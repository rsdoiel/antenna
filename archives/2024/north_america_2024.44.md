## Dead Hydrogen Hubs and Ghost Forests

</p><h3>2. Why hydrogen hubs are struggling</h3><p>
	 A year after the Biden administration named the seven regional clean hydrogen hubs selected to receive $7 billion of support from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, almost half are “running into serious trouble,” Heatmap’s Jael Holzman 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/hydrogen-hubs-problems?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-822VkV9I1ytzbe0BUa26gTBr93Pqw-qD-yIzNHFXb1WAXIzjMWGwY-DqZifrZKcp8R6MTz" target="_self">reported Wednesday for The Fight</a>. Several companies have pulled out of or paused projects; CNX indefinitely stepped away from a blue hydrogen hub in West Virginia, while Fortescue would not confirm that a hydro-powered production plant intended for Washington state will still be built.<br/>
<br/>
	“Conversations with experts and stakeholders indicate to me this could be evidence of broader macroeconomic issues hitting the hydrogen industry, from inflation pushing up the price of electrolyzers to the stubbornly low price of natural gas,” Holzman wrote. Or perhaps it’s “a calm before a storm of hydrogen investment” that’ll follow full implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act’s production tax credit. Jael’s take? “This is further proof we live in a disorganized energy transition.”

	Tesla joined Hyundai, GM, Audi, Rivian, and other major car makers in endorsing California’s low carbon fuel standard program, which sets declining limits for transportation fuel emissions in the state. Tesla’s participation in the letter from automakers to California lawmakers,

<br/>
	Musk has spent more than $75 million supporting Trump’s campaign and has been <a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2024/10/trump-and-musk-want-create-government-efficiency-commission-its-not-new-idea/400693/?oref=ge-mini-feed&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-822VkV9I1ytzbe0BUa26gTBr93Pqw-qD-yIzNHFXb1WAXIzjMWGwY-DqZifrZKcp8R6MTz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promised a role</a> in a Republican administration, while Trump, in turn, has <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-822VkV9I1ytzbe0BUa26gTBr93Pqw-qD-yIzNHFXb1WAXIzjMWGwY-DqZifrZKcp8R6MTz" target="_self">tempered</a> some of his more aggressive rhetoric on EVs.

The tariffs come on top of the preexisting 10% rate and vary by manufacturer based on subsidies they receive from China, ranging from an additional 7.8% for Tesla to 35.3% for SAIC Motor of Shanghai.<br/>
<br/>
			European carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW oppose the tariffs, worrying they will hurt their sales in China if the country decides to retaliate, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-29/eu-imposes-tariffs-on-chinese-ev-imports-as-high-as-45?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-822VkV9I1ytzbe0BUa26gTBr93Pqw-qD-yIzNHFXb1WAXIzjMWGwY-DqZifrZKcp8R6MTz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em> writes</a>, while <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-tells-carmakers-pause-investment-eu-countries-backing-ev-tariffs-sources-2024-10-30/?utm_term=2024-10-31&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-822VkV9I1ytzbe0BUa26gTBr93Pqw-qD-yIzNHFXb1WAXIzjMWGwY-DqZifrZKcp8R6MTz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reuters reports</a> Beijing has already quietly told its domestic automakers not to make significant investments in countries that voted for the tariffs, including France, Poland, and Italy.

This week, the Tucson Unified School District board of governors approved in a 3-2 vote an ambitious student-led plan to cut emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2040, in part by electrifying its entire bus fleet, increasing plant-based meal options, and limiting its food waste, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91219386/arizona-students-just-pressured-the-tucson-school-district-to-pass-an-aggressive-climate-resolution?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-822VkV9I1ytzbe0BUa26gTBr93Pqw-qD-yIzNHFXb1WAXIzjMWGwY-DqZifrZKcp8R6MTz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Fast Company</em> reports</a>.

## European allies face challenging times, whoever wins US presidential election

date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA

BERLIN — The United States' European allies are bracing for an America that's less interested in them no matter who wins the presidential election — and for old traumas and new problems if Donald Trump returns to the White House.


The election comes more than 2 1/2 years into Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in which Washington has made the single biggest contribution to Kyiv's defense. There are question marks over whether that would continue under Trump, and how committed he would be to NATO allies in general.


A win by Vice President Kamala Harris could be expected to bring a continuation of current policy, though with Republican opposition and growing war fatigue among the U.S. public there are concerns in Europe that support would wane.


Trump's appetite for imposing tariffs on U.S. partners also is causing worry in a Europe already struggling with sluggish economic growth. But it's not just the possibility of a second Trump presidency that has the continent anxious about tougher times ahead.


European officials believe U.S. priorities lie elsewhere, no matter who wins. The Middle East is top of President Joe Biden’s list right now, but the long-term priority is China.


"The centrality of Europe to U.S. foreign policy is different than it was in Biden’s formative years," said Rachel Tausendfreund, a senior research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. "And in that way, it is true that Biden is the last trans-Atlantic president."


The U.S. will continue to pivot toward Asia, she said. "That means Europe has to step up. Europe has to become a more capable partner and also become more capable of managing its own security area."


Germany’s defense minister, Boris Pistorius, remarked when he signed a new defense pact with NATO ally Britain that the U.S. will focus more on the Indo-Pacific region, "so it is only a question of, will they do much less in Europe because of that or only a little bit less."




Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels, said that "above all, Europe is looking for predictability from Washington," and that's in short supply in a turbulent world in which any administration will face other demands on its attention. "But the potential for disruption is clearly greater in the case of a potential Trump administration."


"There is an assumption of essential continuity" under Harris that's probably well-founded, he said, with many people who have shaped policy under Biden likely to remain. "It's very much the known world, even if the strategic environment produces uncertainties of its own."


While both the U.S. and Europe have been increasingly focused on competition with Asia, the ongoing war in Europe means "the potential costs of a shift away from European security on the American side are very much higher today than they might have been a few years ago," Lesser said. Europe's ability to deal with that depends on how quickly it happens, he said.


Europe's lagging defense spending irked U.S. administrations of both parties for years, though NATO members including Germany raised their game after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. NATO forecasts that 23 of the 32 allies will meet its target of spending 2% or more of gross domestic product on defense this year, compared to only three a decade ago.


During his 2017-21 term, Trump threatened to abandon " delinquent " countries if they weren’t paying their "bills." In campaigning this time, he suggested that Russia could do what it wants with them.


His bluster has undermined trust and worried countries nearest to an increasingly unpredictable Russia, like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.


Europeans see the war in Ukraine as an existential challenge in a way the United States eventually may not, even with some signs of war fatigue emerging in Europe itself.


If Trump wins, "there's every indication that he has no interest in continuing to support Ukraine in this war" and will push quickly for some kind of cease-fire or peace agreement deal that Kyiv may not like and Europe may not be ready for, Tausendfreund said. "And there is also just no way that Europe can fill the military gap left if the U.S. were to withdraw support."


"Even with a Harris administration there is a growing, changing debate — frankly, on both sides of the Atlantic — about what comes next in the war in Ukraine, what is the end game," Lesser said.


Biden emphasized the need to stay the course in Ukraine during a brief recent visit to Berlin when he conferred with German, French and British leaders.


"We cannot let up. We must sustain our support," Biden said. "In my view, we must keep going until Ukraine wins a just and durable peace."


The times he has lived through have taught him that "we should never underestimate the power of democracy, never underestimate the value of alliances," the 81-year-old Biden added.


German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who bestowed Germany's highest honor on Biden for his service to trans-Atlantic relations, hopes Biden's compatriots are listening.


"In the months to come, I hope that Europeans remember: America is indispensable for us," he said. "And I also hope that Americans remember: Your allies are indispensable for you. We are more than just ‘other countries’ in the world —we are partners, we are friends."


Whoever wins the White House, the coming years could be bumpy.


"Whatever the outcome next week, half of the country will go away angry," Lesser said, noting there's "every prospect" of divided government in Washington. "Europe is going to face a very chaotic and sometimes dysfunctional America."

## Musk's X ineffective against surge of US election misinformation, report says

date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA

The crowd-sourced fact-checking feature of Elon Musk's X, Community Notes, is "failing to counter false" claims about the U.S. election, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) said in a report Wednesday.


Out of the 283 misleading posts that CCDH has analyzed on the digital social media platform, 209 or 74% of the posts did not show accurate notes to all X users correcting false and misleading claims about the elections, the report said.


"The 209 misleading posts in our sample that did not display available Community Notes to all users have amassed 2.2 billion views," CCDH said, urging the company to invest in safety and transparency.


X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.


X launched its "Community Notes" feature last year, which allows users to comment on posts to flag false or misleading content, in effect crowd-sourcing fact checking to users rather than a dedicated team of fact checkers.


The report comes after X lost a lawsuit brought by CCDH earlier this year that faulted it for allowing a rise in hate speech on the social media platform.


Social media platforms, including X, have been under scrutiny for years over the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, including false information about elections and vaccines.


Secretaries of state from five U.S. states urged billionaire Musk in August to fix X's AI chatbot, saying it had spread misinformation related to the November 5 election.


Musk, who endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in July, himself has been accused of spreading misinformation. Polls show Trump is in a tight race with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.

## Iran wary over US presidential election

date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA

TEHRAN, Iran  — America's presidential election next week comes just after Iran marks the 45th anniversary of the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis — and for many, tensions between Tehran and Washington feel just as high as they did then.


Iran remains locked in the Mideast wars roiling the region, with its allies — militant groups and fighters of its self-described "Axis of Resistance" — battered as Israel presses its war in the Gaza Strip targeting Hamas and its invasion of Lebanon amid devastating attacks against Hezbollah. At the same time, Iran still appears to be assessing damage from Israel's strikes on the Islamic Republic last Saturday in response to two Iranian ballistic missile attacks.


Iran's currency, the rial, hovers near record lows against the dollar, battered by international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program of enriching uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels.


In public spaces, women still openly defy Iran's mandatory law on the headscarf, or hijab, a result of the mass demonstrations over the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini that still haunts the country.


That has left a feel of fatalism among some on the streets of the capital, Tehran, as Americans cast ballots for either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump. Many are split on which candidate would be better for their country — if at all.


"All U.S presidents elected after the (1979) revolution had the same views about Iran and I think that’s unlikely to change," said Sadegh Rabbani, 65.


Harris and Trump have offer hard-line views on Iran


Both candidates have either undertaken or expressed tough stances on Iran.


In 2018, Trump unilaterally pulled America out of Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, setting off years of attacks across the Middle East even before Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Trump has been briefed on Iranian plots to retaliate against him, as well over his decision to launch a 2020 drone strike that killed Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad.




Harris, meanwhile, vowed at the September presidential debate that she would always "give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel."


For its part, the Biden administration did try indirect negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program that produced no tangible results, though it did reach one prisoner swap deal that saw five Americans detained for years in Iran walk free in September 2023.


In an outdoor coffeeshop in downtown Tehran, popular among the youth, 22-year-old Zahra Rezaei said she preferred a Harris win.


"We saw Trump in the past and he just ran an anti-Iran policy," Rezaei told The Associated Press. "It is time for a woman ... I think she (Harris) will better since she is not after war."


Ebrahim Shiri, a 28-year-old postgraduate political sciences student, agreed.


"I think Harris knows the world better," he said. "She and (Joe) Biden convinced Israel not to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities. This mean moving toward peace."


Others believe Trump, with his promises of dealmaking, might be a better fit.


"I do not know what the American people think, but Trump is able to get a quick deal with Iran," said Mohammad Ali Raoufi, 43, who runs a double-glazed window workshop. "The Biden administration including Harris failed to reach any (deal) with Iran over the past years when they were in power."


Reza Ghaemi, a 31-year-old taxi driver, also suggested Trump may lessen tensions in the region since he pushed to withdraw U.S. troops from the Mideast during his term in office.


Iran's government wants sanctions gone


Many declined to speak to the AP on camera — Iran has only state-run television and radio stations, so people are suspicious of reporters with video cameras working openly on the street. A woman walking by immediately tightened her previously loose headscarf after seeing the camera.


Those who did speak to the AP mostly expressed worries about a direct United States-Iran war — especially if Trump wins.


While saying he wants Trump to win "for my own reasons," 53-year-old Ahmad Moradi claimed that would make a U.S.-Iran war "100%" sure to happen.


A woman who only gave her name as Mahnaz, fearing repercussions for speaking openly, suggested that Harris, as a woman, couldn’t reach any deals with Iran because "men can talk to men."


"I think if Trump is elected, it will be much harder for our kids. Of course it doesn’t matter which one is elected, it’s already tough for us," said Fariba Oodi.


"We the Iranian people are trapped in some political game. And our kids are paying a price for that," she added. "But I still think if it’s Trump, it will be more difficult, especially for my son who is a student and plans to apply" to study in America.


Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, elected after a helicopter crash killed hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, came to power on a promise to reach a deal to ease Western sanctions.


Iranian officials maintain that separating nuclear negotiations from Mideast wars is possible, even as the U.S. has accused Iran of meddling in the November election, which Tehran denies.


Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Pezeshkian's administration, said Tehran wants to see a change in U.S. policies and a respect for the "national sovereignty of other countries." It also wants Washington to "avoid tension-making activities as we witnessed in recent years," she said.


Analysts, however, see a difficult road ahead for any possible U.S.-Iran talks, no matter who wins next Tuesday.


"The talks will be a war of attrition," Ali Soufi told the pro-reform Shargh newspaper. Saeed Nourmohammadi, another analyst, suggested such talks "are unlikely to be fruitful."


But ultimately, any decision rests with Iran's 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.


"You know, Khamenei has seen eight U.S. presidents" come and go, said Abbas Ghasemi, a 67-year-old retired teacher "He knows how to deal with the next one."

## Americans are anxious and frustrated about the presidential campaign, an AP-NORC poll finds

date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Most Americans are feeling a lot of emotions heading into Election Day, but excitement is not one of them.


A new poll from The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that about 7 in 10 Americans report feeling anxious or frustrated about the 2024 presidential campaign, and a similar share say they're interested.


Only about one-third say they feel excited.


There's a broad feeling of uncertainty hanging over the 2024 presidential contest during the last week of the campaign. The race is competitive nationally and in key swing states, according to recent polls, with neither Democrat Kamala Harris nor Republican Donald Trump showing a measurable advantage.


At the same time, the candidates have offered closing arguments that are in stark contrast with each other, with Harris arguing that Trump is obsessed with revenge and his own personal needs, while Trump referred to Harris at a rally on Sunday night as “a trainwreck who has destroyed everything in her path.”


Some groups are even more anxious than they were four years ago, even though that election took place in the midst of a deadly pandemic.


In 2020, an AP-NORC poll found that about two-thirds of Americans were anxious about the election, which is not statistically significant from the new result. But for partisans, anxiety is dialed a little higher.


About 8 in 10 Democrats say anxious describes how they are feeling now, up slightly from around three-quarters in the last election. About two-thirds of Republicans are anxious, a moderate uptick from around 6 in 10 in 2020.


Independents, by contrast, haven't shifted meaningfully, and they're also feeling less worried than Democrats or Republicans. About half say they are anxious, similar to the finding in 2020.


Other emotions have gotten more intense compared to past election cycles, including excitement. About one-third of Americans report feeling excited about the 2024 campaign, up from around one-quarter in 2016. But a majority of Americans say they are not excited about this year's race.


One thing has stayed fairly constant, though: Americans' level of frustration with the campaign. Roughly 7 in 10 Americans say frustrated describes their emotional state, similar to 2020.


For those Americans, though, there is light on the horizon — soon, the election will be over.


The poll of 1,233 adults was conducted Oct. 24-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.

## Children trick-or-treat at White House; first lady dresses as panda for Halloween

date: 2024-10-31, from: VOA News USA

washington — President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, who dressed as a giant panda, hosted trick-or-treaters on the White House South Lawn on Wednesday for the last time.


The first lady had participated in the National Zoo's announcement earlier this year that pandas would be returning to Washington. They arrived in the nation's capital in mid-October and Jill Biden donned the panda suit Wednesday as a "welcoming gesture," the White House said.




Jill Biden added an educational theme to the event and named it "Hallo-Read" to help encourage reading. She has been a teacher for 40 years. Earlier Wednesday, she read a short story about spooky pumpkins to a group of costumed children gathered on the lawn.


She and the president later ventured outside at sunset and spent about an hour handing out treats. Biden, in a suit and tie, dropped boxes of White House Hershey's Kisses chocolates in the kids' tote bags while the first lady handed out copies of "10 Spooky Pumpkins."


Up to 8,000 people, including students and children tied to the military, were expected to pass through the White House gates during the day.




A large orange moon and a sign that said "Hallow-Read at the White House" decorated the south face of the executive mansion. The decorations also included cardboard representations of Willow, the family cat who is rarely seen in public, and stacks of books. Giant pumpkin decorations flanked the door.


Biden dropped his bid for reelection in July. He leaves office in January.

## The consumer spending sweet spot

date: 2024-10-30, from: Market Place

<p>Consumer spending has been strong since the post-pandemic-crash economy got back on its feet, and it continues to prop up GDP. But too much spending, as well as too little, could mess with the Federal Reserve&#8217;s goals of stable prices and maximum employment. Also in this episode: WNBA players want a contract to match their popularity and brand power, wage growth stays ahead of inflation and farmers are having a down year.</p>

## Would You Like a Gas-Fired Power Plant With That Data Center?

Along with it comes a 25-megawatt power plant that once provided power and steam directly to the former Merck headquarters in Kenilworth, New Jersey, but began to sell more and more power to the grid, the plant’s owner said in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

In other words, one way to get around grid interconnection and intermittency issues is to have your own power plant.</p><p>“The economics of developing the power on site don't really hurt the data center economics that much.

But the chips can only perform when they’re powered, turning the data center business into a hunt for electricity wherever it can be found.</p><p>“Access to reliable power could be a roadblock towards the timely buildout” for a data center, Francois Poirier, the chief executive of TC Energy, the Canadian pipeline company, told analysts on an earnings call in August. “We’re seeing a shift in siting preferences from regions where big telecom infrastructure is in place to regions where energy and supply infrastructure is in place.”</p><p>CoreWeave, PSE&G, Onyx, and Atlantic Power’s owner, I Squared Capital, did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>This situation has not come about for lack of effort on the part of the several electricity markets that have been trying to get new natural gas generation on the grid. PJM, for example, has <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/pjm-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>been working to entice new supply</u></a>, but even following a record auction for power capacity that paid out billions to natural gas plants, few producers have indicated their willingness to make large new investments.

<p>“While Fortescue will continue to maintain a portfolio of other projects for the future, our financial discipline always comes first. We will never do projects that are not currently economically viable,” the company said in a statement provided to me this morning. </p>
<p>Meanwhile CNX, a natural gas company, has indefinitely put the kibosh on a <a href="https://investors.cnx.com/news-releases/2023/12-15-2023-211538125" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>blue hydrogen ammonia plant</u></a> in West Virginia crucial to the Appalachian hydrogen hub known as ARCH2. Marathon Petroleum’s midstream subsidiary MPLX also confirmed to me they’ve canceled a hydrogen storage facility planned for that hub, and Chemours is no longer involved with the hub either. </p>
<p>Another blue hydrogen ammonia plant in North Dakota crucial to a different hub – known as the <a href="https://undeerc.org/research/projects/heartland-h2-hub.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Heartland hub</u></a> – has been canceled by Marathon and TC Energy. </p>
<p>In other words: a year after the Biden administration made <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/13/biden-harris-administration-announces-regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-to-drive-clean-manufacturing-and-jobs/" target="_blank">a big announcement</a> about the seven hubs that could potentially receive billions of dollars in government funding, almost half of them are running into serious trouble. </p>
<p>The companies that have quietly pulled out or paused projects are laying blame on implementation of the federal hydrogen production tax credit, claiming rules enforcing the “three pillars” and carbon intensity requirements are too onerous. Meanwhile critics of the hydrogen hubs are seizing on project cancellations and delays to argue against their construction outright; the Ohio River Valley Institute, an environmental group opposed to the ARCH2 hydrogen hub, has received <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18102024/appalachian-hydrogen-hub-plan-struggles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a lot of press</u></a> in recent days for <a href="https://ohiorivervalleyinstitute.org/is-the-arch2-hydrogen-hub-coming-apart-sure-looks-like-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a report</u></a> claiming the hub is “coming apart.”</p>
<p>I’m already hearing whispers from industry insiders in D.C. who are trying to spin these cancellations as evidence the credit implementation has been too favorable to climate activists and is constraining growth in the nascent hydrogen space. </p>
<p>But what’s really going on? </p>
<p>Conversations with experts and stakeholders indicate to me this could be evidence of broader macroeconomic issues hitting the hydrogen industry, from inflation pushing up the price of electrolyzers to the stubbornly low price of natural gas. We saw this with <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/plug-power-hydrogen-stamp-genesee" target="_self"><u>the Plug Power project</u></a> in New York, which we were first to report problems with. These market issues may be overpowering the subsidies and demand-side benefits of the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act. </p>
<p>These hiccups may also be a calm before a storm of hydrogen investment and a reshuffling of capital that’ll become more evident after the IRA’s production tax credit is fully implemented with final regulations. Perhaps it’ll take final rules to see <a href="https://hystorenergy.com/hydrogen-industry-support-of-strong-45v-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the companies supportive</u></a> of the “three pillars” move more projects forward. </p>
<p>It could also be a mixture of these things <em><em>and</em></em> other factors, like issues with the specific sites companies had selected for their plants. </p>
<p>No matter the cause for these hubs stuttering, these projects falling out of the fold is a shock to no one, especially supporters of the “three pillars” approach to the tax credit. Though it may indicate flaws with a disorganized approach to the energy transition. </p>
<p>“I’m not surprised if at the end of the day some of the many projects supported by DOE are not viable in the end,” said Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor at Princeton University and expert in energy systems engineering. In addition to co-hosting Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast, Jenkins leads the REPEAT Project, which produced influential policy analysis supporting the “three pillars” approach to Treasury’s implementation of the hydrogen production tax credit. </p>
<p>Irrespective of the reasons, it’s important to remember that on some level both industry and the Biden administration stumbled into this mess. That’s because Congress passed the bipartisan infrastructure law mandating the creation and financing of these hubs <em><em>before</em></em> the IRA was even introduced. The infrastructure law itself required DOE to start soliciting proposals for hub funding mere months after it was enacted. This means the hub program was crafted independent of a tax subsidy boosting supply. </p>
<p>The hubs may be lobbying for a specific version of the hydrogen production credit to be implemented, as many D.C. lobbyists <a href="https://www.hyvelocityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/H2Hubs-Letter-to-Treasury.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>like to point out</u></a>, but the program wasn’t referenced in the tax credit’s statute either. </p>
<p>As Jenkins put it, any conflict between the hubs and tax credit provisions is evidence “that reflects that many of the projects [selected] are not compliant.” </p>
<p>Biden administration officials spoke to me for a half hour this morning about the canceled projects on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the tax credit and hubs. To them, this can be explained as the process working as intended, and they emphasized how the credit and hub are independent programs. They also expect more capital to be unleashed after the credit is finalized, as companies who’ve supported the “three pillars” get certainty to make final investment decisions. </p>
<p>The administration’s view sounded akin to the optimistic vision relayed to me by Clean Air Task Force’s Conrad Schneider: “This is what progress looks like. It’s slow, it’s steady. It’s not [a] steady state though.” </p>
<p>My take? This is further proof we live in a disorganized energy transition. So far in The Fight, we’ve covered the struggles to get projects built because of opposing forces at a grassroots level. That same dynamic applies to the federal climate programs incentivizing a switch from carbon-intensive business practices. And sometimes, there’ll be tug-of-war competing interests between the climate programs themselves. </p>

## Agri-Voltaics Anguish, Offshore Wind Wailing

Douglas County, Kansas </strong>– A legal headache is consuming Kansas Sky Energy Center, a 159-megawatt solar project proposed by Savion and Invenergy… and showcasing how “agri-voltaics” may not be the community engagement panacea some in industry are praying for, according to legal filings reviewed by Heatmap.</p><ul><li>The Douglas <a href="https://www.dgcoks.gov/county-commission" target="_blank"><u>Board of County Commissioners</u></a> approved the project earlier this year <a href="https://flatlandkc.org/news-issues/douglas-county-commission-approves-massive-solar-project/" target="_blank"><u>unanimously</u></a> in spite of a petition from nearly property owners to oppose the project. After that, landowners and the small neighboring community of Grant Township sued the county commissioners to invalidate the approval.<br/></li><li>The litigation accuses the Board Chair Karen Willey of essentially orchestrating the approval and the solar project’s agri-voltaics plans without meaningful local consultation, per the most recent amended complaint filed by the aggrieved community members.</li><li>The complaint gets ugly real fast, citing texts and emails to allege some sort of conspiracy between Willey, Savion employees, and The Nature Conservancy, the environmental nonprofit, which was brought in to assist with the agri-voltaics plans.</li><li>“Commissioner Karen Willey, a well-known opponent of production farming and a critic of the accepted farming principles that enable Kansas farmers to feed the world,” states the complaint filed in August, “orchestrated the request and approval process to fulfill her pre-set personal agenda.”</li><li>Willey and the rest of the board have denied all of the wrongdoing alleged in the suit and are fighting it vigorously.</li><li>Irrespective of the merits, this one’s a headache, and must be eating up lots of time and money for developers and the local government. Yesterday a federal judge sent the case to state court after a prolonged fight over jurisdiction.</li><li>This can be a fraught place to develop solar, as NextEra Energy has experienced with its <a href="https://lawrencekstimes.com/2022/09/14/giant-solar-farm-joco-dgco/" target="_blank"><u>West Gardner solar project</u></a>.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Worcester County, Maryland</strong> – We finally get to see the contours of the legal strategy against the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, after Ocean City and surrounding local business and government officials filed their lawsuit last week. </p><ul> <li>In their complaint, opponents primarily cite environmental protection laws and issues like “segmenting” environmental impacts that are “cumulative” under NEPA (i.e. looking at them separately instead of together).<br/></li><li>The lawsuit also argues the government failed to properly consider the impacts of climate change on the wind project.</li><li>Ocean City and its allies are represented in the case by locally-based attorney Bruce Bight of the D.C. law firm Marzulla, which is also <a href="https://marzulla.com/blog/when-harms-are-all-over-the-map-massachusetts-wind-farms-threaten-marine-life-and-livelihoods-on-and-off-shore/" target="_blank"><u>representing fishermen</u></a> fighting offshore wind in New England.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Barnstable County, Massachusetts </strong>– Another blow to offshore wind came Friday in the coastal town of Barnstable where leaders voted to oppose cable landings for Avangrid’s New England Wind 2 project.</p><ul><li>The town’s non-binding resolution opposing the cable landings came after a citizens group waged a pressure campaign – <a href="https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/environment/2024/08/16/barnstable-speaks-town-council-save-greater-dowses-beach-superior-court-avangrid-new-england-wind-1/74797910007/" target="_blank"><u>including litigation</u></a> – to make the town ditch a <a href="https://tobweb.town.barnstable.ma.us/ParkCityWindDocuments/Side%20Agreement%20Relating%20to%20HCA%20(Executed%206.25.2024%20).pdf" target="_blank"><u>host community agreement</u></a> with Avangrid.<br/></li><li>Avangrid did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Somewhere near Houston, Texas </strong>– The small city of Katy rejected a 500-megawatt battery storage project proposed by Ochoa Energy despite the community struggling with regular blackouts. </p><ul><li>During the city council’s meeting <a href="https://katytx.new.swagit.com/videos/317576" target="_blank"><u>last week</u></a> on the project, city councilors discussed crafting their own anti-storage moratorium and cited other communities with new restrictions, including <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/escondido-california-battery-moratorium-aes" target="_self"><u>specifically Escondido, California.<br/></u></a></li><li>The rejection was at least partially based on fear. Katy City Councilor Gina Hicks said she personally supported construction but local opposition made it impossible for her to support the project as an elected representative.</li><li>The vote against Ochoa’s proposal came after an uproar at another recent public meeting on the project, per Hicks, who predicted “brownouts” and “blackouts” without the project.</li><li>“Just know that we as a community chose this and I will represent what the community wants versus what I feel is personally best for this decision,” she said.</li></ul>

## The CEO of GE Vernova Wants Less Talk, More Action

date: 2024-10-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDA4OTM1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NzgyNzgzNn0.cvb0hhAIL67YVFwLMgv_D2l_WAwUEWwGpMnQN612Kbw/image.jpg?width=900&height=410&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Last week at Greentown Labs’ startup summit in Boston I interviewed Scott Strazik, CEO of GE Vernova, the energy equipment manufacturing arm of General Electric formerly known as GE Renewables and GE Power. </p>
<p>GE Vernova has been at the forefront of a tech and public relations crisis in the offshore wind sector after one of the blades it constructed for the Vineyard Wind farm collapsed into the Atlantic Ocean. Last week, the company reported it found more issues with blades and recorded $700 million in financial losses from offshore wind contracts largely tied to blade issues. </p>
<p>So naturally, I asked him about this – and NIMBYs, and the Inflation Reduction Act, and also about what gives him hope for the future. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>These days there’s a lot of folks out there who a few years ago were more optimistic than they are today given all kinds of industry trends, policy trends … how would you characterize the pace of the transition right now? Is it speeding up or slowing down? </strong></p>
<p>I actually go into the room today more optimistic than I would’ve been two years ago. I think at the end of the day what we need to think about is, in the electric power system, we need growth to be able to innovate. We’re about to get the most growth that we’ve had – the most load growth in the U.S. – in multiple decades. That actually is an opportunity for us to transform how things work. It’s a lot harder to do that in a flat demand environment, and for the first time in a long time we don’t have that anymore. </p>
<p>So I find it quite interesting when you have conversations about <em><em>oh my gosh, the hyperscalers need a ton of electricity for data centers, what is this going to do to the energy transition? </em></em>Hyperscalers, as an example, are amazing customers who care immensely about sustainability. They do need electrons tomorrow but those are electrons they’re committed to decarbonizing over time. So I like our chances now more than I would’ve two years ago. </p>
<p><strong>How has your experience in wind informed your approach to emerging technologies generally? </strong></p>
<p>Well I think in a lot of these cases, this is an all-of-the-above energy technology opportunity for us. We’re going to need a lot of different technologies to solve our challenges and then the real question becomes how do we develop products that can industrialize at scale. And that is really at the heart of the challenge for the wind industry today. </p>
<p>The reality is there’s an incredible amount of innovation with wind. A lot of accelerated larger products. And as they got larger and larger, they got harder and harder to make, and the harder and harder they are to make, the bigger the industry’s quality challenges. And at the end of the day, if we produce products that ultimately don’t work, it doesn’t electrify and decarbonize the world. </p>
<p>When I think about what we do in places like [a startup summit], the technology is the start but it’s also simultaneously saying, <em><em>is this something we can make at scale? </em></em></p>
<p><strong>Do you think we’re not going to be able to manufacture wind at scale? </strong></p>
<p>No, I think we’re definitely going to be able to do it. But I think the industry has gone through such an incredible amount of growth fairly quickly with different product variants that the industry struggled in that regard. The availability of the global install base of wind turbines from an industry perspective has gone down as the growth has gone up. And that’s a bad equation. We need the availability of the product to be working at the same static pace as we plan more and more wind turbines. Do I think we can do that? I think we can. But something I reference a lot is the risk of developing products and businesses on PowerPoint economics versus actual engineering and manufacturing discipline to make sure we can do things right the first time. </p>
<p><strong>I write a newsletter for Heatmap about conflicts in the energy transition – local, state, federal – and I’ve covered conflicts over wind projects, solar projects, battery storage. A trend I’ve seen, especially within first-moving space, is one involving opposition. Because people aren’t familiar with these technologies, it’s easier to scaremonger or get people opposed. I’m wondering, how do you think companies like yourself are doing at handling community engagement and communities’ reception to emerging technologies? </strong></p>
<p>I think what’s critical here is that we all are a catalyst to a conversation. I think the challenge we have sometimes with the energy transition is we actually let the conversation go on for too long. </p>
<p>I actually think the debate is crucial. The debate within communities where there are trades being made – for example, for space or resources — are critical. But the adult conversation is how we converge. Ultimately you need to govern those conversations, make decisions, and go. And today I don’t know if that adult conversation happens fast enough.</p>
<p><strong> For anyone here involved in deployment, are we in a place where people aren’t willing to go? I know at least in some parts of this country, that’s certainly the case. I write about NIMBYs all the time. </strong></p>
<p>Well I think – and again, we need people to be heard, we need communities to be heard – projects do take longer to get done today. That’s a dynamic when you think about industrializing products at scale, a lot of products within the electric power system need to be connected to the zero-carbon power sources that we’re creating. That connection does require new transmission lines to get the electrons to where they’re ultimately needed. That is a long, drawn-out process today in the U.S. It’s longer in our U.S. markets than it is in Europe, it’s longer than it is in Asia. That doesn’t mean the conversation shouldn’t happen, because if a transmission line goes through a community that ultimately isn’t benefiting from that transmission line, we’ve got to solve that problem. But the country needs the transmission lines, because without it we’re not going to decarbonize the electric power system. </p>
<p>In my mind this is less about whether we’re having the debates. It’s more about how do we have them quicker and then make decisions and go. </p>
<p><strong>Given the timetables for developing a transmission line or developing a wind farm, those can be decadal timetables. Next year we’re looking at Congress potentially writing a new tax bill. How bankable is the Inflation Reduction Act in a decadal investment landscape? </strong></p>
<p>Two thoughts on that. </p>
<p>First, it can’t take decades to build a transmission line or a wind farm. I can tell you, as one of the biggest players in the space, it sure as heck doesn’t take that long to physically build them. It takes that long because the conversation takes too long before we push go. That’s the challenge. We can do this much quicker, we just have to do it. </p>
<p>Now, on the Inflation Reduction Act – and there are many elements of the Inflation Reduction Act – I’m certain that with the next administration, regardless of who is in it, they’ll scrutinize all the decisions the last administration made. That’s the beauty of our government. All that said, when it comes to most elements of the Inflation Reduction Act that are tied to creating jobs, manufacturing growth, U.S. competitiveness, energy security – it’s becoming very, very clear that building out and really transforming the electric power system in the U.S. supports all of those priorities. Those are things that both sides of the aisle support. </p>
<p>When I look at the things we’re investing in — and we’re investing heavily into expanding U.S. factories to grow the wind industry, to grow further into serving the transmission and switchgear market — we’re not hesitating one bit because of the bankability risk of our democracy. We think both sides of the aisle are going to support things that are aligned with competitiveness, innovation, jobs, and U.S. national security. And that’s what we’re investing in every day. </p>
<p><strong>So, what gives you hope? You’re certainly brimming with it. </strong></p>
<p>We’re in this every day. We added 29 gigawatts of new power globally last year. Forty-four percent of it was in developing countries. That new 29 gigawatts of power we added to the grid was about 25% cleaner than what the grid is in totality and we see a very clear pathway to add a lot more gigawatts every year, and for it to be even cleaner than what we delivered this year or last year. We know how to do this. </p>
<p>I come into rooms like this and listen to the last 20 minutes of [startup] presentations and I say to myself, <em><em>okay, we’ve got a lot of young companies that are working on really important stuff. Do they know exactly how to industrialize their product yet at the level that it can make an impact? </em></em>Maybe not. <em><em>Do they have the customer reach they’re going to need to accelerate the commercial momentum? </em></em>Probably not in all cases. Guess what: Those are things Vernova can help with. That’s why we like hanging out in a room like this. There’s a lot of companies that operate in this building every day in which that art of the possible is exciting. There’s a lot of other buildings in the country, in the world, where it’s hard to not have a kick in our step. So this is there for the taking. </p>
<p>I’d rather go at it with that mindset than with the alternative because if I go at it with the alternative, I’ll definitely let down my kids. I’ve got a 12 and 10 year old. They already believe that this is their generation’s greatest challenge. So are we going to take it on with optimism and go after it, or the alternative? And I do think that’s an important point I want to hit on is, something I shared with my broad leadership team: I do think at times, as it relates to energy innovation with climate change and the energy transition, we can lean into conversations with pessimism. And I don’t think that helps our industry. </p>
<p>If I do a compare-contrast with the tech industry on the West Coast, where I’m spending a lot more time now, they’re a lot more optimistic about things they have no idea how to actually make a reality. But the optimism is there. And that optimism can sometimes be half the battle. So are we going to scare everybody? Or are we going to frame up what we know how to do, be honest about what we don’t know how to do, and go after it? </p>
<p><strong>I’ll tell you, any time an oil rig fails, no one is having a conversation about the technology. Is this a public perception problem and a media problem with trade-off denial? Is there some sort of double standard going on in the energy transition space versus fossil fuel space? </strong></p>
<p>I don’t think that is the case. I think we want to hold to the standard the media and the communities are expecting of us. There [are] no trade-offs for safety and quality. And when things don’t work, whether it be a solar farm, a wind turbine, a transformer goes down, I’m not crying in my beer over those communities pushing on whether the industry is good enough.</p>
<p>I think a similar thing happens in the fossil fuel industry when things don’t work, but I don’t want a different bar. I don’t think this is about having a different set of expectations for what we need to deliver. We talk every day about the fact that if this industry is going to thrive, it needs to start every single day with safety and quality at the forefront of what we do. Delivery comes next and that’s where I talk about industrializing things at scale. We don’t really have time for hobbies. These things need to be built at scale. And then the economics need to ultimately work because if the economics don’t work and we push this price to everyone with just exponentially higher electricity prices, that’s not going to work either. </p>
<p>But you can’t start with the economics. You can’t start with whether you can make it at scale. First it has to be safe and it has to be high quality. And I actually think communities, the media, investors holding that bar to every element of the renewables industry is a step in the right direction.</p>

## US detects H5N1 bird flu in pig for first time

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS — H5N1 bird flu had been confirmed in a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon, the first detection of the virus in swine in the country, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Wednesday.


Pigs represent a particular concern for the spread of bird flu because they can become co-infected with bird and human viruses, which could swap genes to form a new, more dangerous virus that can more easily infect humans.


The USDA said there is no risk to the nation's pork supply from the Oregon case and that the risk to the public from bird flu remains low.


Pigs were the source of the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009-2010, and have been implicated as the source of others, said Richard Webby, a St. Jude Children's Research Hospital virologist who studies flu in animals and birds for the World Health Organization.


The finding of the virus in a small farm makes the pig infection less of a concern than if it had been detected in a commercial pig farm, he said.


"I think it probably doesn't increase the risk much, but surely, if this virus starts transmitting in pigs, that absolutely increases the risk," he said.


The Oregon farm has been quarantined, and other animals there, including sheep and goats, are under surveillance, the USDA said.


Pigs and poultry on the farm were culled to prevent the spread of the virus and enable additional testing of the swine, the USDA said. Tests are still pending for two of the pigs, the agency said.


The swine case originated with wild birds and not from a poultry or dairy farm, a USDA spokesperson said. Wild bird migration has carried bird flu to poultry flocks and cattle herds.


The case was one factor that prompted the USDA to broaden its bird flu surveillance to include nationwide bulk milk testing, which the agency announced on Wednesday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told Reuters in an interview.


"While it’s a different variation of the virus and it is tied to wild birds, it is a factor to make sure that we understand and appreciate exactly where the virus is in dairy and in bovine," he said.


The pigs on the Oregon farm were not intended for the commercial food supply, the USDA said.


The agency said that poultry and swine on the backyard farm shared water sources, housing and equipment, which have all served as pathways for transmitting the virus between animals in other states.


The detection is a warning for pig farmers to be on the lookout for further infections, said Marie Culhane, a professor of veterinary population medicine at the University of Minnesota who has researched flu viruses in swine.


"People need to start increasing their plans to deal with it if it should happen in another herd and another herd," Culhane said. "Pigs are just really good at picking up influenza viruses."


This year, 36 people have tested positive for bird flu as the virus has spread to nearly 400 dairy herds. All but one of the people were farm workers who had known contact with infected animals.


Since 2022, the virus has wiped out more than 100 million poultry birds in the nation's worst-ever bird flu outbreak.

## Concerns about Elon Musk, Russia's Putin not fading yet

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Reports that billionaire Elon Musk has been talking on a consistent basis with Russian President Vladimir Putin are still reverberating among current and former U.S. officials, almost a week after news of the conversations first surfaced.


Musk, who owns electric car maker Tesla and the X social media platform, also owns SpaceX, a commercial spaceflight company that has numerous contracts with the U.S. government, doing work for the Department of Defense and U.S. space agency NASA.


Some of that work is so sensitive that the United States has given Musk high-level security clearances due to his knowledge of the programs, raising concerns among some that top secret U.S. information and capabilities could be at risk.


According to current and former U.S., European and Russian officials who spoke to The Wall Street Journal, such concerns may be warranted.


During one conversation, those officials said, Putin allegedly asked Musk not to activate Starlink, a SpaceX subsidiary that provides satellite internet services, over Taiwan as a favor to China.


“I think it should be investigated,” NASA administrator Bill Nelson told the Semafor World Economy Summit on Friday, a day after The Journal published its report.


“I don’t know that that story is true,” Nelson said, adding, if it is, “I think that would be concerning, particularly for NASA, for the Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies.”


Russia and Musk deny frequent calls


Musk has previously denied frequent calls with Putin. In 2022, Musk said he had spoken to the Russian leader just once, but The Journal said there have been repeated conversations since then.


Musk has not commented or responded to the Journal article on X. Russia has also denied there have been frequent conversations between Putin and Musk.


The Pentagon has so far declined to refute or confirm the allegations.


“We have seen the reporting from The Wall Street Journal but cannot corroborate the veracity of those reports,” Defense Department spokesperson Sue Gough told VOA in an email late Friday.


“[We] would refer you to Mr. Musk to speak to his private communications,” Gough said, adding that, by law, the department does not comment on the details or status of anyone’s security clearance.


“We expect everyone who has been granted a security clearance, including contractors, to follow the prescribed procedures for reporting foreign contacts,” she said.


Former U.S. intelligence officials who spoke to VOA said the reported conversations, since confirmed by other U.S. news organizations citing their own confidential sources, raise significant questions.


“There is no doubt that Russia is cultivating many possible channels of influence in the United States and other Western countries,” said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA officer who now teaches at Georgetown University.


“Russia would regard a wealthy and influential business mogul such as Musk as potentially a highly useful channel and thus a relationship worth nurturing,” he said.


Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and former senior director of the White House Situation Room, is also wary.


“It does get the spider-sense tingling,” he told VOA.


“If the reports of Musk’s repeated conversations with Vladimir Putin are true, I would definitely have some concerns,” Pfeiffer said. “Russia under Putin will cultivate support wherever it can be bought, cajoled or coerced.


“Putin has equal opportunity security services that will take advantage of any opportunity to get foreign business leaders to influence their governments to align with Russian interests,” he said.


Concerns don't equal wrongdoing


Former officials like Pillar and Pfeiffer, though, caution there is a difference between concerns and actual wrongdoing.


Other former officials note that even if Musk engaged in conversations that could make some in government uncomfortable, just having those conversations is not necessarily illegal.


“Americans are allowed to talk to essentially whomever they want,” said a former national security prosecutor, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity. “There's no inherent limitation.”


And in the case of a high-profile individual who oversees companies with global reach, conversations with foreign officials could be unavoidable.


“For a businessman, there may be commercially legitimate reasons to have those communications,” the former prosecutor said. “It's when a businessman is having those communications, perhaps for political reasons or even proto-diplomatic reasons, that it gets probably more concerning from a counterintelligence perspective.”


There also may not be any legal issues with a potential failure by someone like Musk to voluntarily disclose conversations with foreign leaders. Hiding such conversations when asked about them, however, could wade into criminal territory.


Still, given the value the U.S. gets from Musk’s companies, U.S. officials may feel like they have little recourse.


“It is one of those unfair things in life that if the government has a unique need for you, you can get away with more and still get a security clearance,” the former prosecutor said. “Someone who has unique value is going to get more accommodation.”

## What Does Elon Musk Want From Trump?

date: 2024-10-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDAyMDM1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3OTg5NTQ3M30.mn6AuMrnDTSAzue88hJwX1CxxNYetXO28OoHRDQw_gM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">At a recent rally for Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Howard Lutnick, the head of Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, took the stage together and <a href="https://qz.com/elon-musk-donald-trump-government-spending-budget-biden-1851682623" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>contemplated</u></a> the federal budget. “How much do you think we can rip out of this wasted $6.5 trillion Harris-Biden budget?” Lutnick asked. “I think we could do at least $2 trillion,” Musk said, to the cheers of the crowd. “Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that.”</p><p>This idea — that there is $2 trillion of “waste” in the yearly federal budget that could be eliminated if only someone like Musk were given the power to do it — exemplifies his orientation toward government. It’s brash, shockingly ambitious, contemptuous of what most Americans need, and fed by Musk’s combination of arrogance and ignorance. And it will never happen — not because the deep state will prevent it, but because Musk, while brilliant in some ways, is not smart enough to know what he doesn’t know. </p><p>Tempting as it is to take seriously Trump’s proposal for Musk to head up a new cabinet department or a commission on government efficiency (it has been described both ways) if Trump becomes president, the idea that Musk will spend his days in a government building in Washington poring over budget details is laughable. Plus, we already have a department of efficiency; it’s called the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Government Accountability Office</u></a>, and it does excellent work. But Musk does stand to have extraordinary influence in a Trump administration. So when it comes to policy, what does he actually want?</p><p>To start, let’s do some math. Without going too deep into it, if you add up Social Security, Medicare, military spending, veterans’ benefits, and interest on debt in <a href="https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/reports-statements/mts/mts0924.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the fiscal 2024 budget</u></a> — none of which will be cut — you get $4.4 trillion. That leaves $2.25 trillion, of which Musk thinks he could cut $2 trillion. That, in turn, would mean eliminating almost everything the federal government does, from controlling the border to issuing passports to running national parks to medical research to federal prisons to food inspections to … you get the idea. </p><p>Also in that $2.25 trillion is, of course, the money the federal government spends on the energy transition, something Musk doesn’t seem to have much enthusiasm for. It isn’t that he has embraced Trump’s climate denialism, but he also doesn’t talk much about <em><em>government’s</em></em> role in reducing emissions. </p><p>This represents a shift: When Joe Biden took office, Musk <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/25/exclusive-elon-musk-tells-fortune-hes-super-fired-up-about-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>, “I’m super fired up that the new administration is focused on climate.” Biden followed through on his pledges in both regulation and legislation, but Musk was less enthusiastic as time went on, and eventually embraced Trump wholeheartedly, despite the latter’s promise to undo essentially everything Biden has accomplished on climate change. </p><p>Tesla has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-embraces-trump-scorns-subsidies-tesla-still-lobbies-us-benefits-2024-08-12/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quietly lobbying</u></a> to maintain subsidies for electric vehicles and in favor of regulations that could phase out the production of internal combustion cars, even as the candidate for whom Musk is spending tens of millions of dollars promises to eliminate those policies. But he’s not trying to change Trump’s mind, at least not publicly. On an earnings call with shareholders earlier this year, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/12/musk-trump-advice-climate-change-00173411" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Musk said</u></a> that if Trump keeps his promise to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, it would hurt Tesla “slightly,” but “long term, it probably actually helps,” since it would be “devastating for our competitors.”</p><p>In other words, Musk may want to address climate change, but that goal will always take a back seat to what’s good for Elon Musk — and what’s good for Musk just happens to be good policy, or so he seems to think. This is an occupational hazard for billionaires, who are inevitably surrounded by sycophants eager to tell them that any brain fart that comes tumbling out of their mouths is the height of wisdom. </p><p>This tendency shows up in Musk’s views on just about everything else, too. Like many a dilettante — albeit one with his own social media platform and 200 million followers there — Musk occasionally dips his thinking-emoji into policy issues without bothering to learn about what they actually entail, like <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/04/09/elon-musk-social-security-cuts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his warning</u></a> that Social Security is all but doomed. He worries a great deal about underpopulation, which few experts think is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/health/elon-musk-population-collapse-wellness/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>really a problem</u></a>; his solution seems to be to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/elon-musk-reportedly-offered-sperm-163849936.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>distribute his own sperm</u></a> as widely as possible. </p><p>But the most likely places where Musk will exercise influence in a second Trump presidency are not his grand notions of a remade American society, but rather in his own relationship with government. That largely means two things: He would like government to give him more money, and he would also like it to get out of his way. </p><p>On the first point, Musk is already a significant beneficiary of federal contracts. As <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/20/us/politics/elon-musk-federal-agencies-contracts.html?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>documented</u></a>, Musk’s “companies were promised $3 billion across nearly 100 different contracts last year with 17 federal agencies.” How handy it would be if he were in charge of rejiggering federal spending! But on the flip side, “His companies have been targeted in at least 20 recent investigations or reviews, including over the safety of his Tesla cars and the environmental damage caused by his rockets.” In a second Trump term — especially one in which the architects of Project 2025 will no doubt be busily reconfiguring the government to place nearly absolute power in the hands of the president — Trump could easily repay the nine figures Musk has spent to get him elected by making all those investigations disappear. </p><p>Musk is also counting on the courts to make it easier for him to treat his workers however he likes. He has repeatedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/spacex-forced-workers-sign-illegal-severance-agreements-us-agency-claims-2024-03-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clashed</u></a> with the National Labor Relations Board, and SpaceX is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/column-new-spacex-opinion-nlrb-case-has-ominous-hints-federal-agencies-2024-07-24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suing</u></a> to effectively have the entire NLRB declared unconstitutional. (Other anti-union companies including Amazon and Starbucks are <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spacex-trader-joe-amazon-law-205755137.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seeking</u></a> the same outcome.) Trump has publicly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/uaw-hits-trump-musk-federal-labor-charges-union-busting-comments-rcna166403" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>praised</u></a> Musk for firing striking workers, which is illegal; and while it appears Trump was referring to Musk <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>firing</u></a> most of the staff of Twitter, who were not actually on strike, their shared <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/business/tesla-union-uaw-strike/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>contempt</u></a> for collective bargaining and worker rights is amply clear. </p><p>That Musk is an egomaniac is barely disputable, so it’s not surprising that he believes government will either be a tool in his hands or the destroyer of worlds, with no in-between. “While I have many concerns about a potential Kamala regime,” he recently <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1837908705683059166" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tweeted</u></a>, “the bureaucracy currently choking America to death is guaranteed to grow under a Democratic Party administration. This would destroy the Mars program and doom humanity.” Apparently, only by giving Musk whatever he wants can we avoid extinction. </p><p>The truth is that if Harris wins, Elon Musk will be just fine, and so will humanity. The big difference will be that Musk won’t be able to pick up the phone and tell the president what to do. But I’m sure he will react to that with all the maturity and thoughtfulness we’ve come to expect from him. </p>

## US airstrikes target multiple sites in Syria, killing up to 35 Islamic State militants

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. military has struck a number of Islamic State group camps in Syria this week, killing as many as 35 militants, U.S. Central Command said Wednesday. 


The airstrikes in the desert of central Syria were done Monday evening and targeted multiple locations and senior leaders of the group. The attacks came on the heels of a number of joint operations with Iraqi forces that targeted IS militants in Iraq. 


Pentagon officials have said that the Islamic State group remains a threat in the region, but it is no longer as powerful as it was 10 years ago when the militants swept across Iraq and Syria, taking control of large swaths of the two countries. 


U.S. Central Command said the latest strikes in Syria will disrupt the group's ability to plan, organize and conduct attacks against civilians and U.S. and allied forces in the region. It said there were no indications of civilian casualties in the strikes.

## Harris promises to 'represent all Americans' after Biden 'garbage' remark

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Kamala Harris said she disagrees "with any criticism of people based on who they vote for," reacting after U.S. President Joe Biden's reference to Donald Trump's supporters and "garbage."


"I will represent all Americans, including those who don't vote for me," the vice president said.


Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, made the comment to reporters as she prepared to campaign in three states. Her words were an attempt to blunt the controversy over Biden's rhetoric with less than a week until the end of the campaign.


The tumult began Tuesday night around the time that Harris was delivering a unifying message in a speech near the White House. Inside the building, Biden was criticizing Trump's recent Madison Square Garden rally, where a comedian described Puerto Rico as an "island of garbage."


"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American," Biden said in a campaign call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino. "It's totally contrary to everything we've done, everything we've been."


Biden and the White House rushed to explain that the president was talking about the rhetoric on stage, not Trump's supporters themselves. But Republicans seized on Biden's comments, claiming they were an echo of the time when Hillary Clinton, as the Democratic nominee against Trump in 2016, said half of Trump's supporters belong to a "basket of deplorables."


In attacking Biden, and by extension, Harris, Republicans are glossing over Trump's own history of insulting and demonizing rhetoric, such as calling the United States a "garbage can for the world" or describing political opponents as "the enemy within." Trump has also described Harris as a "stupid person" and "lazy as hell," and he's questioned whether she was on drugs.


Trump has also refused demands to apologize for the comment about Puerto Rico at his rally, acknowledging "somebody said some bad things" but "I can't imagine it's a big deal."


Political attack lines have a history of occasionally boomeranging back on people who use them. For example, Ohio Senantor JD Vance, now Trump's running mate, once described Democrats as beholden to "a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made."


Vance's three-year-old comments were resurfaced once he became the vice presidential nominee, energizing Harris supporters who repurposed the label as a point of pride on shirts and bumper stickers — much like Trump's supporters once cheerfully branded themselves as "deplorables."


On Wednesday morning, Harris' running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, downplayed Biden's comments in television interviews.


He told "CBS Mornings" that Biden "was very clear that he's speaking about the rhetoric we heard," not the supporters themselves.


Walz made a similar comment on ABC's "Good Morning America," where he emphasized that Democrats' inclusive message.


"Let's be very clear, the vice president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this," he said. "Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric is what needs to end."

## US cracks down on Russia’s sanctions evasion in fresh action

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday imposed curbs on hundreds of targets in fresh action against Russia, taking aim at sanctions circumvention in a signal that the U.S. is committed to countering evasion.


The action, taken by the U.S. Treasury and State departments, imposed sanctions on nearly 400 entities and people from over a dozen countries, according to statements from the Treasury and State departments.


The action was the most concerted push so far against third-country evasion, a State Department official told Reuters. It included sanctions on dozens of Chinese, Hong Kong and Indian companies, the most from those countries to be hit in one package so far, according to the official.


Also hit with sanctions were targets in Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Thailand, Malaysia, Switzerland and elsewhere.


The action comes as Washington has sought to curb Russia's evasion of the sanctions imposed after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which has killed or wounded thousands and reduced cities to rubble.


The U.S. has repeatedly warned against supplying Russia with Common High Priority Items — advanced components that include microelectronics deemed by the U.S. and European Union as likely to be used for Russia's war in Ukraine.


"This should send a serious message to both the governments and the private sectors of these countries that the U.S. government is committed to countering the evasion of our sanctions against Russia and to continue putting pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine," the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.


The Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 274 targets, while the State Department designated more than 120. The U.S. Commerce Department added 40 companies and research institutions to a trade restriction list over their alleged support of the Russian military.


"The United States and our allies will continue to take decisive action across the globe to stop the flow of critical tools and technologies that Russia needs to wage its illegal and immoral war against Ukraine," Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in the statement.


A senior administration official said Wednesday's action was designed to signal the U.S. would act against Indian companies if progress were not made through communication.


“With India, we have been very direct and blunt with them about the concerns we have about what we see as sort of emerging trends in that country that we want to stop before they get too far down the road,” the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.


India-based Futrevo was among the companies targeted by the State Department, which accused it of being involved in the supply of high-priority items to the Russia-based manufacturer of Orlan drones.


The Treasury also targeted Shreya Life Sciences Private Limited, which it said since 2023 has sent hundreds of shipments of U.S.-trademarked technology to Russia, totaling tens of millions of dollars.


A second senior State Department official told Reuters on Tuesday that more than 70% of the high-priority goods getting to Russia was from China, more than an estimated $22 billion worth since the start of the war.


"That's over 13 times the next largest supplier," the official said, which as of the end of 2023 was Turkey.


Among those targeted Wednesday were Hong Kong and China-based companies involved in the shipment of tens of millions of dollars’ worth of high-priority items to Russia-based companies or end-users, the State and Treasury departments said.


The U.S. also took actions on a variety of entities supporting Russia's Arctic project, which is 60% owned by Russia's Novatek and was to become Russia's largest liquefied natural gas plant.


Novatek has been forced to scale back Arctic, which had been planned to reach an eventual output of 19.8 million metric tons per year, following a raft of U.S. sanctions starting in 2023 with additional measures in August and September.


But the U.S. held back from using an executive order signed by President Joe Biden last year that threatened penalties for financial institutions that help Russia circumvent sanctions. The senior administration official said banking sectors had taken notice of the authority and sort of moved into compliance.

## A delightful surprise for those in the labor market

<p>The private payroll company ADP reported that a lot more people than expected were added to its payrolls this month. True, the more closely watched data on hiring and unemployment is not due from the government until Friday. But this is new evidence that the American jobs machine is still putting people to work. We dig in. Plus, a look at Google&#8217;s strong earnings and the continually daunting car market.</p>

## 5 Takeaways From an Actually Pretty Solid Quarter for EV Sales

date: 2024-10-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzg4ODYzMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjcxMjEyN30.2WRSzLnV0-itcjDfJEWYFsgALKNdf2s33l1c5CbDFZ4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Stop me if you’ve heard this one already, but the supposed EV sales slump isn’t real. The overall growth rate has slowed somewhat, crushing any fantasy that America would accelerate to mostly electric driving in just a few years. But electric vehicles sales have been steadily rising amid a negative narrative, and they <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q3-2024-ev-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rose</u></a> yet again in the third quarter of 2024. </p>
<p>Carmakers sold 346,309 of them from July to September, a 5% increase over the second quarter of this year and an 11% jump year-over-year. EVs reached 8.9% of all vehicles sold in America in the third quarter, prompting Cox Automotive (which owns Kelley Blue Book) to opine that 10% looks well within reach.</p>
<p>A look inside the numbers behind the news tells us a few important things about the state of EVs.</p>
<h3>1. Somebody out there loves the Cybertruck</h3>
<p>A lightning rod on wheels, the Cybertruck became a focal point for the anger and contempt lots of very online people feel toward Elon Musk and his support for Donald Trump. But as I <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-gmc-hummer" target="_self"><u>noted</u></a> a year ago for Heatmap, plenty of people want this car — either out of genuine affection for what it is and what it can do, or for the political statement they can make by owning one.</p>
<p>The numbers don’t lie. Despite a slow start, Tesla sold 16,692 Cybertrucks during the third quarter. That made it the number three EV in America behind Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3. The Cybertruck’s emergence, combined with better sales by a refreshed Model 3, helped to stop a slide at Tesla earlier this year caused by falling sales of the aging Models S, X, and Y. </p>
<p>As Tesla goes, so goes today’s EV market. Its slump in 2024 had hampered the growth of the industry at large; a rumored update to the industry-leading Model Y would be a shot in the arm for everybody. Yet even with Tesla stabilizing, Elon Musk’s dominance isn’t what it once was. The company’s market share, which hovered in the 70% range in 2019 and 2020, has fallen below 50%. With a growing slate of competitors, it may never cross above that threshold again.</p>
<h3>2. Trending up: GM</h3><p>Korean brands Hyundai and Kia had been the non-Tesla <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/hyundai-motor-group-kia-motors-ioniq-5-ev-6" target="_self"><u>success story</u></a> of the past year-plus, with American EV shoppers falling in love with the quirky Hyundai Ioniq 5 in particular. But General Motors seized second place in Q3 as some of its plans finally came to fruition. Chevy sold nearly 8,000 Blazer EVs and almost 10,000 Equinox EVs last quarter. That latter figure is particularly impressive given that the $35,000 base-level Equinox, which could fall below $30,000 after incentives, didn’t hit the market until October. The Cadillac Lyric found a niche. Even the preposterous GMC Hummer EV saw a big sales bump.</p>
<p>GM’s solid numbers don’t include the remarkable success of its partnership with Honda, who borrowed GM’s Ultium platform to build its first American EV, the Prologue. That vehicle sold 12,644 in the third quarter, outpacing GM’s own EV crossovers. (Perhaps the legion of loyal Honda buyers in America were just waiting for the brand to sell them an electric car.) </p>
<p>Chevy and Honda’s success came at the expense of some brands whose electric crossovers aren’t quite so new and exciting anymore. The Ioniq 5 dropped a tiny bit compared to the third quarter of 2023, just 0.5%. However, Ford’s Mustang Mach-E dropped by nearly 10% year over year, while the Volkswagen ID.4 tumbled by 57.8%.</p>
<h3>3. Treading water: Ford</h3><p>Speaking of Ford, it wasn’t all bad news for GM’s rival. Ford’s EV division did <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/10/28/ford-tops-q3-earnings-but-ev-losses-weigh-profits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>better</u></a> than Wall Street expected. Overall sales actually rose, with gains from the E-transit van and F-150 Lightning pickup truck balancing out falling numbers from the Mustang Mach-E. Even so, Ford is losing billions of dollars on its electric vehicles. The blue oval brand faces a double challenge: It needs to get a new EV on sale to juice sales while figuring out how to dramatically cut manufacturing costs.</p>
<h3>4. Incentives matter</h3><p>Watch any car commercial and you’ll be reminded that incentives aren’t the sole domain of EVs. Brands and dealerships offer all kinds of rebates and discounts to move gasoline cars off the lot. Yet because of the size of the federal and state tax credits and rebates for buying electric, those incentives retain an outsized impact on sales. Cox points out that incentives made up 12% of the average price of an EV sold in the third quarter of this year, compared to just above 7% for other kinds of cars.</p>
<p>What’s especially dramatic, though, is the incentive-driven rise of the leased EV. Overall, Americans lease just over 20% of their new cars, not far from where the figure stood two years ago. At the end of 2022, less than 10% of Americans who got a new EV leased it. But in December of that year, the federal government announced many EVs that weren’t ineligible for tax credits when purchased outright <em><em>would</em></em> be eligible for those incentives if people leased them. Cox’s <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-10-at-4.06.25%E2%80%AFPM.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>chart</u></a> paints a stark picture, showing leases rocketing from about 9% to 43% of EV sales.</p>
<h3>5. Luxury brands are leading the way</h3>
<p>In their own EV makeup, that is. There are six car brands that have 10% of their U.S. sales or more from EVs: Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar, Audi, and Cadillac — luxury brands all — are five of them. (The other is Mini.) </p>
<p>This makes perfect sense, of course. Luxury brands sell fewer vehicles overall, so it’s easier for EVs to make a big dent in sales. They sell expensive cars, which makes it easier for buyers to swallow the higher cost of EVs. Their drivers have always been more likely to lease cars, even before leasing EVs in particular became so appealing.</p>
<p>In sum, it means that the luxury car brands — while selling fewer overall EVs than Chevy and Honda will eventually sell — will be the first to experience what it’s like for a legacy car brand when the scales tip to more EVs than not.</p>

## Supreme Court allows Virginia to resume purge of voter registrations

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Virginia to resume its purge of voter registrations that the state says is aimed at stopping people who are not U.S. citizens from voting. 


The justices, over the dissents of the three liberal justices, granted an emergency appeal from Virginia's Republican administration led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The court provided no rationale for its action, which is typical in emergency appeals. 


The justices acted on Virginia's appeal after a federal judge found that the state illegally purged more than 1,600 voter registrations in the past two months. A federal appeals court had previously allowed the judge's order to remain in effect. 


Such voting is rare in American elections, but the specter of immigrants voting illegally has been a main part of the political messaging this year from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans. 


Trump had criticized the earlier ruling, calling it "a totally unacceptable travesty" on social media. 


"Only U.S. Citizens should be allowed to vote," Trump wrote. 


The Justice Department and a coalition of private groups sued the state earlier in October, arguing that Virginia election officials, acting on an executive order issued in August by Youngkin were striking names from voter rolls in violation of federal election law. 


The National Voter Registration Act requires a 90-day "quiet period" ahead of elections for the maintenance of voter rolls so that legitimate voters are not removed from the rolls by bureaucratic errors or last-minute mistakes that cannot be quickly corrected. 


Youngkin issued his order on Aug. 7, the 90th day before the election. It required daily checks of data from the state Department of Motor Vehicles against voter rolls to identify people who are not U.S. citizens. 


U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles said elections officials still could remove names on an individualized basis, but not through a systematic purge. Court records indicated that at least some of those whose registrations were removed are U.S. citizens. 


Giles had ordered the state to notify affected voters and local registrars by Wednesday that the registrations have been restored. 


Nearly 6 million Virginians are registered to vote. 


In a similar lawsuit in Alabama, a federal judge this month ordered the state to restore eligibility for more than 3,200 voters who had been deemed ineligible noncitizens. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the 3,251 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens.

## US economy grew at a solid 2.8% pace last quarter on strength of consumer spending

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. economy grew at a healthy 2.8% annual rate from July through September, with consumers helping drive growth despite the weight of still-high interest rates. 


Wednesday's report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product — the economy's total output of goods and services — did slow slightly from its 3% growth rate in the April-June quarter. But the latest figures still reflect surprising durability just as Americans assess the state of the economy in the final stretch of the presidential race. 


Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.7% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period. Exports also contributed to the third quarter's growth, increasing at an 8.9% rate. 


On the other hand, growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. But spending on equipment surged. 


The report is the first of three estimates the government will make of GDP growth for the third quarter of the year. The U.S. economy has continued to expand in the face of the much higher borrowing rates the Federal Reserve imposed in 2022 and 2023 in its drive to curb inflation. Despite widespread predictions that the economy would succumb to a recession, it has kept growing, with employers still hiring and consumers still spending. 


In a sign that the nation's households, whose purchases drive most of the economy, will continue spending, the Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index posted its biggest monthly gain since March 2021. The proportion of consumers who expect a recession in the next 12 months dropped to its lowest point since the board first posed that question in July 2022. 




At the same time, the nation's once-sizzling job market has lost some momentum. On Tuesday, the government reported that the number of job openings in the United States fell in September to its lowest level since January 2021. And employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs a month so far this year — a healthy number but down from a record 604,000 in 2021 as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, 377,000 in 2022 and 251,000 in 2023. 


On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the economy added 120,000 jobs in October. That gain, though, will probably have been significantly held down by the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and by a strike at Boeing, the aviation giant, all of which temporarily knocked thousands of people off payrolls. 




Wednesday's report contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Fed's favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter and the lowest figure in more than four years. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.2%, down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter. 


Despite the continued progress on inflation, average prices still far exceed their pre-pandemic levels, which has exasperated many Americans and posed a challenge to Vice President Kamala Harris' prospects in her race against former President Donald Trump. Most mainstream economists have suggested, though, that Trump's policy proposals, unlike Harris', would worsen inflation. 




At its most recent meeting last month, the Fed was satisfied enough with its progress against inflation — and concerned enough by the slowing job market — to slash its benchmark rate by a hefty half percentage point, its first and largest rate cut in more than four years. When it meets next week, the Fed is expected to announce another rate cut, this one by a more typical quarter-point. 


The central bank's policymakers have also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate again at their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. The cumulative result of the Fed's rate cuts, over time, will likely be lower borrowing rates for consumers and businesses.

## New York media outlet connects immigrants with news and resources

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

New York — On a drizzly day in New York's Chinatown, journalist April Xu suggested stopping at a bakery for a snack. 


"But not Fay Da," she said, referring to a bakery on the nearby corner. 


Xu doesn't go to Fay Da Bakery anymore. Not since she reported on how New York's largest Chinese bakery chain had allegedly stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages from its employees. 


Many people feel connected to the famous bakery, Xu told VOA. "When they saw the news, they were shocked," she said. 


In April, the bakery agreed to a $940,000 settlement to resolve claims by former and current employees.


It was a big story — the kind that the nonprofit media outlet Documented, where she works, likes to tell. Under-covered stories on issues such as wage theft and housing are the focus of this immigrant-focused news outlet.


With immigration a polarizing issue in the U.S. presidential election, the news outlet finds itself balancing its typical coverage with debunking false claims. As racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric is pushed by the far-right, Documented's team sees their local coverage of immigration as crucial.


The inspiration for Documented came from dissatisfaction with how mainstream media often covered immigration, said co-founder Mazin Sidahmed.


 




Born in Sudan, Sidahmed worked for The Guardian in New York and other media before helping set up his own outlet in 2018.


"No one was really covering how those big federal policy shifts were playing out at the local level in big cities like New York, where most immigrants actually live," Sidahmed told VOA at the outlet's office in the Financial District. 


"There was a real hole and a need for a site that was covering how federal immigration policy was playing out locally," he said.


A commitment to meeting the audience's needs has been central to Documented's success, Sidahmed said. 


Early on, the outlet launched a needs assessment focused on Spanish-speaking audiences. It was hugely successful in figuring out how to best serve that community, according to Sidahmed.


They found that respondents felt that they were typically portrayed in the media as either criminals or victims, and they wanted news that would help them navigate government resources. 


When Documented learned that the community got most of its news from WhatsApp groups, it started a Spanish-language news service on the app.


"Over the past five years, it has really grown into an engine that's driving a lot of our most powerful journalism," Sidahmed said. "But getting it to that point was incredibly hard and challenging, and it involved building a lot of trust." 


In addition to English and Spanish, Documented publishes in Mandarin and Haitian Creole. To better serve the Chinese community, Documented operates a news account on WeChat. For the Caribbean community, it uses the platform NextDoor. 


"We feel that we can't ask people to go to our website to consume news every day. We should deliver the news to them," Xu said.


Platforms like WhatsApp and WeChat are two-way streets. Documented delivers news, and audiences can directly contact reporters with story tips or questions. 


That way, said Sidahmed, Documented can produce content that is in service of their needs.


It also publishes content that helps audiences navigate government bureaucracy or access resources. 


"I don't think there's any mainstream news outlet that is really working with immigrants directly in that way, to serve them, as opposed to just covering them," said Fisayo Okare. Originally from Nigeria, she writes the outlet's newsletter.


In 2022, New York City was home to about 3.1 million immigrants — accounting for 38% of the city's total population — according to a report from the mayor's office. 


Many of Documented's staffers count themselves among that population. Okare thinks their work is enhanced by the team's background.


"As an immigrant myself, I tend to understand what other immigrants are going through," she said. "We pride ourselves on not just writing about immigrants but writing for them." 


More recently, that has included correcting baseless claims about illegal immigration, including conspiracy theories that candidate Donald Trump repeated about Haitians in Ohio.


"Our role during this time has been to put out the right information whenever just completely wrong or inaccurate information is shared," Okare said. 


Documented has also bucked trends in the U.S., where the local news industry has been struggling for years.


Over the past two decades, the U.S. has lost more than one-third of its newspapers, according to a 2024 report by Northwestern University's Local News Initiative. Almost 55 million people across the country have limited to no access to local news, the report found. 


"When a city loses a local news institution, it has all of these other catastrophic effects on the city. People start to see their local issues in this nationalized lens and don't feel as tethered and connected to their communities," Sidahmed said.


The journalist is optimistic about the future. Documented is aiming to become the leading news source for the communities it is covering in New York, he said. 


"We see an opportunity to rebuild local news and rewrite that contract between local news outlets and the communities that have typically had bad relationships with local news," he said.

The authors find that 10 of their 15 indicators for climate change-related health hazards “reached concerning new records.” These impacts are, of course, not hitting everyone equally. Heat-related deaths among people over 65 were 167% higher last year than in the 1990s. The global population also lost 6% more sleep due to heat than the average between 1986 and 2005, with the worst impacts seen in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. <br/>
<br/>
	The authors warn that that oil and gas companies are reinforcing global dependence on their product. “The relentless expansion of fossil fuels and record-breaking greenhouse gas emissions compounds these dangerous health impacts, and is threatening to reverse the limited progress made so far and put a healthy future further out of reach,” Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown

	If fully developed, the leases could generate 6.8 gigawatts of electricity, or enough to power about 2.3 million homes, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. But that part of the ocean is deep, and the projects will need to utilize still-nascent floating offshore wind technology.

The 55 grants across 27 states and territories will support the electrification of cargo handling equipment, drayage trucks, trains, and ferries, as well as solar power projects and EV charging infrastructure.

New methods for translating measurements of various gases and particles into estimates of ground-level pollution can help fill data gaps in communities that don’t have local air quality monitoring systems. Nearly two-thirds of U.S. counties lack monitoring stations, the report says, whether due to cost constraints, low population density, or rapid land use change. The authors identified 300 counties with incomplete or no monitoring data that likely had unhealthy levels of air pollution in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Twenty years ago, Nike created millions of carbon credits tied to the sneaker brand’s efforts to stop using sulfur hexafluoride, a powerful greenhouse gas that was previously pumped into its soles. Now, ACR, formerly known as the American Carbon Registry, has disclosed that more than a million of those credits are in its “buffer pool,” which is supposed to provide insurance for buyers. If a forestry project in the registry burns, for example, credits set aside in the buffer pool can be cancelled to make up for the loss.<br/>
<br/>
			But Nike’s credits were basically meaningless to begin with — the decision to change the shoes had nothing to do with the carbon market, Nike confirmed to <em>Bloomberg</em> — and they’re even more meaningless 20 years later. “It was a somewhat notorious project for those of us in the North American carbon market 15 years ago,” Derik Broekhoff, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute, told Elgin.

## Redoxblox Raises $40.7 Million for ‘Thermochemical’ Energy Storage

date: 2024-10-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDA4OTc5NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3OTQ5MzI3N30.MnVT1VO9dkoMa66BTxhBoO4ciJzhG44sA6_RVujpYz8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Decarbonizing industrial processes such as paper and pulp production, chemical manufacturing, or food processing is a tough sell. As it so often goes, that’s largely due to the efficacy and low cost of natural gas, which can cheaply and efficiently provide the high heat required for these industries. But a number of <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/antora-rondo-energy-thermal-batteries" target="_self">innovative battery companies</a> are looking to shake up that dynamic, and the latest, Redoxblox, just gained a big vote of confidence. </p><p>Today, the San Diego-based startup announced the close of its $40.7 million Series A round, which it raised in two tranches. The first <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1939750/000193975022000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$9.4 million tranche, </u></a> back in 2022, was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240111260321/en/RedoxBlox-Receives-25M-to-Demonstrate-Its-Pioneering-Long-Duration-Thermochemical-Energy-Storage-Technology#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20Khosla%20Ventures%2C%20RedoxBlox%20is%20backed%20by%20top%20climate%20technology%20firms%2C%20including%20Breakthrough%20Energy%20Ventures%20(BEV).%20BEV%20led%20the%20company%E2%80%99s%20Seed%20round%20and%20participated%20in%20its%20Series%20A%20fundraise." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>led by Khosla Ventures,</u></a> with participation from  Breakthrough Energy Ventures. The latest $31.3 million raise, announced today, was led by the climate tech investor Prelude Ventures, with participation from Imperative Ventures and New System Ventures, alongside BEV and Khosla. While Redoxblox didn’t respond to an inquiry about why it raised these two tranches so far apart, an SEC filing reveals that the company initially aimed to raise $22.4 million in 2022, indicating that it fell far short of its original goal. </p><p>Now though, the company looks poised for growth, and has announced the appointment of a new CEO, Pasquale Romano, formerly the CEO of ChargePoint, which operates a network of EV charging stations. </p><p>Redoxblox’s technology is known as “thermochemical energy storage,” as the system stores energy both chemically and as heat. “What the founders have discovered is a real scientific breakthrough,” Scott McNally, the company’s vice president of development, told me. He said that Redoxblox is mistakenly lumped in with thermal storage startups such as <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/rondo-battery-deal" target="_self"><u>Rondo</u></a> or Antora all the time. But the company’s thermochemical solution is a new class of energy storage entirely. “Yes, we store energy as heat, but we also store energy in chemical bonds. That's why fossil fuels are so widely adopted, is because the amount of energy contained in a chemical bond is enormous,” McNally explained. This allows Redoxblox to achieve both very high energy density and very high temperatures. </p><p>The system uses grid electricity to charge when prices are low or when there’s excess renewable generation. As electricity passes through the company’s proprietary metal oxide storage pellets, they’re resistively heated (like a toaster!) up to 1,500 degrees Celsius. When they hit a certain temperature, this drives a “redox reaction,” which is a kind of reaction in which electrons are transferred between two substances. In Redoxblox’s case, the pellets release pure oxygen gas and absorb heat, which is stored as chemical energy. To discharge that heat, a pump blows air across the hot pellets; as the air heats up and the pellets absorb oxygen from it, that oxygen-depleted air can then be delivered as heat to power various industrial processes or to gas turbines to generate electricity. </p><p>The redox reaction the company relies upon has been understood since the 1800s — what’s exciting is the proprietary metal oxide the company’s founders discovered, which can cycle through this reaction again and again. “The problem with fossil fuels is you can't take a lump of ash from burning coal, run electricity through it, and make coal again. But with this, you actually can,” McNally told me. “We've cycled our material through that more than 1,000 times with no loss of energy density, no degradation.”</p><p>Redoxblox’s Series A funding comes in addition to about $17 million in non-dilutive capital that the company has already received from an ARPA-E grant, as well as <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240111260321/en/RedoxBlox-Receives-25M-to-Demonstrate-Its-Pioneering-Long-Duration-Thermochemical-Energy-Storage-Technology" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more recent grants</u></a> from the Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission, which will go towards building the company's first industrial demonstration projects. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/nepa/articles/cx-031193-decarbonization-steam-generation-chemical-process-heating-through" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The $6.7 million DOE grant</u></a> supports RedoxBlox’s partnership with Dow Chemicals, in which the startup will retrofit a gas-fired steam boiler with its thermochemical battery at Dow’s manufacturing plant in Charleston, West Virginia. And the CEC grant will support the buildout of a 3 megawatt-hour long-duration energy storage system for UC San Diego’s medical campus, which will provide 24 hours of electricity in the case of a power outage. </p><p>Romano told me that Redoxblox also has partnerships with a paper mill and a dairy production operation in Europe, where natural gas is magnitudes more expensive, and thus the startup’s technology is much more economically competitive. Ultimately of course, Redoxblox wants to be cheaper than natural gas in the U.S., which Romano said currently sits at about 3.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. </p><p>However, this technology is not yet likely to make much of a dent in the highest temperature industrial heating applications, such as steel and cement manufacturing or certain chemical production processes. While Redoxblox’s tech would theoretically work for these industries, the energy demands would be astronomical.</p><p>The company is targeting its first commercialized product in 2026, which will fit inside a shipping container and store up to 20 megawatt-hours of energy at 95% efficiency. Multiple units can be combined to meet the needs of larger facilities, and McNally told me that they’re not necessarily targeting any one specific industry at the moment. As he put it, “We're just targeting anybody that uses natural gas that wants to decarbonize at, in many cases, a lower cost than fossil fuels.”</p>

## Climate-o-Rama: EVs, Oil, Trump, and More

	It’s all happening. The presidential election is a week away, and our cohost Jesse Jenkins is back from vacation. There is so much to talk about in the world of decarbonization and energy. So we tried to catch up on all of it. Are EV sales starting to rebound in the U.S.? What’s up with the Cybertruck? And what about Senator Joe Manchin’s permitting reform bill?
</p><p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Jesse and Rob attempt to discuss all those questions and more. Peak oil demand — the IRA’s focus on manufacturing — the emerging political economy of decarbonization — we hit it all. Or we try to, at least. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

<span></span>Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I want to do a branching pass here for a second. If Trump wins and Republicans want to pass [the Manchin-Barrasso permitting] bill, I think Democrats should take them up on it. Because all the changes to the oil and gas regime — almost all the changes to the oil and gas permitting regime that are contemplated by the bill will be done by a Trump administration. They could be done through executive action, or through a helpful Congress in a Trump administration. But the transmission stuff can’t be. So you might as well take the transmission tailwind and then just do the stuff that a Trump administration can do anyway.<br/>
<br/>
To be clear here, when you talk to the modelers — not Jesse, other modelers — they say that the expansion oil and gas that happened during Trump would dwarf any sense of the changes contemplated by the bill. If Harris wins, then I think we have the real conversation about whether this bill makes sense for Democrats. But if Trump wins, I think, number one, Republicans aren’t going to be interested in passing the bill. But if they are interested, Democrats should take them up on it.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, so you have kind of a narrow range of circumstances where this bill might be considered seriously in a lame duck, right? I think you’re right that if Trump wins somehow they’re going to offer it, Republicans are going to offer it, that’s an interesting deal for Democrats. I just don’t think that’s too likely.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most likely scenario where this bill is taken seriously is if Harris wins and if the House and Senate are split. Whether they flip sides or whatever the control looks like, going forward, if the Democrats have the House and the Republicans have the Senate, or vice versa, this could be the type of bipartisan bill that is sort of the best deal on the table that, that might be able to get through regular order — that’s, this bill would require 60 votes to get past the filibuster in the Senate.
	<br/>
<br/>
So you know, it by nature has to be bipartisan. And by definition, at this stage, a bipartisan bill is going to have some things that climate advocates really don’t like. And if it has enough that outweighs that, that’ll be the serious question.

## US forest managers finalize land exchange with Native American tribe in Arizona

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

CAMP VERDE, Ariz. — U.S. forest managers have finalized a land exchange with the Yavapai-Apache Nation that has been decades in the making and will significantly expand the size of the tribe's reservation in Arizona's Verde Valley, tribal leaders announced Tuesday.


As part of the arrangement, six parcels of private land acquired over the years by the tribe will be traded to the U.S. Forest Service in exchange for the tribe gaining ownership of 12.95 square kilometers of national forest land that is part of the tribe’s ancestral homelands. The tribe will host a signing ceremony next week to celebrate the exchange, which was first proposed in 1996.


“This is a critical step in our history and vital to the nation’s cultural and economic recovery and future prosperity,” Yavapai-Apache Chairwoman Tanya Lewis said in a post on the tribe's website.


Prescott National Forest Supervisor Sarah Clawson said in a statement that there had been many delays and changes to the proposal over the years, but the tribe and the Forest Service never lost sight of developing an agreement that would benefit both public and tribal lands.


The federal government has made strides over recent years to protect more lands held sacred by Native American tribes, to develop more arrangements for incorporating Indigenous knowledge into management of public lands and to streamline regulations for putting land into trust for tribes.


The Yavapai-Apache Nation is made up of two distinct groups of people — the Wipuhk’a’bah and the Dil’zhe’e. Their homelands spanned more than 41,440 square kilometers of what is now central Arizona. After the discovery of gold in the 1860s near Prescott, the federal government carved out only a fraction to establish a reservation. The inhabitants eventually were forced from the land, and it wasn't until the early 1900s that they were able to resettle a tiny portion of the area.


In the Verde Valley, the Yavapai-Apache Nation's reservation lands are currently comprised of less than 7.77 square kilometers near Camp Verde. The small land base hasn't been enough to develop economic opportunities or to meet housing needs, Lewis said, pointing to dozens of families who are on a waiting list for new homes.


Lewis said that in acknowledgment of the past removal of the Yavapai-Apache people from their homelands, the preamble to the tribal constitution recognizes that land acquisition is among the Yavapai-Apache Nation's responsibilities.


Aside from growing the reservation, the exchange will bolster efforts by federal land managers to protect the headwaters of the Verde River and ensure the historic Yavapai Ranch is not sold for development. The agreement also will improve recreational access to portions of four national forests in Arizona.

## Prosecutor tells jury of 9/11-style plot thwarted in the Philippines

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK  — A Kenyan man who plotted a 9/11-style attack on a U.S. building was training as a commercial pilot in the Philippines when his plans were interrupted, a federal prosecutor told a New York jury Tuesday.


Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon Bodansky told a federal jury in Manhattan that Cholo Abdi Abdullah plotted an attack for four years that he hoped to carry out on behalf of the terrorist organization al-Shabab.


He said Abdullah was almost finished with his two-year pilot training when he was arrested in July 2019 in the Philippines on local charges. He was transferred in December 2020 to U.S. law enforcement authorities, who charged him with terrorism-related crimes.


Abdullah underwent training in explosives and how to operate in secret and avoid detection before moving to the Philippines in 2017 to begin intensive training for a commercial pilot's license, the prosecutor said.


Abdullah posed as an aspiring commercial pilot even though his true intention was to locate a building in the United States where he could carry out a suicide attack from the cockpit by slamming his plane into a building, Bodansky told the jury.


He said Abdullah was "planning for four years a 9/11-style attack" only to have it thwarted with his arrest.


The defendant, operating from a Nairobi hotel, used the internet to research how to breach a cockpit door and looked up a 2019 terrorist attack that killed some 21 people, Bodansky said. Among those killed in that attack was an American businessman who survived the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.


Prosecutors have said Abdullah also researched information "about the tallest building in a major U.S. city" before he was caught.


Abdullah, who is representing himself and once pleaded not guilty, declined to give an opening statement and did not actively participate in questioning witnesses Tuesday.


In court papers filed before the trial, prosecutors told the judge that they understood "through standby counsel that the defendant maintains his position that he 'wants to merely sit passively during the trial, not oppose the prosecution and whatever the outcome, he would accept the outcome because he does not believe that this is a legitimate system.'"


The State Department in 2008 designated al-Shabab, which means "the youth" in Arabic, as a foreign terrorist organization. The militant group is an al-Qaida affiliate that has fought to establish an Islamic state in Somalia based on Shariah law.


If convicted, Abdullah faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years in prison. His trial is expected to last three weeks.

## For expats in Ukraine, election back in US hits home

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

The outcome of the U.S. election and the possible changes in Washington’s foreign policy are of special significance to the 3 million American expatriates eligible to vote in next week’s U.S. presidential elections. In few places is that outcome more tangible than in Ukraine, where a few thousand Americans have, for various reasons, chosen to live after Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. Lesia Bakalets speaks to several expatriates in Ukraine and sends this report from Kyiv.

DES MOINES, Iowa  — For the first time since 1938, children in Des Moines, Iowa, will go trick-or-treating on Halloween.


Going door-to-door for candy on All Hallows' Eve has long been commonplace throughout the country. But not in Des Moines, where Iowa's capital city took a different approach more than seven decades ago in hopes of tamping down on hooliganism.


Instead, Des Moines children don their costumes on Beggars' Night, typically the day before Halloween. And besides screaming, "Trick-or-Treat," children are expected to tell a joke before receiving a treat.


This year, Beggars' Night was set for Wednesday, but because of expected heavy rain and thunderstorms, officials delayed trick-or-treating until Thursday, which to the rest of the country is the normal Halloween.


"To my knowledge, it has never been moved or canceled since it was established after Halloween in 1938," Assistant City Manager Jen Schulte said. "However, the safety of our residents, families and children is always our top priority and led to the change in this year's scheduled Beggars' Night."


The city began its unusual custom at the suggestion of a former city parks director as a way to reduce vandalism and promote more wholesome fun for kids. Initially, children were encouraged to sing a song, recite poetry and offer some other kind of entertainment, but over time a joke became the most common offering.


Beggar's Night also has limited hours, typically running from 6 to 8 p.m.


Many of Des Moines' suburbs also adopted the Beggars' Night tradition and chose to shift the celebration to Halloween this year.


"I didn't realize we were that much of an anomaly because for us, this is normal," said Debbie Westphal Swander, who owns a costume shop in West Des Moines. "We're going to be in sync at least for this year with the way the event is celebrated everywhere else.


"The big picture for me is, it's absolutely about the kids. That's the most important thing."

## US finalizes rule restricting investment in Chinese tech firms

date: 2024-10-30, from: VOA News USA

The Treasury Department on Monday finalized a new rule meant to prevent U.S.-based people and companies from investing in the development of a range of advanced technologies in China, thereby preventing Beijing from accessing cutting-edge expertise and equipment.


The rule, which implements an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in 2023, focuses particularly on advanced semiconductors and microelectronics and the equipment used to make them, technology used in quantum computing, and artificial intelligence systems.


When it takes effect on January 2, the rule will prohibit certain transactions in semiconductors, microelectronics and artificial intelligence. It also establishes mandatory reporting requirements for transactions that are not banned outright.


In the field of quantum computing, the rule is more far-reaching, banning all transactions “related to the development of quantum computers or production of any critical components required to produce a quantum computer,” as well as the development of other quantum systems. Unlike the fields of AI and semiconductors, the rule does not allow for transactions that can be completed so long as they are reported to the government.


The rule also announced the creation of the Office of Global Transactions within Treasury’s Office of Investment Security, which will administer the Outbound Investment Security Program.


Justification and opposition


“Artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and quantum technologies are fundamental to the development of the next generation of military, surveillance, intelligence and certain cybersecurity applications like cutting-edge code-breaking computer systems or next generation fighter jets,” Paul Rosen, assistant secretary for investment security, said in a statement.


“This Final Rule takes targeted and concrete measures to ensure that U.S. investment is not exploited to advance the development of key technologies by those who may use them to threaten our national security,” Rosen said.


Beijing has repeatedly complained about U.S. technology policy, arguing that the U.S. is dedicated to preventing China’s rise as a global power. In a press conference on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian reiterated China’s longstanding objections to U.S. efforts to withhold advanced technology from Chinese companies.


“China deplores and rejects the U.S.’s Final Rule to curb investment in China,” Lin said. “China has protested to the U.S. and will take all measures necessary to firmly defend its lawful rights and interests.”


Not just equipment


The language of the rule frequently notes that it applies to transactions with “countries of concern,” but the specific language in the text makes it plain that the targets of the rule are companies and individuals doing business in mainland China as well as the “special administrative districts” of Hong Kong and Macao.


The Final Rule’s ban on transactions is not limited to the physical transfer of finished goods and machinery in the specified fields. Explanatory documents released on Monday make it clear that several intangible benefits are also covered.


Countries of concern “are exploiting or have the ability to exploit certain United States outbound investments, including certain intangible benefits that often accompany United States investments and that help companies succeed,” an informational statement accompanying the rule said. “These intangible benefits include enhanced standing and prominence, managerial assistance, investment and talent networks, market access, and enhanced access to additional financing.”


Signaling to US companies


The onus will be on U.S. companies to comply with the new rule, Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, told VOA.


“This is the U.S. government signaling to U.S. entities and investors that they need to think twice about making investments on the prohibited transaction side of the equation that would advance China's capabilities in these areas,” Ezell said.


He added that the impact of the rule on investment in Chinese technology companies would have effects far beyond any reduction in funding.


“It's not just the dollars,” he said. “A key target here is getting at the intangible benefits that come with those investments, such as managerial capability, talent networks.” He described that loss as “very significant.”


Closing loopholes


In an email exchange with VOA, Daniel Gonzales, a senior scientist at the RAND Corporation, explained that the purpose of the rule was, in part, to prevent U.S. investment firms from supporting Chinese firms in the development of certain kinds of technology.


“These rules were put in place after many episodes where U.S. [venture capital] companies helped to transfer or nurture advanced technologies that have relevant military capabilities,” Gonzales wrote. “One particular case was that of TikTok and its AI algorithms, which were developed with the help of Sequoia Capital of California.”


Sequoia did not break any laws in assisting TikTok, Gonzales said. But “it has since become known to U.S. authorities that TikTok does possess an AI algorithm that has a variety of applications, some of which have military implications. This new rule is intended to close this loophole.”


Gonzales said the U.S. government’s concern with quantum computing is also born of worries about Chinese offensive capabilities.


“Chinese researchers are working on developing quantum computer algorithms that can break encryption codes used by the U.S. government and the U.S. financial sector to protect private and confidential information,” he wrote. “China has several startup companies working to develop more powerful quantum computers. This new rule is intended to prevent the leakage of U.S. quantum technology to China through U.S. VCs.”

## US court declines RFK Jr's request to order 2 states to drop him from ballot

date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Supreme Court denied a bid Tuesday by former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be removed from the ballot in Wisconsin and Michigan for the Nov. 5 election. Kennedy has said he wants voters who would have backed him to cast ballots for the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. 


The court declined Kennedy's emergency requests to order the Wisconsin Elections Commission and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to take him off the ballot in those states. Michigan and Wisconsin are among a handful of closely contested states expected to decide the outcome of the race between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.  


Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented from the decision concerning the Michigan ballot only. No other justice publicly dissented. 


Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist known by his initials RFK Jr., has sought the Supreme Court's intervention in his attempts to stay on the ballot in some states while dropping off others. In September, the Supreme Court rejected his bid to be restored to the ballot in New York. 


Kennedy suspended his campaign in August and endorsed the former president's candidacy. Kennedy has urged his supporters everywhere to back Trump and has withdrawn from the ballot in a number of Republican-leaning states.

## Judge dismisses Republican lawsuit targeting Pennsylvania overseas ballots

date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA

A U.S. judge on Tuesday dismissed a Republican lawsuit seeking to force election battleground state Pennsylvania to strengthen its procedures for verifying ballots submitted by military and overseas voters. 


Six Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives seeking reelection on November 5 had sued Pennsylvania's top election officials on September 30. The Republicans had argued that the state was improperly exempting overseas voters from a requirement that their identity documents be verified, creating a vulnerability for fraudulent votes to be submitted. 


Pennsylvania is one of a handful of closely contested states that are expected to decide the outcome of the U.S. presidential race pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. 


U.S. District Judge Christopher Conner dismissed the case in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, deciding that the plaintiffs had waited too long to file their complaint given that Pennsylvania's procedures had been in place for years.


The suit was one of dozens around the country in which Republicans have challenged voting procedures or sought to purge voter rolls in what they call a push to ensure that people do not vote illegally. That legal blitz has been faltering. In the past three weeks, Trump allies have been dealt at least 11 court losses. 


Conner also said Erick Kaardal, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, had not provided evidence that there had been foreign influence over Pennsylvania's overseas ballots. The judge wrote that when he pressed Kaardal for such evidence during an October 18 hearing, the lawyer "effectively conceded that all he had was 'concerns.'" 


"Plaintiffs cannot rely on phantom fears of foreign malfeasance to excuse their lack of diligence," Conner wrote. 


"We don't want votes from Iran or Russia or invalid votes counting," Kaardal had told the hearing in Harrisburg federal court over a motion to dismiss the case filed by the Democratic National Committee and Pennsylvania's top elections official. 


The Election Research Institute, a conservative group whose lawyer Karen DiSalvo brought the case alongside Kaardal, said the plaintiffs were disappointed by the dismissal and were considering options for appeal. 


Judges in the election battleground states of Michigan and North Carolina this month also rejected lawsuits filed by the Republican National Committee seeking to block votes from some Americans living overseas. 


In those cases, the Republicans argued the states improperly allowed U.S. citizens living abroad who had never lived in those states to vote there.

## Two Offshore Wind Developers Wade Into the Gulf of Maine

date: 2024-10-29, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDAxNjg3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjA2NDk5OX0.EP572QLZcb9dedWYqLqszZJr0_-0d0cXGPKJ97dXjYM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Just days before what is sure to be a close presidential election in which one of the candidates has promised to shut down the offshore wind industry “on day one,” an auction for the rights to develop wind energy projects in the Gulf of Maine on Tuesday was a surprise success.</p><p>Two developers, Avangrid and Invenergy, purchased four of the eight leases that were up for sale. If turned into wind farms, they have the potential to generate about 6.8 gigawatts, or enough electricity to power about 2.3 million homes, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.</p><p>Compared with the optimism on display just two years ago, when more than a dozen companies competed in a <a href="https://grist.org/energy/a-record-breaking-offshore-wind-lease-sale-signals-a-new-era-for-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three-day bidding war</u></a> for the right to develop six areas off the coast of New York and New Jersey, Tuesday’s sale was a flop. Just two companies participated. The bidding closed after one round. The leases sold for a flat $50 per acre, compared to an average of nearly $9,000 per acre in the New York sale. </p><p>But put in context of how things are going in 2024, it’s a miracle anyone showed up at all. The offshore wind industry has been <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/offshore-wind-2024-outlook" target="_self"><u>struggling</u></a> with supply chain issues and inflation, not to mention increasing opposition from coastal communities. Just a month ago, an offshore wind lease sale off the coast of Oregon was <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/27/oregon-offshore-wind-auction-cancellation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>canceled</u></a> after the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management learned that there was only one interested party. The agency also canceled an auction for the Gulf of Mexico earlier this year citing a lack of interest. </p><p>“It’ll be a win if anything gets leased,” Francis Eanes, executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council, told me Tuesday morning before the results came in. “And honestly, it won’t be surprising if it doesn’t.”</p><p>Outside of the existential threat of a Trump presidency, developing wind projects in the Gulf of Maine was already a challenging prospect. The water is upwards of 200 meters deep — too deep to affix the foundation of a wind turbine to the seafloor. Instead, developers will need to build floating structures that are moored to the seabed with giant cables. Floating offshore wind is a proven technology — there are a handful of projects already operating around the world. But it is more expensive to build, and there are none yet operating in the U.S. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy24osti/88988.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimates</u></a> that floating offshore wind farms will have a levelized cost of energy that’s at least 40% higher than fixed-bottom projects.</p><p>On top of that, just days ago, the U.S. Department of Energy rejected Maine’s application for a $456 million grant to build a <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/maine-floating-wind-sears-island" target="_self"><u>floating offshore wind assembly port on Sears Island</u></a>, a protected area in Penobscot Bay about the size of New York City’s Central Park. A new port is a necessary prerequisite for developing projects in the Gulf of Maine, as floating offshore wind assembly requires different infrastructure than fixed-bottom projects.</p><p>Nonetheless, Tyler Hansen, a research associate studying offshore wind at Dartmouth College, told me he thought the results of the auction “make sense” when weighing the prospects for the technology against the political risks. He expects the cost of floating offshore wind to come down as governments around the world invest in research and development. The Department of Energy has a “<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/floating-offshore-wind-shot-progress-and-priorities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Floating Offshore Wind Shot</u></a>,” a program aimed at reducing the cost of floating technology 70% by 2030.</p><p>The winds that blow over the Gulf of Maine are especially strong and steady, making them one of the best potential renewable energy resources in the United States. The northeast is also “particularly blessed” with available substations where projects could connect to the grid, Eric Hines, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Tufts University told me. Several recent coal plant closures on the Massachusetts coast have created “an enormous amount of coastal transmission capacity that are prime locations for plugging in offshore wind,” he said. </p><p>The area also boasts favorable policy paired with relatively strong grassroots support. States in the Northeast are counting on floating offshore wind to hit their climate goals. Maine has set a goal of achieving 100% clean electricity by 2040, with at least 3 gigawatts of power prescribed to come from the Gulf. Massachusetts, too, anticipates needing some 23 gigawatts from offshore wind by 2050, with at least 10 coming from the Gulf of Maine. </p><p>Environmental groups in Maine have spent the past two years building political coalitions with fishermen, tribes, and labor unions in support of developing an offshore wind industry. Those efforts culminated in a major victory last summer when the state passed a bill that set strong labor standards for offshore wind development, created a requirement for tribal engagement in project development, and enshrined a policy of avoiding development in a key fishery known as Lobster Management Area One. Later, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management amended its map of lease areas in the Gulf of Maine to exclude that management area.</p><p>“That was a huge win,” Eanes said, and never would have happened without the environmental and labor movement’s proactive efforts to build consensus around where offshore wind <em><em>should</em></em> happen, if it were going to happen. As a result, they’ve been able to cultivate a different attitude toward offshore wind in Maine than you will find right now in New Jersey, for example. </p><p>“To be clear, if you go to a coastal community in Maine, especially one that lands a lot of lobsters, you’re not going to find support for offshore wind,” he said. “But the level of organized opposition has not been as pitched as it would have been had we seen lease areas in Lobster Management Area One.”</p><p>In a press release, Avangrid touted the Gulf of Maine’s strong wind speeds and access to interconnection, as well as the fact that it was “largely deconflicted from other ocean users following a rigorous federal public engagement process.” The company is already developing more than 5 gigawatts of offshore wind along the East Coast, including Vineyard Wind, which is currently under construction. This will be its first project to utilize floating technologies, however it is also owned by Iberdrola, a Spanish company with a pipeline of floating offshore wind projects in Europe.</p><p>Maine officials celebrated the results of the auction on Tuesday.</p><p>“The federal lease sale represents a significant milestone for Maine and the region as we advance offshore wind in a responsible manner to help us reduce our reliance on expensive, harmful fossil fuels, diversify our sources of energy, grow our economy, and fight climate change,”<strong> </strong>said Dan Burgess, Director of the Maine Governor’s Energy Office, in an emailed statement.</p><p>The Maine Department of Transportation, the agency leading the development of the would-be port, emphasized that it's undeterred despite losing out on the federal grant. “Maine has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to develop a port facility to create good-paying jobs while serving the entire region as we harness abundant clean wind energy in the Gulf of Maine,” Bruce Van Note, the transportation commissioner, said in a statement last week. “Our work will continue as we examine other opportunities to secure funding to advance this critical port infrastructure.” </p><p>The agency <a href="https://www.maine.gov/mdot/projects/searsport/windport/docs/Maine%20OSWP_Pre-Application%20Alternative%20Analysis_Draft-October%202024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>anticipates</u></a> filing federal permit applications for the project in the next few months, kicking off a process anticipated to take two years, and securing additional funding for it by the end of 2025. But that timeline may depend on the results of the presidential election next week.</p><p>While it’s not always the best advice to take Donald Trump at his word, the former president promised supporters at a rally in New Jersey in May that he would “end” offshore wind development. “You won’t have to worry about Governor Murphy’s 157 windmills,” he said. “I’m going to write it out in an executive order. It’s going to end on day one.”</p><p>In its most recent <a href="https://oceantic.org/2024-q3-u-s-offshore-wind-quarterly-market-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quarterly market report</u></a>, the industry association Oceantic Network noted that private investment and activity in the offshore wind sector “are decelerating … due largely to the uncertainty around the presidential election.”</p><p>At the same time, developers are used to long time horizons. Offshore wind projects can take a decade to permit and build, and as long as state support doesn’t slide, a slowdown of four years isn’t make-or-break. Even with a supportive administration, it will likely be impossible for Avangrid or Invenergy to begin construction in the Gulf of Maine before 2030, as that’s the absolute soonest Maine expects to get its port built. </p><p>The fact that two developers took the leap now rather than waiting for 2028 — which is when the next lease sale in the Gulf of Maine is <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-announces-new-five-year-offshore-wind-leasing-schedule" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scheduled</u></a> — shows some level of confidence in the long-term prospects for the industry.</p><p>“These leases don’t come up for auction very often,” Hines told me. “And if you don’t have a lease, you can’t build a project.”</p>

## Teri Garr, comic actor of 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Tootsie,' has died

date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Teri Garr, the quirky comedy actor who rose from background dancer in Elvis Presley movies to co-star of such favorites as Young Frankenstein and Tootsie, has died. She was 79. 


Garr died Tuesday of multiple sclerosis "surrounded by family and friends," publicist Heidi Schaeffer said. Garr battled other health problems in recent years and underwent an operation in January 2007 to repair an aneurysm. 


Admirers took to social media in her honor, with writer-director Paul Feig calling her "truly one of my comedy heroes. I couldn't have loved her more" and screenwriter Cinco Paul saying: "Never the star, but always shining. She made everything she was in better." 


The actor, who was sometimes credited as Terri, Terry or Terry Ann during her long career, seemed destined for show business from her childhood. 


Her father was Eddie Garr, a well-known vaudeville comedian; her mother was Phyllis Lind, one of the original high-kicking Rockettes at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Their daughter began dance lessons at 6 and by 14 was dancing with the San Francisco and Los Angeles ballet companies. 




She was 16 when she joined the road company of West Side Story in Los Angeles, and as early as 1963 she began appearing in bit parts in films. 


She recalled in a 1988 interview how she won the West Side Story role. After being dropped from her first audition, she returned a day later in different clothes and was accepted. 


From there, the blonde, statuesque Garr found steady work dancing in movies, and she appeared in the chorus of nine Presley films, including Viva Las Vegas, Roustabout and Clambake. 


She also appeared on numerous television shows, including Star Trek, Dr. Kildare and Batman, and was a featured dancer on the rock 'n' roll music show Shindig, the rock concert performance T.A.M.I. and a cast member of The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. 


Her big film break came as Gene Hackman's girlfriend in 1974's Francis Ford Coppola thriller The Conversation. That led to an interview with Mel Brooks, who said he would hire her for the role of Gene Wilder's German lab assistant in 1974's Young Frankenstein — if she could speak with a German accent. 




"Cher had this German woman, Renata, making wigs, so I got the accent from her," Garr once recalled. 


The film established her as a talented comedy performer, with New Yorker film critic Pauline Kael proclaiming her "the funniest neurotic dizzy dame on the screen." 


Her big smile and off-center appeal helped land her roles in Oh God! opposite George Burns and John Denver, Mr. Mom (as Michael Keaton's wife) and Tootsie in which she played the girlfriend who loses Dustin Hoffman to Jessica Lange. 


Although best known for comedy, Garr showed in such films as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Black Stallion and The Escape Artist that she could handle drama equally well. 


She had a flair for spontaneous humor, often playing David Letterman's foil during guest appearances on NBC's Late Night With David Letterman early in its run. 


Her appearances became so frequent, and the pair's good-natured bickering so convincing, that for a time rumors cropped up that they were romantically involved. Years later, Letterman credited those early appearances with helping make the show a hit. 


It was also during those years that Garr began to feel something in her right leg. It began in 1983 and eventually spread to her right arm. By 1999 the symptoms had become so severe that she consulted a doctor. The diagnosis: multiple sclerosis. 




For three years Garr didn't reveal her illness. 


"I was afraid that I wouldn't get work," she explained in a 2003 interview. "People hear MS and think, 'Oh, my God, the person has two days to live.'" 


After going public, she became a spokeswoman for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, making humorous speeches to gatherings in the U.S. and Canada. 


"You have to find your center and roll with the punches because that's a hard thing to do: to have people pity you," she said in 2005. "Just trying to explain to people that I'm OK is tiresome." 


She also continued to act, appearing on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Greetings From Tucson, Life With Bonnie and other TV shows. She also had a brief recurring role on Friends in the 1990s as Lisa Kudrow's mother. After several failed romances, Garr married contractor John O'Neill in 1993.

## US reiterates 'one China' policy amid reports of Xi's request on Taiwan

date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Resisting pressure from Beijing to publicly reject independence for Taiwan, the Biden administration underscores there is no change in its “one China” policy which takes no stand on the issue.


“We do not support Taiwan independence. We expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion,” a senior administration official told VOA Tuesday, underscoring long-standing U.S. policy on the thorny issue. “We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by either side.”


The confirmation followed reports that during their last in-person meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S. President Joe Biden to change the language the administration uses when discussing its position on Taiwan independence.




On the sidelines of the APEC meeting near San Francisco last November, Xi reportedly told Biden he wants the U.S. to use language stating it “opposes” instead of “does not support” independence for Taiwan, the current phrase used in U.S. official statements.


The administration has been “consistent on our long-standing one China policy,” the official said. Under the policy, the U.S. acknowledges but does not endorse Beijing’s view that it has sovereignty over Taiwan. It considers Taiwan's status as unsettled.


The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s request for comment.


Beijing’s push for stronger language is not new. Ahead of the Biden-Xi meeting last year, VOA reported that Foreign Minister Wang Yi also made the request in his meetings with U.S. counterparts.


The Chinese have been asking for this shift, and in some instances falsely asserting that the U.S. position is to oppose Taiwanese independence, said Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.


“I find it unlikely that the United States will take this advice without some substantial concession from China on its own position about Taiwan,” Cooper told VOA. “I doubt this will get any traction in Washington unless it is part of a longer-term conversation about de-escalating tensions across the Taiwan Strait.”




Biden and Xi likely to meet again in person next month in South America, where both are expected to attend an APEC meeting in Lima, Peru, and a G-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It will likely be Biden’s last meeting with the Chinese leader before leaving office in January.


“It will probably be an opportunity for the two leaders to say goodbye and for their teams to wrap up a couple of loose ends, perhaps including an announcement or two on people-to-people issues,” said Cooper.


Beijing is no doubt gearing up for a change in U.S. administration ahead of the election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Both have vowed to be tough on China, with Trump saying he would impose “150% to 200%” tariffs on China if it sought to blockade Taiwan.


Flared tensions


Cross-strait tensions have flared many times in recent years. On Sunday, Taiwan's defense ministry said Chinese warplanes and warships carried out another “combat patrol” near the island, following Beijing’s threat to respond with countermeasures to a $2 billion arms sale by the United States.




The administration announced it approved the package last week, which includes its first delivery of three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, advanced weapons that have been battle-tested in Ukraine.


Despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, the U.S. is Taiwan’s strongest unofficial ally and Washington is legally bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taipei with the means to defend itself.


China “strongly condemns” the sale. “We will take resolute countermeasures and take all measures necessary to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,” said a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson. 


VOA's Nike Ching contributed to this story.

## Trump ally Steve Bannon released after serving 4 months in prison for contempt of Congress

date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA

DANBURY, Conn.  — Longtime Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon was released from prison early Tuesday, after serving a four-month sentence for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.


Bannon left the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, according to Kristie Breshears, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Prisons. He planned to hold a news conference later in the day in Manhattan, his representatives said. He's also expected to resume his podcast Tuesday.


Bannon, 70, reported to the prison July 1 after the Supreme Court rejected his bid to delay the prison sentence while he appeals his conviction.




A jury found Bannon guilty in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and a second for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement Trump's efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race.


When he began serving his sentence in July, Bannon called himself a "political prisoner."


"I am proud of going to prison," he said at the time, adding that he was standing up Attorney General Merrick Garland and a "corrupt" Justice Department.


Trump, a Republican, is seeking to regain the presidency in next week's election against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.


A federal appeals court panel upheld Bannon's convictions in May. Bannon is now asking the full appeals court to hear his case. His legal team had argued that the congressional subpoena was invalid because Trump had asserted executive privilege. Prosecutors, though, say Bannon had left the White House years before and Trump had never invoked executive privilege in front of the committee.


Bannon faces additional criminal charges in New York state court, alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges. A trial in that case is scheduled to begin in December.

## Adidas reaches out-of-court settlement with rapper Ye

date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA

London — Adidas has reached an out-of-court settlement with rapper Ye to end all legal proceedings between them, the sportswear brand said on Tuesday, adding that no money changed hands in the agreement.


Adidas and Ye had been embroiled in multiple lawsuits for the past two years, since the German company ended a partnership with the rapper previously known as Kanye West over antisemitic comments he made.




"There isn't any more open issues, and there is no... money going either way, and we both move on," CEO Bjorn Gulden told reporters on a conference call, declining to give further details of the deal.


"There were tensions on many issues, and... when you put the claims on the right side and you put the claims on the left side, both parties said we don't need to fight anymore and withdrew all the claims," Gulden added.

## The Energy Transition Is Slowing Down

The energy transition as a whole is slowing down. </p><p>This was the stark warning from Wood Mackenzie’s <a href="https://www.woodmac.com/market-insights/topics/energy-transition-outlook/" target="_blank">Energy Transition Outlook</a>, the energy consultancy’s annual assessment of global progress toward decarbonizing the economy. “Progress toward a low-carbon energy system is stumbling on multiple fronts, leaving the world dependent on fossil fuels for longer,” the outlook’s authors write.</p><p>Alongside the International Energy Agency’s Global Energy Outlook, which found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/16/climate/global-demand-electricity-rising.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>faster than expected global electricity demand imperiling Paris goals</u></a>, and the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap Report, which warned that unless emissions were soon wrenched down “it will become impossible” to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report completes a grim picture. The question now is less “Can the world meet the Paris Agreement goals?” and more “How will we manage once we’ve missed them?”</p><p><span></span>Wood Mackenzie takes 2.5 degrees of warming as its “base case,” consistent with other estimates, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2024/executive-summary" target="_blank"><u>including the IEA’s</u></a>. The report’s authors have little optimism left about the prospect of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 and limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. Instead, they used to the report to “highlight the potential of a delayed transition,” in which warming rises to 3 degrees, said Jonathan Sultoon,  Wood Mackenzie’s head of markets and transitions, on a call with reporters Monday.</p><p>“We’re in the middle of the 2020s, the decade that’s pivotal to accelerate the energy transition” Sultoon said, “and no major countries — and very few companies — are on track to meet their 2030 climate goals.”</p><p>To meet even the 2.5 degree warming scenario — one that many scientists warn could result in difficult to predict and possibly irreversible climate impacts — would still require that global emissions peak by 2027. Emissions, instead, are rising — by some 1.3% in 2023, according to the United Nations.</p><p>The likelihood of slipping from 2.5 degrees to 3 will be determined by politics, Wood Mackenzie’s analysts argue, whether it’s the war in Ukraine and unstable Middle East leading countries to reinvest in fossil fuels for energy security or protectionist policies that block imports of world-leading low-priced Chinese renewable technology.<br/></p><p>“China’s the lower-cost producer in clean tech,” Sultoon said. “Either the rest of the world needs to rely on Chinese manufacturing to speed the transition,” or “the West will pay a higher cost — or, in fact, delay the transition. And it looks far more likely to be that latter situation than the former.”</p><p>Policymakers in the rest of the high-emitting world, especially the United States, are perfectly aware of China’s dominance of much of the low-carbon technology stack, ranging from solar panels to lithium refining. But <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-policy" target="_blank">they’re seeking to nurture their own industries</a>, seeking both to secure energy supplies in case of global conflict and to protect native workers and industries. <strong><em></em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong>The political or security logic of these movies might be clear enough, but the Wood Mackenzie analysts are skeptical of this approach, at least when it comes to advancing decarbonization. “These dual goals — of decarbonisation and reducing dependence on metals supply from China — are at odds,” they write. “It will take years, if not decades, to shift away from China because it controls up to 70% of global supply chains across several commodities. It is also the lowest-cost producer. The rest of the world may need to rely on Chinese manufacturing or be prepared to either pay a higher cost or delay the transition.”</p><p>And then there’s the growth in electricity demand, which the IEA <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/iea-world-energy-outlook-2024" target="_blank">also highlighted</a>. While any scenario that brings down emissions globally to levels consistent with even 2.5 degrees of warming, let alone 1.5, will involve a high degree of electrification of processes currently reliant on the combustion of fossil fuels, new demand for electricity can have ambiguous effects on overall emissions depending on the ability of non-carbon-emitting generation to meet that demand.</p><p>“The quick expansion of electricity supply is often constrained by transmission infrastructure which takes time to develop,” the report says. This means new demand could be met by fossil fuels, that the energy transition could become more expensive than it would be under a lower demand scenario, or that some crucial amount of electrification just simply does not happen.</p><p>“What happens if geopolitical crises, expanded trade restrictions, or protectionist policies becomes the norm, rather than the exception on a long-term basis? And where you see slower cost declines for alternative energy?” asked David Brown, director of Wood Mackenzie’s energy transition practice. If things continue as they are, that's a question we’ll all have to answer. <strong></strong></p>

## China's Xi pressed Biden to alter language on Taiwan, sources say

date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON/BEIJING/TAIPEI — Chinese President Xi Jinping asked U.S. President Joe Biden last year to change the language the United States uses when discussing its position on Taiwanese independence, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the private conversation.


During last November's Biden-Xi meeting near San Francisco, Xi and his aides asked Biden and his team to tweak the language in U.S. official statements.


China wanted the U.S. to say "we oppose Taiwan independence," rather than the current version, which is that the United States "does not support" independence for Taiwan, said the people, who requested anonymity to speak about private diplomatic exchanges they participated in or were briefed on.


Xi's aides have repeatedly followed up and made the requests in the months since, according to two U.S. officials and another person familiar with the exchanges.


The U.S. has declined to make the change.


The White House responded to a request for comment with a statement that repeated the line that Washington does not support Taiwan independence. "The Biden-Harris administration has been consistent on our long-standing One China policy," the statement read.


China's foreign ministry said: "You should ask this question to the U.S. government. China's position on the Taiwan issue is clear and consistent."


Taiwan's foreign ministry declined comment.


The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists.


The Republic of China remains Taiwan's formal name and the government says it has no plans to change that given they are already a sovereign, independent state and Beijing has no right to claim Taiwan as its own.


Sensitive issue


For several years, Chinese diplomats have pushed the United States to make changes to how it refers to Taiwan's status, which remains the most sensitive area in U.S.-China relations. The unusually direct and renewed push at the leader level has not been reported previously.


The United States severed official relations with the government in Taipei in 1979 but is bound by law to provide democratically governed Taiwan with the means to defend itself. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.


It was not clear why Xi chose to raise the issue with Biden, but he has made opposition to Taiwan independence a focus of his time in office and China's military has significantly ramped up its activities around the island in recent years.


The Biden administration regards the proposed language change as a non-starter.


Taiwan was briefed on the recent overtures at a high level by Washington, said one of the sources.


Leaders in Beijing "would love it if Joe Biden said very different things about Taiwan than he says, no doubt," said one senior Biden administration official, adding that Biden would stick with the standard U.S. formulation for talking about Taiwan independence.


During his time in office, Biden has upset the Chinese government with comments that appeared to suggest the United States would defend the island if it were attacked, a deviation from a long-held U.S. position of "strategic ambiguity."


Change would reverberate


A change by the U.S. to say that it opposes Taiwanese independence would reverberate through the trade-rich Asia Pacific and with U.S. partners, competitors and adversaries alike.


Officials from two governments in the region told Reuters they would interpret any such change in wording as a change in U.S. policy toward less support for Taipei's defense and diplomatic aspirations at a time when Beijing has ramped up military pressure.


China has over the past five years staged almost daily military activities around Taiwan. Earlier this month, Beijing held a day of war games using what Taiwan said was a record 153 military aircraft as part of drills simulating blockading ports and assaulting maritime and ground targets.


Any switch in language could also be seen signaling a shift in U.S. policy from supporting the resolution of Taiwan's future through peaceful talks to one suggesting the United States stands against Taiwanese aspirations regardless of the circumstances at play.


Opinion polls in Taiwan show most people support maintaining the status quo, neither seeking to join with China nor establishing a new state.


In 2022, the State Department changed its website on Taiwan, removing wording both on not supporting Taiwan independence and on acknowledging Beijing's position that Taiwan is part of China, which angered the Chinese. It later restored the language on not supporting independence for the island.


The two leaders are expected to speak again before Biden's term in office ends in January, talks that may come by phone or on the sidelines of next month's G20 summit in Brazil or APEC summit in Peru. APEC is one of few international forums where both Taiwan and China take part.


The Democratic president will hand over the tense Taiwan issue to his successor, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or Republican former President Donald Trump, following the Nov. 5 election.

## Washington Post's Bezos defends decision to end presidential endorsements

date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos on Monday defended the newspaper's decision not to endorse a U.S. presidential candidate after a report that more than 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions following the move.


The decision blocked an endorsement of Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris, the National Public Radio report said, and many people in messages on the newspaper's website criticized Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon.com and rocket company Blue Origin.


Bezos, in an opinion piece late on Monday, said "most people believe the media is biased" and the Washington Post and other newspapers needed to boost their credibility.


No candidate was informed or consulted about the decision and that there was "no quid pro quo," Bezos said, adding that there was no connection between the decision and a meeting between Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Blue Origin's CEO on the same day.


"Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election," Bezos wrote. "What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one."


The subscription cancellations as of midday represented about 8% of the paper's paid circulation of 2.5 million subscribers, which includes print as well, reported NPR, which said a series of columnists had resigned their positions in protest.


The Washington Post declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.


In a post on Friday, William Lewis, The Washington Post's publisher and CEO, said the newspaper would not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in the Nov. 5 election, nor in any future presidential election.


"We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates," Lewis wrote.


"The Washington Post's decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential campaign is a terrible mistake," wrote 20 columnists in an opinion piece on the Post's website, adding that it "represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love."

## US, South Korea to confer on North Korean troop deployment to Russia

date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA

state department — Top diplomatic and military officials from the United States and South Korea are set to convene in Washington this Thursday as the two allies closely monitor and express concerns about North Korea's deployment of about 10,000 troops to Russia.


Meanwhile, U.S. officials and analysts say that China could be displeased by Russia's growing influence over North Korea, and that if Beijing chose, it could restrict exports of materials that Pyongyang might use for munitions production.


U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will co-host South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul and Minister of Defense Kim Yong-hyun to coordinate on pressing security threats facing the alliance.


State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told VOA during Monday’s briefing that high on the agenda would be discussion of “North Korea's expanding relationship with Russia,” which includes the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia;  various other provocative actions by North Korea in recent months; and the U.S. commitment to security in the Indo-Pacific region.


The consultation between Washington and Seoul will come two weeks after establishment of the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team, a group formed by the United States, South Korea, Japan and other allies to better coordinate enforcement of sanctions against North Korea.


The group said that while “the path to dialogue” with North Korea remained open, it was committed to “safeguard the global nonproliferation regime and address the threat arising from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s [DPRK, North Korea’s official name] weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, which are in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.”


Some analysts suggest that by sending troops to support Russia’s war on Ukraine, North Korea may gain an opportunity to test the effectiveness of its ballistic missiles and munitions.


“We have communicated with the PRC about this matter to make clear that we are concerned about it, and that they ought to be concerned about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and North Korea,” Miller added. He was referring to People’s Republic of China.


Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that while China has been supportive of Russia’s war in Ukraine, North Korea’s involvement introduces an unsettling dynamic.


“For one,” Cha said, “China does not like Russia to have so much influence over North Korea.”


Cha added that Beijing could take specific actions, such as curbing exports of petroleum coke to North Korea, which can be used in munitions production.


“According to recent public reports, imports of this good [used for steel production] have dramatically increased while overall trade has only slowly started to return to normal,” he said.


Defense Department spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Austin would also meet with his South Korean counterpart Wednesday, when he will host Kim at the Pentagon for the 56th U.S.-ROK Security Consultative Meeting. ROK refers to South Korea’s official name, the Republic of Korea.

## Biden hosts White House Diwali reception

date: 2024-10-29, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday hailed the start of the five-day festival of Diwali — the celebration that symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and is marked by Hindus, Jains and Sikhs around the world, especially in India. 


Biden began the White House festivities by lighting a small prayer lamp known as a diya. Several hundred guests — including South Asian administration officials, elected officials, prominent community members and others — wore silks and embroidered finery and thronged the White House’s massive and heavily chandeliered East Room for the occasion. 


But Biden used the occasion to shine a light on someone who was not in the crowd: Vice President Kamala Harris, the most prominent South Asian American, who was busy on the campaign trail as the election swiftly approaches. Her late mother immigrated to the United States from what was then the Indian city of Madras, now called Chennai. 


“One of the things we bonded over was the role each of our mothers played in our lives,” Biden said. “They come from different places, different generations, different lives, but they shared a basic belief about America: Only in America is anything possible. Only in America.”


And, he said, after hundreds of years of struggle, South Asian Americans have made the U.S. their home. 


“Diwali is celebrated openly and proudly here in the White House,” he said. “And by the way, this is not my house. This is your house.”


The festival starts on the darkest night of the year, per the Hindu lunar calendar — October 31, according to the Indian government. The day is a national holiday.


Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who was visibly moved by the occasion, spoke of how his parents’ faith illuminated their path after they immigrated to the U.S. from India. 


“That is the message of Diwali,” he said. ”Choose light always, whatever the future may bring. Whatever the future may bring, it is our light and our fierce commitment to one another that will see us through to a better day.”


And joining the festivities from afar was International Space Station commander Sunita Williams. Her father immigrated to the U.S. from India; her mother, from Slovenia. She spoke to the White House crowd via a recorded message from 420 kilometers (260 miles) above the Earth. 


“On this day, I specifically think about my father, who immigrated to the U.S. from India,” she said. “He kept and shared his cultural roots by teaching us about Diwali and other Indian festivals. Diwali is a time of joy, as goodness in the world prevails. I am so thankful to have grown up in a multicultural household where our parents encouraged us to seek opportunities and reach for the stars.”


Monday’s reception marks the latest in a line of presidential celebrations of Diwali that date to President George W. Bush's time in office. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump also held Diwali celebrations. 

 

The festival marks the return of the mythical Lord Ram, named in Sanskrit scripture as a reincarnation of the god Vishnu, from exile after 14 years. The people of his kingdom, Ayodhya, lit lamps to illuminate his path home — a tradition that merrymakers continue today with lamps and pyrotechnics. Indian Americans are the largest non-mixed Asian group in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, with nearly 4.4 million people identifying as 100% Indian in origin. 


Today, celebrants around the world honor the occasion with new clothes, extravagant decorations and massive quantities of sugar-laden confections.


This year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is the top proponent of a Hindu-nationalist movement known as Hindutva, saw a sweet named in his honor. The so-called “Modi Laddu” — the Modi Ball — is made of saffron, clarified butter, pistachios, almonds and rose water.


But there is also a vein of bitterness in India’s observance of this holiday.


Modi was the driving force behind the rebuilding of a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, on what was thought to be Ram’s birthplace. In 1992, a Hindu mob demolished a mosque on that site, prompting deadly religious riots that were the worst since India’s independence, leaving more than 2,000 people dead. Modi spent years raising funds to erect a massive Hindu temple on the ruins. He opened it earlier this year, saying, “Today, our Ram has come.”

## Ex-US Marine sentenced to 7 years for white supremacist plot

date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A former U.S. Marine was sentenced to seven years in prison Monday for his role in a white supremacist plot to destroy power facilities. 


Jordan Duncan, 29, pleaded guilty in North Carolina in June to aiding in the manufacture of a firearm. 


Duncan and four other men, including two other ex-Marines, were arrested in 2020 in connection with what authorities described as a neo-Nazi plot to sow chaos by targeting the power grid. 


"We have now brought to justice all five of the defendants involved in a self-described 'modern day SS,' who conspired, prepared, and trained to attack America's power grid in the name of violent white supremacist ideology," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. 


FBI Director Christopher Wray said the group was "inspired by racially motivated violent extremism." 


"If the defendants had been able to carry out an attack it could have caused suffering to thousands of American citizens," Wray said. 


The other four defendants were previously sentenced to prison terms between 21 months and 10 years. 


According to court documents, two members of the group were active on "Iron March," a neo-Nazi online forum, until it was closed in 2017. They also recruited the other three people involved. 


The group accumulated firearms and produced a video of live-fire training in the desert near Boise, Idaho, that ended with the phrase "Come home white man" as the final frame. 


Components of the power grid in the northwestern United States were listed as potential targets in handwritten notes found in the possession of one of the conspirators.

## One person dead in Iowa from Lassa fever, state health department says

date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA

The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services on Monday confirmed the death of a middle-aged eastern Iowa resident from Lassa fever.


The individual had recently returned from travel to West Africa, where it is believed the person contracted the virus, the state health department said.


The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to confirm the diagnosis of Lassa fever, the state health department said. The CDC said it assesses the risk to the general public to be extremely low.


Lassa fever is a viral disease common in West Africa, but rarely seen in the United States.


There have been eight travel-associated cases of Lassa fever in the United States in the past 55 years, according to the Iowa health department.


In West Africa, the Lassa virus is carried by rodents and spread to humans through contact with urine or droppings of infected rodents.


About 100,000 to 300,000 cases of Lassa fever and 5,000 related deaths occur in West Africa each year, according to the CDC.

## There’s No Easy Way to Fill Climate Tech’s ‘Missing Middle’

date: 2024-10-28, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzg4ODk3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjYwODg0N30.3dgQqSCEV-aV12c3mQOS3V9Go5t77BxdLdOluYXq1tw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Sometimes it’s called the “missing middle,” sometimes, more ominously, the “valley of death.” Whatever the terminology, it’s undeniable that a chasm lies between a climate company’s early funding rounds and its eventual commercial scale-up, one that’s getting harder and harder to bridge. From the first half of last year to the first half of this one, total Series B funding declined by nearly a quarter; beyond Series C rounds — what the market intelligence platform <a href="https://www.ctvc.co/a-weak-11-3bn-start-to-2024-climate-tech/?ref=ctvc-by-sightline-climate-newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CTVC</u></a> calls “growth funding” — it declined by a third.</p><p>“The capital needs of these businesses have just outgrown their early stage backers,” Frank O’Sullivan, a managing director for S2G Ventures’ energy investments, told me. “But the infrastructure investors have absolutely no appetite whatsoever for taking on an unproven technology and scaling.” S2G makes both early stage and growth stage investments, and O’Sullivan co-authored a <a href="https://www.s2gventures.com/2023-capital-imbalances-energy-transition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>white paper</u></a> last year on the problem of the “missing middle.” The paper found that of the $270 billion in private capital for clean energy raised between 2017 and 2022, just 20% was allocated to late-stage and growth-focused investments, while 43% went to earlier rounds and 37% toward deploying established tech.</p><p>Of course, some of climate tech’s funding gap can be attributed to broader trends in the venture market and economic landscape. Covid-related disruptions and low interest rates led investors to throw money at promising startups, only to see their valuations drop as inflation (with rising interest rates to match) and geopolitical uncertainty cooled down the overheated market. Other companies went directly onto the public market via special purpose acquisition companies, only to underperform expectations. “There is capital to be deployed,” O’Sullivan told me. “But a lot of the companies that need that capital are struggling, really, to swallow hard and take significant restructuring of their previous valuations.”</p><p>With clean tech in particular, there’s also frequently a mismatch between the abilities of venture firms, which often make their biggest returns on software startups, and the demands of climate tech. The latter tends to require huge investments in physical infrastructure and support for first-of-a-kind projects, and generally has a longer timeline to profitability than, say, an app. “Venture funding, in some sense, was built for scaling software companies,” Lara Pierpoint, managing director of the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240418137137/en/Prime-Coalition-Announces-Trellis-Climate-to-Accelerate-Deployment-of-First-of-a-Kind-Climate-Projects-Through-Catalytic-Capital" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new catalytic capital program</u></a> Trellis Climate, told me. “You’re talking about a capital light business that generally is creating something that enters a white space, and for which there’s huge amounts of market potential.” </p><p>It’s much more difficult to build expensive infrastructure that aims to displace fossil fuel facilities and the entire economy that relies on the cheap, reliable power they provide. So while VCs may be enthusiastic about taking a relatively small financial bet on a high-potential early-stage company, that may be all they’re able to do.</p><p>Trellis, on the other hand, is a part of the climate nonprofit Prime Coalition and funds first-of-a-kind climate projects with philanthropic capital. The nonprofit structure and philanthropy-focused funding model mean that Trellis can take a different tack on missing middle financing than traditional venture or equity investors. For example, Pierpoint told me it can choose whether to invest in a company or just a specific project. Trellis can also help de-risk projects by providing an “insurance backstop” — basically backup capital in case primary project funding falls short. “We’re looking at expanding the kinds of resources and dollars we can bring to the table in general for the ecosystem, because we think that venture can’t do this alone,” Pierpoint told me.</p><p>As with all nonprofits, generating big returns isn’t the focus for Trellis. But for traditional investors, that’s the primary goal. And while growth investments in more technically mature solutions are likely to generate consistent returns, O’Sullivan told me they don’t often provide the rarer but more alluring 10x returns that make early-stage venture capital particularly enticing. “So it’s a more balanced portfolio, typically, in that growth equity category. It’s just that you don’t see the high highs,” he said, explaining that a two to 3x return on investments is more realistic. </p><p>Brook Porter, a partner and co-founder at the growth-stage firm G2 Venture Partners, told me that focusing on the missing middle <em><em>can</em></em> be extremely profitable, though, and that the key to making real money is correctly identifying a company’s “inflection point” — that is, when it’s poised for significant growth and impact. That is, of course, every investor’s dream. But G2’s whole strategy revolves around identifying exactly when this critical juncture will be, tracking more than 2,000 companies per year to identify the ones best poised for breakout scale-up.</p><p>The firm spun off in 2016 from Kleiner Perkins’ Green Growth Fund, where Porter and his three co-founders previously worked as senior partners. This is where they honed their theory of inflection point investing, <a href="https://g2vp.com/portfolio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>funding companies</u></a> such as Uber, drone-maker DJI, and Enphase Energy. Porter told me that helping startups move from proof-of-concept to building “that machine of a business” requires a lot of hand-holding, and that “there aren’t as many investors with that skill set,” so it could take a while for this approach to scale. </p><p>On the other end of the funding spectrum, large institutional investors like banks, hedge funds, and asset management firms certainly have the money to help bridge the missing middle, but O’Sullivan and Pierpoint told me they’re generally more interested in fulfilling their internal climate mandates by building out more wind and solar, which generates near-guaranteed returns. These investment giants then look at their remaining cash and think, “Well, we should do something more avant garde. Let’s put money into early-stage venture,” O’Sullivan explained. That’s how many seed and Series A-focused funds raise money. </p><p>As O’Sullivan sees it, what’s happening now is “a flaw of the structure of capital allocation at the very highest level.” He thinks we could start by reorienting incentives such that large investors such as banks, asset managers, and pension funds get paid in part for helping bring new climate solutions to market, as opposed to just funding the same old, same old. That would allow them to write “right-sized checks” on the order of $50 million to $100 million to ready-to-scale companies — larger than what a VC firm would write, but smaller than what the big infrastructure investors are used to.</p><p>How would those alternate funding models actually work? Well, that’s the real question. Pierpoint said she’s often asked whether a new kind of investor or asset class will be necessary to fill the gap, and while she doesn’t have an answer, what she does know is that the group of climate tech companies that’s ready to commercialize “can’t wait 15 years until we have the exact right form of capital.” </p><p>“There needs to be urgency on the part of philanthropists, on the part of infrastructure equity investors, on the part of venture capitalists, to really start showing that we can do this,” Pierpoint told me, “and that we can bring together the right capital stacks to make this happen.” </p>

The population of Maricopa County, which includes the city and its suburbs, was over 4.4 million in the 2020 <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/maricopacountyarizona/PST045223" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Census</u></a>, double what it had been 30 years before. This is despite the fact that you run the risk of bursting into flames simply by walking down the street there; this summer, temperatures <a href="http://phoenicians" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exceeded</u></a> 100 degrees Fahrenheit in Phoenix for a stunning 113 straight days, and in July <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-weather/2024/08/16/phoenix-heat-breaks-over-a-dozen-all-time-records-what-are-they/74831426007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the temperature reached</u></a> a balmy 118.</p><p>Climate hasn’t been as hot an issue in Arizona this year as immigration, though the candidates for an open Senate seat have <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/shes-in-denial-gallego-lake-clash-on-climate-water/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disagreed</u></a> over the reality of climate change and how to deal with extreme heat. (Democrat Ruben Gallego advocates emissions reductions and more nuclear power; Republican Kari Lake says if we “Drill baby drill” then everyone can keep running their air conditioners.) There is genuine uncertainty about how long the state will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/01/climate/arizona-phoenix-permits-housing-water.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have enough water</u></a> to supply its growing population, but when the election is over it will be difficult to tell exactly how many votes were moved by rising temperatures. Joe Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Maricopa since Harry Truman, and the slowly baking county is the most important battleground in that battleground state. </p><p>While climate may have seemed like a minor consideration amid all the talk of fascism, abortion bans, and fictional pet-eating this election cycle, in some of the states where the election will be decided, it’s still a vital issue. Particularly when a few thousand votes can determine who wins — as will probably be the case in multiple states — it could be far more important than most people realize. </p><p>In fact, in most of the battlegrounds, one can identify a climate issue that is profoundly affecting lives and the economy — and might or might not nudge the election results one way or another. The most obvious case may be North Carolina, where the western part of the state was ravaged by Hurricane Helene. In the aftermath, it became clear that Asheville was not the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91200111/asheville-has-been-called-a-climate-haven-theres-no-such-thing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate refuge</u></a> some had believed it to be. </p><p>Buncombe County, where Asheville is located, is a blue island in a red sea. And while officials scramble to make sure voting sites are operable, Republicans in the state seem to think the hurricane has given them an advantage, since they’ve used it to convince people (often with false claims and conspiracy theories) that the federal government has abandoned them. The county Democratic chair <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-trump-teams-scramble-votes-north-carolinas-hurricane-damaged-west-2024-10-24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told Reuters</u></a> they’ve stopped knocking on Republican voters’ doors because “we just don't know about how volatile they might be.” No one is sure how many people have lost access to voting sites due to the storm, though one Republican congressman from Maryland <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/trump-freedom-caucus-north-carolina-electors-00185520" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested</u></a> that since many of the affected areas lean red, the state legislature should just award its electoral votes to Trump.</p><p>Pennsylvania is another state where Republicans think the climate debate will work in their favor. Both Trump and Senate candidate David McCormick have put much of their emphasis on promoting fracking and accusing their opponents of wanting to ban it, on the presumption that the issue is a guaranteed winner. But the truth is that Pennsylvanians are <a href="https://e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/E2-Clean-Jobs-Pennsylvania-2023_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>much more ambivalent</u></a> about fracking than you might imagine, and there are now more <a href="https://e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/E2-Clean-Jobs-Pennsylvania-2023_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clean energy jobs</u></a> in the state than fracking jobs. The counties <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/5d08b5d1dd7f4cbba594b193debf75dd#data_s=id%3AdataSource_1-19083a7c8ba-layer-13%3A8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most dependent</u></a> on fossil fuel production — including McKean, Warren, Venango (where Oil City is the largest town) and others — are small to mid-sized, though heavily Republican; their votes are swamped by those in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and their surrounding suburbs. It wouldn’t be a stretch to think that if Harris wins, the frack attack could fade in the same way coal has <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/coal-2024-election-trump-biden" target="_self"><u>ceased</u></a> to be a major campaign issue. </p><p>There are also places where climate politics are even more subtle. Consider Bryan County, Georgia, a rapidly growing county not far from Savannah. It has long been a Republican stronghold — Donald Trump got two-thirds of the vote there in 2020 — but it’s also one of the jewels in Georgia’s recent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-georgia-became-green-manufacturing-capital-2024-3?op=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reinvention</u></a> as a center of green manufacturing. Production <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/hyundia-metaplant-has-started-production-ahead-of-schedule/ar-AA1rIAKb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just began</u></a> at the local Hyundai “Metaplant” in the county, where 1,400 workers are building electric vehicles. </p><p>Will people in a place where the local economy increasingly revolves around green manufacturing vote again for a candidate who wants to rescind the subsidies that allow consumers to buy the very vehicles they and their neighbors are making? It’s difficult to predict. But the Republicans who run the state, especially Gov. Brian Kemp, have worked hard to promote Georgia as a green tech hub while tiptoeing around any talk of climate change, in a way that hasn’t seemed to damage either their political or economic fortunes. </p><p>The politics in these very different places show that economic transitions can be fodder for arguments on both sides, progress can produce backlash, and disaster can be exploited by almost anyone cynical enough to do so. While advocates of climate action might hope that the candidates who support their favored policies will inevitably have an advantage as the effects of climate change grow in magnitude, that won’t always be true.</p><p>It may be inevitable that over time, climate will become more central to campaigns. But the ways it is playing out in this election, low-key though they might be, could be a preview of things to come. The urgency of the climate crisis won’t make the politics any simpler.</p>

</p><h3>2. Study: Gas stoves shorten lives by an average of 2 years</h3><p>
	Pollutants from gas stoves shorten people’s lives by an average of two years, according to a new study by scientists at Jaume I University in Spain. The research, which looked at households in the U.K. and EU, attributed 40,000 deaths per year in Europe to gas stoves, which leak pollutants linked to heart and lung diseases. “Way back in 1978, we first learned that NO2 pollution is many times greater in kitchens using gas than electric cookers,” lead author Juana María Delgado-Saborit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/28/pollutants-from-gas-stoves-kill-40000-europeans-each-year-report-finds?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RKvZ1JNl2Pqqa-pNGxr83NCcO9tNc-Kp6avIJT6kv857Ug8x1fZ4rE9lV1K30LjP0BExn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>The Guardian</em></a>. “But only now are we able to put a number on the amount of lives being cut short.”<br/>

Using data from the U.S. Drought Monitor, the USDA, the National Water Model, and other government agencies, the new maps can show users weekly national drought conditions ranging from 2000 to 2024. According to the maps, roughly 4% of the country is currently experiencing “exceptional drought” — which describes “widespread crop/pasture losses” and “shortages of water in reservoirs, streams, and wells [creating] water emergencies” — including parts of Montana, Texas, West Virginia, and Ohio.

According to Oxfam, the average annual carbon footprint of billionaire-owned superyachts is over 6,000 tons — “more than three times the emissions of the billionaires’ private jets,” or the equivalent of 860 years of emissions for the average person in the world.
</p><h3>5. Wildfires, industrial activities drove CO2 level to new record in 2023</h3><p>
	Globally averaged surface CO2 reached 420.0 parts per million in 2023, a new record, the World Meteorological Organization reported Monday.

The 2023 increase was higher than in 2022, which the researchers attributed to fire emissions, reduced plant carbon uptake due to extreme heat stress, and industrial activities. “These are more than just statistics,” WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo said in a statement. “Every part per million and every fraction of a degree temperature increase has a real impact on our lives and our planet.”

## California tries to woo back movie studios

date: 2024-10-28, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Movie studies have always been associated with Hollywood and sunny Southern California, but high costs have driven many companies eastward to states like New York and Georgia in recent years in search of lower costs for filming. A look at the Golden State&#8217;s recent moves, including a tax credit just passed in an attempt to revive the state&#8217;s marquee industry. Plus, why Texas&#8217;s abortion restrictions risk causing a marked decrease in OB-GYNs willing to work in the state. And, we chat with Sara Taylor, president of the consulting firm deepSee, about incivility in the workplace in a time of tense election-year politics.</p>

<p>From the BBC World Service: The Japanese yen sunk to a three-month low as investors reacted to the loss of a parliamentary majority for Japan&#8217;s ruling coalition in weekend elections. A look at how investors are thinking of the shock results, including speculation that the political uncertainty would slow interest rate rises. New research by the World Meteorological Organisation says concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are accumulating faster than at any time in human history. The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are building what they call the project of a century: Rail Baltica, which will aim to connect the region by high-speed rail.</p>

## McDonald's Quarter Pounder returns after E. coli testing rules out beef

date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — McDonald's announced Sunday that Quarter Pounders will again be on its menu at hundreds of its restaurants after testing ruled out beef patties as the source of the outbreak of E. coli poisoning tied to the popular burgers that killed one person and sickened at least 75 others across 13 states.


The U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to believe that slivered onions from a single supplier are the likely source of contamination, McDonald's said in a statement. It said it will resume selling the Quarter Pounder at affected restaurants — without slivered onions — in the coming week.


As of Friday, the outbreak had expanded to at least 75 people sick in 13 states, federal health officials said. A total of 22 people had been hospitalized, and two developed a dangerous kidney disease complication, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. One person has died in Colorado.


Early information analyzed by the FDA showed that uncooked slivered onions used on the burgers "are a likely source of contamination," the agency said. McDonald's has confirmed that Taylor Farms, a California-based produce company, was the supplier of the fresh onions used in the restaurants involved in the outbreak, and that they had come from a facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado.


McDonald's pulled the Quarter Pounder burger from menus in several states — mostly in the Midwest and Mountain states — when the outbreak was announced Tuesday. McDonald's said Friday that slivered onions from the Colorado Springs facility were distributed to approximately 900 of its restaurants, including some in transportation hubs like airports.


The company said it removed slivered onions sourced from that facility from its supply chain on Tuesday. McDonald's said it has decided to stop sourcing onions from Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility "indefinitely."


The 900 McDonald's restaurants that normally received slivered onions from Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility will resume sales of Quarter Pounders without slivered onions, McDonald's said.


Testing by the Colorado Department of Agriculture ruled out beef patties as the source of the outbreak, McDonald's said.


The Department of Agriculture received multiple lots of fresh and frozen beef patties collected from various Colorado McDonald's locations associated with the E. coli investigation. All samples were found to be negative for E. coli, the department said.


Taylor Farms said Friday that it had preemptively recalled yellow onions sent to its customers from its Colorado facility and continues to work with the CDC and the FDA as they investigate.


While it remains unclear if the recalled onions were the source of the outbreak, several other fast-food restaurants — including Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC and Burger King — pulled onions from some menus in certain areas this week.


Colorado had the most illnesses reported as of Friday, with 26 cases. At least 13 people were sickened in Montana, 11 in Nebraska, 5 each in New Mexico and Utah, 4 each in Missouri and Wyoming, two in Michigan and one each in Iowa, Kansas, Oregon, Wisconsin and Washington, the CDC reported.


McDonald's said Friday it didn't pull the Quarter Pounder from any additional restaurants and noted that some cases in states outside the original region were tied to travel.


The CDC said some people who got sick reported traveling to other states before their symptoms started. At least three people said they ate at McDonald's during their travel. Illnesses were reported between Sept. 27 and Oct. 11.


The outbreak involves infections with E. coli 0157:H7, a type of bacteria that produces a dangerous toxin. It causes about 74,000 infections in the U.S. annually, leading to more than 2,000 hospitalizations and 61 deaths each year, according to CDC.


Symptoms of E. coli poisoning can occur quickly, within a day or two of eating contaminated food. They typically include fever, vomiting, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea and signs of dehydration — little or no peeing, increased thirst and dizziness. The infection is especially dangerous for children younger than 5, people who are elderly, pregnant or who have weakened immune systems.

## Seven European countries match US in startup-friendly laws, report says

date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA

STOCKHOLM — Seven European countries have changed their laws to increase employee ownership in startups to rival the U.S. in attracting talent and investment, while other countries are lagging, a report by venture capital firm Index Ventures found.


While stock options were integral to Silicon Valley’s success, Europe has been hampered by bureaucracy and by taxing employees too early, among other restrictions.


The European Union needs a coordinated industrial policy, rapid decisions and massive investment if it wants to keep pace with the U.S. and China economically, Mario Draghi said in a long awaited report last month.


Over 500 startup CEOs and founders joined a campaign called "Not Optional" in 2019 to change rules that govern employee ownership — the practice of giving staff options to acquire a slice of the company, as European-based companies compete for talent with U.S. firms.


Germany, France, Portugal and the UK lead European countries in making changes that match or exceed those of the U.S., while Finland, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden got lower ratings in the Index report.


When companies such as Revolut and others go public, that ownership translates into real money for employees, said Martin Mignot, a partner at Index and an investor at fintech Revolut, which is valued at $45 billion.

## Missouri sports betting ballot measure highlights national debate about tax rates

date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — The ads promoting a November ballot measure to legalize sports betting in Missouri tout the potential for millions of new tax dollars devoted to schools. If voters approve the measure, it's a good bet they will see even more ads offering special promotions for bettors. 


Many of those promotional costs — in which sportsbooks provide cash-like credits for customers to place bets — will be exempt from state taxes, effectively limiting the new revenue for education. 


The Missouri ballot measure highlights an emerging debate among policymakers over how to tax the rapidly growing industry, which has spread from one state — Nevada — to 38 states and Washington, D.C., since the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to legalized sports wagering in 2018. 


"It's a fledging industry," said Brent Evans, an assistant finance professor at Georgia College & State University who has taught classes on gambling. "So nobody really knows what is a reasonable tax." 


Since authorizing sports betting, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., all have already raised or restructured their tax rates. And Colorado and Virginia have pared back the tax deductions they originally allowed. 


Tax rates range from a low of 6.75% in states such Iowa to 51% in states such as New York. That tax gap is even wider, because Iowa allows promotional bets to be deducted from taxable revenue while New York does not. 


About half the states allow tax deductions for promotional costs. It's a common way of enticing people to start — or continue — making bets. But in the short-term, it also can decrease the tax revenue available for governments and schools. 


Missouri's proposed 10% tax rate on sports betting revenue is below the national average of 19% that sportsbooks paid to states last year. Because of deductions for "free play," there could be some months in which sportsbooks owe nothing to the state. Missouri's proposed constitutional amendment acknowledges that possibility, stating that negative balances can be carried over from one month to the next until revenue rises enough to owe taxes. 


Unlike in some states, Missouri's amendment caps the amount of promotional credits that can be deducted from taxable revenue, at 25% of all wagers. But it appears unlikely that cap would come into play. An analysis conducted by consultant Eilers & Krejcik Gaming for amendment supporters projects promotional bets will comprise around 8% of total wagers in Missouri's first year of sports betting, declining after that. 


The Missouri proposal "is very much in line with what has worked and been effective in other states," said Jack Cardetti, a spokesman for Winning for Missouri Education, the group backing the measure. 


After voters narrowly approved it, Colorado launched sports betting in 2020 with a 10% tax rate and full deductions for promotional bets. It logged $2.7 billion of total bets during its first full fiscal year, yielding $8.1 million in taxes, just slightly below legislative projections. But Colorado changed its law starting in 2023 to cap promotional tax deductions at 2.5% of total bets, gradually declining to 1 .75% by July 2026. 


Colorado's sports betting tax revenue has since risen to over $30 million in its most recent fiscal year. That growth led lawmakers to place a proposal on the November ballot seeking permission for the state to keep more than the original $29 million limit on sports betting tax revenue. 


Capping tax deductions for promotional bets is a good step, said Richard Auxier, a principal policy associate at the nonprofit Tax Policy Center. But he questions why some states exempt them from taxes in the first place. 


"We don't give out free samples of cannabis when a state legalizes cannabis," Auxier said. "Is this something you want to be subsidizing through your state tax policy — to encourage people to gamble?" 


The Missouri amendment was placed on the November ballot by initiative petition after legislation to legalize sports betting repeatedly stalled in the state Senate. The $43 million campaign — a record for a Missouri ballot measure — has been been funded entirely by DraftKings and FanDuel, which dominate the nationwide sports betting marketplace. If the measure passes, the companies could apply for two statewide licenses to conduct online sports betting. The amendment authorizes additional sports betting licenses for Missouri casinos and professional sports teams. 


The $14 million opposition campaign has been funded entirely by Caesars Entertainment, which operates three of Missouri's 13 casinos. Although Caesars generally supports sports betting, it opposes "the way this measure is written," said Brooke Foster, a spokesperson for the opposition group Missourians Against the Deceptive Online Gambling Amendment. 


In some other states, sports betting is run through casinos. Though research is limited, a study of seven states released last year found that casino gambling revenue declined as online sports betting increased. 


"There will definitely be a shift from placing bets in a physical space with a Missouri incorporated casino versus hopping on an app in your living room," Foster said. 


The effect of different tax rates can be seen in Illinois and New Jersey, which spearheaded the court challenge leading to widespread legal sports betting. People in each state placed between $11.5 billion and $12 billion of sports bets last year, resulting in $1 billion of revenue for sportsbooks after winnings were paid to customers, according to figures from the American Gaming Association. 


New Jersey took in $129 million in tax revenue, based on a 14.25% tax rate for online sports bets and a 9.75% tax rate with some promotional deductions for sports bets at casinos and racetracks. Illinois took in $162 million of tax revenue — one-quarter more than New Jersey — with a 15% tax rate in most places and no promotional deductions. 


But Illinois officials weren't satisfied with those results. Beginning in July, Illinois imposed a progressive tax scale, starting with a 20% tax on sports betting revenue of less than $30 million and rising to a 40% rate on revenue exceeding $200 million. 


Some sportsbooks representatives had raised the possibility of leaving Illinois if tax rates rose. But that hasn't happened. 


There's also not much evidence that sportsbooks worsen the odds for wagers in states where they pay higher taxes, said Joe Weinert, executive vice president of Spectrum Gaming Group, a consulting firm. 


"The sports betting operators compete vigorously for bettors," he said, "and how you compete vigorously is to offer attractive odds and good promotions."

## How to prepare for potential health effects of upcoming end to daylight saving time

date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA

The good news: You will get a glorious extra hour of sleep. The bad: It'll be dark as a pocket by late afternoon for the next few months in the U.S. 


Daylight saving time ends at 2 a.m. local time next Sunday, Nov. 3, which means you should set your clock back an hour before you go to bed. Standard time will last until March 9 when we will again "spring forward" with the return of daylight saving time. 


That spring time change can be tougher on your body. Darker mornings and lighter evenings can knock your internal body clock out of whack, making it harder to fall asleep on time for weeks or longer. Studies have even found an uptick in heart attacks and strokes right after the March time change. 


"Fall back" should be easier. But it still may take a while to adjust your sleep habits, not to mention the downsides of leaving work in the dark or trying exercise while there's still enough light. Some people with seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression usually linked to the shorter days and less sunlight of fall and winter, may struggle, too. 


Some health groups, including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Sleep Medicine, have said it's time to do away with time switches and that sticking with standard time aligns better with the sun — and human biology. 


Most countries do not observe daylight saving time. For those that do — mostly in Europe and North America — the date that clocks are changed varies. 


Two states — Arizona and Hawaii — don't change and stay on standard time. 


Here's what to know about the twice yearly ritual. 


How the body reacts to light 


The brain has a master clock that is set by exposure to sunlight and darkness. This circadian rhythm is a roughly 24-hour cycle that determines when we become sleepy and when we're more alert. The patterns change with age, one reason that early-to-rise youngsters evolve into hard-to-wake teens. 


Morning light resets the rhythm. By evening, levels of a hormone called melatonin begin to surge, triggering drowsiness. Too much light in the evening — that extra hour from daylight saving time — delays that surge and the cycle gets out of sync. 


And that circadian clock affects more than sleep, also influencing things like heart rate, blood pressure, stress hormones and metabolism. 


How do time changes affect sleep? 


Even an hour change on the clock can throw off sleep schedules — because even though the clocks change, work and school start times stay the same. 


That's a problem because so many people are already sleep deprived. About 1 in 3 U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven-plus hours nightly, and more than half of U.S. teens don't get the recommended eight-plus hours on weeknights. 


Sleep deprivation is linked to heart disease, cognitive decline, obesity and numerous other problems. 


How to prepare for the time change 


Some people try to prepare for a time change jolt by changing their bed times little by little in the days before the change. There are ways to ease the adjustment, including getting more sunshine to help reset your circadian rhythm for healthful sleep. 


Will the U.S. ever get rid of the time change? 


Lawmakers occasionally propose getting rid of the time change altogether. The most prominent recent attempt, a now-stalled bipartisan bill named the Sunshine Protection Act, proposes making daylight saving time permanent. Health experts say the lawmakers have it backward — standard time should be made permanent.

## Biden marks anniversary of Pittsburgh synagogue attack that killed 11

date: 2024-10-28, from: VOA News USA

PITTSBURGH — President Joe Biden on Sunday marked the sixth anniversary of a gunman's deadly attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue and called out what he called an "appalling surge of antisemitism" amid the war in Gaza. 


The 2018 attack claimed the lives of 11 worshippers from Dor Hadash, New Light and Tree of Life congregations, which shared space in the synagogue in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. Two worshippers and five responding police officers were also injured in the attack, the deadliest act of antisemitism in U.S. history. 


Biden said in a statement that the attack "shattered families, pierced the heart of the Jewish community, and struck the soul of our nation." But he said that in the years since, the Jewish community "has also shown the country how to courageously turn pain into purpose" launching "a global initiative to counter hate and hate-fueled violence." 


Biden noted that the remembrance of the Pittsburgh synagogue attack comes weeks after the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack in Israel "during which Hamas killed more than 1,200 people, took another 250 hostage and committed horrific acts of sexual assault." 


He said the trauma and losses of Oct. 7 are made worse by "the appalling surge of antisemitism against Jews in America and around the world." 


The attack sparked a war between Israel and the militant group Hamas and has resulted in widespread destruction and civilian deaths in Gaza. 


Biden said his administration was implementing a national strategy to counter antisemitism, including securing $1.2 billion for security of nonprofits such as synagogues and Jewish community centers and day schools. He also cited the Justice Department's investigation and prosecution of antisemitic hate crimes and said his administration had "put colleges on notice that antisemitism is discrimination" and barred under laws protecting civil rights. 


Vice President Kamala Harris also cited a rise in antisemitism in a statement marking the anniversary of the Pittsburgh attack. 


"I will always work to ensure the safety and security of Jewish people in the United States and around the world and will always call out antisemitism whenever and wherever we see it," she said. 


The Pittsburgh attacker was sentenced to death last year after being convicted on 63 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death. 


In June, ground was broken for a new complex on the Pittsburgh site that is to include a cultural center, sanctuary, educational center and museum along with a memorial to the slain worshipers from three congregations.

## On Navajo Nation, push to electrify more homes on vast reservation

date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA

HALCHITA, Utah — After a five-year wait, Lorraine Black and Ricky Gillis heard the rumblings of an electrical crew reach their home on the sprawling Navajo Nation. 


In five days' time, their home would be connected to the power grid, replacing their reliance on a few solar panels and propane lanterns. No longer would the CPAP machine Gillis uses for sleep apnea or his home heart monitor transmitting information to doctors 400 miles away face interruptions due to intermittent power. It also means Black and Gillis can now use more than a few appliances — such as a fridge, a TV, and an evaporative cooling unit — at the same time. 


"We're one of the luckiest people who get to get electric," Gillis said. 




Many Navajo families still live without running water and electricity, a product of historic neglect and the struggle to get services to far-flung homes on the 70,000-square-kilometer (27,000-square-mile) Native American reservation that lies in parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Some rely on solar panels or generators, which can be patchy, and others have no electricity whatsoever. 


Gillis and Black filed an application to connect their home back in 2019. But when the coronavirus pandemic started ravaging the tribe and everything besides essential services was shut down on the reservation, it further stalled the process. 


Their wait highlights the persistent challenges in electrifying every Navajo home, even with recent injections of federal money for tribal infrastructure and services and as extreme heat in the Southwest intensified by climate change adds to the urgency. 


"We are a part of America that a lot of the time feels kind of left out," said Vircynthia Charley, district manager at the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, a non-for-profit utility that provides electric, water, wastewater, natural gas and solar energy services. 


For years, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority has worked to get more Navajo homes connected to the grid faster. Under a program called Light Up Navajo, which uses a mix of private and public funding, outside utilities from across the U.S. send electric crews to help connect homes and extend power lines. 




But installing power on the reservation roughly the size of West Virginia is time-consuming and expensive due to its rugged geography and the vast distances between homes. Drilling for power poles there can take several hours because of underground rock deposits while some homes near Monument Valley must have power lines installed underground to meet strict regulations around development in the area. 


About 32% of Navajo homes still have no electricity. Connecting the remaining 10,400 homes on the reservation would cost $416 million, said Deenise Becenti, government and public affairs manager at the utility. 


This year, Light Up Navajo connected 170 more families to the grid. Since the program started in 2019, 882 Navajo families have had their homes electrified. If the program stays funded, Becenti said it could take another 26 years to connect every home on the reservation. 


 




Those that get connected immediately reap the benefits. 


Until this month, Black and Gillis' solar panels that the utility installed a few years ago would last about two to three days before their battery drained in cloudy weather. It would take another two days to recharge. 


"You had to really watch the watts and whatever you're using on a cloudy day," Gillis said. 


Then a volunteer power crew from Colorado helped install 14 power poles while the tribal utility authority drilled holes six feet deep in which the poles would sit. The crew then ran a wire about a mile down a red sand road from the main power line to the couple's home. 


"The lights are brighter," Black remarked after her home was connected. 


In recent years, significantly more federal money has been allocated for tribes to improve infrastructure on reservations, including $32 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — of which Navajo Nation received $112 million for electric connections. The Navajo tribal utility also received $17 million through the Biden administration's climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, to connect families to the electric grid. But it can be slow to see the effects of that money on the ground due to bureaucracy and logistics. 




Next spring, the tribal utility authority hopes to connect another 150 homes, including the home of Priscilla and Leo Dan. 


For the couple, having grid electricity at their home near Navajo Mountain in Arizona would end a nearly 12-year wait. They currently live in a recreational vehicle elsewhere closer to their jobs but have worked on their home on the reservation for years. With power there, they could spend more time where Priscilla grew up and where her dad still lives. 


It would make life simpler, Priscilla said. "Because otherwise, everything, it seems like, takes twice as long to do."

## 'Venom: The Last Dance' misses projections as superhero films' grip on theaters loosens

date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA

New York — "Venom: The Last Dance" showed less bite than expected at the box office, collecting $51 million in its opening weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, significantly down from the alien symbiote franchise's previous entries.


Projections for the third "Venom" film from Sony Pictures had been closer to $65 million. More concerning, though, was the drop off from the first two "Venom" films. The 2018 original debuted with $80.2 million, while the 2021 follow-up, "Venom: Let There Be Carnage," opened with $90 million even as theaters were still in recovery mode during the pandemic.


"The Last Dance," starring Tom Hardy as a journalist who shares his body with an alien entity also voiced by Hardy, could still turn a profit for Sony. Its production budget, not accounting for promotion and marketing, was about $120 million — significantly less than most comic-book films.


But "The Last Dance" is also performing better overseas. Internationally, "Venom: The Last Dance" collected $124 million over the weekend, including $46 million over five days of release in China. That's good enough for one of the best international weekends of the year for a Hollywood release.


Still, neither reviews (36% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audience scores (a franchise-low "B-" CinemaScore) have been good for the film scripted by Kelly Marcel and Hardy, and directed by Marcel.


The low weekend for "Venom: The Last Dance" also likely insures that superhero films will see their lowest-grossing year in a dozen years, not counting the pandemic year of 2020, according to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment.


Following on the heels of the "Joker: Folie à Deux" flop, Gross estimates that 2024 superhero films will gross about $2.25 billion worldwide. The only upcoming entry is Marvel's "Kraven the Hunter," due out Dec. 13. Even with the $1.3 billion of "Deadpool & Wolverine," the genre hasn't, overall, been dominating the way it once did. In 2018, for example, superhero films accounted for more than $7 billion in global ticket sales.


Last week's top film, the Paramount Pictures horror sequel "Smile 2," dropped to second place with $9.4 million. That brings its two-week total to $83.7 million worldwide.


The weekend's biggest success story might have been "Conclave," the papal thriller starring Ralph Fiennes and directed by Edward Berger ("All Quiet on the Western Front"). The Focus Features release, a major Oscar contender, launched with $6.5 million in 1,753 theaters.


That put "Conclave" into third place, making it the rare adult-oriented drama to make a mark theatrically. Some 77% of ticket buyers were over the age of 35, Focus said. With a strong opening and stellar reviews, "Conclave" could continue to gather momentum both with moviegoers and Oscar voters.


Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.


1. "Venom: The Last Dance," $51 million.


2. "Smile 2," $9.4 million.


3. "Conclave," $6.5 million.


4. "The Wild Robot," $6.5 million.


5. "We Live in Time," $4.8 million.


6. "Terrifier 3," $4.3 million.


7. "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice," $3.2 million.


8. "Anora," $867,142.


9. "Piece by Piece," $720,000.


10. "Transformers One," $720,000.

Yahya Sinwar's death won't end the Israel-Hamas war. But Sinwar's demise offers a chance to achieve the release of the remaining Israeli hostages, closes the first act of the war, and sets up what comes next.

## What is GivingTuesday? Annual day of charitable giving approaches

date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA

Since it started as a hashtag in 2012, GivingTuesday, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, has become one of the biggest fundraising days of the year for nonprofits in the U.S.


In 2022 and 2023, GivingTuesday raised $3.1 billion for charitable organizations, according to estimates from GivingTuesday.


This year, GivingTuesday is on December 3.


How did GivingTuesday start?


The #GivingTuesday hashtag started as a project of the 92nd Street Y in New York in 2012 and became an independent organization in 2020. It's grown into a worldwide network of local organizations that promote giving in their communities, often on different dates that have local relevance, such as holidays.


Now, GivingTuesday, the nonprofit, also convenes researchers working on topics about everyday giving. It collects data from a wide range of sources such as payment processors, crowdfunding sites, employee giving software and institutions that offer donor-advised funds, a kind of charitable-giving account.


What is the purpose of GivingTuesday?


The hashtag was started to promote generosity, and the nonprofit continues to promote giving in the broadest sense.


For nonprofits, the point of GivingTuesday is to raise money and engage their supporters. Many will be familiar with the barrage of email and mail appeals that coincide on the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. Essentially all major American nonprofits will organize fundraising campaigns, and many smaller, local groups also participate.


Nonprofits don't have to be affiliated in any way with GivingTuesday, the organization, to run a fundraising campaign. They can just do it, although GivingTuesday does provide graphics and advice. In that way, it remains a grassroots effort with groups and donors participating however they like.


Has GivingTuesday been successful?


That depends on how success is measured, but it certainly has grown far beyond the initial effort to promote giving on social media. The day has become an enduring and well-known event that seeks to center charitable giving, volunteering and civic participation in the United States and around the world.


For years, GivingTuesday has been a major focus of fundraising for nonprofits, with many seeking to organize matching donations from major donors and leverage their networks of supporters to contribute. It is the beginning of the end-of-year fundraising rush, as nonprofits seek to reach their budget targets for the following year.


Donations on GivingTuesday in 2022 and 2023 reached $3.1 billion, an increase from $2.7 billion in 2021. While that’s a lot to raise in a single day, the trend last year was flat and with fewer donors giving, which the organization said is a worrying sign.

## Unpacking America's urban-rural divide

date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA

The divide between urban and rural voters is a key indicator in U.S. electoral politics. Cities favoring Democrats and rural areas favoring Republicans isn’t new. But since 2000, the gap has grown dramatically. What is behind this trend, and why is it so important? The answer is partly economic — but there are also complex cultural factors involved. Produced by Yass Monem and Nicky Woolf.

## NASA astronaut released from hospital after return from space station

date: 2024-10-27, from: VOA News USA

washington — A NASA astronaut who was hospitalized upon return from the International Space Station for an unspecified medical condition was released Saturday in "good health," the U.S. space agency said. 


The four-member Crew-8 mission splashed down off the coast of Florida early Friday after nearly eight months aboard the orbital laboratory.   


NASA did not reveal which of the astronauts was hospitalized nor the reason, citing medical privacy.   


However, it said in a blog post that the crew member has returned to the Johnson Space Center in Houston "in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members."   


On its way back to Earth, the SpaceX Dragon executed a normal re-entry and splashdown, and recovery of the crew and spacecraft was without incident, NASA said.   


But during routine medical assessments on the recovery ship, an "additional evaluation of the crew members was requested out of an abundance of caution," it added, without elaborating. 


NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were all flown to Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola.   


Three were subsequently released, while one remained at the hospital "under observation as a precautionary measure."
