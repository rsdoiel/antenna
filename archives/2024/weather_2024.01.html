Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1238 PM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

No changes to the ongoing forecast. Dry and windy conditions are
probable across parts of South Texas during the late afternoon and
persisting into the evening. Poor fuel receptiveness and strong cold
air advection behind the cold front should limit the overall fire
weather concerns, however.

..Wendt.. 01/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024/

...Synopsis...
An intense upper-level trough and surface low are forecast to
amplify further as they move eastward across the south-central CONUS
D2/Monday. In the wake of the low, a strong cold front will move
eastward ushering in a windy, but much colder air mass. A few hours
of dry and windy conditions are possible over parts of West TX.

...West TX...
As the upper trough and surface low continue to intensify over the
Southern Plains, low-level winds are expected to increase across the
TX Trans Pecos region through much of D2/Monday. Strong pressure
gradients behind the low will aid downslope gusts of 25-35 mph.
Coincident with the increasing winds, a dry low-level air mass with
RH values below 25% is possible. A few hours of elevated
meteorological conditions may develop in the afternoon. With strong
winds and areas of low humidity potentially overlapping ahead of the
cooler air mass, elevated fire-weather conditions are a possibility,
for a few hours, despite modest fuel availability.

Mesoscale Discussion 0010
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1116 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Areas affected...Portions of Southern New England

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 071716Z - 072015Z

SUMMARY...Moderate to heavy snow expected through the afternoon with
rain transitioning to snow near the coast.

DISCUSSION...Snow is intensifying across portions of southern New
England as the surface low intensifies over the Atlantic and
low-level wind fields strengthen. Snowfall rates of 1 to perhaps 2
inches per hour are expected through the afternoon before moving
offshore by this evening. Areas near the coast which have been
mostly rain thus far due to winds off the ocean will transition to
snow in the next few hours as winds shift more northerly as the
cyclone deepens/moves east. In addition, sustained winds around 15
mph with gusts of 25 to 30 mph may lead to some blowing and drifting
snow and additional visibility restrictions through the afternoon.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CENTRAL GULF COAST OVERNIGHT MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of strong wind gusts and tornadoes are
expected from southeast Texas across the central Gulf Coast and from
Monday afternoon into early Tuesday morning. Greatest severe
potential is anticipated overnight from southeast Louisiana across
southern Mississippi and southern Alabama, and into the western
Florida Panhandle.

...Synopsis...
Shortwave trough currently extending from Great Basin through the
northern Baja Peninsula is forecast to move eastward today while
intensifying. By 12Z Monday morning this shortwave will likely have
matured into a mid-latitude cyclone centered over northeast NM, with
an extensive belt of strong mid-level flow throughout its southern
periphery. This cyclone is then expected to evolve eastward across
the TX Panhandle and OK throughout the day, with mid-level flow
strengthening considerably throughout its eastern periphery. By
Monday evening, 100+ kt at 500-mb will likely stretch from the
Edwards Plateau into the Ozark Plateau. Further strengthening of
this mid-level flow is anticipated overnight Monday as the cyclone
tracks a bit more northeastward, ending the period over western MO.
Intense low-level flow will accompany this cyclone as well, with a
large area of 50+ kt over the southern Plains early Monday. This
low-level jet will shift eastward throughout the day and overnight,
while gradually strengthening. By early Tuesday morning, 60+ kt
850-mb flow will cover much of the Southeast, with 70+ kt possible
from northern MS into middle TN and northern AL. 

Previous frontal intrusion (evidenced by the cold and dry conditions
over the southern Plains and Southeast Sunday) will limit the
northern extent of the moisture return and associated
severe-thunderstorm potential. General expectation is for secondary
surface cyclogenesis over central TX Monday morning, with the
primary low well to the north over the TX/OK Panhandles. This
secondary low (and associated warm front) should delineate the
northern extent of the severe potential as it gradually moves
eastward across central portions of east TX and into central LA
Monday afternoon and evening. This low is forecast to continue
eastward overnight Monday into early Tuesday, progressing across
central MS and AL. Severe thunderstorms are expected within the warm
sector ahead of this low, as well as along the associated cold front
as it surges eastward.

...North TX Early Monday...
As the strong mid-level flow associated with the cyclone moves into
southern Plains, a fast-moving line of showers and embedded
thunderstorms is expected to move across north TX early Monday
morning. Forecast soundings show very weak thermodynamics, limiting
overall updraft strength and duration. However, given the strong low
and upper level support, a narrow-line of forced convection may
become capable of locally gusty/damaging wind gusts as it moves
eastward.

...TX Coastal Plain/Southeast TX into southwest LA Monday Afternoon
and Evening...
Two rounds of strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across the
region Monday, with the first round likely beginning early Monday
afternoon as the warm sector moves into the region. Current guidance
suggests this warm sector will be characterized by temperatures in
the low 70s, dewpoints in the upper 60s, and moderate buoyancy.
However, given the prevalence of cloud cover and early period
showers, there is uncertainty regarding if temperatures can reach
the low 70s. If they do, some surface-based supercells capable of
all severe hazards, including tornadoes are possible. If
temperatures stay in the 60s, low-level stability would likely
inhibit surface-based storm development, mitigating the severe
potential. Consensus within the guidance has trended towards warmer
temperatures and tornado probabilities were increased across the
region as a result. A further increase in probabilities may be
needed in later outlooks if confidence in surface-based storms
increases.

Additional thunderstorm development is anticipated along the front
as it moves through, but the strength of these storms will be
predicated on coverage and strength of any warm sector development.
Strong wind gusts would be the primary severe risk with this
convective line.  

...Central Gulf Coast Overnight Monday into Tuesday Morning...
As the surface low continues eastward, a convective line is expected
to mature along the cold front as it encounters a moderately moist
and buoyant airmass and increasingly strong low-level flow. As the
line matures, it will likely transition from a more parallel
stratiform structure to a more organized leading-line, trailing
stratiform configuration. Robust low-level kinematics, characterized
by 50-60 kt just above the surface and 500+ m2/s2 of 0-3 km SRH,
suggest both significant-severe gusts and strong QLCS tornadoes are
possible.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1033 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 01/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024/

...Synopsis...
An amplified and progressive mid-level flow pattern will persist
over the CONUS as a Pacific trough is forecast to rapidly deepen
over parts of the western US before ejecting eastward over the
southern Plains. In response, a strong lee low will develop,
supporting gusty winds across parts of West TX. However, cool
temperatures and widespread recent precipitation should limit
fire-weather concerns.

...Texas Trans Pecos...
As the upper trough and surface low move across the southern Plains,
strong southerly winds and pockets of lower humidity are possible
over parts of West TX and southern NM. Gusts of 25-35 mph and RH
values below 20% are possible over a minima in recent precipitation.
Elevated to critical meteorological conditions are possible in parts
of southern New Mexico into the Trans-Pecos. However, unreceptive
fuels are not expected to support widespread concerns.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1015 AM CST Sun Jan 07 2024

Valid 071630Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE TONIGHT
OVER PORTIONS OF WESTERN NORTH TEXAS AND SOUTHWEST OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong storms capable of gusty/damaging winds are possible
late tonight over portions of western north Texas and southwest
Oklahoma.

...TX/OK...
A vigorous shortwave trough currently over southern NV will
amplify/deepen tonight as it digs into the southern Rockies. 
Meanwhile, an intense southerly low-level jet will develop ahead of
the system over TX, resulting in enhanced low-level warm advection
and lift - along with weak destabilization.  The result will likely
be the development of a line of fast-moving showers and
thunderstorms after midnight over parts of west TX and southwest OK.
 Forecast soundings show very weak thermodynamics, suggesting the
updraft strength will be modest.  However, given the strong low and
upper level support, a narrow-line of forced convection may become
capable of locally gusty/damaging wind gusts (mainly 09-12z).
