I updated the <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">docs</a> this morning to include very basic getting started stuff, and it now includes a link to a form where you can apply to be a tester. At this time it's limited to people who know how to write a bug report, how to find and read the JavaScript console in a web browser, and take a screen shot that shows clearly what went wrong. This the hardest part of getting a product fit for general use, and I'm too old to try to wrangle workable bug reports from well-intentioned users who basically aren't scientists. This time I'm determined to do this the right way without excess wear and tear on me. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

date: 2024-12-02, updated: 2024-11-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>I recently <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/11/new-ios-security-feature-makes-it-harder-for-police-to-unlock-seized-phones.html">wrote about</a> the new iOS feature that forces an iPhone to reboot after it&#8217;s been inactive for a longish period of time.</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="https://naehrdine.blogspot.com/2024/11/reverse-engineering-ios-18-inactivity.html">technical details</a>, discovered through reverse engineering. The feature triggers after seventy-two hours of inactivity, even it is remains connected to Wi-Fi.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I'm using the term "RSS-based podcasts" in place of "podcasts" to make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other "podcasts," are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube et al to just connect their "podcasts" to RSS and everyone's happy. Like "organic cheeseburgers." :-)

Sometimes shows are done, but the archive contains good stuff. Not everything is based on current events. Music, art, history for example. Also bring the feed out from hiding. At least the nerdy people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds. I like to be able to lift the hood even if I don't understand what I'm looking at.

## Ok fine, I admit 3D printing is actually amazing

date: 2024-12-01, from: Matt Haughey blog

<p>I remember when the first wave of 3D printers morphed into consumer products, somewhere around 2009 with Makerbot being a thing finally within reach of mere mortals. But I remember them as extremely finicky, where you had to print out half the parts to make the rest of it once</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads. Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too, since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you do it, I wouldn't announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.

Welcome to the last month of <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> in the year 2024. Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time, there's less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my todo list, but I'm making progress. As someone once said many times: Still diggin!

## What is the impact of online writing?

date: 2024-12-01, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

What&#8217;s special about online writing? Blog posts, microblog posts, email newsletters, social media posts, comments &#8212; these are self-published pieces of writing by regular people, most of whom are not getting paid to write. Most people would have had limited access to this type of writing fifty years ago, when self-published writing was zines and, [&#8230;]

Cas Mudde, a political scientist who specializes in extremism and democracy, observed yesterday on Bluesky that &#8220;the fight against the far right is secondary to the fight to strengthen liberal democracy.&#8221; That&#8217;s a smart observation.
