## Detecting Pegasus Infections

date: 2024-12-06, updated: 2024-12-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/">This tool</a> seems to do a pretty good job.</p>
<blockquote><p>The company&#8217;s Mobile Threat Hunting feature uses a combination of malware signature-based detection, heuristics, and machine learning to look for anomalies in iOS and Android device activity or telltale signs of spyware infection. For paying iVerify customers, the tool regularly checks devices for potential compromise. But the company also offers a free version of the feature for anyone who downloads the iVerify Basics app for $1. These users can walk through steps to generate and send a special diagnostic utility file to iVerify and receive analysis within hours. Free users can use the tool once a month. iVerify&#8217;s infrastructure is built to be privacy-preserving, but to run the Mobile Threat Hunting feature, users must enter an email address so the company has a way to contact them if a scan turns up spyware&#8212;as it did in the seven recent Pegasus discoveries...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-12-02 Rollenspieladvent: Das Rollenspielsetting

date: 2024-12-05, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-12-02-rollenspieladvent-das-rollenspielsetting">2024-12-02 Rollenspieladvent: Das Rollenspielsetting</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@HeyeBodo" title="@HeyeBodo@rollenspiel.social">@HeyeBodo</a> stellt auf fedi jeden Tag eine Frage zum Rollenspielsetting. Die darf man dann beantworten. Da ich schon lange nichts mehr auf Deutsch hier auf dem Blog geschrieben habe, werde ich die Gelegenheit wahrnehmen, das hier zu tun. Allerdings habe ich vor, alles auf dieser Seite zu sammeln. Das wird f√ºr die Leser, die dem Blog via einem Feed folgen, wahrscheinlich etwas seltsam, denn heute gibt es nur Antworten auf die ersten zwei Tage. Mir f√§llt leider auch keine andere L√∂sung ein, denn irgendwie will ich auch nicht jeden Tag eine Seite schreiben.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23RSP">#RSP</a></p>

<h2 id="welchen-geografischen-ma√üstab-hat-oder-strebst-du-f√ºr-dein-setting-an">Welchen geografischen Ma√üstab hat oder strebst Du f√ºr Dein Setting an?</h2>

<p>Eine typische Karte, wie ich sie vorbereiten w√ºrde, ist von Ost nach West ca. 30 Tagesreisen breit und von Nord nach S√ºd ca. 10‚Äì20 Tagesreisen hoch. Das sieht √§sthetisch gut aus, bietet Platz f√ºr ein paar St√§dte, Magiert√ºrme, Monsterlager, Bauernh√∂fe, versteckte Siedlungen, und so weiter. Ein paar Seen, ein oder zwei Gebirge mit P√§ssen und Handelsrouten, viele Fl√ºsse. Ich weigere mich, eine genau Gr√∂sse anzugeben und behaupte einfach, ein Feld auf der Karte ist eine Tagesreise. Wenn es keine Wege gibt, behaupte ich manchmal, dass eine Tagesreise vielleicht nur 5‚Äì10km sind. Klar kann man als trainierter Legion√§r auf einer r√∂mischen Strasse vielleicht ab und zu einen 50km Marsch machen, oder 30km weit ziehen, aber in einem Tal, wo die Talw√§nde steil und von B√§chen zerkl√ºftet sind, wo der Talboden versumpft und wild ist, wo das Wasser √ºberall steht und fliesst, das Unterholz im Wald dicht ist, weil die Wisente immer wieder Lichtungen reissen und es keine richtige Forstwirtschaft gibt, kann ich mir nicht vorstellen, dass Leute mit 20‚Äì30kg Ausr√ºstung pro Person mehr als ein paar Kilometer weit kommen. Ich schliesse da von mir auf andere. üòÖ</p>

<p>Und damit kommen wir zum n√§chsten Thema, angenommen, ein Feld ist 10km und dann ist eine Karte von 30√ó20 ungef√§hr so gross wie die ganze Schweiz.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Die Ausdehnung der Schweiz betr√§gt von Norden nach S√ºden 220km und von Osten nach Westen 348km. ‚Ä¶ Die Schweiz gliedert sich in drei geografische Zonen: die Alpen mit einem Anteil von etwa 58% der Gesamtfl√§che, das Mittelland mit rund 31% und der Jura mit 11%. 48 Schweizer Berge sind √ºber 4000 m hoch.  Obwohl Gebirge insgesamt 70% des Staatsgebietes einnehmen, lebt in diesem Gebiet nur ein Viertel der Bev√∂lkerung. &ndash; <a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/de/home/umwelt/geografie/geografie---fakten-und-zahlen.html">Geografie ‚Äì Fakten und Zahlen</a>, Eidgen√∂ssisches Departement f√ºr
ausw√§rtige Angelegenheiten (EDA)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In diesem Gebiet gibt es 26 Kantone und entsprechend 26 gr√∂ssere Orte und ein Vielfaches an Burgen. An jedem Talausgang hat es eine Burg. In gr√∂sseren T√§lern hat es mehrere Burgen. Wenn wir jetzt von 30√ó20 Feldern ausgehen, von denen 58% Gebirge sind, bleiben 348 Felder f√ºr die 26 Kantone oder im Durchschnitt 13 Felder pro Kanton.</p>

<p>Jetzt bin ich selber √ºberrascht, wie √ºberdimensioniert und leer meine Karten sind. Da muss viel, viel mehr rein!</p>

<h2 id="wovon-ist-dein-setting-inspiriert">Wovon ist Dein Setting inspiriert?</h2>

<p>Meine Welt ist vor allem von der Umwelt inspiriert, in der ich lebe. Die Berge, T√§ler und H√ºgel, in denen ich selber herumlaufe, inspirieren mich f√ºr mein Spiel. Ich versuche nat√ºrlich mir vorzustellen, wie es fr√ºher aussah, vor den Flussbegradigungen, vor der Trockenlegung der S√ºmpfe, vor dem Strassenbau. Und somit ist klar, dass all diese Vorstellungen aus der Vergangenheit irgendwie kollidieren und kollabieren m√ºssen. Das Resultat ist unrealistisch und weltfremd, und doch vertraut genug.</p>

<p>Die Monster und Menschen sind in vielem wohl von Conan und dem Herr der Ringe bestimmt. Die Elfen sind eher keine Elben, sondern irgendwo zwischen der Elfenwelt und Elric von Melnibon√© angesiedelt; die Orks irgendwo zwischen Mordor und Skyrim; die Halblinge bei den Hobbits; die Goblins in Moria; die B√§ume in Fangorn; die G√∂tter stammen aus der nordischen Tradition (Odin, Thor, Loki), aber auch aus dem Zweistromland (Ishtar, Marduk, Pazuzu), Griechenland (Hekate) oder aus √Ñgypten (Thot, Ra, Set), aus Hyperborea (ebenfalls Set) und aus D&amp;D (Orcus).</p>

<h2 id="wie-w√ºrdest-du-den-technologischen-entwicklungsstand-innerhalb-deines-settings-beschreiben">Wie w√ºrdest Du den technologischen Entwicklungsstand innerhalb Deines Settings beschreiben?</h2>

<p>In meiner Fantasy gibt es abgest√ºrzte Raumschiffe, Laserpistolen, Pistolen, Gewehre, Astralsegler, fliegende Schiffe, und so weiter, aber ungleich verteilt. Aus Sicht der Spielenden ist ein Plattenpanzer mit Schild die beste R√ºstung. Hochwertige R√ºstungen gibt es, doch dann sind es Prunkst√ºcke, die mehr kosten, aber nicht mehr n√ºtzen. Fantastische Technologie gibt es im Rahmen von &ldquo;Golem R√ºstungen&rdquo;, die dann einem Plattenpanzer +2 und Schild +2 entsprechen und mit einer passenden Energiequelle dann zu Plattenpanzer +4 und Schild +4 gesteigert werden k√∂nnten. Ich kann mich allerdings nicht erinnern, dass dies jemand am Tisch je geschafft hat. Die Laserpistolen sind sehr einfach gehalten: Ein Schuss macht 1W6 Schaden wie eine Schusswaffe, Trefferwurf normal durch Geschicklichkeit beeinflusst, Nachladen unn√∂tig. Schaden liegt in der Gr√∂ssenordnung von einem magischen Geschoss. Eine Plasmakanone funktioniert wie ein Bitzschlag und und macht 5W6 Schaden entlang einer Linie, ein Granatwerfer wie ein Feuerball und macht 5W6 Schaden im Zielgebiet, Rettungswurf gegen Drachenodem f√ºr halben Schaden. Das k√∂nnten genau so gut Zauberst√§be mit Ladungen sein. So l√§sst sich alles entweder mit Technik oder Magie erkl√§ren und es macht keinen grossen Unterschied, da es die Rolle eines Technikers f√ºr die Spielenden nicht als Klasse gibt. In dem Sinne ist alle Technik verloren gegangene und wiederentdeckte Technik, die nicht wirklich beherrscht ist, die wie Magie verwendet wird.</p>

<p>Auch die Zeitgeschichte ist mir egal. Bei aller Technologie von Waffen, R√ºstungen, Schiffstypen, Sprengk√∂rpern und so weiter wird frisch und fr√∂hlich durcheinander gemischt. Die technologischen Unterschiede von Hopliten und Conquistadores, zwischen Kataphrakten und Rittern, zwischen Skythen, Mongolen und Hunnen, zwischen Vikingern und Reisl√§ufern, Landsknechten und Legion√§ren interessiert mich nicht richtig.</p>

<p>Gespielt wird in einer Fantasiewelt, in der man keinen Sprengstoff und kein Pulver kaufen kann. Die Schiffe sind aus Holz und von Segelkraft betrieben. Kohleindustrie und Stahlindustrie gibt es nicht, also gibt es keine Schiesswaffen und kein Dampfmaschinen, also auch keine Eisenbahn, keinen Zeppelin, kein Flugzeug. Es gibt keinen Wilden Westen, kein kolonialen Weltreiche, kein Zeitalter der Entdeckungen. In diesem Sinne ist auch der Kapitalismus als &ldquo;Finanztechnologie&rdquo; nicht entdeckt.</p>

<h2 id="was-ist-in-deinem-setting-unter-einem-monster-zu-verstehen">Was ist in  Deinem Setting unter einem ‚ÄûMonster‚Äú zu verstehen?</h2>

<p>In den D&amp;D-artigen Spielen vermischen sich Dinge: Auf der einen Seite sind Monster Konsequenzen f√ºr soziale R√§tsel, wo es um etwas geht, weil die Gewaltbereitschaft der Gegner allen Gespr√§chen, so lustig und gebl√∂delt sie auch daherkommen, jeder Zeit in Mord und Totschlag umschlagen k√∂nnen. Bildlich sind diese Monster menschen√§hnlich, damit auch geredet werden kann. √úberhaupt ist mir wichtig, dass die Monster reden wollen. Ich tendiere dazu, Regeln zu ignorieren, die das erschweren.</p>

<p>Die zweite Sorte Monster sind Monster, die den Mainstreamalptr√§umen entspringen. Kraken, Spinnen, W√ºrmer. Hier gibt es alles von K√∂rperhorror, Gestaltwandlern, Chim√§ren, Fleischmagie und mehr. Hier gibt es auch Zwischenstufen. Auch diese Monster reden, aber es unterstreicht mehr den Alptraum. Wovon reden denn Harpyien, Ghule, Matikore und Trolle ausser vom ewigen Leben und wie alles verflucht ist? Hier gibt es dann auch eine Traumlogik, wo man nicht immer eine rationale Diskussion f√ºhren kann.</p>

<p>Wenn ich Traveller spiele, dann sind die erste Sorte Monster immer Menschen und die zweite Sorte Monster immer Maschinen oder Institution, Organisationen, Firmen, Staaten, Prozesse, Gerichte, Polizei und Milit√§r ‚Äì auch hier geht es ins Alptraum-artige: Hoffnungslosigkeit, lange Zeitr√§ume, unmenschliche Bedingungen, Entfernungen, Zeiten, kafkaeske Komplikationen, faschistisches Gedankengut, Gewaltspiralen, Krieg ‚Äì das sind die Alptr√§ume, mit denen man nicht mehr rational diskutieren kann, weil die Gegenseite auch kein menschliches Wertevers√§ndnis mehr hat.</p>

<h2 id="welche-konflikte-gibt-es-in-deinem-setting">Welche Konflikte gibt es in Deinem Setting?</h2>

<p>Meistens hat es latente Kolonialsituation oder soziale Ungerechtigkeit, sei es die Feudalherrschaft, Theokratie, Plutokratie, Kleptokratie oder √§hnliche Konflikte. Das sind verh√§rtete Fronten, welche nur mit einer grossen Kampagne umgestossen werden k√∂nnen ‚Äì und das soll man auch d√ºrfen aber auch lassen d√ºrfen. Wenn es einen Krieg gibt, dann ist er weit weg und man sieht nur die Fl√ºchtenden, Desertierenden, Maraudierenden, das Elend und die Verzweiflung aus der Ferne.</p>

<p>Wenn der Krieg zu aktiv ist, dann entsteht der Wunsch, einzugreifen und Einfluss auf Schlachten und Ereignisse zu haben, als sei man Hauptfigur in einem Film. Aber so will ich das fast nie spielen. Also braucht es eine angespannte Lage, die aber ohne Einflussnahme der Spieler statisch bleibt. Nur so kann ich eine Sandbox leiten. Wenn wir dann mal 30 Spielabende gespielt haben, darf es √Ñnderungen geben, vielleicht eine Massenschlacht, eine √Ñnderung der Machtverh√§ltnisse. Aber der Krieg selber steht nicht im Zentrum des Spiels.</p>

Aggregate all the shows from all the feeds in a list into a single feed. This seems brilliant because it reduces the implementation in the client to almost nothing, just rebuild a feed periodically, it could be done entirely in the client app. But it also could be something users could share with other users, sort of a meta-channel. I think it's brilliant with the caveat that sometimes when you implement it you find something that makes it more complex than it seems at first. This is the second idea I've heard that the initial listening lists idea spawned. I think there's a lot of unexplored possibilities here.

## AmpereOne: Cores are the new MHz

## Raw Computer Power (with apologies to Guy Kewney)

date: 2024-12-05, from: Liam on Linux

First Unix box I ever touched, in my first job, here on the Isle of Man 36Y ago.<br /><br />It was a demo machine, but my employers, CSL Delta, never sold any AFAIK. It sat there, running but unused, all day every day. Our one had a mono text display on it, and no graphics ability that I know of.<br /><br />I played around, I wrote "Hello, world!" in C and compiled it and it took me a while to find that the result wasn't called "hello" or "hello.exe" or anything but "a.out".<br /><br />If I had the knowledge then, I'd have written a Mandelbrot generator or something and had it sit there cranking them out -- but I was not skilled enough. It was not networked to our office network, but it had a synchronous modem allowing it to access some IBM online service which we used to look up tech support info.<br /><br />Synchronous modem comms, or serial comms, are very different indeed to the familiar Unix asynchronous serial comms used on RS-232 connections for terminals and things. Sync comms are a mainframe thing, more than a microcomputer thing.<br /><br /><a href="https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Asynchronous_vs_Sy">https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Asynchronous_vs_Sy</a>...<br /><br />That modem was a very specialised bit of kit that cost more than a whole PC -- when PCs cost many thousands each -- and it couldn't talk to anything else except remote IBM mainframes, basically.<br /><br />The RT/PC felt more powerful than a high-end IBM PC compatible of the time, but only marginally. It had a bit of the feeling of Windows NT about 6-7 years later: when you were typing away and you did something demanding, the hard disk cranked up and you could hear, and even feel the vibrations, that the machine was working hard, but it stayed responding to you the same as ever. It's a bit hard to describe because all modern OSes work like this, but it was not normal in the 1980s.<br /><br />Then, OSes didn't multitask or they did it badly, and things like hard disk controllers of the time took over the CPU completely when reading or writing. So on MS-DOS, or PC-DOS or OS/2 1.x or DR Concurrent DOS, when you typed commands or interacted with programs, the computer responded right away as fast as it could. But if you gave a command that made the machine work hard, like asked for a print preview or a spell-check of a multi-page document, or sorted a spreadsheet of thousands of rows, or asked it to draw a graph from hundreds of points of data, the computer locked up on you. The hard disks span up, you heard the read/write heads chattering away as it worked, but it was no longer listening to you and anything you pressed or typed was lost. Or, worse, buffered, and when it was done, then it tried to do those commands, and quite possibly did something very much not what you wanted, like deleted loads of work.<br /><br />(Decades later something similar happened with cooling fans, and now that's going away too. But with hearing the fans spin up, there's a hysteresis: it takes time, and tens of billions of CPU cycles, for the CPU to heat up, so the fans come on later, and maybe stay on for a while after it's done. A PC locking up as the hard disk went crazy was immediate.)<br /><br />The RT/PC was a Unix box. It didn't do that. No idea how much RAM or disk ours had: maybe 4MB if that, perhaps 100-200MB disk. A lot for 1988! But if I did, say,<br /><br />cd / ls -laR<br /><br />... then it would sit there for several minutes with the HDD chuntering away, listing files to screen... but what was remarkable was that you could switch to another virtual console and it stayed perfectly responsive as if nothing were happening. That hard disk was SCSI of course, so it didn't use loads of CPU under heavy disk load.<br /><br />The machine always felt a little slower, a little less responsive than DOS, but it never slowed down even when working hard. You had the feeling of sitting behind the wheel of a Rolls Royce with some massive engine there, but pulling a massive weight, so it didn't accelerate or brake fast, but could just keep accelerating slowly and steadily 'til you ran out of road... and you'd make an impressively large crater.<br /><br />We sold a lot of IBM PS/2 machines with Xenix, and it was a Unix too and felt the same... but limited by the puny I/O buses of even high-end 1980s IBM PS/2 kit, so it sssslllloooowwwweeeedddd way down doing that big directory listing.<br /><br />Whereas contemporary PC OSes responded quicker but just locked up when working hard. This included Windows 2, 3.x, 95, 98 and ME, and also OS/2 1.x, 2.x, and Warp. The kernels did not support multithreading and background I/O very well, so it didn't matter that the hardware didn't either.<br /><br />Then Windows NT 4.0 came along, and it did. Suddenly the hardware mattered. But if you had a Pentium 1 machine, with an Intel Triton chipset on the motherboard, there was an innocent looking driver floppy in the box. On that was a busmastering DMA driver for the Intel PIIX EIDE controller. Install it on Win9x and it could see a CD-ROM on the PATA bus. Handy but not world-shattering.<br /><br />Install it on an NT machine and once the kernel booted, the sound of the hard disk changed because the kernel was now using busmastering to load stuff from disk into RAM. As the machine booted the mouse pointer kept moving smoothly, with no jerkiness. When the login screen appeared it blinked onto the screen and you could press Ctrl-Alt-Del and start typing and your username appeared slowly but smoothly. The stars representing your password, the same.<br /><br />It suddenly had that "massive computer power being used to keep the machine responsive" feeling of an RT/PC the decade before. Like that PIIX driver had made the machine's ¬£100 cheapo IDE disk into a ¬£400 SCSI disk.<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=93060" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

I frequently have trouble remembering the names of things I want to use in my writing. I've come to rely on ChatGPT for help. So I <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/674f36d9-9990-8012-8971-a2019ac8808b">wrote</a> to ChatGPT: "I'm trying to remember the name of the stone that has the key to understanding a language." To which it replied: "You're likely thinking of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>. It was crucial in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs because it featured the same text written in three scripts: Greek, Demotic, and hieroglyphic. The Greek text provided the key to understanding the other two scripts."

## We need a BDG for Bluesky

date: 2024-12-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I was very happy to see <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfefferle.org/post/3lcfkqqlcfk2j">this post</a> on Bluesky this morning from a friend, Matthias Pfefferle, who works at Automattic on the connection between WordPress and ActivityPub. </p>
<p>In his post he asks if there is a BDG for creating a PDS for Bluesky. </p>
<p>A BDG is a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+busy+developer%27s+guide">Busy Developer's Guide</a>, something we did <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041009205034/http://www.soapware.org/bdg">first</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html">for SOAP</a> in 2001 when we were trying to figure out how to map <a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> onto it.  Since then there have been lots of BDGs for all kinds of things. It's a useful concept because developers are often overly busy, so we need to get right to the problem before understanding all the theory behind it. We need an example that works, and we'll just do what it does. That also guarantees interop, which is the point of course. </p>
<p>Now we have a similar problem. Bluesky stores a user's writing in a PDS. If we can generate a PDS for our blogs, theoretically Bluesky should be able to see them and use them as if they were created inside Bluesky. If it were easy to understand we could get busy converting everything so it works there. We can do that because we're using popular simple formats like JSON (see below) to organize our work. </p>
<p>For example this is how I use JSON for my blog, the one you're reading right now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items">folder</a> in a repository on GitHub. Broken down into <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020">years</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07">months</a>, <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/items/2020/07/18">days</a>, and posts. </li>
<li>Each post is a JSON file, <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2019/03/03/a025810.json">like this</a>. It has three bits of data, the text of the post, when it was created (which also serves as a unique ID, no two posts have the same creation date) and type. This item has a type of outline, because it can have structure, though this post does not. </li>
<li>Here's <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/blog/items/2022/07/06/a232835.json">another post</a> that does have structure. In Bluesky it would be represented as a thread. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the question. What's the absolutely simplest way to have that structure of posts represented in a Bluesky PDS?</p>
<p>PS: I had a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/674f3d6c-4904-8012-b071-953862cd5b4a">conversation</a> with ChatGPT to scope this out. </p>

## Drones

date: 2024-12-03, from: David Rosenthal's blog

<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Slaughterbots_low-quality_cropped_screen_capture_@00.01.05.jpg#/media/File:Slaughterbots_low-quality_cropped_screen_capture_@00.01.05.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="Fictional CEO demonstrates microdrone" height="106" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f3/Slaughterbots_low-quality_cropped_screen_capture_%4000.01.05.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CO6M2HsoIA&amp;t=2s">Source</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
In 2017 the <a href="http://futureoflife.org/">Future of Life Institute</a> released a video entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipTO_7mUOw"><i>Slaughterbots</i></a>. Wikipedia describes it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterbots">as an</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
arms-control advocacy video presenting a dramatized near-future scenario where swarms of inexpensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_air_vehicle">microdrones</a> use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_software">facial recognition software</a> to assassinate political opponents based on preprogrammed criteria.
</blockquote>
War accelerates technological progress. The war in Ukraine has not yet produced "slaughterbots" but it has greatly accelerated drone technology and taken some giant steps toward them. The most important of these steps is that the cost of precision strike has been reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude, making it affordable for "non-state actors" and even individuals.<br />
<br />
Below the fold I look at drone developments in the war in Ukraine, what is happening with drones and drone defense in the West, and sketch some implications for the future.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
In parallel with the military developments I discuss here, there is rapid evolution in civilian drone systems, especially in China, which can be expected to feed into the military space. For example, Arnaud Bertrand describes Pingyin County's <a href="https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862726569040781505">low-altitude economy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The "low-altitude economy" is a big trend in China at the moment. XPeng, one of China's leading EV manufacturers, recently released a low-altitude flying car for instance. Drone deliveries are becoming increasingly common in Chinese cities, and various regions are actively developing low-altitude transportation networks. Shanghai, for instance, plans to establish 400 low-altitude flight routes by 2027.<br />
...<br />
this experiment in Pingyin County might seem small, but it could be the beginning of something truly revolutionary. This is China effectively experimenting around becoming the world's first truly three-dimensional economy, with low-altitude transportation and logistics networks. In a decade or two Chinese cities might have as much activity happening in the sky as on the ground.
</blockquote>
<h2>Ukraine</h2>
The drone systems I am discussing here fall into two classes:<br />
<ul>
<li>Small systems such as First Person View (FPV) quadcopters, with a range of a few tens of kilometers.</li>
<li>Larger systems navigating autonomously by GPS or other means with a range of hundreds of kilometers but relatively slow speeds of up to 200Kph.</li>
</ul>
I am excluding faster systems such as short-range missiles like HIMARS and cruise missiles such as Storm Shadow.<br />
<h3>Short Range Drones</h3>
The battlefield use of small fixed-wing and FPV quadcopter drones in the class of DJI's <a href="https://store.dji.com/product/dji-mavic-3-pro">Mavic</a> and <a href="https://store.dji.com/product/m350-rtk-and-dji-care-enterprise-basic">Matrice</a> has transformed both reconnaissance and strike. They cost a few hundred to a few thousand dollars; for comparison a <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/04/goal-100k-artillery-shells-month-sight-army-says/396047/">155mm shell is around $3K</a>.<br />
<h4>Reconnaissance</h4>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjG4XHxtvuDG0IyMuTwLrStz8kyfVA_On4VUmsST_N6R_EmxDfjL_KlTTyAPDqHManUZ2F2EJXMmAJh58aehmYJkvxesqO14yB034-7y4gd5hDJGKtGG8gQmpsGVVKMqDM3cgnwpJoA1SYajVtlxFGSnoSBFGrI8Zj_ORxgtlSwWxE_oD97w8MxgaGcXAH1/s1200/Orlan-10.jpg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1200" height="133" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjG4XHxtvuDG0IyMuTwLrStz8kyfVA_On4VUmsST_N6R_EmxDfjL_KlTTyAPDqHManUZ2F2EJXMmAJh58aehmYJkvxesqO14yB034-7y4gd5hDJGKtGG8gQmpsGVVKMqDM3cgnwpJoA1SYajVtlxFGSnoSBFGrI8Zj_ORxgtlSwWxE_oD97w8MxgaGcXAH1/w200-h133/Orlan-10.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">By Mil.ru, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0" title="Creative Commons Attribution 4.0">CC BY 4.0</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=93867440">Link</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
Small drones, such as the Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlan-10">Orlan-10</a>, provide an eagle's-eye view of the battlefield with real-time video. They have greatly extended the range of battle field surveillance. With zoom lenses they can provide detail at these longer ranges. With GPS they can provide precise target locations. With thermal cameras they can do all this at night.<br />
<br />
These changes have had significant tactical effects:<br />
<ul>
<li>Movement within about 20Km of the front line has become much more dangerous. Night is no longer a good cover for movement. This has made logistical support for positions close to the front more difficult. <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">For example</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
That has made some sections of the front lines, for example around Siversk in Luhansk province, practically no-go areas for humans. Drones are now responsible for a majority of battlefield losses, overtaking artillery, according to Ukrainian sources.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Damage assessment has become much easier. Real-time video of strikes can estimate their effects accurately, avoiding wasting ammunition by repeated strikes on targets that have been sufficiently disabled.</li>
<li>The vast amount of video generated, much of it from drones and the rest from cellphones allows selected clips to be posted to social media used for propaganda and for units to fund-raise. Donations are significant, especially on the Russian side for vehicles, and on the Ukrainian side to <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">support drone manufacture</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Ukrainian state is buying more than it once was, but voluntary foundations still provide at least a third of all drones used by the army.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>This cornucopia of video fuels an active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence">open source intelligence</a> community and especially their impressive ability to geolocate. It has become much harder for combatants to hide events from the public.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Strike</h4>
Kamikaze FPV drones provide sniper-like precision strike, but at vastly longer range, with much heavier warheads, and the ability to access <a href="https://x.com/Osint613/status/1852045500519981272">targets that snipers cannot</a>. For example, social media videos routinely show FPV drones striking targets inside buildings or infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) after entering through open doors. The warheads in common use include anti-armor explosively formed projectiles ‚Äî here is a <a href="https://twitter.com/mouw5284/status/1859996364563939769">small FPV drone</a> costing a few thousand dollars demolishing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-90">T-90</a>, the most advanced tank Russia has deployed costing perhaps $3-5M. Note the precision with which the FPV drone strikes the joint between the turret and the hull. And <a href="https://twitter.com/PStyle0ne1/status/1862419476454535531">here</a> four FPV drones totaling around $10K destroy a $24M Zoopark radar.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Javelin_Fire!_(48638261261).jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" title="The U.S. Army,
Sgt. Liane Hatch/3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Inf, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons"><img alt="Javelin Fire! (48638261261)" height="133" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Javelin_Fire%21_%2848638261261%29.jpg/512px-Javelin_Fire%21_%2848638261261%29.jpg?20190831161453" width="200" /></a>
Compare this to the US <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGM-148_Javelin">FGM-148 Javelin</a> with a unit cost of around $250K, a range of less than 5Km and weighing 22Kg. Is one Javelin as effective as 50 FPV drones delivering perhaps six times the weight of warhead at more than twice the range?<br />
<br />
There are also many FPV strike drones that are not kamikaze. There are "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_drone">Dragon drones</a>" that drop burning thermite on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/09/ukrainian-drones-now-spray-2500-c-thermite-streams-right-into-russian-trenches/">trenches</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1860401081949306998">disabled armor</a>.  The <a href="https://dykishershni.com/en.html">Wild Hornets drone manufacturer</a> claims their <a href="https://twitter.com/wilendhornets/status/1861477843622101197">Queen Hornets product</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
is a versatile platform capable of mining, bombing enemy positions, delivering supplies, transporting drones, firing an assault rifle or grenade launcher, and relaying communications
</blockquote>
Then there is the night bomber drone the Ukrainians call "Vampire" and the Russians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Yaga_(aircraft)">Baba Yaga</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The drone is a large hexacopter (6-rotor) drone. It is equipped with an infrared (thermal imaging) camera and able to carry up to a 33-pound (15kg) rocket warhead.<br />
...<br />
Baba Yaga was used both as a bomber deploying "mortar-sized munitions" and also as a "mother-ship" drone equipped with a signal repeater, anti-jamming equipment, batteries, and directional antennas. Its ability to function as a signal repeater extended the battery life and range of secondary drones. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the drones have been used primarily at night.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://twitter.com/PStyle0ne1">@PStyle0ne1</a> tweeted video of a Baba Yaga destroying a Russian BUK-M1 air defense system hidden in a forest at night with a <a href="https://twitter.com/PStyle0ne1/status/1857753071108948057">precise bomb drop</a>.  Drones in this class are also highly effective at <a href="https://twitter.com/casualdiot/status/1860744358858826010">laying minefields</a>.<br />
<br />
Although Baba Yaga carries the same size warhead as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahed_131">Shahed 131</a>, there is a huge gap in range and speed. But systems are emerging to fill it, such as one in the video tweeted by <a href="https://x.com/Bricktop_NAFO">@Bricktop_NAFO</a> that <a href="https://x.com/Bricktop_NAFO/status/1858215277663842801">converts between fixed-wing and quadcopter</a> in flight.<br />
<br />
There are now also specialized <a href="https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1858994042509684840">drone motherships</a> that carry 4-6 FPV drones and relay their communications, greatly extending their range of action.<br />
<br />
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIsj1C3Z1DcGVmQ5Tq8rn0DSeTgACeiiP1u9Hv-ZE0LGIzACUXB8UlBJpZ9cm98153Xgs8uVENCkmcksBZi0-yrZnECTQl7mmRn1LBUFMa0OLkbRq0pLGPqqXohG2_I2XNH188i2rhSgrcAqeSPY_uHF_lNv6iqcV9_RilQDOkl5v8eA0HfYsmMuMmTzp-/s3456/Lancet.jpeg" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2304" data-original-width="3456" height="133" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIsj1C3Z1DcGVmQ5Tq8rn0DSeTgACeiiP1u9Hv-ZE0LGIzACUXB8UlBJpZ9cm98153Xgs8uVENCkmcksBZi0-yrZnECTQl7mmRn1LBUFMa0OLkbRq0pLGPqqXohG2_I2XNH188i2rhSgrcAqeSPY_uHF_lNv6iqcV9_RilQDOkl5v8eA0HfYsmMuMmTzp-/w200-h133/Lancet.jpeg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">ZALA Lancet<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZALA_Lancet#/media/File:Army-2020-314.JPG">Nickel nitride</a>, CC0<br /></td></tr></tbody></table>
On the Russian side the predominant strike drone is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZALA_Lancet">Lancet</a>, a propeller-driven fixed-wing drone costing around $20K with a range up to 40Km. It has been fairly effective until recently (see Defense below), but probably less cost-effective than the much cheaper quadcopter FPV drones.<br />
<br />
The Achilles heel of all these drones is their dependence upon radio communication for command and control, which can be both detected and jammed. Worse, the command and control transmitter can be located and attacked; drone pilots are a high-priority target for both sides. <a href="https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1798050100633366633">This tweet</a> shows the Ukrainians using remotely-controlled directional antennas so to minimize the risk of detection, and the loss if attacked.<br />
<br />
Thus both sides have started to deploy drones controlled via a fiber optic cable. David Hambling reports on a Ukrainian version in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/11/07/ukraine-fields-reboff-unjammable-fiber-optic-fpv-attack-drone/"><i>Ukraine Fields Unjammable Fiber Optic FPV Attack Drone</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Khyzak REBOFF is a new Ukrainian FPV kamikaze drone with fiber optic cable for communication instead of radio. This makes it immune to jamming , the most effective protection against small drones.<br />
<br />
Russia has deployed similar technology with the Prince Vandal FPV used in action since August, and which has been lethally effective. However, Ukrainian expert Serhii Flash believes this is a Chinese model which the Russian suppliers rebranded and sold to the military (at a 750% markup), and which was not designed for military use.
</blockquote>
The <a href="https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1855078938164482502">video in this tweet</a> shows that the fiber doesn't impair the FPV drone's remarkable agility. And <a href="https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1853504089734451210">this tweet</a> from the Russian side highlights the high-definition video characteristic of fiber optic drones. This thread discusses the <a href="https://twitter.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1862908038149194028">many advantages fiber optics have over radio</a> in drone warfare. However, replacing radio with fiber adds cost and weight, and reduces range.<br />
<br />
The other way to prevent detection and neutralize jamming is to remove the need for a remote pilot by having the drone detect potential targets and select the most valuable autonomously, as implemented for example in the UK's "fire-and-forget" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brimstone_(missile)#Targeting_and_sensors">Brimstone</a> missile.  Brimstone costs around $130K, over an order of magnitude more than these Ukrainian autonomous drones. They are cheap enough to be used in swarms, as shown in <a href="https://x.com/banderafella/status/1851657984377598327">this tweet's video</a>.<br />

The US military <a href="https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/military-review/Archives/English/Online-Exclusive/2024/Multidomain-Battlefield-AI/Multidomain-Battlefield-AI-UA.pdf">reports that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Attaching infrared and visible light sensors to unmanned systems with onboard object detection and tracking will also increase model performance and targeting effects regardless of illumination conditions. The Ukrainian army is already deploying semiautonomous multirotor drones with onboard edge devices to fly munitions into Russian tanks autonomously.

<blockquote>
Ukraine is using dozens of domestically made AI-augmented systems for its drones to reach targets on the battlefield without being piloted, a senior official said, disclosing new details about the race against Russia to harness automation.<br /><br />
Systems that use artificial intelligence allow cheap drones carrying explosives to spot or fly to their targets in areas protected by extensive signal jamming, which has reduced the effectiveness of manually piloted drones.<br />
...<br />
A Ukrainian official told Reuters in July that most first person view units' target strike rate had fallen to 30%-50%, while for new pilots that can be as low as 10%, and that signal jamming was the main problem.<br /><br />
The official predicted that AI-operated first person view drones could achieve hit rates of around 80%.

<blockquote>
Our AI system not only recognizes static targets but also performs precise targeting of moving objects at speeds of up to 60 km/h. It can simultaneously track multiple targets and prioritize one for strike<br />
...<br />
Unlike traditional computer vision technologies, this system was trained on a specially created database and can recognize seven types of targets: infantry, cars, minivans, trucks, air defense systems, artillery, tanks, and armored vehicles.<br />
...<br />
The automatic target recognition range varies from 150 to 800 meters depending on the object type, with the maximum targeting range being up to 1000 meters. The system can be installed on any type of FPV kamikaze drones, including multicopters, wings, and airplanes. It is equipped with its own camera, connects to the flight controller and standard VTX, and drone control is done via a standard remote.<br />
<br />
According to the interview, the system costs about $50 more than traditional targeting systems.

The cost-benefit ratio of adding AI is reportedly <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">considerable</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Data from the battlefield suggest that the hit rate for these AI-guided drones is currently above 80%. That is higher than the rate of manually piloted drones. As important, the training burden declines dramatically. Mr Liscovich notes that, although there are now more highly experienced drone pilots, some with thousands of hours of flying time, the average quality of Ukrainian personnel has fallen over time as less motivated people are conscripted. ‚ÄúWe can train an operator within 30 minutes and the quality of the engagement doesn‚Äôt depend on their piloting skills,‚Äù
</blockquote>
With feedback from use in combat, the performance of these systems is <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">improving rapidly</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Rudimentary object-recognition software has been in use, on both sides, for over a year. But it is getting better. Lorenz Meier of Auterion, a Switzerland-based firm, says that between spring and summer his firm‚Äôs software, known as Skynode, managed to double the range at which a drone could engage a target, from 500 metres to 1km or so. He says that improvements in the resolution of images captured by drones have since increased that further. <i>The Economist</i> understands that AI systems are sometimes locking onto targets at perhaps double that distance, far beyond the range at which basic jammers could take out the drone.
</blockquote>
The innovation cycle is <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">accelerating</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Mr Meier reckons that fewer than a tenth of drones are AI-guided at present. But that number is rising. Ukraine‚Äôs innovation cycles are relentless, with feedback loops in some cases down to a few days. The simplicity of FPV drones, which Ukraine builds from off-the-shelf components, can also act as a hindrance: it makes them easy to replicate. One manufacturer says Russian reverse engineering can be as quick as three weeks, but encryption means that the software can be protected from copying.
</blockquote>
These autonomous systems are still vulnerable to jamming before they get close enough for the AI to recognize the target.  Some idea of the intensity of the electronic warfare in Ukraine can be gained from Charlie Metcalfe's <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/12/1103833/ukraine-russia-drone-war-flash-radio-serhii-beskrestnov-social-media/"><i>Meet the radio-obsessed civilian shaping Ukraine‚Äôs drone defense</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Serhii ‚ÄúFlash‚Äù Beskrestnov hates going to the front line. The risks terrify him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really not happy to do it at all,‚Äù he says. But to perform his particular self-appointed role in the Russia-Ukraine war, he believes it‚Äôs critical to exchange the relative safety of his suburban home north of the capital for places where the prospect of death is much more immediate. ‚ÄúFrom Kyiv,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúnobody sees the real situation.‚Äù<br />
<br />
So about once a month, he drives hundreds of kilometers east in a homemade mobile intelligence center: a black VW van in which stacks of radio hardware connect to an array of antennas on the roof that stand like porcupine quills when in use. Two small devices on the dash monitor for nearby drones. Over several days at a time, Flash studies the skies for Russian radio transmissions and tries to learn about the problems facing troops in the fields and in the trenches.<br />
<br />
He is, at least in an unofficial capacity, a spy. But unlike other spies, Flash does not keep his work secret. In fact, he shares the results of these missions with more than 127,000 followers‚Äîincluding many soldiers and government officials‚Äîon several public social media channels. Earlier this year, for instance, he described how he had recorded five different Russian reconnaissance drones in a single night‚Äîone of which was flying directly above his van.

Since the longer-range drones navigate using GPS or the Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS">GLONASS</a>, they are vulnerable to jamming and spoofing. Sophisticated Controlled Reception Pattern Antennas (CRPA) can <a href="https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1831722520485171228">filter out the jamming signal</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The CRPA antenna exploits the fact that a GPS satellite signal and a ground based jamming signal arrive from different directions.  It consists of an array of antennas that measure the direction and time of arrival of different signals

While not all cells are created equal, they are essentially commodity products manufactured by the billion. They‚Äôre made mainly by big players in the Far East; China dominates but it does not have a monopoly. Other sources are readily available.<br />
...<br />
To build your own drone batteries, you have to source quality cells from a reliable supplier and assemble them into battery packs. And that is exactly what Ukrainian drone maker Wild Hornets has been doing for some time.<br />
<br />
A <a href="https://x.com/wilendhornets/status/1806061954903285775">video on social media explains Wild Hornets' process</a>. The building blocks for its battery packs are Samsung 50S, which are optimized for high-power applications and have a respectable 5000 mAH capacity.

As with FPV drones, AI is being applied to longer-range drones. For example, the German company Helsing is apparently planning to ship Ukraine 4000 of its new <a href="https://x.com/front_ukrainian/status/1863695390622863856">HX-2 drone</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This kamikaze drone has a range of up to 100 km and weighs about 12 kg and a speed of up to 220 km/h<br />
<br />
The main feature of the HX-2 is its integration with advanced machine vision algorithms, which provide autonomous target recognition and their destruction even with active electronic warfare.
</blockquote>
This is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brimstone_(missile)#Targeting_and_sensors">Brimstone's capabilities</a> but slower, smaller, longer-ranged  and much cheaper.<br />
<br />
Again, the most important aspect of these developments is that they greatly reduce the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-15/above-ukraine-a-sky-full-of-drones-is-changing-the-war">cost of precision strike </a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Ukraine‚Äôs new drones are also cheap. A kit of 10 Fire Point drones plus a control station and transport, including three mobile trailers, costs $580,000. That‚Äôs a fraction of the cost of military drones produced by western arms manufacturers, though it‚Äôs still a stretch for Ukraine‚Äôs military budget. FP says it can produce at least 500 drones per month, but that Ukraine‚Äôs defense ministry struggles to buy a fifth of that.

<h3>Drone Defense</h3>
The essential feature of a successful defense against either the short- or the longer-range drones is that it be cheaper than the attack. This is rapidly decreasing, making cost-effective defense challenging.<br />

All drones emit heat, and the sky is generally a fairly even temperature looking up at it so the passive thermal sights are effective. The pickups and the Yak-52 rely on a nationwide passive <a href="https://www.twz.com/air/ukraines-acoustic-drone-detection-network-eyed-by-u-s-as-low-cost-air-defense-option">acoustic sensor system built from cell-phones</a>, using machine learning to identify drones acoustic signatures. It is called <a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/publication/issues/72169">Sky Fortress</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Over a field east of Poltava, the sound of a 4-cylinder piston engine rumbles through the quiet of the night. A small electronic box attached to a cell tower records the sound, identifying the audio profile of a Geran-2 loitering munition, and transmits the data for processing. Responding to an alert, two soldiers fire up the engine on their Nissan pickup truck and go speeding down the road to the grid coordinates provided. In position, they scan the horizon in the direction of the attack. They have only a narrow window of opportunity. Tracers arc into the sky from their old but reliable DShK, their efforts rewarded as the drone disappears in a fireball.

Three weeks ago Gordon Lubold, Lara Seligman and Aruna Viswanatha of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported that the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/mystery-drones-swarmed-a-u-s-military-base-for-17-days-the-pentagon-is-stumped/ar-AA1saqAu">Mystery Drones Swarmed a U.S. Military Base for 17 Days. Pentagon Is Stumped</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
U.S. Air Force Gen. Mark Kelly wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of reports that a suspicious fleet of unidentified aircraft had been flying over Langley Air Force Base on Virginia‚Äôs shoreline.<br />
<br />
Kelly, a decorated senior commander at the base, got on a squadron rooftop to see for himself. He joined a handful of other officers responsible for a clutch of the nation‚Äôs most advanced jet fighters, including F-22 Raptors.<br />
<br />
For several nights, military personnel had reported a mysterious breach of restricted airspace over a stretch of land that has one of the largest concentrations of national-security facilities in the U.S. The show usually starts 45 minutes to an hour after sunset, another senior leader told Kelly.<br />
<br />
The first drone arrived shortly. Kelly, a career fighter pilot, estimated it was roughly 20 feet long and flying at more than 100 miles an hour, at an altitude of roughly 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Other drones followed, one by one, sounding in the distance like a parade of lawn mowers.<br />
<br />
The drones headed south, across Chesapeake Bay, toward Norfolk, Va., and over an area that includes the home base for the Navy‚Äôs SEAL Team Six and Naval Station Norfolk, the world‚Äôs largest naval port.
</blockquote>
Given the incredible lethality of drones in Ukraine, this seems like a problem.  The <i>WSJ</i> story provided <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/mystery-drones-swarmed-a-u-s-military-base-for-17-days-the-pentagon-is-stumped/ar-AA1saqAu">more details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Over 17 days, the drones arrived at dusk, flew off and circled back. Some shone small lights, making them look like a constellation moving in the night sky‚Äîor a science-fiction movie, Kelly said, ‚Äú‚ÄòClose Encounters at Langley.‚Äô‚Äù They also were nearly impossible to track, vanishing each night despite a wealth of resources deployed to catch them.<br />
<br />
Gen. Glen VanHerck, at the time commander of the U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, said drones had for years been spotted flying around defense installations. But the nightly drone swarms over Langley, he said, were unlike any past incursion.
</blockquote>
The swarms were clearly a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/mystery-drones-swarmed-a-u-s-military-base-for-17-days-the-pentagon-is-stumped/ar-AA1saqAu">sophisticated operation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
U.S. officials didn‚Äôt believe hobbyists were flying the drones, given the complexity of the operation. The drones flew in a pattern: one or two fixed-wing drones positioned more than 100 feet in the air and smaller quadcopters, the size of 20-pound commercial drones, often below and flying slower. Occasionally, they hovered.<br />
<br />
They came from the north around 6 p.m. to traverse the base, which sits on a peninsula at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, and continued south, beyond the reach of radar. They repeated the pattern and then disappeared, typically by midnight.
</blockquote>
Shaheds do sound like lawn movers, fly around 100mph, and have the endurance to fly several circuits of Langley between 6pm and midnight. General Kelly might have over-estimated the length; the fixed-wing drones may have been Shahed 136 equivalents. The map shows the vast area from which a Shahed 136-class drone attack on Langley could be launched.<br />

The Langley incursions were among more than 600 reported over U.S. military installations since 2022, NORAD stated Tuesday. In the wake of the rash of drone activity over Langley AFB, NORTHCOM was tasked by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to look at drone incursions across the U.S., Guillot said.

‚ÄúI saw that NORAD‚Äôs responsibility for countering UAS was very limited to something that would be an attack of national consequence,‚Äù he explained not the small drones as seen over Langley and elsewhere.

<blockquote>
‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs certainly a role for fighters. There‚Äôs a role for non-kinetic or low-collateral kinetic capabilities that would be at the smaller end.

Indeed, the DoD's Palletized High Energy Laser Program has produced a laser counter-drone system, the <a href="https://bluehalo.com/bluehalo-locust-laser-weapon-system-delivered-to-the-palletized-high-energy-laser-p-hel-program/">BlueHalo LOCUST Laser Weapon System</a>. The <i>WSJ</i> reported on it in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFiDYFnlp7s">this video</a>.<br />
<br />
One of the big problems with cheap drones is that you need to shoot them down even more cheaply. LOCUST touts a per-shot cost of just $3, but that isn't the end of the story.  Each LOCUST costs $10M. "fewer than a dozen are deployed", all overseas. Each requires a dedicated team from BlueHalo to maintain it because there are no stocks of spare parts.  And "the Pentagon has not confirmed that a laser has taken down a drone in combat". It weighs 3400lb and fits in a 7' cube. It takes "as many as 15 seconds to melt a target".<br />
<br />
Despite the low per-shot cost, LOCUST isn't a solution to the rash of drone swarms. First, at a unit price of $10M plus a dedicated support team defending the vast number of US defense assets isn't affordable. Second, the problem isn't defending against a single drone, it is defending against a swarm of cheap drones. For example, Ukraine used at least 34 drones in their November 10<sup>th</sup> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-drone-attack-forces-closure-two-moscow-airports-2024-11-10/">attack on Moscow</a>. Lets guess that Locust can switch targets in 5 seconds, and is 100% lethal in 15 seconds, it would take 11:20 to defeat the swarm. It isn't going to have that long, because at 100mph that is 19 miles. So even if 34 was the biggest feasible swarm (hint: it isn't) defending a high-value asset would need say 5 LOCUST systems at $50M capex plus opex.<br />
<br />
<h3>Drone Defense: Policy</h3>
Neither the pickups with the Brownings nor the cellphones are systems the DoD's supply chain is interested in building.  But even if systems like LOCUST could be afforded and deployed, policies need to be established for their use.  Joseph Trevithick, Howard Altman and Tyler Rogoway's <a href="https://www.twz.com/news-features/lasers-microwaves-missiles-guns-not-on-the-table-for-domestic-drone-defense"><i>Lasers, Microwaves, Missiles, Guns Not On The Table For Domestic Drone Defense </i></a> is a deep dive into the policy issues:<br />
<blockquote>
Even if counter-drone policies are clarified and solidified, and authorities get expanded, there are still other concerns at play, especially when it comes to collateral damage. Shooting something down with a gun-based system or a surface-to-air missile carries inherent dangers of projectiles or interceptors, or debris from them, falling onto innocent bystanders below. The aforementioned Centurion C-RAM <a href="https://www.twz.com/36412/centurions-roaring-whips-of-exploding-shells-are-still-engaging-rockets-over-iraqs-green-zone">fires specialized self-destructing ammunition</a> to reduce these risks.
</blockquote>
Here, for example, is an <a href="https://x.com/Trotes936897/status/1851738072779501911">Oerlikon Revolver</a> in Ukraine firing <a href="https://x.com/Trotes936897/status/1851738118396801392">air-burst ammunition</a>. But the ammunition isn't the only problem:<br />
<blockquote>
The drone, or what is left of it, which could include undetonated explosive warheads or <a href="https://www.twz.com/air/poop-filled-north-korean-balloons-descend-on-the-south-stoking-fears-of-deadlier-payloads">other potentially hazardous payloads</a>, would also fall to Earth in an uncontrolled manner after any such engagement.<br />
</blockquote>
The Russians frequently explain burning oil refineries and similar mishaps on debris from successful interceptions of drones. Someone whose house was destroyed by the 50Kg warhead of a shot-down Shahed 136 would have reason to be upset. Deciding on a suitable counter-drone policy is <a href="https://www.twz.com/news-features/lasers-microwaves-missiles-guns-not-on-the-table-for-domestic-drone-defense">complex</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Maybe even more importantly is that these weapons do fail and they are packed with high explosives and traveling at high speed, which could cause very unpredictable harm to people and property in a large potential impact area. Then there is the idea that you have to know exactly what you are shooting at, and that can be harder than it sounds when dealing with strange objects in the sky, especially in populated areas where civilian air traffic is dense. Making the call to shoot down an object over the U.S. is an incredibly complex task that never actually occurred until recently.

But even in war zones where the US policy is clear and permissive, it isn't foolproof. Stefan Becket and Kaia Hubbard reported on a January incident at Tower 22 on the border with Syria in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-troops-killed-jordan-american-service-members-syria/"><i>3 American service members killed and dozens injured in drone attack on base in Jordan, U.S. says</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Three American service members were killed and dozens more were injured in an unmanned aerial drone attack on a base in Jordan on Sunday, President Biden and the U.S. military said.<br />
...<br />
Mr. Biden said the attack happened at a base in northeast Jordan, a U.S. ally, close to the border with Syria. A U.S. official said the attack occurred at an outpost known as Tower 22, where roughly 350 U.S. Army and Air Force personnel are deployed, according to the Department of Defense.<br />
<br />
U.S. Central Command, which oversees forces in the Middle East, initially put the number of injured at 25, but two U.S. officials soon said that figure had risen to more than 30. CENTCOM confirmed later Sunday night that at least 34 had been injured. Eight of the wounded service members had to be evacuated ‚Äî some were in critical condition but all were stable, a defense official told CBS News.
</blockquote>
How was the drone able to penetrate US defenses and kill or injure more than 10% of the base occupants? <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/29/politics/us-soldiers-deaths-jordan/index.html"><i>Drone that killed US soldiers in Jordan followed American drone onto base, causing confusion</i></a> by Natasha Bertrand, Oren Liebermann and Haley Britzky explains:<br />
<blockquote>
The drone that killed three US Army soldiers and wounded dozens more in Jordan on Sunday approached the US military outpost, Tower 22, around the same time an American drone was returning to the base, which led to uncertainty over whether it was hostile and caused a delay to the US response, two US officials told CNN.<br />
<br />
The enemy drone followed the American drone as it approached, but it is not clear whether the enemy drone intentionally followed the American one or if it was a coincidence, one of the officials said.
</blockquote>
These problems don't go away if the counter-drone technology is electronic. Confusing the drone's navigation with GPS spoofing or detaching an FPV drone from its pilot using a jammer may prevent it reaching its target but it doesn't render it harmless to innocent bystanders.<br />
<h3>The Threat</h3>
One notable feature of the war in Ukraine is Russia's sustained campaign against Ukraine's electric grid, which has caused major difficulties especially in the winter. On November 26<sup>th</sup> <a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1861396932658115043">Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Last night, Russia attacked Ukraine, launching a record number of strike drones‚Äî188‚Äîagainst our people. I want to thank our defenders of the sky for repelling the attack. Around 80 drones were shot down, and more than 90 were lost due to location disruption.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there has been damage to our critical infrastructure, and the situation in Ternopil remains challenging. All services and repair crews are on-site, doing everything to assist people and restore electricity as quickly as possible.
</blockquote>
A mysterious feature has been Ukraine's reluctance to attack Russia's electric grid, especially since their economy and military are completely dependent upon freight trains hauled by electric locomotives. This may have been part of the US' "escalation management".<br />
<br />
If whoever is behind the drone incursions in the West decides to switch from reconnaissance to strike, they are likely to follow the Russian example and strike the grid by attacking the transformers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalf_sniper_attack">US transformers have already been shot</a> and damaged by unknown attackers, presumably right-wing militia. FPV drones would cause far more than the $15M damage in that attack. Large grid transformers are expensive, long lead-time items, completely defenseless against drone attack. A coordinated attack on a number of them would have a major, long-lasting impact on the US grid, similar to a major <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/07/coronal-mass-ejections.html">coronal mass ejection</a>.<br />
<h2>The Future</h2>
The cost of precision strike, both at short and longer ranges, has been reduced by at least an order of magnitude and likely much more. Further reductions are very likely. Typically, when the cost of something is greatly reduced, you get a lot more of it. What is likely to be the effect of greatly increasing the supply of precision strike?<br />
<br />
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09592318.2024.2319216"><i>The impact of precision strike technology on the warfare of non-state armed groups: case studies on Daesh and the Houthis</i></a> by Max Mutschler, Marius Bales and Esther Meininghaus examines one effect that has already happened:<br />
<blockquote>
Precision strikes from a distance are a common practice of state warfare. However, the global proliferation of precision strike technologies, like missiles and armed drones, makes such weapons progressively available to non-state armed groups (NSAGs). We look at Daesh in Syria and Iraq and at the Houthis in Yemen as two case studies to analyse the consequences of this proliferation for non-state warfare.
</blockquote>
The Houthis, with help from Iran, have used precision strike systems much more sophisticated than the ones I deal with here to cause a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis">major disruption to world trade</a>, and to cause Western nations to expend vastly more expensive systems in a futile attempt to stop them.<br />
<br />
The war in Ukraine spawned <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/13/nx-s1-5147284/ukraine-drones-russia-war#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20more%20than%20200%20drone,Literally%20made%20in%20the%20kitchen.%E2%80%9D">hundreds of new drone manufacturers</a>. This incredibly competitive market has driven costs down to a point where groups with far less funding than the drug cartels, and even individuals, can acquire precision strike capabilities. In the US civilian use of drones is currently regulated by the FAA. Drones are required to be registered and the areas where they are permitted to fly are restricted. They are not regarded as weapons, but what does the 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment say about drones if they are regarded as weapons?<br />
<br />
Many of the same policy issues arise when it comes to individuals defending themselves against drone attacks. Electronic defenses such as jamming and GPS spoofing are illegal. "Kinetic" defenses such as shotguns are legal in some cases, but restricted by the risks to bystanders. Passive defenses such as "cope cages" on vehicles would be illegal under safety regulations, and on houses by planning regulations.<br />
<br />
Potential future technological developments may greatly increase the difficulty of defending against drone attacks by making it impossible to interfere with their navigation. Current high-end cruise missiles such as Ukraine's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-360_Neptune">R360-Neptune</a> use inertial navigation, but because it drifts over time it requires regular updates from GPS to maintain accuracy. This is similar to the navigation systems in commercial aircraft. These systems are too large and expensive for drones.<br />

But, as Sandia Labs announced in <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/revolutionary-quantum-compass-could-soon-make-gps-free-navigation-a-reality/"><i>Revolutionary Quantum Compass Could Soon Make GPS-Free Navigation a Reality</i></a> dramatic increases in accuracy and reductions in cost and size for inertial navigation are on the way:<br />
<blockquote>
Now, scientists are attempting to make a motion sensor so precise it could minimize the nation‚Äôs reliance on global positioning satellites. Until recently, such a sensor ‚Äî a thousand times more sensitive than today‚Äôs navigation-grade devices ‚Äî would have filled a moving truck. But advancements are dramatically shrinking the size and cost of this technology.<br />
<br />
For the first time, researchers from Sandia National Laboratories have used silicon photonic microchip components to perform a quantum sensing technique called atom interferometry, an ultra-precise way of measuring acceleration.<br />
...<br />
Besides size, cost has been a major obstacle to deploying quantum navigation devices. Every atom interferometer needs a laser system, and laser systems need modulators.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúJust one full-size single-sideband modulator, a commercially available one, is more than $10,000,‚Äù Lee said.<br />
<br />
Miniaturizing bulky, expensive components into silicon photonic chips helps drive down these costs.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúWe can make hundreds of modulators on a single 8-inch wafer and even more on a 12-inch wafer,‚Äù Kodigala said.

<br />
Even with Sandia's progress in reducing the size and cost of quantum intertial navigation, the technology is currently far out of reach for low-cost drones. But if progress were to continue it would mean that a drone, or more likely a drone swarm, could navigate to any target whose coordinates were known without using any external assistance that could be jammed or spoofed. Electrical grid transformers would be one such target.<br />

I have no problem with that, because his son was accused as a proxy for his father. If there is any legitimate use of presidential pardons, this is it. Perhaps relatives of the president should also be immune from prosecution. Does anyone really think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden">Hunter Biden</a> would have been tried for such petty crimes if he weren't Biden's son? The journalists, as always, have equated two <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5181960/can-trump-pardon-as-promised-people-convicted-in-connection-with-the-jan-6-attack">very different</a> things. They're playing their own game, trying to self-pardon in a way, to avoid being a target for the incoming administration, which we're all scared of, and I guess that's the point, to scare us.

## Algorithms Are Coming for Democracy‚Äîbut It‚Äôs Not All Bad

date: 2024-12-03, updated: 2024-11-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>In 2025, AI is poised to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-global-elections/">change every aspect of democratic politics</a>&#8212;but it won&#8217;t necessarily be for the worse.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has used AI to translate his speeches for his multilingual electorate in real time, demonstrating how AI can help diverse democracies to be more inclusive. AI avatars were used by presidential candidates in South Korea in electioneering, enabling them to provide answers to thousands of voters&#8217; questions simultaneously. We are also starting to see <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/generative-ai-political-advertising">AI tools</a> aid fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts. AI techniques are starting to augment more traditional polling methods, helping campaigns get cheaper and faster data. And congressional candidates have started using AI robocallers to engage voters on issues. In 2025, these trends will continue. AI doesn&#8217;t need to be superior to human experts to augment the labor of an overworked canvasser, or to write ad copy similar to that of a junior campaign staffer or volunteer. Politics is competitive, and any technology that can bestow an advantage, or even just garner attention, will be used...</p>

I'm using the term "RSS-based podcasts" in place of "podcasts" to make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other "podcasts," are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube et al to just connect their "podcasts" to RSS and everyone's happy. Like "organic cheeseburgers." :-)

Sometimes shows are done, but the archive contains good stuff. Not everything is based on current events. Music, art, history for example. Also bring the feed out from hiding. At least the nerdy people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds. I like to be able to lift the hood even if I don't understand what I'm looking at.

For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads. Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too, since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you do it, I wouldn't announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.
