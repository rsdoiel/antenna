<p>date: 2024-08-31, from: Press Releases</p>
<p>Grand Canyon National Park will implement Stage 4 water restrictions
on the South Rim starting the afternoon of Thursday, August 29, due to a
series of four significant breaks in the 12½ mile-long Transcanyon
Waterline that supplies water from the canyon for use in the park. Since
July 8, the park has faced challenges with water supply, and currently,
no water is being pumped to either the South or North Rim.

<strong>WASHINGTON — </strong>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) today
announced its
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-19478/environmental-impact-statements-availability-etc-utility-scale-solar-energy-development-and-proposed">proposed
roadmap</a> for solar energy development on public lands, designed to
expand efficient and environmentally responsible solar project
permitting on public lands across the West. Today’s release of the Final
Utility-Scale Solar Energy Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement
and Proposed Resource Management Plan Amendments (also known as the
proposed updated Western Solar Plan), comes as the Biden-Harris
administration releases new data to demonstrate how it has
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-permitting-action-plan-to-accelerate-and-deliver-infrastructure-projects-on-time-on-task-and-on-budget/">improved
federal permitting processes</a> to help deliver more projects, more
efficiently, across the United States.
</p>
<p>
The proposed Western Solar Plan builds on President Biden’s Investing in
America agenda, which is working to transition the nation to clean
energy, lower energy costs for consumers, create good-paying union jobs,
tackle the climate crisis, and advance clean air and environmental
justice priorities, with the goal of achieving a 100-percent clean
electricity grid by 2035. Earlier this year, BLM
<a href="https://www.blm.gov/press-release/biden-harris-administration-delivers-historic-milestones-new-actions-clean-energy">surpassed
the goal</a> of permitting more than 25 gigawatts of clean energy
projects on public lands, and the updated Western Solar Plan will
support continued progress on responsible permitting. 
</p>
<p>
“The updated Western Solar Plan will help build modern, resilient energy
infrastructure that creates a strong clean energy economy and protects
our communities from the worsening impacts of climate change,” said
<strong>Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals
Management Dr. Steve Feldgus.</strong> “Through extensive planning and
collaboration, we’re not only protecting our public lands but also
ensuring that permitting for solar projects moves faster and more
efficiently, avoiding conflicts and striking the right balance as we
advance clean energy and safeguard the environment.”
</p>
<p>
Developed with substantial public input, the proposed updated
<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2022371/510">Western
Solar Plan</a> will guide BLM’s management of solar energy proposals and
projects on public lands. It would make over 31 million acres of public
lands across 11 western states available for potential solar
development, driving development closer to transmission lines or on
previously disturbed lands and avoiding protected lands, sensitive
cultural resources and important wildlife habitat.
</p>
<p>
Steering project proposals away from areas where they may conflict with
other resources or uses will help ensure responsible development, speed
the permitting process, and provide greater predictability to the solar
energy industry. The plan updates and expands the original 2012 Western
Solar Plan in order to reflect changes in technology and meet the higher
demand for solar energy development. This plan analyzes five additional
western states (Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming), in
addition to the six states analyzed in the original plan.
</p>
<p>
“The updated Western Solar Plan is a responsible, pragmatic strategy for
developing solar energy on our nation’s public lands that supports
national clean energy goals and long-term national energy security,”
said <strong>BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning.</strong> “It will drive
responsible solar development to locations with fewer potential
conflicts while helping the nation transition to a clean energy economy,
furthering the BLM’s mission to sustain the health, diversity, and
productivity of public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and
future generations.” 
</p>
<p>
No solar developments are authorized through this planning effort;
proposed projects will still undergo site-specific environmental review
and public comment. This Final Utility-Scale Solar Energy Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement follows a draft published in January 2024
for public comment, with input from a wide range of stakeholders helping
BLM to make additional updates that will help protect wildlife habitats
and migration corridors and other key resources, while providing clarity
to industry about low-conflict areas and project design approaches to
guide responsible development.
</p>
<p>
To date, the Biden-Harris administration has approved 40 renewable
energy projects on public lands (9 solar, 13 geothermal, and 18
gen-ties) allowing for early achievement of the goal to permit 25
gigawatts by 2025. In total, BLM has now permitted clean energy projects
on public lands with a total capacity of approximately 29 gigawatts of
power – enough to power over 12 million homes. This year BLM also issued
a final Renewable Energy Rule that will lower consumer energy costs and
the cost of developing solar and wind projects, improve project
application processes, and incentivize developers to continue
responsibly developing solar and wind projects on public lands.
</p>
<p>
Publication of the Final Utility-Scale Solar Energy Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement and Proposed Resource Management Plan
Amendments initiates a 30-day protest period and 60-day governor’s
consistency review. Following resolution of any remaining issues
identified in this phase, the BLM will publish the Record of Decision
and Final Resource Management Plan Amendments.

BARSTOW, CA. – <a name="_Hlk160197126">The Bureau of Land Management is
seeking public comment on a proposed land sale of approximately 30 acres
of public lands located in San Bernardino County to
</a><a name="_Hlk160562469">Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway</a>.
The
<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-19256.pdf">Notice
of Realty Action</a> will publish in the Federal Register on Wednesday,
August 28, to begin a public comment period that will close Oct. 15. 
</p>
<p>
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway has proposed to use the land for
the <a href="https://bnsfbig.com/">Barstow International Gateway</a>
project, an approximately 4,500-acre integrated rail facility that would
transfer goods from international to domestic containers. The proposed
project would result in a more than $1.5 billion investment in the
community, potentially creating more than 20,000 new jobs and helping to
address logistics and supply chain issues. If approved, the Barstow
International Gateway project is expected to also help reduce freeway
congestion around the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
</p>
<p>
The public land proposed for sale is suitable for private sale since it
is surrounded by private lands and provides no public access. As such,
there would be no impacts to public land access or recreation. If
approved, the public lands would be sold to Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Railway at fair market value.
</p>
<p>
Anyone interested reviewing the environmental assessment, the appraisal,
or maps, may visit the
<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2033900/510">BLM
National NEPA Register</a>, or visit the BLM Barstow Field Office, 2601
Barstow Road in Barstow, CA 92311, during business hours 8 a.m. to 4:30
p.m., five days a week, excluding federal holidays. The public may
contact the office at 760-252-6000 to make visitation arrangements.
</p>
<p>
Written comments should be sent to Bureau of Land Management, Barstow
Field Office, ATTN: Tim McCain, 2601 Barstow Road in Barstow, CA 92311,
or sent by email to tmccain@blm.gov.

<p>On Sunday, August 25, at approximately 3:40 p.m., Grand Canyon
National Park was alerted to an emergency via a satellite phone call
from a commercial river trip near Fossil Rapid (river mile 126) on the
Colorado River.</p>
<p>The Grand Canyon Regional Communications Center received a report
that CPR was in progress on an 80-year-old male who had entered the
river after his boat flipped at Fossil Rapid. Despite the efforts of the
