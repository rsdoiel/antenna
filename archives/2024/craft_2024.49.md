## Psst: Need a ‘Shorty’ Benchcrafted Split-top Roubo?

date: 2024-12-06, from: Lost Arg Press blog

A few years back, we decided we had too many benches in our shop, so I hired movers to transport and get my &#8220;Gluebo&#8221; into my basement. (Its weight almost killed us moving it from my former workplace to Lost Art Press in 2017.) Then we decided we had too few benches, and that we...

## 2024 Anarchist’s Gift Guide: Day 10

date: 2024-12-06, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Day 10: GRIP 9&#8220; Stainless Steel Pry Bar I can’t tell you how often I grab this thin pry bar from Chris’s tool chest in a panic to remove moulding and other small pieces without damaging them, and I don’t know what else. But I grab it a lot. I have one at home that...

## A Collection of Mid-18th-century French Tools

date: 2024-12-05, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Several weeks ago I came across an illustrated collection of tools held by Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ). The approximate date of the collection is 1740, which pre-dates Roubo’s “l’art du Menuisier.”  The collection, acquired in 1970, includes 84 illustrations. In the BAnQ’s description it is noted the illustrations may be from a...

Day 9: Infinity Stamps If you want a fantastic logo stamp, contact Infinity Stamps. The company’s designers will create a stamp for you based on a sketch or whatever else you have, or you can send a vector file. Infinity is fast and great to deal with. Chris has three (or it is four?) stamps...

## Campaign Furniture – Rugged & Simple

The following is the preface of “Campaign Furniture,” by Christopher Schwarz. For almost 200 years, simple and sturdy pieces of campaign furniture were used by people all over the globe, yet this remarkable furniture style is now almost unknown to most woodworkers and furniture designers. “Campaign Furniture” seeks to restore this style to its proper...

## 2024 Anarchist’s Gift Guide: Day 7

date: 2024-12-03, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Day 7: Purified/refined Linseed Oil Finishing has gotten a lot easier here now that we have switched to raw linseed oil that has been purified/refined. These oils are lighter than your hardware store linseed oil, they dry fast and they don’t have any heavy metallic driers. You can use them on their own or in...

## Anthe Update: New Storefront & Offices

date: 2024-12-02, from: Lost Arg Press blog

It’s been a while since I wrote about our work on the Anthe Building, the old factory where our fulfillment center is located. This fall we’ve been working on the storefront of the building, which faces Madison Avenue in downtown Covington. And on some offices upstairs for the editorial staff. Here’s the latest. The Storefront...

Day 6: Pica Markers &#38; Mechanical Pencils This year I have completely embraced the Pica marking stuff. It is not perfect (details below). But it is still miles beyond what I was using before. What makes it awesome? Pica’s “Longlife Cap.” This is basically a scabbard that clips tenaciously to your shop apron, waist apron...

date: 2024-12-01, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Day 5: Hans Karlsson &#38; Jason Lonon Scorps/Inshaves Good scorps/inshaves are expensive and difficult to come by. Most of the used and discount scorps I’ve seen are not worth messing with. I’ve tried grinding them and even cold-bending their handles in an effort to make them work. Most times the old tool simply wasn’t made...
