## 2024 Anarchist’s Gift Guide: Day 7

date: 2024-12-03, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Day 7: Purified/refined Linseed Oil Finishing has gotten a lot easier here now that we have switched to raw linseed oil that has been purified/refined.

## Anthe Update: New Storefront & Offices

## 2024 Anarchist’s Gift Guide: Day 5

date: 2024-12-01, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Day 5: Hans Karlsson &#38; Jason Lonon Scorps/Inshaves Good scorps/inshaves are expensive and difficult to come by. Most of the used and discount scorps I’ve seen are not worth messing with. I’ve tried grinding them and even cold-bending their handles in an effort to make them work. Most times the old tool simply wasn’t made...
