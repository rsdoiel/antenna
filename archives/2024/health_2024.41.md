## Bacteriophage-mediated approaches for biofilm control

date: 2024-10-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Biofilms are complex microbial communities in which planktonic and dormant bacteria are enveloped in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) such as exopolysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and DNA. These multicellular structures present resistance to conventional antimicrobial treatments, including antibiotics. The formation of biofilms raises considerable concern in healthcare settings, biofilms can exacerbate infections in patients and compromise the integrity of medical devices employed during treatment. Similarly, certain bacterial species contribute to bulking, foaming, and biofilm development in water environments such as wastewater treatment plants, water reservoirs, and aquaculture facilities. Additionally, food production facilities provide ideal conditions for establishing bacterial biofilms, which can serve as reservoirs for foodborne pathogens. Efforts to combat antibiotic resistance involve exploring various strategies, including bacteriophage therapy. Research has been conducted on the effects of phages and their individual proteins to assess their potential for biofilm removal. However, challenges persist, prompting the examination of refined approaches such as drug-phage combination therapies, phage cocktails, and genetically modified phages for clinical applications. This review aims to highlight the progress regarding bacteriophage-based approaches for biofilm eradication in different settings.

## Synergistic effects of antimicrobial components of the human-derived composite amnion-chorion membrane on bacterial growth

date: 2024-10-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe human-derived amnion-chorion membrane (ACM) has endogenous antimicrobial properties, which are important for preventing the colonization and survival of oral bacteria on exposed membranes. This project aimed to decipher the underlying mechanism by identifying the components of ACM that confer antibacterial properties. In addition, the antimicrobial efficacy of these identified components on oral bacteria was assessed.MethodsFour antimicrobial proteins, histone H2A/H2B, cathelicidin LL-37, lactoferrin, and lysozyme, were identified via mass spectrometry in ACM. These proteins were then assessed for their efficacy in killing Streptococcus gordonii Challis. Log-phased bacterial cells were cultured with the commercially available proteins that were identified in ACM, either individually or in combination, at different concentrations. After incubation for 8 or 24 hours, the bacteria were stained with a live/dead viability kit and analyzed via confocal microscopy.ResultsThe combination of these proteins effectively killed S. gordonii in a dose-dependent fashion after 8 or 24 hours of incubation. When each protein was tested individually, it killed S. gordonii at a much lower efficacy relative to the combinations. The synergistic effects of the antimicrobial protein combinations were also observed in both the viable cell count recovery and minimum inhibitory concentration assays.DiscussionBy shedding light on the mechanisms in the ACM’s antimicrobial property, this study may raise more awareness of the potential benefit of utilization of a membrane with endogenous antimicrobial properties in regeneration surgeries.

## The RNA m5C methyltransferase NSUN1 modulates human malaria gene expression during intraerythrocytic development

date: 2024-10-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionPlasmodium falciparum is the most damaging malaria pathogen and brings a heavy burden to global health. Host switching and morphological changes in P. falciparum are dependent on an effective gene expression regulatory system. C5 methylation of cytosines is a common RNA modification in eukaryotes, and the NSUN family are essential m5C modification executors. Currently, little is known about this family in Plasmodium spp. In this study, we focus on exploring the function of PfNSUN1 protein.MethodsAn efficient CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technique was applied to construct the PfNSUN1 knockdown strain. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed by growth curves and western blot experiments. The knockdown transcriptome data was acquired to find differentially expressed genes, and target genes of PfNSUN1 protein were identified by RNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing experiments.ResultsThe efficiency of PfNSUN1 protein down-regulated was about 34%. RNA-seq data revealed that differentially expressed genes were mainly down-regulated. And there were 224, 278, 556 genes that were down-regulated with more than 2-fold changes and p-adj<0.05 at ring, trophozoite and schizont stages, respectively. PfNSUN1 protein was significantly enriched on 154 target genes, including 28S ribosomal RNA and pfap2-g5 transcription factor.DiscussionPfNSUN1 is a crucial RNA post-transcriptional modification protein in P. falciparum. It plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression and parasite growth by targeting 28S ribosomal RNA and pfap2-g5 transcription factor.

## Antifungal susceptibility, molecular epidemiology, and clinical risk factors of Candida glabrata in intensive care unit in a Chinese Tertiary Hospital

date: 2024-10-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe increasing incidence and high mortality rate of Candida glabrata infection in ICU patients is an important issue. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the antifungal susceptibility profiles and epidemiological characteristics in local regions.MethodsHerein, antifungal susceptibility testing was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of eight antifungal drugs. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to study the strain genotype, geographical distribution, and susceptibility to antifungal agents among C. glabrata isolates. The mechanism of echinocandin resistance was explored by sequencing the FKS1 and FKS2 genes (encoding 1,3-β-D-glucan synthases) of echinocandin-resistant C. glabrata strains. Moreover, we further investigated the clinical manifestations and the various risk factors of patients infected with C. glabrata in the ICU.ResultsWe selected 234 C. glabrata isolates from 234 patients in the ICU randomly for the follow-up study. Cross-resistance was found among the ICU C. glabrata isolates. Analysis using MLST showed that the genetic diversity among the C. glabrata isolates was low. Furthermore, sequence type showed no correlation with the antifungal resistance profiles, but was associated with geographical distribution. We also revealed novel mutations in FKS1 (S629P) and FKS2 (W1497stop) that mediated high-level echinocandin resistance (MIC >8 µg/mL). More than 14 days’ stay in ICU (P=0.007), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) score (P=0.024), prior antifungal exposure (P=0.039) and lung disease (P=0.036) were significantly associated with antifungal resistant/non-wild-type C. glabrata infection.ConclusionOur study shed light on the antifungal susceptibility, molecular epidemiology, and clinical risk factors of C. glabrata in the ICU of a Chinese Tertiary Hospital. Importantly, we revealed the molecular mechanism of echinocandin resistance. These results highlight the significance of continued surveillance in ICUs and provide data support for the treatment of C. glabrata in clinics.
