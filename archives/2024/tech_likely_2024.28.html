<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: Michael Tsai</p>
<p>Tim Hardwick: According to Apple, research shows that motion sickness
is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and
what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using
iPhone or iPad while riding in a moving vehicle. Vehicle Motion Cues are
designed to avoid this sensory conflict with the […]</p>

<p>
We’re spending two nights in Murten or Morat. The lake is small with a
circumference of about 25km. <a href="2018-murten/index">A few years
ago</a> we ran around it – but today we ran about six or seven
kilometres before turning back. 13km is enough, these days. We’re both
out of shape, sadly.

<p>
Just after sunset, looking out over the lake.

<p>

</p>
<p>
Working on a half-enclosed patio until late into the night. There was
drunken shouting to be heard until midnight, on a Monday. I did not know
that this sleepy town was so rowdy!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-2.jpg" alt="" />

The town itself looks unchanged from our last visit in 2018.

We ran over to the eastern side of the lake, a protected wetland.

Our destination was this village at the foot of

rather small mountain.

It got rather hot so by the time we arrived in Sugiez, I was so very
tired.

Canals connect the lake of Murte, the lake of Neuchâtel and the lake of

up and down the channel. 🙄

<i>The problem is elites grabbing the wheel with no clue about what
comes next.</i>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/14/bidenActionFigure.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Every
Tuesday I look for Jon Stewart’s opening for the Daily Show on YouTube.
It’s always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he
says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing
President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the
people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice.
</p>
<p>
If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized
after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There’s never
been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on
organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue
about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren’t any
smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that’s been the
real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we’ve gotten the
tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And
now we’re at the last moment before it’s all flushed away and the NYT et
al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less.
</p>
<p>
Be warned I get really angry at the end and raise my voice. I don’t
think I’ve ever done that in a podcast, and I’m not sure I like it. But
the rage is real.

</h1>
<p>
We spent two nights in Neuenburg or Neuchâtel. They came under Prussian
control in 1707 because the locals were looking for a government that
was far away and wouldn’t meddle in their affairs. It became a republic
and a canton of Switzerland in 1848.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the death in 1707 of Marie d’Orleans-Longueville, duchess de Nemours
and Princess of Neuchâtel, the people had to choose her successor from
among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince first and foremost
to be a Protestant, and also to be strong enough to protect their
territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices.
Louis XIV actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but
the Neuchâtelois people passed them over in favour of King Frederick I
of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion
through the Houses of Orange and Nassau. With the requisite stability
assured, Neuchâtel entered its golden age, with commerce and industry
(including watchmaking and lace) and banking undergoing steady
expansion. –

<p>
We met a friend and went for a walk in the late afternoon: from La
Neuveville up the Combe du Pulouvi. I took some flower pictures.
</p>
<p>
At the new Jeunes Rives. It looked very nice but we did see a big dead
fish, belly up. That dampened our enthusiasm somewhat.

<h2 id="some-more-thoughts-on-tbc">Some more thoughts on TBC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I know, I know. You’re tired of hearing me ranting about The Browser Company and their Arc “browser”. I’m also tired of reading about them but I keep stumbling on news about this silly company and I can’t help myself from yelling at the screen. They aired a commercial on TV the other day, clearly a reasonable thing to do when you have a product with no revenues and no business model. And not happy with that, they released a YouTube video with the CEO explaining the ideas “hidden” in the commercial and that tells you how good at marketing these people are. If you need to release an almost 5-minute video to explain the meaning of a stupid 1-minute ad you probably need a better marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Anyway, leaving aside the pointlessness of this whole thing what
prompted me to write this post were some of the things the CEO said in
the video explainer which are so profoundly stupid that I find them
offensive. If you are an ARC user you should be offended too because he
must think you’re all a bunch of idiots.
</p>
<p>
He said in the video that there were three questions he wanted to ask:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What is this internet we want to live within?
</li>
<li>
What if the web were truly made for you?
</li>
<li>
What are we here for?
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>
What is this internet we want to live within? What do we want to create
for ourselves?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Just to make it clear, what this company is allegedly making is a
browser. It’s in their fucking name: The Browser Company. They’re not
making a new internet. They’re not creating anything. As I wrote before,
they’re not even making an actual browser like the awesome people at
<a href="https://ladybird.org">Ladybird</a>. They’re building a wrapper
around Chrome. This makes the CEO rant about browser monoculture even
more hilarious since by doing that they’re part of the problem.
</p>
<p>
In the video, he tries to argue that Silicon Valley companies are driven
by efficiency, you type something in Google and he gives you an answer
but there are times when you don’t want an answer, you want to get
access to the best set of results because you’re after experiences and
serendipity and a bunch of other complete nonsense. He asked, “Do we
even believe in a single answer?“. The answer is no Josh. No, we don’t.
This is why all search engines have a SERP. No search engine gives you
one answer.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A lot of other times something just seems really interesting to you and
you want to go wide and deep and be surprised there are a lot of other
things we might want to optimise for when we’re designing this new
internet
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Designing this new internet? You’re not designing a new internet. You’re
using some algorithm to decide for me which 6 or 8 results I should be
seeing. In doing that you’re worse than Google.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The second thing is what would it look like if truly the web was made
for you?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m gonna ask you a question Josh: how can you make a web for me without
profiling me? I’ll wait for an answer the same way I’m still waiting to
hear back from your support team on that ticket I opened months ago
where I was asking how to prevent your stupid ARC Search from accessing
my sites.
</p>
<p>
You asked “What does the personal web, the personal internet look like”
and there are various ways to tackle this question but it certainly
doesn’t look like a generated ARC Search result page that is the same
for everyone. You said the web doesn’t feel personal because we all see
the same stuff and yet you showed a screenshot of your stupid ARC Search
pulling in results from Reddit and Trip Advisor. Again, if you’re
reading this and you’re an ARC user, they must think you’re a complete
idiot to believe all this stuff.
</p>
<p>
As for the final question, what are we here for and why am I looking at
this video, well Josh, I work in tech. I code websites, I care about the
web. Especially the independent, personal one. The one you’re ranting
about but probably don’t care about at all. I also have to care about
your stupid browser because even though it’s Chrome sometimes it has
bugs that aren’t present on Chrome and so I have to test on it. I’d love
to not care about your browser and your stupid ARC Search but I have to
because this is the world I live in. My email is public if you want to
get in touch. You probably won’t because why would you, you have nothing
to gain from a private exchange after all.

special topic of the 1916

because he’s like obsessed with it, hahah. Tonight he’s explaining to me
at length how many layers there are to it: the class divide, the
sectarian divide between Protestants and Catholics in that era,
contested notions of masculinity (is it about going off to kill people
abroad, or staying home to play sport?)… honestly, he has me convinced,
it’s an interesting topic.

I loved the FinalCut Pro UI elements for entering rotation data. One
neat feature is that in addition to the swipe to choose an angle, if you
long-press the dial goes into high-precision input mode.

Guys, we have one of those Brother printers that are supposed to be so
solid and reliable, but it is not cooperating today. Keeps sending
itself to sleep mid-job and “going offline” so I have to physically walk
to it and turn it back on. “Printing” blank pages. When told to print a
three-page document (ONCE), it prints TWO copies of page 1 &amp; 2 then
skips page 3. That “just buy this Brother printer everyone has, it’s
fine” article lied to me.

<p>
First, install the <code>nncp</code> package on both systems. In
addition to that, install the <code>openbsd-inetd</code> package on the
server. (In the following passages, I’m connected as <code>root</code>
to the server.)
</p>
<p>
Generate new configs on the systems that are missing
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>
<p>
Examine the file using a text editor. Each system needs to know the
public keys of the other.
</p>
<p>
So, on the laptop, I need to add to add the public keys of the server. I
also want to specify that I’m going to call the node on a regular basis
and that files sent to me from that node should be saved in my
“incoming” directory. I also want to accept mail.

And on the server, I need to add the public keys of the laptop. I also
want to save incoming files from the laptop. And I want to accept mail.
</p>
<pre><code>    melanobombus: {

        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
Note how the laptop calls the server but the server does not call the
laptop!
</p>
<p>
Let’s make sure those directories exist:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/incoming
ssh sibirocobombus mkdir incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s create a file and send it from the laptop to the server using
<code>nncp-file</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>echo Hello &gt; hello.txt
sudo -u nncp nncp-file hello.txt sibirocobombus:
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the log using <code>nncp-log</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log | tail -n 1
2024-06-28T21:36:02Z File hello.txt (282 B) is sent to sibirocobombus:hello.txt
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s connect to the server and check:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Nothing has arrived!
</p>
<p>
Let’s call the server using <code>nncp-call</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:07:36Z ERROR Calling sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): dial tcp [2a02:418:6a04:178:209:50:237:1]:5400: connect: connection refused

<p>
Oops. It’s not running? That’s right, I need to run
<code>nncp-daemon</code> on the server side.
</p>
<p>
Add the following to <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> on the server to
accept NNCP connections on port 5400:
</p>
<pre><code>5400 stream  tcp nowait  nncp    /usr/local/bin/nncp-daemon  nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>
<p>
Reload it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload openbsd-inetd
</code></pre>
<p>
Try again on the laptop:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus

Strange! That id listed there matches my laptop’s <code>noisepub</code>.

that pasted the wrong pubkeys… 🤦 Fix that and try again…

Looking good! Check for the file on the server:

<p>
It’s not there!
</p>
<p>
Let’s investigate on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log

<p>
This looks good, so we have the packet! And we can confirm this using
<code>nncp-stat</code>:
</p>

<p>
What needs to happen now is “tossing” using <code>nncp-toss</code>. This
is, “processing” the packet and thereby delivering it.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-toss

you’ve lived much at all you know what Joni says is true. I got there
when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative
that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I’d never
see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No
way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we
cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn’t even
take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a
constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying
goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It’s why we’re
playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden’s presidency,
because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to
this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about
Biden’s flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The
problem isn’t that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were
to win, we’ll be right back here in another four years, and at that time
we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever
happens this year, what’s waiting for us is for most of us to wake up
from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It’s all
falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start
working together, intelligently, or else it’s over.</p>

<p>
This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the
corruption of American journalism. Most of the time we can turn our
attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House,
and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the
journalists, get away with it again.

<p>I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the
press on our democratic process that I’m pretty depressed about the
future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who
moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I
asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said
he’d never do it. If they tried to force him, he’d get a gun and shoot
them. This isn’t the first time I’ve heard that, and I called bullshit.
You’re never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won’t
do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath
and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally –
and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a
social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn’t believe you
are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can’t get
back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone
number). I’ve been through all these miserable processes. And none of
them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who
demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where
we’re headed, again.</p>

the next version of OSNews</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Despite being live since 1997, OSNews has had fairly few redesigns in
the grand scheme of things. If my memory serves me correctly, we’ve had
a grand total of 6 designs, and we’re currently on version 6, introduced
about 5 years ago because of unpleasant reasons. It’s now 2024, and for
a variety of reasons, we’re looking to work towards version 7 of our
almost 30 year old website, and we need help. I have a very clear idea
of what I want OSNews 7 to be like – including mockups. The general
goals are making the site visually simpler, reducing our dependency on
WordPress extensions, and reducing the complexity of our theme and
website elements to make it a bit easier for someone like me to change
small things without breaking anything. Oh and a dark mode that works.
Note that we’re not looking to change backends or anything like that –
WordPress will stay. If you have the WordPress, design, and developer
skills to make something like this a reality, and in the process shape
the visual identity of one of the oldest continuously running technology
news websites in the world, send me an email.</p>

<p>I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the
<a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an
incredible
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a>
to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news
sites. It’s more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site
updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge
next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the
full story. Maybe it was a mistake calling this a blogroll. I’m trying
to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and
use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for
themselves. In any case I’m thinking about what to do next with
FeedLand, which is what’s behind the blogroll software. It hasn’t lived
up to my hopes, and I don’t think it’s likely to. I may be done writing
software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years,
between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of
writing for others was not a success. So I’m thinking about how to wind
down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using
it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a
bit. It’s that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few
years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span

<h2 id="getting-the-most-out-of-twm-x11s-default-window-manager">Getting
the most out of TWM, X11’s default window manager</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Graham’s TWM page has been around for like two decades or so and
still isn’t even remotely as old as TWM itself, and in 2021 they
published an updated version with even more information, tips, and
tricks for TWM. The Tab Window Manager finds its origins in the lat
1980s, and has been the default window manager for the X Windowing
System for a long time, now, too. Yet, few people know it exists – how
many people even know X has a default window manager? – and even fewer
people know you can actually style it, too. OK, so TWM is fairly easy to
configure but alot of people, upon seeing the default config, scream
‘Ugh, thats awful!’ and head off to the ports tree or their distro
sources in search of the latest and greatest uber desktop environment.
There are some hardcore TWM fans and mimimalists however who stick
around and get to liking the basic feel of TWM. Then they start to mod
it and create their own custom dekstop. All part of the fun in Unix :).
↫ Graham’s TWM page I’ll admit I have never used TWM properly, and
didn’t know it could be themed at all. I feel very compelled to spend
some time with it now, because I’ve always liked the by-now classic
design where the right-click desktop menu serves as the central location
for all your interactions with the system. There are quite a few more
advanced, up-to-date forks of TWM as well, but the idea of sticking to
the actual default X window manager has a certain charm. I almost am too
afraid to ask, because the answer on OSNews to these sorts of questions
is almost always “yes” – do we have any TWM users in the audience? I’m
extremely curious to find out if TWM actually has a reason to exist at
this point, or if, in 2024, it’s just junk code in the X.org source
repository, because I’m looking at some of these screenshots and I feel
a very strong urge to give it a serious go.</p>

brief summary of click-to-raise and drag-and-drop interaction on X11
and Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>The goal is to be able to drag an icon from a background window
without immediately raising that window and obscuring the drop target
window when using the click-to-focus mode. This is a barebones
description of what needs to happen. It assumes familiarity with code,
protocols, etc. as needed. ↫ Quod Video The articles describes how to
get there using both X and Wayland, and it’s clear there’s still quite a
bit of work to do. At least on my KDE Wayland setups, the way it works
now is that when I click to drag an icon from a lower Dolphin window to
a higher one, it brings the lower window forward, but then, when I hover
for a bit over the other window, it brings it back up. Of course, this
only works if the destination window remains at least partially visible,
which might not always be the case. For usability’s sake, there needs to
be an option to start a drag operation from one window to the next
without altering the Z-order.</p>

In 1984 SCO released PC XENIX, a port of UNIX that ran on an IBM PC. To
understand why that’s such a technical feat, and how we even got here,
we have to go back to the late 1970s. In this episode we are taking a
look at how Microsoft got into the UNIX game, and how they repeatedly
struggled to make micro-UNIX work for them. Along the way we run into
vaporware, conspiracy, and the expected missing sources!

You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn’t
lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.
</p>
<p>
What you need to know:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We all knew this would happen.
</li>
<li>
We all saw it happen, we don’t need you to tell us.
</li>
<li>
We’re going with him anyway.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The plan is this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election – VP
Harris steps up.
</li>
<li>
Now everyone can relax.
</li>

I had a similar idea.
</p>
<p>
Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.
</p>
<p>
Let all the great next generation democrats shine.
</p>
<p>
Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.
</p>
<p>
Joe Biden dials in via satellite.
</p>
<p>
“Listen, I’m an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright
young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren’t
they wonderful!”
</p>
<p>
He puts on his robe and slippers, sits in a rocking chair with a dog at
his feet and his grandchildren playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">yahtzee</a> and
checkers…
</p>
<p>
And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn’t
spill his beer, so you know they have his back.
</p>
<p>
Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of
the Democratic Party.
</p>
<p>
Collect them all!
</p>
<p>
You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.
</p>
<p>
Some would be very rare.
</p>
<p>
Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack,
Michelle and Bill would have a concert.
</p>
<p>
Hosted by Mayor Pete!
</p>
<p>
Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.
</p>
<p>
Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift
wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit.
</p>
<p>
And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers.
</p>
<p>
Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and
the freedom fighters.
</p>
<p>
All the heroes of America, standing up for America.
</p>
<p>
The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course
Lynne Cheney.
</p>
<p>
We don’t need no freaking monarch, they all sing.
</p>
<p>
No we don’t! shouts the people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJBaIUZwmTs&t=43s">On
video</a>, the Dead sing “I’m Uncle Sam, how do you do!”
</p>
<p>
Shake the hand that shook the hand of PT Barnum and Charlie Chan.
</p>
<p>
We all march together to victory.
</p>

I should add that once you have this volume of photos, Apple Photos
really shines - for searching events, people, locations, themes,
memories; and also to search text of screenshots and memes.

Two things I just learned:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>the iCloud storage is in addition to your AppleOne subscription, so
I don’t need to buy the 6 TB tier yet, I only have to buy the additional
2TB to extent the 2TB I have from AppleOne.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>you can share the storage with your family (our family is 5, not
sure if Apple Storage is Utah-friendly)
</p></li>
</ul></li>

I wonder how your photo library compares to mine?
</p>
<p>
I always loved photos, but taking pictures and videos of the kids took
this to another level.

glad Biden is attacking journalists, he has a much bigger voice than I
do. If I had his influence I’d be saying the same things, though I
wouldn’t be as kind. It’s time to put the journalists back where they
belong, covering news, not trying to run the country.</p>

We were looking after this little guy (the dog, Patches) for the
weekend. He and Gidget got along so well! Very happy to sleep in close
proximity and be chill. I think Gidget is happy to be the only pet again
after Viv returned him home, though 😂
