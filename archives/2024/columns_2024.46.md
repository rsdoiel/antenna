## 2024-11-17 Everything is slow and I don't know why

date: 2024-11-17, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-17-everything-is-slow-and-i-don-t-know-why">2024-11-17 Everything is slow and I don&rsquo;t know why</h1>

<p>When I try to log into the server using SSH it takes a long time. Why is that?
<code>iotop</code> doesn&rsquo;t show anything suspicious. And yet, since Saturday 18:00, <code>munin</code>
shows that something is up.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-1.jpg" alt="System CPU goes up. Everything goes up!" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-2.jpg" alt="Disk IO goes up." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-3.jpg" alt="Throughput per device starts to be weird." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-4.jpg" alt="Utilisation per device goes up to 50%." /></p>

<p>I rebooted the server. &ldquo;Have you tried turning it off and on again?&rdquo; ü§∑</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p>And that seems to have worked.
I wonder what I did back then.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-5.jpg" alt="Saturday 18:00 shows users connecting (me). Doing something. Who knows what." /></p>

<p>I was clearly doing something!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I noticed: I uploaded a new version of the Norn bot, which had an error. I replaced it.
Was systemd spawning it again and again, spamming the journal? Is that what caused the problem?</p>

<p>This is very strange.</p>

<p>But‚Ä¶ rebooting helped!</p>

<p><strong>2024-11-18</strong>. Or did it? The initial connect to the web server still seems to take a second or five. Once the initial handshake is done, the site serves quickly. So what could it be? The problem seen above really is gone.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-6.jpg" alt="CPU is back to normal, lots of idle time." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-7.jpg" alt="Disk utilization is back to normal, nearly 0." /></p>

## Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst Buddy‚Äù is in deep shit 

date: 2024-11-17, from: Robert Reich's blog

If you&#8217;re advising a president-elect, you don&#8217;t publicly push him to do what you want. That&#8217;s true of any president-elect. It&#8217;s even truer of Trump.

I see it that way too. When <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/bob-woodward-on-ukraine-the-middle-east--the-election/">Brian Lehrer asked</a> a few weeks ago how the US got so divided of his guest Bob Woodward (a fascinating time capsule, recorded before the election) they both missed it. We were divided by an enemy that is on the cusp of destroying the US without launching a single nuke. Putin didn't have to invade Ukraine. I guess even he didn't think his plan would succeed so spectacularly. BTW, I don't think Trippi's network is the answer, but maybe it is. I wish I had had a chance to create the system he was using, we would make a good team. Anyway we need to be further along than his offering is. The right system would allow me to control my presence with only <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, in and out. Maybe not for everyone, to start, but it would allow us to start building. It's why I have been lobbying for inbound and outbound RSS as a back-end for all these networks. With the rise of Bluesky in the last couple of weeks (things are happening that fast now) we may have a new shot at it because Masto and Threads are certainly feeling it, and when people feel competed-with they are more open to new thinking.

If it's bought by someone who wants to use it the way Musk has, they can, without any recourse by the users. As they said in the old days, if you're getting something for free, you're the product, not the customer. We helped Musk build a way to excercise political power against our interests. You may think Bluesky is a way of fixing that, but it probably isn't. They're digging a deep hole, probably too deep to climb out of at this point. They did some innovative stuff, perhaps. But they ended up at the same place, it appears, as Twitter did.

## AMD Radeon PRO W7700 running on Raspberry Pi

<p>After <em>years</em> of work among a bunch of people in the Pi community (special callout to Coreforge!), we finally have multiple generations of AMD graphics cards working on the Raspberry Pi 5.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/use-external-gpu-on-raspberry-pi-5-4k-gaming">recently got Polaris-era GPUs working</a> (like the RX460), but in the past month we've gotten 6000 and 7000-series GPUs up and running. And many parts of the driver work at full performance‚Äîwell, as much as can be had on the Raspberry Pi's single PCIe Gen 3 lane (8 GT/sec)!</p>

<p>I've been testing tons of modern AAA games, like Doom Eternal and Crysis Remastered, and can get 10-15 fps at 4K with Ray Tracing on, or 15-20 fps at 4K. Dropping down to 1080p is not enough to overcome the Pi's CPU bottleneck‚Äîonly at resolutions under 720p does the Pi's CPU and the single PCIe lane not seem to get in the way <em>quite</em> as much.</p></div>

## Good Essay on the History of Bad Password Policies

date: 2024-11-15, updated: 2024-11-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Stuart Schechter makes some <a href="https://stuartschechter.org/posts/password-history/">good points</a> on the history of bad password policies:</p>
<blockquote><p>Morris and Thompson&#8217;s work brought much-needed data to highlight a problem that lots of people suspected was bad, but that had not been studied scientifically. Their work was a big step forward, if not for two mistakes that would impede future progress in improving passwords for decades.</p>
<p>First, was Morris and Thompson&#8217;s confidence that their solution, a password policy, would fix the underlying problem of weak passwords. They incorrectly assumed that if they prevented the specific categories of weakness that they had noted, that the result would be something strong. After implementing a requirement that password have multiple characters sets or more total characters, they wrote:...</p></blockquote>

If Trump aims to turn America into a police state, these are the officials he will utilize. After only 10 days as president-elect, he appears to be on his way.

I've been having a one-sided discussion with Bluesky asking they make their product less vulnerable to takeover by tech bros, and I can't tell if they're doing anything about it. They must be conflicted, on the one hand, they clearly could sell there service now for a lot of money, but when they do that they must know they're selling us out.

BTW, start thinking of WordPress as a highly networked, deployed, debugged, widely supported <b>network operating system</b>. It meets all the criteria. It also has storage. And can publish. And unlike other social web systems, it is textcasting-ready since it comes from the world of blogging where we competed to give writers the features they needed. We can build lots of apps on this foundation.

My goal is to speed up development and reduce wear and tear on me. Once we're confident it really works as advertised, we'll open up the testing further. There will be a form you can fill out to get in the queue. The choice of the first testers will be highly subjective.

## 2024-11-13 A big memex

date: 2024-11-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-13-a-big-memex">2024-11-13 A big memex</h1>

<p>How big are your memories? Some days they seem endless.
Perhaps you started using an external add-on brain, a memory extender (memex) ‚Äì a blog, like I did.
It&rsquo;s about 20 years old, now.
The <a href="archives">archives</a> show the first blog posts showed up in 2002.
I think I copied some entries over from Meatball, at the time.
So I&rsquo;m not entirely sure when this particular site started.</p>

<p>Back then, I was big into wikis.
I was a <a href="http://meatballwiki.org/">Meatball Wiki</a> regular.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">history of blogs</a> show that they entered the mainstream around 2004.
I thought they were for people who couldn&rsquo;t edit and couldn&rsquo;t collaborate.
The text is written and then sinks to the bottom to join the forgotten posts of the past.
Wiki pages, on the other hand, were forever!</p>

<p>This site started as a wiki.
And then something happened: I realized that the things I wanted to write under one heading changed over time.
Sometimes I changed my mind.
Sometimes I cared for a different aspect.
I realized that I couldn&rsquo;t go back to edit the old pages and just replace the old words with the new words.
I wanted to capture this slow churn.</p>

<p>All of this came back to me when <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@somi" title="@somi@merveilles.town">@somi</a> asked on fedi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for those that maintain personal wikis by hand, how do you approach it generally? Do you try and associate pages by topic? Do you maintain some sort of hierarchical table-of-contents? Maybe you tag stuff? Do you put it all in one big bag?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now you know what happened.
My site started as a wiki and has drifted towards a blog.</p>

<p>How it works:
The blog posts are wiki pages starting with an ISO date.
These pages are automatically added to the front page.</p>

<p>Pages have hashtags and if a page with that name exists (not all hashtag pages exist) then a link from the hashtag page back to the tagged blog post gets added automatically.
The result is that every hashtag page has a subset of my blog posts, gathering all the blog posts for that particular topic.</p>

<p>If I write about a thing, I use hashtags.
After a while I might think that I&rsquo;ve written so much about this topic, time to create a dedicated page for this hashtag.
I add a list of links to existing pages with that tag and from now on pages with this hashtag get added automatically.</p>

<p>Visitors (and I) can visit the hashtag page to see how my writing about the topic has evolved (or not).</p>

<p>I think the big driver of this is that my memex is over twenty years old and has thousands of pages.
Going back to old pages to update them does not works for me. üòß</p>

<p>Writing more about a topic, and linking old and new does work.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Wikis">#Wikis</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Blogs">#Blogs</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddmu">#Oddmu</a></p>

There isn‚Äôt a single social web network that I like pouring my creativity into. I feel like I‚Äôm being used not appreciated. There‚Äôs nothing in it for me. I had a similar feeling for Twitter, but they were the only one. Now there are a bunch, and I honestly don't care about any of them, esp now that the election is over. I think this whole idea of feeding the greed of a bunch of tech people is over. If there's a good place to gather, with a small number of people I relate to as people, then I'm up for that, but none of these services meet that need.

## Are you the nerd of the year??

date: 2024-11-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Whenever you ask for something with Bluesky they tell you about how a user account is like a website, you just have to make it work a certain way, that some devs have mastered, and I guess I could too, but right now all my attention is focused on WordPress and getting it to work well with ActivityPub so my editor can get directly into the Mastodon network and possibly with Threads too. </p>
<p>But what about Bluesky which is growing like a weed now??</p>
<p>It might be easy for the right person.</p>
<ol>
<li>Come up with an interface that makes it so that a WordPress blog is just a user on the Bluesky network.</li>
<li>They have a nice API, I've just spent a year implementing on top of it. I imagine for someone who knows both WordPress and Bluesky this might be a weekend project? </li>
<li>Do it, and blow our minds! There's a lot of content out there in WordPress and a lot of people publish on it.  </li>
<li>And the best part of it is that it totally drives adoption of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> which is my not so hidden agenda. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></li>
<li>And for the people who are starting to think it's only an ActivityPub thing, think again. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you do this you might not win the Nobel Peace Prize but you will be Nerd of the Year in my book! </p>

I am working on a text editor for WordPress using MediumEditor, but I save the text in Markdown and when I reload the Markdown text I regenerate the HTML. I think the social web should exchange Markdown as the canonical form of web text. It has the right set of features, it's <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/08/25/210902.html">Just Enough HTML</a>.

ChatGPT can't remember my coding conventions. It always falls back to using features of JavaScript I told it not to use. I indent my code according to the way it works in an outliner, so I can't use their code without having to manually modify it. I haven't forgotten that I'm the human and it's the computer. Its memory is supposed to be perfect. And I am a paying customer, btw.

## 2024 is different from 2016

date: 2024-11-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/13/mobIncited.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">It's good to have a record of the things you posted and when you posted it. On August 12 of this year, I tweeted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3kzjvirjq3d2q">this</a>: "When the NYT makes Trump sound like a reasonable candidate that a sane person might vote for, remember this day." I included a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/13/trumpIncitesMob.png">screen shot</a> of the front page of the NYT on Jan 7, 2021. One in three Trump voters still <a href="https://x.com/froomkin/status/1856384929476624841">watch mainstream news</a>, which follows the lead of the NYT, and if they had been straight with us, perhaps enough people who like Trump's style would have realized the danger, and voted in a conservative way, ie to conserve the Constitution. Because of how they covered it, we now get to re-run the 2016 experiment all over again. </p>
<p>But, as <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trump-won-what-now-with-heather-cox-richardson/id1583132133?i=1000676185735">Heather Cox Richardson</a> points out in Jon Stewart's weekly podcast (a must-listen) -- we have more experience too, and perhaps will know better how to deal with Trump and know that <b>his bark is often worse than his bite.</b> I have to say as the new reality sinks in, I'm not as scared as I was on Election Night last week or even Election Night in 2016. A lot of people will sell out this time who didn't before. But the problems of climate change have gotten worse in the intervening years,  and people feel it in their bones, pocketbooks and fears. You think inflation was bad? This will be far worse and it's happening now, and nothing we can do at a human scale will make it go away. </p>
<p>We're dealing with a very unusual drought in the eastern US now. Fires are breaking out where we never used to have them. Yeah this shit is real, and even people who don't believe in science are feeling it. </p>
<p>As someone once said, you should <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/xdc8t4/never_let_a_good_crisis_go_to_waste/">never waste a good crisis</a>. A lot of other people feel compelled to move. Unfortunately some are moving to the wrong place, as they always do. Making change isn't easy, but is possible, if you understand how people move. As they try to figure out what the Dem's failed at, that's it. </p>
<p>Skate to where the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/1bvv11l/i_skate_to_where_the_puck_is_going_to_be_not/">puck will be</a>, not where it was, as another famous philosopher once said. And people don't listen to their friends, they listen to their competitors (which I said, sadly, but then put that fact to use to get various standards to fly by without debate). There is a method to human madness, in other words, imho.</p>

## Social media platforms should make it easier to add alternative text using an [Alt: description] syntax

date: 2024-11-13, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

Adding alternative texts to images on social platforms is not a &#8220;nice thing to have&#8221; but important to not lock people out. That&#8217;s why it is a shame that it is quite tricky to do it across different platforms. Personally I use Twitter, BlueSky, Mastodon and LinkedIn and the following video shows just how much [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-11-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Update: My guess is that they haven't released enough code to run a Bluesky of your own, because all the answers from people who say they know say the same thing -- "It doesn't work that way." You <i>could</i> write your own, but if we were to do that, why use their one-off API, use a standard instead, and we might have a chance to interop with other systems in a meaningful way. I don't blame them for wanting to cash out, but I do blame them for conning people into believing it's some kind of escape. Until I hear otherwise Bluesky is a dead-end, not worth investing your hope in. If you're migrating from Twitter this is no better. Keep looking. But I promise to let you know if I get any info that changes my opinion, so if I've got it wrong, people from Bluesky, just answer the freaking question in the post at the top of this page. Thanks.

## M4 Mac mini's efficiency is incredible

date: 2024-11-12, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">M4 Mac mini's efficiency is incredible</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I had to pause some of my work getting <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/680">a current-gen AMD graphics card running on the Pi 5</a> and <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/52">testing a 192-core AmpereOne server</a> to quickly post on the M4's efficiency.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/m4-mac-mini-on-desk.jpg" alt="M4 Mac mini on desk"></p>

<p>I expected M4 to be better than M1/M2 (I haven't personally tested M3), and I hoped it would at least match the previous total-system-power efficiency king, a tiny arm SBC with an RK3588 SoC... but I didn't expect it to jump forward <em>32%</em>. Efficiency gains on the Arm systems I test typically look like 2-5% year over year.</p>

<p>The M4 mini I just bought reaches <strong>6.74 Gflops/W</strong> on the HPL benchmark.</p>

<p>I can get 283 Gflops at 42W, versus 264 at 66W on my M1 Max Mac Studio (for a round 4.00 Gflops/W).</p></div>

One click? That would be awesome. We need to have <i>thousands</i> of these running. If it really is like the web, as they say it is, then it should be like the web in every way. There are lots of websites. If you sell your website to a billionaire, that has no effect on my website. Right now we are totally vulnerable to the Bluesky folk selling their service to another country, or <i>our</i> country for that matter -- or a billionaire, or whoever.

## Popular Rockchip SBC distro in limbo after maintainer burns out

## Criminals Exploiting FBI Emergency Data Requests

date: 2024-11-12, updated: 2024-11-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about the problem with lawful-access backdoors in encryption for decades now: that as soon as you create a mechanism for law enforcement to bypass encryption, the bad guys will use it too.</p>
<p>Turns out the same thing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/fbi-says-hackers-are-sending-fraudulent-police-data-requests-to-tech-giants-to-steal-peoples-private-information/">is true</a> for non-technical backdoors:</p>
<blockquote><p>The advisory said that the cybercriminals were successful in masquerading as law enforcement by using compromised police accounts to send emails to companies requesting user data. In some cases, the requests cited false threats, like claims of human trafficking and, in one case, that an individual would &#8220;suffer greatly or die&#8221; unless the company in question returns the requested information...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-11-10 Weltensegler

date: 2024-11-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-10-weltensegler">2024-11-10 Weltensegler</h1>

<p>Wir haben letzthin im <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/Internet%20Office%20Hours">Internet Office Hours Podcast</a> wieder √ºber Traveller geredet. <a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@hasran" title="@hasran@rollenspiel.social">@hasran</a> meinte zu Beginn der Sendung: Schreiben wir einen Traveller Klon und wann tun wir das? Ich denke auch, dass wir ein kurzes, einfaches Regelwerk brauchen.</p>

<p>Jetzt haben wir damit angefangen. Ich habe es <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/index">Weltensegler</a> genannt.</p>

<p>Unser Zielbild, f√ºr den Moment:</p>

<p>Hasran: &ldquo;Als Spiel soll Weltensegler erm√∂glichen, eigene Welten und Abenteuer im Stile klassischer Science Fiction Literatur erlebbar zu machen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ich: &ldquo;Weltensegler soll ein relativ kurzes 2W6 basiertes Science Fiction Rollenspiel sein, auf Deutsch, f√ºr alles von Star Wars bis Perry Rhodan, von Star Trek bis Dune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wir sind beide grosse Fans vom urspr√ºnglichen Classic Traveller Ger√ºst. Also haben wir damit mal angefangen: <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/figuren">Personagenerschaffung</a>, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/erfahrung">Berufserfahrung</a>, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/karriere">Karrieren</a>. Es fehlen noch ein paar Tabellen aber grunds√§tzlich steht schon einiges. Und wenn wir nicht weiter wissen, hilft uns <a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> mit Traveller 5 Erfahrung. üòÑ</p>

<p>Allerdings habe ich f√ºr mich beschlossen, dass ich f√ºr Weltensegler bei den Regeln bleiben will, die ich am Tisch schon verwendet habe. Erstaunlicherweise waren das nie die Preislisten. Viel wichtiger war der Tech Level der Welt und das wars. Ausr√ºstung war geschenkt, gesponsert, geklaut, aus dem Ship Locker, oder aus der Lebensgeschichte heraus gegeben. Ich glaube, ich habe als Spieler nur einmal eine Sonnenbrille f√ºr 100 Cr. gekauft, mehr nicht. Entsprechend habe ich unter Ausr√ºstung eine Seite f√ºr <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/feudalismus">Wirtschaft ohne Geld</a> erstellt.</p>

<p>Aus dem gleichen Grund habe ich auch noch nie ein Schiff nach den Regeln zusammengebaut. Mal schauen, wie es bei Hasran aussieht. Ich glaube jedenfalls, dass er schon gerne Preislisten h√§tte.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23RSP">#RSP</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Traveller">#Traveller</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Weltensegler">#Weltensegler</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-11-12</strong>. Gestern mal ein PDF generiert. Es sind schon 35 Seiten! Von wegen &ldquo;kurz&rdquo;. Oje!</p>

<p>Und bez√ºglich Schiffsbauregeln habe ich gestern Zeit damit verbraten, ein Universelles Schiffsprofil zu machen. Die Idee ist, jedes Schiff in 6 Ziffern fassen zu k√∂nnen. Sagen wir: Irgendwie gibt es eine Gr√∂sse und einen Preis, die ein &ldquo;Budget&rdquo; vorgibt und einen Technologielevel, der Maximalwerte vorgibt. Dabei ist zu beachten, dass der Bau von Raumschiffen mit Technologielevel 10 beginnt.</p>

<p>Vorschlag: <strong>Gr√∂sse</strong> (1‚ÄìF), <strong>Sprungweite</strong> (1‚Äì5), <strong>Geschwindigkeit</strong> (ungerade Zahlen = Landung m√∂glich), <strong>Computer</strong>, <strong>Personen</strong>, <strong>Gesch√ºtze</strong>. Es braucht entweder eine Person oder einen Computer f√ºr folgende Rollen: Falls Sprungweite gegeben, Navigator; falls Geschwindigkeit gegeben, Pilot; falls Sprungweite oder Geschwindigkeit gegeben, Kraftmaschinen; pro Gesch√ºtz, Artillerie; pro 10 weiteren Personen, Gastronomie.</p>

<ul>
<li>100101 ‚Äì ein Gesch√ºtzturm mit einem Feuerleitcomputer</li>
<li>105111 - ein J√§ger der Chasseur-Klasse, ohne Sprungtriebwerk, schnell, kann landen, ein Pilot, ein Gesch√ºtzturm mit einem Feuerleitcomputer</li>
<li>205122 - ein Bomber der Incendi√®re-Klasse, ohne Sprungtriebwerk, schnell, kann landen, ein Pilot, zwei Gesch√ºtzt√ºrme mit einem Feuerleitcomputer und einem Artilleristen</li>
<li>100010 ‚Äì eine Rettungskapsel der Sauveur-Klasse f√ºr eine Person, kann nicht springen, sich nicht bewegen, nicht landen</li>
<li>301150 ‚Äì eine Raumf√§hre der Navette-Klasse f√ºr den Transport zwischen Raumstation und Oberfl√§che, kann nicht springen, ist langsam aber kann landen, ein Computer, ein Pilot, viel Platz f√ºr Personen, keine Gesch√ºtze</li>
</ul>

<p>Und so weiter. Wie viele Personen schlussendlich eine 5 bei der Navette bedeutet, braucht wohl eine Tabelle. Oder sind es 2‚Åµ also 32 minus Pilot = 31 Passagiere? Falls es Laderaum gibt, k√∂nnten es dann weniger Personen sein. Und warum das jetzt der Gr√∂sse 3 entspricht, ist mir auch nicht klar. Irgendwas mit Quadrat, Kubik, Exponent und Quersummen?</p>

## MNT Reform 2 - CPU update

It is not represented online 7-by-24-by-12 every year, not just presidential election years. Democrats, when you lose it's because you didn't show up. It's happened three times so far, at least. We could have led here because most of the innovators in this space vote Democratic, but the leadership doesn't listen. The voters could get to know all the stars of the parties. People were right when they said they didn't know Harris. It's time to let the leaders rise from the net, not just from the insiders. This is how you do it.
