You walk over to the shelf with the books on and you sign them. Then you walk away.

## Adrienne Martini Reviews Lyorn by Steven Brust

date: 2024-06-23, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Lyorn: A Vlad Taltos Novel</strong>, Steven Brust (Tor 978-0-76538-286-3, $27.99, 288pp, hc) April 2024.</p>
<p>Before you read further know this: <strong>Lyorn</strong>, the 17th novel in Steven Brust’s Vlad Taltos series, is not the place to begin. So much has happened to Vlad since <strong>Jhereg </strong>was published in 1983 that there is really no way to jump directly into this part of the ocean. Even for those who’ve kept  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/06/adrienne-martini-reviews-lyorn-by-steven-brust/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

I'm in a verrrrry long slooooow line to get to airport security because The Computer has randomly decided to withdraw TSA precheck ability from this boarding pass. But because my original flight was cancelled/rebooked my plane won't take off for 6 hours, so I am not experiencing Airport Stress.

date: 2024-06-23, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Mood Swings</strong>, Frankie Barnet (Astra House, 978-1-66260-259-7, $26.00, 304pp, hc) May 2024.</p>
