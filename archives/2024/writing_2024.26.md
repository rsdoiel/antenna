## Jake Casella Brookins Reviews The Years Shall Run Like Rabbits by Ben Berman Ghan

date: 2024-06-24, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong> The Years Shall Run Like Rab­bits, </strong>Ben Berman Ghan (Buckrider Books 978-1-98949-688-6, 300pp, $21.00, tp) May 2024.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I really enjoy speculative fiction that works more by image and dream logic than plot and worldbuilding. Not to say Ben Berman Ghan’s <strong>The Years Shall Run Like Rabbits </strong>lacks those traditional elements: The ingredients here are quite recognizable – deadly cyborgs and lunar colonies, time travel and genetic engineering. But Ghan  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/06/jake-casella-brookins-reviews-the-years-shall-run-like-rabbits-by-ben-berman-ghan/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## SF in Bulgaria & Romania: How Many Dwarfs Does It Take to Match a Giant? by Valentin D. Ivanov & Cristian Tamaș

date: 2024-06-24, from: Locus Magazine

<p></p>
<p>Outside of the vast English-speaking fandom lies a tapestry of diverse and weakly interlinked communities from the countries with small language bases. These languages, and the nations that speak them are often – because of inertia, rather than ill intent – perceived as “minor.” Indeed, they are minor in one critical aspect: as literary markets. This circumstance has a profound effect on their literature. Speculative fiction, with sales an order  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/06/sf-in-bulgaria-romania-how-many-dwarfs-does-it-take-to-match-a-giant-by-valentin-d-ivanov-cristian-tamas/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

You walk over to the shelf with the books on and you sign them. Then you walk away.

## Adrienne Martini Reviews Lyorn by Steven Brust

date: 2024-06-23, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Lyorn: A Vlad Taltos Novel</strong>, Steven Brust (Tor 978-0-76538-286-3, $27.99, 288pp, hc) April 2024.</p>
<p>Before you read further know this: <strong>Lyorn</strong>, the 17th novel in Steven Brust’s Vlad Taltos series, is not the place to begin. So much has happened to Vlad since <strong>Jhereg </strong>was published in 1983 that there is really no way to jump directly into this part of the ocean.

I'm in a verrrrry long slooooow line to get to airport security because The Computer has randomly decided to withdraw TSA precheck ability from this boarding pass. But because my original flight was cancelled/rebooked my plane won't take off for 6 hours, so I am not experiencing Airport Stress.

## Ian Mond Reviews Mood Swings by Frankie Barnet

date: 2024-06-23, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Mood Swings</strong>, Frankie Barnet (Astra House, 978-1-66260-259-7, $26.00, 304pp, hc) May 2024.</p>
<p><strong>The Ministry of Time </strong>wears its time travel on its literary sleeve. Frankie Barnet’s debut novel, <strong>Mood Swings</strong>, isn’t nearly as overt. In fact, it begins with the world in lockdown – not because of the pandemic (though I did get flashbacks) but because animals have turned on humanity. “Wasps targeted small children and the elderly;  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/06/ian-mond-reviews-mood-swings-by-frankie-barnet/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
