John and Craig finally become writing partners and edit the opening to one chapter of the upcoming Scriptnotes book live on-air.

## Niall Harrison Reviews In Universes by Emet North

date: 2024-07-23, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>In Universes</strong>, Emet North (HarperCollins 978-0-06331-487-0, 240pp, $26.99, hc) April 2024.</p>
<p>Much like time travel, the multiverse, as a scientifi­cally originated but unproven theory, can be used as a narrative conceit with varying degrees of rigour. For every <strong>Timescape </strong>a <strong>Doctor Who</strong>; for every <strong>Anathem </strong>an <strong>Everything Everywhere All at Once</strong>. I don’t think a work’s placement on this spectrum is a predictor of its quality, but  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/07/niall-harrison-reviews-in-universes-by-emet-north/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Ian Mond Reviews The Cautious Traveller’s Guide to The Wastelands by Sarah Brooks

date: 2024-07-22, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Cautious Traveller’s Guide to The Waste­lands</strong>, Sarah Brooks (Flatiron Books 978-1-25087-861-8, $28.99, 336pp, hc) June 2024.</p>
<p>I was surprised to discover that there are few novels, vintage or contemporary, set on the Trans-Siberian Express. There are plenty of memoirs and travel guides, but, unlike the Orient Express, with its Agatha Christies and Graham Greenes, very little fiction. The irony is that Sarah Brook’s eerie debut novel, <strong>The Cautious </strong> <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/07/ian-mond-reviews-the-cautious-travellers-guide-to-the-wastelands-by-sarah-brooks/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
