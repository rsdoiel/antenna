There’s a lot to consider when thinking about how your screenplay will
be received by a reader. A producer may consider budget, a director
might think about how the script translates visually and a screenwriting
competition judge will most likely be looking to see if the writer’s
voice stands out. But what does a casting director look for? Knowing
that getting the right actor in the lead role can make or break your
movie, we sat down with casting director
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0961027/">David Guglielmo CSA</a>,
to find out how to make an impact on the person who could be most
critical to getting that greenlight.

<strong>The Bright Sword</strong>, Lev Grossman (Viking
978-0-73522-404-9, $35.00, 688pp, hc) June 2024.
</p>
<p>
In a “Historical Note” to his new novel <strong>The Bright Sword
</strong>(his first adult novel since wrapping up The Magicians
trilogy), Lev Grossman remarks that people have been re-working and
re-inventing King Arthur’s story for nearly 1,400 years. As he
poetically puts it, the legend has “never been told quite the same way
twice. Every age and

id="how-prowritingaid-integrates-with-scrivener-to-check-your-grammar">How
ProWritingAid Integrates with Scrivener to Check Your Grammar</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;In a recent article, we looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/why-you-might-want-to-use-online-spelling-and-grammar-checkers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;why you might want to use an online spelling and grammar checker&lt;/a&gt;. While Scrivener&amp;#39;s built-in spell checker, on both Mac and Windows, is very efficient, checking grammar is much more complicated than simply finding words that are not in a dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Online spelling and grammar checkers are much more powerful than the
tools built into computer operating systems. They use different
algorithms, based on extensive data sets, which allow them to spot the
type of errors that writers may miss.
</p>
<p>
One tool we mentioned in the article is
<a href="https://prowritingaid.com" target="_blank">ProWritingAid</a>,
which can interface directly with Scrivener. In the recent update of
ProWritingAid, the ProWritingAid Everywhere app for
<a href="https://prowritingaid.com/everywhere-download-windows" target="_blank">Windows</a>
and
<a href="https://prowritingaid.com/everywhere-download-mac" target="_blank">Mac</a>
interfaces directly with Scrivener, providing live corrections as you
write. You could use ProWritingAid as a real-time spelling and grammar
checker, or turn it on when you've finished a scene, chapter, or draft
to do a full check of your project. You'll need a
<a href="https://prowritingaid.com/pricing" target="_blank">Premium or
Premium Pro account</a> to benefit from this tool.
</p>
<p>How ProWritingAid Desktop Everywhere works with Scrivener</p>
<p>
In previous versions, ProWritingAid was a standalone app that would
allow you to
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/check-grammar-in-your-scrivener-projects-with-prowritingaid" target="_blank">open
your Scrivener projects and check spelling and grammar</a>, but you
needed to close Scrivener to use its features.
</p>
<p>
Now, ProWritingAid interfaces directly with Scrivener while you work on
your project. It displays a small icon above the side of your Scrivener
window and lets you know if there are any corrections. If the icon is
pink, that means that ProWritingAid has recommendations for changes. If
it's green, then you've made or dismissed all the corrections it
suggests.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Tip</strong>: you can drag the ProWritingAid to any location
at the top, bottom, or either side of the Scrivener window, so it
doesn't get in your way.</em>
</p>
<p>
ProWritingAid shows corrections by underlining them in various colors.
If you hover your cursor over a suggestion, ProWritingAid displays a
dialog offering to correct the error, ignore it, disable the rule, or,
for a spelling error, add it to its dictionary. You'll find that
ProWritingAid flags many proper names as errors, and you can easily add
them to your dictionary, so you'll only be notified if you've actually
misspelled them.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/pwa-add-to-dictionary.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;If you click the ProWritingAid icon, a window displays showing the number of mistakes in the various categories that the app checks. This gives you an idea of what to work on, whether it be grammar and spelling, sentence length, readability, dialogue tags, weak adverbs, and more. Clicking the gear icon at the bottom right of the ProWritingAid window takes you to the ProWritingAid website, where you can enable or disable any of these 25 categories.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    






            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/pwa-error-window.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;396&quot; /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;At the top of the floating window is a menu where you can choose the writing type of your work: options include general writing academic, business, technical, and a variety of creative genres, such as general fiction, fantasy, romance, science fiction, and more. This choice helps you refine the type of suggestions that ProWritingAid makes.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    






            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/pwa-style.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;396&quot; /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;In some cases, ProWritingAid can suggest rephrasing bits of text. This is often the case for writing in the passive mode, wordy phrases, or other types of grammar that aren&amp;#39;t incorrect, but that may hinder readability. If you click Suggest Rephrases, ProWritingAid will offer a variant that you can accept or refuse. You can click Ignore at any time to tell ProWritingAid that you don&amp;#39;t like its changes.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    






            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/pwa-rephrase.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;496&quot; /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;You may also see suggestions that you don&amp;#39;t agree with or don&amp;#39;t want to use in a specific piece of writing or project. If this is the case, click Disable Rule, and ProWritingAid will no longer mark this type of wording as erroneous. You can always go back to ProWritingAid&amp;#39;s settings, by clicking the gear icon in the ProWritingAid window, and re-enable any rules you have disabled.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
ProWritingAid offers 25 detailed reports that you can access by hovering
your cursor over the ProWritingAid icon, and then clicking the icon that
looks like a text file with a star at its corner.
</p>
<p>
Click Summary to get an overview of these reports; a larger window opens
with a sidebar that lets you drill down into these reports, or click an
individual report to see its data.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/pwa-reports.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;396&quot; /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;Naturally, you shouldn&amp;#39;t take all of these suggestions or reports as gospel. If you write fiction, your writing style may not fit with ProWritingAid&amp;#39;s algorithm, but this tool can give you suggestions that may improve your writing. As mentioned above, you may not want to have ProWritingAid active all the time as you&amp;#39;re writing; it can be a distraction. If you click the ProWritingAid icon, then the eye icon, you can disable ProWritingAid. Click the icon again to enable it. And if you click the ProWritingAid icon and then the gear icon, you can disable the app for an hour or entirely. You can re-enable it at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    






            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/pwa-disable.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;317&quot; /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;ProWritingAid is a useful tool to check your spelling and grammar and to ensure a consistent style. The app offers &lt;a href=&quot;https://prowritingaid.com/en/App/StyleGuides&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a detailed range of style guide settings&lt;/a&gt;, and lets you customize many of its suggestions.
