id="fluted-cabinets-are-in-style-heres-how-you-can-do-it-yourself">Fluted
Cabinets Are In Style – Here’s How You Can Do It Yourself</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: Family Handyman Blog</p>
<p>
When we built our kitchen, we were on a very limited budget. But one
aspect I was adamant about was not having those cookie-cutter cabinets
found at every big box store. The problem was, those are the most
affordable and easiest to find. So, one option we considered was to buy
them anyway, then turn them into fluted cabinets — and that’s an idea
that happens to be trending with a lot of others now, too.
</p>
<p>
“Fluted cabinetry is popular lately because it’s a great way to add
style and pizzazz to your kitchen,” says Josh Rudin, owner of
<a href="https://www.asaprestoration247.com/service-areas/water-damage-restoration-mesa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASAP
Restoration</a>. “One of the speculations as to why is because their
design is more intricate and, therefore, a bit more expensive upfront.
This can make them a display option to one-up neighbors and friends, but
many people also choose this design for its unique look.”
</p>
<p>
But you don’t have to spend a fortune to get that characteristic look.
Chances are, many of the cabinets around your home are pretty easy to
DIY into something more interesting and textured, like fluting. Here’s
how.
</p>
<h2>
What Are Fluted Cabinets?
</h2>
<p>
Fluted cabinets have smooth, rounded grooves on the cabinet faces. They
tend to run vertically and are usually pressed or routed in. They can
also be made by adding half-round on top of an existing cabinet door.
</p>
<p>
People often choose fluted cabinets because of their soft, wave-like
Mid-Century Modern look, which is also reminiscent of Greek or Roman
architecture.
</p>
<p>
“They are becoming more popular because people are putting more value
into personalizing their homes and steering away from more
conventional-looking spaces,” says Drew Mansur, director of
<a href="https://tilecloud.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TileCloud</a>.
“These cabinets will add an artisanal touch to the room while still
maintaining a sense of modernity.”
</p>
<h2>
How to DIY Fluted Cabinets
</h2>
<p>
There are several ways to go about making fluted cabinets. “If you have
some DIY experience, this job won’t be too hard,” says Mansur. ” The
important part is to make sure you don’t rush, and to give yourself time
to get the best results.”
