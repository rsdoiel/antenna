<p>Which reminds me. I had a family member whose executor was their
lawyer. By the time they died the lawyer was suffering from dementia,
which meant that sorting out the estate was arduous, long and
unnecessarily complex. (I learned as the years passed that there is no
easy way to remove an executor.)</p>

“One of the main things I’ve learned from Shonda [Rhimes] is to focus on
what you really want to see, yourself, in a season. Not necessarily what
should happen. I remember on <em>Scandal</em>, in the writers room, we
would craft what we thought were these perfectly structured stories. And
Shonda would come in and pitch something that was really wild, kind of
out there and maybe didn’t fit perfectly into the structure,” says Jess
Brownell, showrunner for <em>Bridgerton</em> Season 3.  “Ultimately,
when the show aired, that would always be the thing that Twitter would
light up about. So it’s taught me to work from that place first. Don’t
just worry about, ‘Okay, what are the beats that make sense to get from
A to B?,’ but ‘What’s juicy? What do you want to see?’”

<h2 id="how-to-give-and-receive-feedback-on-creative-writing">How to
Give and Receive Feedback on Creative Writing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;When someone asks for your feedback on a piece of writing, whether it is a short story or a novel, remember that the writer requesting feedback has spent a lot of time laboring over their words, and respect the fact that they are choosing you for your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
When you seek feedback for a piece of writing, it’s important that the
feedback you receive is helpful. Telling your beta reader what sort of
feedback you expect can ensure that the feedback is pertinent. Here’s
how to give and receive feedback on your novel or short story.
</p>
<p>The importance of feedback</p>
<p>
While part of the writing journey is discovering the story that is
within the writer, it’s only when stories resonate with readers that a
piece of writing is successful. While you may not intentionally write to
please others, the goal of telling a story is to engage the people who
read it. The best way to know if your story or novel works is to find
out what readers think.
</p>
<p>
There are many ways to find beta readers, people who read your work to
give feedback before you send it out to an agent, editor, or
publication. You may ask friends, family members, fellow authors, or you
may
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-find-beta-readers" target="_blank">seek
out beta readers in other ways</a>.
</p>
<p>
As a writer, you may be asked to give feedback on the work of other
writers, especially if you are in a writing group where people exchange
feedback, or you work with a critique partner. When different people
read your manuscript, they may see things that you don’t notice, because
you’ve been seeing them for so long. It’s always useful to get opinions
on your writing, even if you may not agree with the feedback.
</p>
<p>How to request feedback</p>
<p>
When you request feedback for a novel or story, you shouldn’t just send
it to someone without giving some guidelines. Here are some elements you
might wish the feedback to address:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Is the work enjoyable, and did the reader feel the urge to keep reading? Did they want to turn the pages and get to the end?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Are the characters believable, and are the main characters&amp;rsquo; motivations clear?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Do the settings feel real?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is anything over-described?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Does the dialog feel authentic?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is the plot believable and does the resolution make sense?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Are sentences, paragraphs, or chapters too long or too short? Does the prose flow, or does it feel choppy?&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Also, ask your reader to mention any specific points that stand out that
you haven’t covered.
</p>
<p>
It’s best to ask your reader not to say anything about typos unless they
interfere with the story. You will have to do several editing passes of
your manuscript, and you should be able to find these yourself.
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/why-you-might-want-to-use-online-spelling-and-grammar-checkers" target="_blank">You
may even want to use an online grammar checker</a>, chapter by chapter,
to spot this sort of mistake. It’s not a good idea for your beta reader
to get bogged down in minor details. What’s more important is hearing
what they think about the story, the characters, the flow, the pacing,
and all the elements that make a story or novel flow.
</p>
<p>
Remember to not take any feedback personally. Your reader may praise
some things and criticize others, and their criticism is about the work,
not about you as a writer. Feedback is a valuable tool for learning more
about your writing, so use it wisely.
</p>
<p>How to give useful feedback</p>
<p>
When someone asks you to give feedback on their work, they may not have
enough experience to know what to ask for. The most useful type of
feedback is that described above, but the type of feedback they need may
depend on whether you’re reading a work by a new writer or someone who
has published already.
</p>
<p>
The first thing to do when giving feedback is to start by saying what
you like about the manuscript. Highlight what works well in the piece,
whether it’s plot, character, dialogue, description, or anything else.
Remember that you’re giving feedback to a person who may be sensitive
about the months or years they spent writing, and it’s important to
reassure them that their work is valid. Think about how you would like
to receive feedback and apply that to the feedback you give to others.
</p>
<p>
Make sure your feedback is balanced; for every critical point, include a
positive point. Don’t shy away from criticizing elements that stand out,
but do this in a constructive way. Offer suggestions for points that
seem weak, but don’t rewrite entire paragraphs to show how you would
have written something.
</p>
<p>
It’s important that you understand the writer’s intent, and that you are
aware of how their work fits in a specific genre. For example, a friend
may ask you to read a novel that is not a genre that you generally read.
In this case, you may not be able to give appropriate feedback on
genre-specific conventions.
</p>
<p>
When giving feedback, it’s useful to ask questions if you don’t
understand something, such as a character’s motivation or a plot point.
This may be more useful than criticism, as the writer, in thinking about
the question, may discover something they need to improve on their own.
</p>
<p>
Giving and receiving feedback for creative writing can be sensitive,
because writers are often personally attached to their work. Doing this
with care and sensitivity can help writers improve their work and move
ahead toward publication.
