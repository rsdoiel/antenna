I’ve spent many years covering just about every awesome light electric
vehicle that has come out of China, from
<a href="https://electrek.co/2020/08/26/electric-scooter-company-scores-as-vin-diesel-makes-hollywood-style-spy-getaway-on-two-wheels/">e-bikes
and e-scooters </a>to more obscure rides like
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/02/02/i-bought-electric-rickshaw-tuk-tuk/">electric
three-wheelers</a> and
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/05/18/minghong-electric-microcar-unboxing-testing/">more</a>.
After over a decade in the digital trenches, I’ve felt mighty overdue
for a firsthand look at where these fun and functional personal electric
vehicles come from. So I made the trip to China and snuck my way behind
the scenes at a number of factories to check out some of the biggest and
most important players in the industry.
