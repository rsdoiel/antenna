socio-economic, and associated risk factors of oral cavity parasites in
children with intellectual disability from Lorestan province, Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionChildren with intellectual disability (ID) often face
challenges in maintaining proper oral hygiene due to their motor,
sensory, and intellectual impairments, which can lead to compromised
oral health; therefore, there is a need to enhance the oral health
status of these populations and establish an effective system for
administering preventive interventions. Here, we aimed to evaluate the
prevalence of Entamoeba gingivalis and Trichomonas tenax among children
with ID in Lorestan province, in Western Iran through parasitological
and molecular methods.MethodsThe current descriptive investigation
involved 215 in children with ID and 215 healthy children (non-ID) who
were referred to health facilities in Lorestan province, Iran between
October 2022 and March 2024. The prevalence of protozoa in the oral
cavity was found through the utilization of both microscopic analysis
and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques.ResultsThe
total prevalence of the E. gingivalis and T. tenax in children with ID
was found to be 87 (40.5%) and 92 (42.8%) through microscopic and PCR
methods, respectively. Among the positive samples, 57 (61.9%) and 35
(38.1%) children tested positive for E. gingivalis and T. tenax,
respectively. In contrast, among the 215 non-ID children in the control
group, 39 (18.1%) and 42 (19.5%) tested positive by microscopic and PCR
methods, respectively. Among positive samples in non-ID children, 23
(54.7%) and 19 (45.3%) children were positive for E. gingivalis and T.
tenax, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated
that residing in urban areas, parental education, monthly family income,
and tooth brushing p&lt;0.001) were identified as independent risk
factors for oral cavity parasites.ConclusionThis study identified a
notable prevalence of oral cavity parasites in children with ID in
Lorestan province, Western Iran. It is imperative to recognize the
primary risk factors associated with these parasites, particularly
inadequate teeth brushing, in order to enhance public and oral health
strategies for children with ID. Therefore, pediatric dental
professionals should remain vigilant regarding these risk factors to
effectively recognize and address oral health issues in this population,
thereby mitigating the occurrence of oral diseases and infections.</p>

underlies brefeldin A-induced antifungal drug resistance in Cryptococcus
neoformans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Cryptococcus neoformans is at the top of the list of “most wanted”
human pathogens. Only three classes of antifungal drugs are available
for the treatment of cryptococcosis. Studies on antifungal resistance
mechanisms are limited to the investigation of how a particular
antifungal drug induces resistance to a particular drug, and the impact
of stresses other than antifungals on the development of antifungal
resistance and even cross-resistance is largely unexplored. The
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a ubiquitous subcellular organelle of
eukaryotic cells. Brefeldin A (BFA) is a widely used chemical inducer of
ER stress. Here, we found that both weak and strong selection by BFA
caused aneuploidy formation in C. neoformans, mainly disomy of
chromosome 1, chromosome 3, and chromosome 7. Disomy of chromosome 1
conferred cross-resistance to two classes of antifungal drugs:
fluconazole and 5-flucytosine, as well as hypersensitivity to
amphotericin B. However, drug resistance was unstable, due to the
intrinsic instability of aneuploidy. We found overexpression of AFR1 on
Chr1 and GEA2 on Chr3 phenocopied BFA resistance conferred by chromosome
disomy. Overexpression of AFR1 also caused resistance to fluconazole and
hypersensitivity to amphotericin B. Furthermore, a strain with a
deletion of AFR1 failed to form chromosome 1 disomy upon BFA treatment.
Transcriptome analysis indicated that chromosome 1 disomy simultaneously
upregulated AFR1, ERG11, and other efflux and ERG genes. Thus, we posit
that BFA has the potential to drive the rapid development of drug
resistance and even cross-resistance in C. neoformans, with genome
plasticity as the accomplice.</p>

characterization of carbapenem and ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant
Enterobacterales and horizontal spread of blaNDM-5 gene at a Lebanese
medical center</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionIn the battle against multidrug-resistant bacterial
infections, ceftazidime- avibactam (CZA) stands as a pivotal defense,
particularly against carbapenemresistant (CR) Gram-negative pathogens.
However, the rise in resistance against this drug poses a significant
threat to its effectiveness, highlighting the critical need for in-depth
studies about its resistance mechanisms. MethodsThis research focuses on
the genomic characterization of CR- and CZA-resistant Escherichia coli
(n=26) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=34) strains, harboring the blaNDM
and/or blaOXA-48-like genes, at a major Lebanese tertiary care medical
center, using whole genome sequencing (WGS). ResultsOur findings
revealed a notable prevalence of blaNDM in all K. pneumoniae strains
isolates, with 27 of these also harboring blaOXA-48. On the other hand,
E. coli strains predominantly carried the blaNDM-5 gene. Whole genome
sequencing (WGS) identified a predominance of ST383 among K. pneumoniae
strains, which possessed a multi-replicon IncFIB-IncHI1B plasmid
harboring the blaNDM-5. Additionally, various Inc group plasmids in K.
pneumoniae across multiple sequence types were found to carry the
blaNDM. Similarly, diverse STs of E. coli were observed to carry
blaNDM-5 on different plasmids. DiscussionThe study underscores NDM
carbapenemases as a paramount resistance mechanism in
Lebanon,jeopardizing critical last-resort treatments. It also
illuminates the role of varied sequence types and mobile genetic
elements in the spread of NDM resistance,stressing the urgent need for
strategies to mitigate this threat, especially in nosocomial
infections.</p>

investigation on diseases of Larimichthys crocea in Ningbo culture
area</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionDue to the high-density farming of Larimichthys crocea
over the years, diseases caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses,
and parasites frequently occur in Ningbo, posing a huge threat and
challenge to the sustainable and healthy development of the L. crocea’s
bay farming industry. In order to understand the diseases occurrence in
L. crocea farming in Ningbo area, an epidemiological investigation of L.
crocea diseases was carried out through regular sampling in 2023.
MethodsFrom April to October 2023, routine sampling of L. crocea was
conducted monthly in various farming areas in Ningbo. Each time, live or
dying L. crocea with obvious clinical symptoms were sampled, with a
total number of 55 L. crocea collected. The samples were preserved in
ice bags and transported to the laboratory for pathogen
detection(including bacterial isolation and identification,virus
identification, and parasites detection).ResultsA total of fifty-five
fish dying L. crocea with obvious clinical symptoms were collected in
this study, of which 78.18% (43/55) were detected with symptoms caused
by pathogenic infection, while 21.82% (12/55) did not have identified
pathogens, which were presumed to be breeding abrasions, nutritional
metabolic disorders, unconventional pathogens infection or other
reasons. A total of twenty-five pathogenic bacteria strains were
isolated, which mainly were Pseudomonas plecoglossicida and Vibrio
harveyi, accounting for 52% (13/25) and 32% (8/25) of the pathogenic
bacteria strains, respectively. Among them, both V. harveyi and
Streptococcus. iniae co-infected one fish. Additionally, three other
bacterial strains including Nocardia seriolae, Staphylococcus
Saprophyticus, and Photobacterium damselae subsp.damselae were isolated.
Microscopic examination mainly observed two parasites, Cryptocaryon
irritans and Neobenedenia girellae. In virus detection, the red sea
bream iridovirus (RSIV) was mainly detected in L. crocea. Statistical
analysis showed that among the fish with detected pathogens, 55.81%
(24/43) had bacterial infections, 37.21% (16/43) had parasitic
infections, and 37.21% (16/43) had RSIV infections. Among them, five
fish had mixed infections of bacteria and parasites, three had mixed
infections of bacteria and viruses, three had mixed infections of
parasites and viruses, and one L. crocea had mixed infections of
viruses, bacteria, and parasites. DiscussionThese findings indicate that
these three major types of diseases are very common in the L. crocea
farming area in Ningbo, implying the complexity of mixed infections of
multiple diseases.</p>

of LAG-3: a potential indicator of low immune function in
tuberculosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) persists as a global health challenge,
with its treatment hampered by the side effects of long-term combination
drug therapies and the growing issue of drug resistance. Therefore, the
development of novel therapeutic strategies is critical. This study
focuses on the role of immune checkpoint molecules (ICs) and functions
of CD8+ T cells in the search for new potential targets against
TB.MethodsWe conducted differential expression genes analysis and CD8+ T
cell functional gene analysis on 92 TB samples and 61 healthy individual
(HI) samples from TB database GSE83456, which contains data on 34,603
genes. The GSE54992 dataset was used to validated the findings.
Additionally, a cluster analysis on single-cell data from primates
infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and those vaccinated with BCG
was performed.ResultsThe overexpression of LAG-3 gene was found as a
potentially important characteristic of both pulmonary TB (PTB) and
extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Further correlation analysis showed that LAG-3
gene was correlated with GZMB, perforin, IL-2 and IL-12. A significant
temporal and spatial variation in LAG-3 expression was observed in T
cells and macrophages during TB infection and after BCG
vaccination.ConclusionLAG-3 was overexpressed in TB samples. Targeting
LAG-3 may represent a potential therapeutic target for tuberculosis.</p>

specificity and zoonotic Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes in wild
rodents from the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and Liaoning Province
of China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionWild rodents can serve as reservoirs or carriers of E.
bieneusi, thereby enabling parasite transmission to domestic animals and
humans. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of E. bieneusi in
wild rodents from the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and Liaoning
Province of China. Moreover, to evaluate the potential for zoonotic
transmission at the genotype level, a genetic analysis of the isolates
was performed.MethodsA total of 486 wild rodents were captured from two
provinces in China. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to
amplify the vertebrate cytochrome b (cytb) gene in the fecal DNA of the
rodents to detect their species. The genotype of E. bieneusi was
determined via PCR amplification of the internal transcribed spacer
(ITS) region of rDNA. The examination of genetic characteristics and
zoonotic potential requires the application of similarity and
phylogenetic analysis.ResultsThe infection rates of E. bieneusi in the
four identified rodent species were 5.2% for Apodemus agrarius (n = 89),
4.5% for Cricetulus barabensis (n = 96), 11.3% for Mus musculus (n =
106), and 38.5% for Rattus norvegicus (n = 195). Infection was detected
at an average rate of 17.4% among 486 rodents. Of the 11 identified
genotypes, nine were known: SHR1 (detected in 32 samples), D (30
samples), EbpA (9 samples), PigEbITS7 (8 samples), HNR-IV (6 samples),
Type IV (5 samples), HNR-VII (2 samples), HNH7 (1 sample), and HNPL-V (1
sample). Two novel genotypes were also discovered, NMR-I and NMR-II,
each comprising one sample. The genotypes were classified into group 1
and group 13 via phylogenetic analysis.DiscussionBased on the initial
report, E. bieneusi is highly prevalent and genetically diverse in wild
rodents residing in the respective province and region. This indicates
that these animals are crucial for the dissemination of E. bieneusi.
Zoonotic E. bieneusi-carrying animals present a significant hazard to
local inhabitants. Therefore, it is necessary to increase awareness
regarding the dangers presented by these rodents and reduce their
population to prevent environmental contamination.</p>

id="the-role-of-bacterial-genital-infections-in-spontaneous-preterm-delivery-a-case-control-study">The
role of bacterial genital infections in spontaneous preterm delivery: a
case-control study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSpontaneous preterm delivery is defined as the beginning of
the birth process before the 37th week of pregnancy. The presence of
microorganisms in the fetal membranes is accompanied by an increase in
the production of prostaglandin, one of the important factors associated
with the prevalence of preterm birth. The invasion of microorganisms
leads to the production of protease, coagulase, and elastase, which
directly stimulate the onset of childbirth. We investigated the role of
genital infections in women with preterm birth.MethodsThe present
case-control study was conducted in the west of Iran on 100 women with
spontaneous preterm delivery (following 24 weeks of gestation and before
36 weeks and 6 days) as the case group and 100 women with normal
delivery as controls. A questionnaire was applied to collect the data.
Polymerase chain reaction and pathological examination of the placenta
were performed.ResultsThe average age in women with normal delivery
(30.92 ± 5.10) in women with spontaneous preterm delivery (30.27 ±
4.93). The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea,
Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycoplasma genitalium infections was zero in
both groups. The highest prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis was 19
(19%) in the case group and Ureaplasma parvum 15 (15%) in the control
group. Also, Placental inflammation was zero in controls and 7(7%) in
the patient group. There was a significant relationship between
Gardnerella vaginalis bacteria and spontaneous preterm
delivery.ConclusionThe results of our study showed that except for
Gardnerella vaginalis bacteria, there is no significant relationship
between the above bacterial infections and spontaneous preterm birth.
Moreover, despite the significant reduction in the prevalence of many
sexually transmitted infections in this research, it is still suggested
to increase the awareness of people, including pregnant women, about the
ways it can be transmitted by gynecologists and health and treatment
centers.</p>
