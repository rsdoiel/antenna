## Tropical Storm Carlotta Forecast Discussion Number 5

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM MST Thu Aug 01 2024
 
After intensifying over the past 12 to 18 hours, Carlotta is taking
a brief pause as the inner-core becomes better established, though
the system is still quite healthy looking on satellite imagery with
plenty of curved bands around a formative central dense overcast
(CDO). A blend of the latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimates
still support an intensity of 50-kt this advisory, which is also
roughly in the middle of objective intensity guidance.
 
Carlotta continues to move west-northwestward at 295/10-kt. This
motion is caused by a prominent deep-layer ridge located over the
southwestern United States, and Carlotta may turn more back westward
over the next few days as this ridge continues to strengthen.
However by day 3 and beyond, the tropical cyclone will begin to
feel a weakness to the north, which will likely result in a gradual
slowdown in its forward motion and another gentle shift more
poleward in the track. The latest track guidance is ever so slightly
further north and faster compared to the previous cycle. Thus, the
NHC track forecast has been shifted a bit in that direction,
roughly in between the prior track forecast, and the reliable
consensus aids TVCE and HCCA.
 
Environmental conditions still appear quite favorable for 
intensification, with warm 28-29 C sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), 
and low to moderate shear between 10-15 kt out of the northwest. The 
rate of intensification may be determined more by how Carlotta's 
inner-core evolves, and there have not been any recent microwave 
images to diagnose the current structure. The SHIPS rapid 
intensification index is a little lower than last night, though this 
could also be in response to the temporary pause in the 
intensification. However the last few GOES-18 images suggest the CDO 
is becoming better established though an eye has yet to fully appear 
on first-light visible imagery. Even though the intensity guidance 
has shifted a little lower than last night, I have elected to keep 
the same intensification rate in the NHC forecast from the last 
cycle over the next 24 hours. This forecast is in better agreement 
with the regional-hurricane models HAFS-A/B versus the lower 
consensus aids that have been influenced by the lower SHIPS and LGEM 
guidance. After 48-60 hours, SSTs begin to markedly decrease along 
the forecast track, dropping under 26 C in 96 hours. Thus, the NHC 
intensity forecast shows gradual weakening between days 3 to 5.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Carlotta Advisory Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM MST Thu Aug 01 2024
 
...CARLOTTA STILL EXPECTED TO BECOME A HURRICANE BY TONIGHT OR
TOMORROW...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.2N 111.0W
ABOUT 455 MI...735 KM WSW OF MANZANILLO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 290 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...997 MB...29.44 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Carlotta was
located near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 111.0 West. Carlotta is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h). This motion 
is expected to continue today, followed by a turn toward the west on 
Friday and a continued westward motion through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and 
Carlotta is expected to become a hurricane either tonight or 
tomorrow.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 mb (29.44 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Carlotta will affect the coasts of
west-central mainland Mexico and the southern Baja California
peninsula beginning later today. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions through the
weekend. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 200 PM MST.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CDT Thu Aug 01 2024

Valid 011300Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE MIDWEST AND OHIO VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible today across parts of the
Midwest and Ohio Valley, with a threat of damaging winds, isolated
hail, and a tornado or two.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, extensive subtropical ridging is apparent from
the northern Bahamas across FL, the north-central/northeastern Gulf,
central/west TX, to the Four Corners region, bending northwestward
into a large-scale ridge over the Great Basin and northern Rockies. 
This ridging will consolidate around a developing high over the Four
Corners, while weakening over the Southeast/Gulf Coast in response
to northern-stream trough amplification across the Great Lakes.  The
main factor in the latter is a strong shortwave trough -- apparent
in moisture-channel imagery over parts of northern/western MN and
western IA, with an embedded 500-mb low over west-central MN.  The
trough/low should dig southeastward through the period, with the low
reaching WI by 00Z and trough south-southwestward across MO.  By
12Z, the trough should extend from Lake Huron through the low (then
near southern Lake Michigan) to near STL.

The surface analysis at 11Z showed a primary synoptic low over
western Lake Superior, with cold front southwestward across western
IA to central/southwestern KS, the TX Panhandle and northeastern NM.
The KS portion of the front may advance far enough southeastward
today so that its baroclinicity will blend with that of a northward-
drifting, prefrontal outflow boundary now over central/northwestern
OK.  Otherwise, the low should move/redevelop southeastward to Lower
MI through the period, while the trailing front advances down the
upper/mid Mississippi Valley to the Ozarks.

...Parts of the Midwest/Ohio Valley...
One or more clusters of strong-severe thunderstorms are possible
between the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes this afternoon into evening,
offering damaging to severe gusts, isolated large hail and a
marginal/conditional tornado risk.  A mesoscale corridor of more-
concentrated wind potential may evolve on the region, but still
appears too conditional for greater probabilities at this time. 
That is because uncertainty continues regarding the relative
influence on the main afternoon/evening severe potential of:
1.  The ongoing remnant MCS across portions of IL/IN, and the
related pressure/theta-e perturbation as it moves eastward over
parts of IN/OH and encounters destabilizing, favorably moist
boundary layer from midday into early afternoon, and
2. Development either side of the trailing outflow boundary across
portions of central IN into southern IL, and especially its northern
extent into heated/modified outflow air from the previous MCS.

A corridor along and south of the outflow boundary, and east of the
continuing MCS, should be characterized by upper 60s to mid 70s F
surface dewpoints.  This will combine with strong surface heating to
yield peak/preconvective MLCAPE in the 2500-3500 J/kg range, beneath
difluent yet strengthening mid/upper winds ahead of the shortwave
trough.  Deep-layer shear will weaken with eastward extent, but
should be favorable for supercells in the first few hours of the
main convective cycle.  Ultimately, one or two dominant, forward-
propagating MCSs may evolve out of either scenario numbered above,
with a swath of damaging to severe gusts possible.

...Upper Mississippi Valley to parts of the Upper Great Lakes...
Closer to the mid/upper low -- across WI and vicinity -- widely
scattered to scattered mainly afternoon-developing thunderstorms are
possible in an arc moving mostly eastward over the region.  This
close to the low/trough, deep shear will be relatively weak,
limiting overall convective organization.  However, mid/upper-level
DCVA/cooling, and related steepening of deep-layer lapse rates in
conjunction with diurnal heating, will overlie favorable pockets of
low-level moisture, with surface dewpoints commonly in the upper 60s
to lower 70s F.  As such, 1500-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE is expected in a
"top-heavy" buoyancy profile (with largest LIs in the 500-300-mb
layer).  Pulse-severe hail and gusts will be the main concerns.  The
threat should weaken rapidly after sunset.

...Northeastern NM to Ozarks...
The combined outflow/frontal baroclinic zone cross this corridor, as
well as the Raton Mesa and eastern parts of the southern Rockies,
should focus isolated to widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms. 
Some of this convection may persist through the evening where
upscale clustering can occur, but in general, should diminish after
dark.  Isolated severe gusts are the main concern.  The most intense
cores may bring down locally severe hail as well, despite very high
ambient freezing levels.

The kinematic environment along the boundary will be characterized
by strong veering of winds with height, but weak absolute speeds,
rendering largely 25-35-kt effective-shear magnitudes and slow
motions for those thunderstorms not accelerated by local to
mesobeta-scale cold-pool processes.  A well-mixed and deep boundary
layer showing "inverted-V" profiles on forecast soundings should
develop through the afternoon, with temperatures commonly over 100F
in elevations below about 4500 ft, and along and south of the
boundary.  This will support DCAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg beneath similar
MLCAPE values. Just north of the front, somewhat less-intense
heating/mixing, but richer moisture, will yield an axis of 2000-3500
J/kg MLCAPE near and largely parallel to the KS/OK line.  A mix of
wet and dry downburst characteristics therefore is possible across
this corridor.

...Mid Atlantic to GA...
A broad swath of the Eastern Seaboard from the Mid-Atlantic region
to parts of GA, and the central/southern Appalachians, will
experience isolated to scattered thunderstorms today.  Strong
diurnal heating and rich boundary-layer moisture will increase
buoyancy and erode MLCINH, beneath broadly difluent mid/upper-level
flow.  Large-scale vertical motion will be weak (upward or downward)
over the region, with the bulk of lift coming from residual outflow/
differential-heating boundaries, terrain features, and perhaps
sea-breeze boundaries.  Veering of winds with height is likely
beneath modest mid/upper westerly to northwesterly flow, but lack of
greater low/middle-level speeds will limit deep shear.  A few
multicellular clusters are possible within this regime, offering
locally concentrated damaging-wind potential, with isolated gusts
near severe limits possible in the most intense, water-loaded cores.

0956 AM CDT Wed Jul 31 2024

Areas affected...central Indiana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 311456Z - 311630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Locally gusty winds of 40-60 mph are possible across parts
of central Indiana through early afternoon. Severe thunderstorm
watch issuance is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms near the IL/IN border will continue
to track east/southeast the next few hours. Overall structure and
organization of this activity has decreased compared to
overnight/earlier this morning. Measured wind gusts with this
activity have mostly been in the 30-40 kt range, with a couple
locally higher gusts. The downstream environment remains weakly to
moderately capped with deep-layer flow relatively weak (less than 30
kt effective shear). With continued heating, inhibition should
gradually decrease. However, instability and shear are expected to
remain somewhat modest. While some minor intensification is
possible, timing and coverage of any greater severe risk is
uncertain. Severe thunderstorm watch issuance is not expected in the
short term, but trends will be monitored and watch issuance is
possible later this morning or afternoon if trends increase
sufficiently.

Tropical Depression Three-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM MST Wed Jul 31 2024
 
Over the last few hours, the convective organization has improved 
with the area of low pressure we have been monitoring a few hundred 
miles off the southwestern coast of Mexico. First-light visible 
imagery from a GOES-West meso-sector over the storm show the 
development of organized curve banding, with low-level cloud motions 
also now suggesting the presence of closed cyclonic flow. This 
improved convective structure was also seen in an earlier 1040 UTC 
SSMIS microwave pass. In addition, the latest set of subjective 
Dvorak intensity estimates were both at T2.5/35 kt from both SAB and 
TAFB. All these data suggest that the system has become a tropical 
cyclone, and advisories are being initiated at this time. The 
initial intensity for this advisory is set at 30 kt, a little under 
the Dvorak estimates given the lower objective estimates and 
earlier scatterometer data.
 
The initial estimated motion is off to the west-northwest at 
295/12-kt. This motion is expected to continue with a gentle 
turn more westward over the next few days as the system becomes 
primarily steered by a deep-layer ridge located over the 
southwestern United States. Towards the end of the forecast period, 
there could be a bit more of a weakness in this ridge on its 
western extent, potentially allowing the system to turn more 
poleward again. The initial track forecast in general sticks close 
to the consensus aids TVCE and HCCA, which favor a track that is in 
between the operational GFS and ECMWF tracks, but slightly in favor 
of the latter.
 
Intensity-wise, TD3-E might be our first system in the East Pacific 
to last longer than a couple of days, with most of the guidance 
suggesting intensification into the weekend. SHIPS guidance from 
both the GFS and ECMWF suggest the shear will remain low (less than 
15 kt) while sea-surface temperatures underneath the cyclone remain 
in the 29-30 C range over the next few days. Such a favorable 
environment could favor significant intensification once an 
inner-core becomes established. Interestingly, the 
regional-hurricane model guidance, while showing intensification, do 
not currently forecast rapid intensification. The first NHC 
intensity forecast shows more gradual intensification for the next 
day or so, followed by a somewhat faster rate, peaking the system as 
a Category 1 hurricane in 72 h, on the high end of the intensity 
guidance.  Towards the end of the forecast, the tropical cyclone 
should begin to move over cooler ocean waters, with gradual 
weakening expected to begin around day 4 or 5.

Mesoscale Discussion 1743
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1139 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...Pennsylvania...Maryland...and Virginia...including
Washington D.C.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 301639Z - 301845Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Initially isolated thunderstorms should increase in
coverage through the afternoon hours with an accompanying increase
in damaging wind potential. Watch issuance is not anticipated given
a weak kinematic environment.

DISCUSSION...GOES imagery and lightning data over the past 30-60
minutes have shown steadily deepening/intensifying convection along
a residual outflow boundary and weak surface trough from central PA
southward into VA. While ongoing convection currently appears to be
sub-severe based on MRMS hail metrics and regional velocity data,
temperatures warming into the low 80s should promote SBCAPE values
up to 2000 J/kg that will likely result in additional thunderstorm
development as well as some degree of intensification through the
day with an attendant potential for damaging wind gusts. Given weak
deep-layer flow over the region, overall convective intensity will
likely be influenced primarily by low-level heating/destabilization.
This will be modulated by how quickly residual low-level stratus can
clear ahead of developing storms. If stronger diurnal heating can be
achieved (i.e. surface temperatures into the mid/upper 80s) then
higher SBCAPE (possibly up to 3000 J/kg) and steeper low-level lapse
rates will likely favor more intense convection with a relatively
higher damaging wind threat. Regardless, watch issuance is not
anticipated given the meager deep-layer wind shear and uncertainty
regarding the thermodynamic environment.

## SPC Severe Thunderstorm Watch 569

date: 2024-07-30, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0569.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0569_radar.gif" border="1" alt="WW 0569 Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="525" height="459" align="center" /></a><pre>

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 569
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1005 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Indiana
  North-Central Kentucky

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 1005 AM until
  400 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A small bowing cluster of thunderstorms should continue to
pose a risk for mainly scattered damaging winds up to 60-70 mph as
it moves quickly east-southeastward through the rest of the morning
and into the afternoon. Isolated severe hail may occur as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 35
statute miles north and south of a line from 110 miles west
northwest of Louisville KY to 25 miles east of Louisville KY. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 568...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
30040.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Valid 301630Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE MID MISSOURI VALLEY INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY/MIDWEST...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected today into tonight across a broad
area from eastern Nebraska and Iowa into parts of the Midwest,
Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians, with multiple swaths of
damaging winds likely within this corridor. Severe thunderstorms are
also possible across parts of the northern Plains.

...Mid Missouri Valley into the Midwest/Ohio Valley/Southeast...
A larger than usual amount of uncertainty remains regarding
convective evolution this afternoon though tonight. Ongoing cluster
in southern IA will move southeastward across the mid MS Valley into
a rapidly destabilizing airmass with enhanced northwesterly winds at
mid/upper-levels supporting sufficient deep-layer shear for
continued updraft organization. A swath of severe/damaging winds
appears likely with this cluster given the favorable parameter
space. Therefore, the Enhanced Risk for damaging winds has been
extended southeastward to account for the forecast evolution of this
MCS. Another ongoing cluster over the lower OH Valley should also
pose some threat for severe/damaging winds as it and associated
outflow on its southwest flank spreads east-southeastward across KY
and perhaps parts of TN the rest of this afternoon/evening.

Additional robust thunderstorm development appears possible through
the period in a broad corridor from central/eastern NE through the
lower OH Valley and Southeast, with swaths of damaging winds likely
the main threat. Details on where/when this activity will develop
remain rather uncertain. But, isolated supercells may develop across
central/eastern NE late this afternoon/evening in the vicinity of a
surface low/lee trough. Very large hail may occur with this
convection, with a greater threat for severe/damaging winds possible
if this activity can grow upscale into another cluster and spread
southeastward across the mid MO and mid MS Valleys this
evening/overnight.

...Northern Plains...
Weak mid-level height falls amid moderate to strong instability
should foster to widely scattered thunderstorm development along a
surface trough/dryline across parts of the Dakotas this afternoon.
Moderate mid-level westerlies should support deep-layer shear around
30-35 kt, sufficient for a few organized storms, including a few
supercells, capable of both large hail and damaging gusts this
afternoon and evening.

...Mid-Atlantic Vicinity...
A weak mid/upper-level trough and will move across the
Mid-Atlantic and vicinity through this evening. Scattered
thunderstorm development should continue this afternoon from VA into
parts of PA. While there is some uncertainty regarding the extent of
heating and destabilization due to lingering cloudiness, a couple of
stronger cells/clusters may become capable of producing isolated
damaging winds.

...Northeast...
Weak to locally moderate instability may develop this afternoon from
parts of northern New York into northern New England. While storm
coverage remains uncertain, deep-layer shear and relatively cool
temperatures aloft could support a couple of modestly organized
thunderstorms capable of locally damaging winds, and possibly some
hail.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

The current forecast remains on-track with no necessary updates or
changes. See previous discussion for further detail.

..Halbert/Squitieri.. 07/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will move eastward across the northern Rockies and
adjacent Plains during the day. Along/south of the trough, moderate
west-southwesterly midlevel flow will overspread the Great Basin
into the northern/central Rockies.

...Dry Thunderstorms - Northern Rockies/Intermountain West...
Large-scale ascent accompanying the midlevel trough will promote
widely scattered thunderstorms across portions of ID and western MT
during the afternoon and evening. While 0.6-0.9 inch PW will favor a
mix of wet/dry thunderstorms, 25-35 mph storm motions may tend to
limit overall rainfall in any given area. Nevertheless,
lightning-induced ignitions will be possible on the peripheries of
rain cores, given dry fuels across the area.

...Dry/Windy - Great Basin into the Central Rockies...
Deep boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced flow aloft will yield
5-10 percent RH and 15-20 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds from southern UT into WY -- with the strongest winds expected
over WY. These dry/breezy conditions atop modestly receptive fuels
will favor elevated fire-weather conditions during the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1742
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0909 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of southern Illinois and southern Indiana
into north-central Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 567...

Valid 301409Z - 301615Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 567
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms posing a damaging wind risk will
persist across southern Illinois within Severe Thunderstorm Watch
567. Areas across southern Indiana into adjacent north-central
Kentucky are being monitored for possible downstream watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A small, but well organized bowing cluster of storms
continues to track east/southeast across south-central Illinois this
morning. This activity has produced gusts near 50 kt within the past
hour. Around 30 kt effective shear magnitudes are likely sustaining
organized activity as convection shifts east/southeast along an
instability gradient oriented northwest to southeast across the
lower Ohio Valley vicinity. A very moist downstream airmass is
evident, with surface dewpoints in the 70s. With continued heating,
boundary-layer inhibition is expected to quickly erode by midday.
Damaging gusts may continue downstream of ongoing activity,
especially if additional convection can develop on the southern
flank of the ongoing cluster. Visible satellite imagery shows
deepening cumulus ahead of the southern flank, so this evolution
appears plausible. A downstream watch may be needed within the next
hour or so if current trends persist/increase.

Mesoscale Discussion 1741
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0847 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of southern Iowa...northern Missouri...and
extreme west-central Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 301347Z - 301515Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging gusts are possible this morning and afternoon as
a cluster of storms tracks southeast across southern Iowa into
northern Missouri and extreme west-central Illinois. A watch may be
needed this morning, though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...A well organized cluster of storms currently moving
into central Iowa has produced gusts near 50 kt within the past 30
minutes or so. This activity may be somewhat elevated in the wake of
overnight convection. Nevertheless, 35-45 kt effective shear
magnitudes and MLCAPE around 1000-1500 J/kg will likely maintain
organization. While outflow from overnight convection has surged
southward to near I-70 in Missouri, the airmass has shown signs of
quick recovery, with surface dewpoints in the mid/upper 60s F noted
in 13z surface obs. Clear skies ahead of the cluster will also allow
for quick heating through the morning hours. As a result, downstream
destabilization and erosion of capping is expected. 

The ongoing cluster of storms may continue to gradually intensify
and pose a risk for damaging gusts into late morning/early afternoon
as the downstream airmass continue to recover/destabilize. Given the
effect of overnight convection on the airmass, there is some
uncertainty in convective evolution and timing of possible watch
issuance. Nevertheless, it appears possible a severe thunderstorm
watch could be needed this morning across parts of the discussion
area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Mon Jul 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will advance eastward across the northern Rockies
and adjacent High Plains during the day, while broad/enhanced
west-southwesterly flow aloft persists across the Great Basin.

...Northern Rockies/Intermountain West... 
Large-scale ascent accompanying the eastward-moving midlevel trough
will promote widely scattered thunderstorms across portions of the
northern Rockies/Intermountain West into the northern Plains during
the afternoon and evening. While many of these storms will be
capable of producing measurable rainfall, quick eastward-moving
storms (around 25-35 mph) will still favor a mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms over dry fuels. As a result, some lightning-induced
ignitions will be possible -- especially along the peripheries of
any rain cores.

...Great Basin...
Boundary-layer mixing into the modestly enhanced west-southwesterly
flow aloft will lead to locally dry/breezy conditions across parts
of the Great Basin during the afternoon. While locally elevated
conditions are possible, winds should be slightly weaker than the
day prior, and the overall threat appears too localized for an
Elevated area at this time.
