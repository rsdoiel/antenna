movies that inspired the Silent Hill series and where to watch them</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Silent Hill 2 finally emerged from the fog of its
development. A remake of the original 2001 game of the same name by
Polish developer Bloober Team (Layers of Fear, The Medium), Silent Hill
2 is easily the most anticipated and ambitious horror game of 2024, a
modern take on one of […]</p>

<p>Do you feel that? That chill in the air, that tingling sensation at
the back of your neck? It can only mean one thing. That’s right:
Halloween season is once again upon us! Here at Polygon, we love horror.
We cover it all year round, whether it’s ranking the scariest new
releases of the year […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-13, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is not a horror game — it’s a fantasy RPG with a
story that keeps getting better as it goes along and a combat system
that’s complex and satisfying. But whenever I run into the “humans,”
monsters whose visual design look nothing like any human I’ve ever seen
in my life, I feel […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-13, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The comedy streaming service Dropout is breaking ground in a highly
competitive genre of television: the cooking competition show. Its new
series, Gastronauts, brings Dropout’s comedic talent and penchant for
zany antics to the well-worn genre with something just a little less
cutthroat than you’ll see on other cooking shows. Hosted by comedian,
writer, and […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-12, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Tomb Raider fans, bless them, spend a lot of time wondering how the
series all syncs up. If the Lara Croft we saw in the original ’90s games
is the same one as the rougher-around-the-edges Lara from the Survivor
trilogy, then what happened in between to have it all make sense? 
Luckily, answers appear on […]</p>

<p>Netflix is ushering in the fall season with a slate of great
additions this October, including quite a few thrillers. Along with the
highly anticipated sequel to Netflix’s gnarly thriller The Platform, the
streamer also added quite a few older thrillers, including a few greats
from the 2000s and a few that go even further […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-12, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There’s been a slight sense of anticlimax after the release of The
Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. It’s a very good game, of course, but
perhaps a few steps shy of the greatness we expect of the series. Its
new, indirect gameplay style, with Zelda conjuring echoes of objects and
monsters to solve puzzles […]</p>

<p>Each week on Polygon, we round up the most notable new releases to

<p>date: 2024-10-11, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>When you turn on your Xbox Series X, open the Microsoft Store, and
buy Farming Simulator 22, you might think you own the game, but you’d be
wrong. You actually paid for a license to play the game — not to own it.
Companies can revoke the license at any time. It doesn’t happen all

<p>Overwatch 2’s next spooky, supernatural season will be packed with
fresh costume changes for the heroes of Overwatch, just in time for
Halloween. The game’s annual holiday event, Halloween Terror, will make
a return this October, remixed and revitalized with a new spooky PvP

<p>The story of Geralt and Ciri has been told through many mediums, from
the original novels by Andrzej Sapkowski to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and
the Netflix adaptation. Now we can add another take on that found-family
father/daughter dynamic, this time expressed through a collection of
adorable comics by Giana Carboni. The Little Witcher […]</p>

<p>Ryan Murphy has six shows on air right now, but only one of them
features Kansas City Chiefs tight end and Mr. Taylor Swift, Travis
Kelce. Grotesquerie, which is basically the second American Horror Story
replacement for the year (American Horror Stories is still a thing!), is
about Lois (Niecy Nash), a troubled detective solving […]</p>
