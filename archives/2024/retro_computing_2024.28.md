## ROUGOL to see Visions of the Impossible – 15th July

date: 2024-07-10, from: RiscOS Story

They&#8217;ll see things you people wouldn&#8217;t believe. The RISC OS User Group of London (ROUGOL) next meets up on Monday, 15th July, and this month they&#8217;ll be hallucinating. No, wait, I meant they&#8217;ll have Nathan Atkinson from Visions of the Impossible as their guest speaker. Visions of the Impossible (or VotI) were a programming group active in the 1990s, and brought a number of titles to the RISC OS platform, including games, demos, and utilities. One of their more well known games was Sunburst, a game in which you may&#8230;

## Bristol RISC OS Users meeting – 11th July

date: 2024-07-10, from: RiscOS Story

However, sometimes members might bring along their own latest projects &#8211; or problems &#8211; for the group to look at. If you live in or&#8230;

date: 2024-07-10, from: RiscOS Story

A new version of StreetFix has been released by Kevin Wells. The software provides a means for RISC OS users to report and check upon local issues, such as damaged street furniture, potholes in the road, and so on &#8211; all from within an application on the RISC OS desktop, rather than via a web browser. The updated application now stands at version 1.08, and the two changes Kevin has highlighted with this release are the addition of Australia as a country in which the software can be used, and&#8230;
