Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0753 AM CDT Wed Jul 03 2024

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL/NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
A threat for all severe hazards is possible this afternoon into
evening over portions of the central/northern High Plains.  Damaging
to severe gusts may occur near a separate front, mainly from the
Ozarks to Ohio.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, broadly cyclonic flow will continue over much
of the northern CONUS from the Pacific Northwest to the Upper Great
Lakes, with numerous embedded vorticity maxima and shortwaves of
varying amplitudes.  Of those, the most important for this outlook
will be a shortwave trough now apparent in moisture-channel imagery
over northern Rockies.  This feature should dig southeastward to
southwestern ND, southeastern MT, northwestern WY and southeastern
ID by 00Z.  By the end of the period (12Z), the trough should extend
diagonal across SD, then to southeastern WY and northwestern CO. 
Subtropical ridging will persist over the Gulf Coast States and
portions of southern CA/AZ, with a height weakness in between, over
northwestern MX and NM.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a cold front across Lake
Michigan, northwestern IL, central MO, and southeastern KS, becoming
quasistationary across northwestern OK and the TX Panhandle to
northeastern NM.  By 00Z, the front should move to Lake Huron,
northwestern OH, southern IN, southern MO, while drifting southward
again to  northeastern and west-central OK and the southern
Panhandle/northern South Plains region of TX.  By 12Z, the front
should extend over western parts of NY/PA, eastern/southern KY, and
north-central AR, becoming a warm front over north-central/
northwestern OK.  Cyclogenesis is forecast late this afternoon
through this evening along a lee trough over east-central CO, with a
cold front developing from the NE Sandhills into northeastern/
central CO by 06Z.  By 12Z, the low should migrate to central NE,
with warm front over southern IA, and cold front southwestward
across western KS to northeastern NM.

...Central/northern High Plains and vicinity...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop this
afternoon -- initially over higher terrain near the Palmer and
Cheyenne Ridges and near lee trough, increasing in coverage while
moving eastward to southeastward over the High Plains.  Large hail
(some 2+ inches in diameter) and damaging wind (some gusts over 70
mph) are expected over the north-central High Plains, and a couple
tornadoes also are possible, mainly in and near western NE where
some overlap of favorable moisture and low-level shear is expected.

As the mid/upper trough approaches, expect a favorable strengthening
of large-scale lift, winds aloft, deep shear, and mass response
leading to northward moisture advection/transport, to the north of
the southern frontal zone.  Optimal moisture return may be precluded
by effects of ongoing clouds/precip to reinforce the baroclinic zone
over the southern Plains; however, boundary-layer moisture should be
sufficient to support development as heating of higher terrain
preferentially erodes MLCINH.  Steep low/middle-level lapse rates
will contribute to development of 1000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE in a
corridor from eastern CO and northwestern KS to southwestern SD,
decreasing from there westward toward the Bighorns and southward
into less-unstable conditions of the Panhandles and northeastern NM.
Veering of winds with height east of the lee trough will contribute
to favorable vertical shear for supercells and organized/upscale-
coalescing multicells, the latter being most commonly progged over
parts of eastern CO and northwestern KS (where wind probabilities
are relatively maximized).  Low-level hodographs should be
relatively maximized in size over western NE, and rather elongated
over a broader swath of the central High Plains, supporting large to
significant hail production.

...Lower Ohio Valley region...
Widely scattered to scattered, multicell thunderstorms are expected
to develop this afternoon and focus mainly near the front and
prefrontal outflow/differential-heating boundaries, from northern OK
to the Lower Great Lakes.  The greatest concentration of convection
is still expected over the area from the Ozarks to central OH from
late afternoon into early evening.  Forecast soundings suggest that
diurnal heating and rich boundary-layer moisture, represented by
upper 60s to lower 70s surface dewpoints, will offset modest
mid/upper-level lapse rates enough to support peak/preconvective
MLCAPE in the 2500-3500 J/kg range over the Ozarks, to 1000-2000
J/kg in OH.  Conversely, low-level and deep-layer shear will be
fairly weak overall, and decreasing with southwestward extent. 
Damaging to severe gusts will be the main concern.  A few short-
lived convective clusters are possible, with locally maximized
potential for severe gusts.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Tue Jul 02 2024

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will prevail over much of the CONUS as a mid-level
trough overspreads the northern Rockies tomorrow (Wednesday). During
the afternoon, dry downslope flow will encourage dry and breezy
conditions across much of the Great Basin into the central Rockies.
Latest guidance consensus suggests that 15+ mph sustained westerly
winds (locally higher in terrain-favoring areas) will coincide with
10-15 percent RH for several hours. With fuels beginning to become
at least modestly receptive to wildfire spread on a widespread
basis, Elevated highlights have been introduced.

Mesoscale Discussion 1509
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0643 PM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Areas affected...portions of eastern Nebraska into western Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 012343Z - 020115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe threat will gradually increase as the warm
front approaches and the low-level airmass destabilizes through the
evening. Severe wind and hail are the predominant threats, though a
tornado or two could also occur. A WW issuance will eventually be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Several thunderstorms are progressing eastward across
NE, including a supercell that is traversing the warm frontal zone
with a history of brief tornadoes. The surface warm front is
expected to continue drifting northward with time as low-level
warm-air advection increases in tandem with the strengthening of the
low-level jet. Initially elevated buoyancy will advect over eastern
NE into western IA with large, curved hodographs. The stronger,
longer-lived updrafts that form should become multicellular and
perhaps supercellular, capable of severe wind and hail. The tornado
potential will be largely dependent on the degree of
surface-based/boundary-layer destabilization can materialize this
evening. A WW issuance will eventually be needed as storms across
central NE impinge on the eastern bounds of Tornado Watch 496.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0747 PM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Valid 020100Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN EASTERN NE TO
FAR WESTERN IA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms should persist for a few more hours
across a portion of eastern Nebraska into far western Iowa, before
diminishing tonight.

...01Z Update...
Most of the severe threat across the central and northern Great
Plains has diminished and this trend should largely persist through
the rest of evening. One exception, where a severe wind and brief
tornado threat should persist, is across eastern NE into far western
IA. A leading supercell over south-central NE has recently become
absorbed into a mostly non-severe QLCS. This process may yield some
short-term strengthening of the severe wind threat along the south
side of the QLCS amid a 45-kt low-level jet per UEX VWP data.
Further increase of the low-level jet through the evening will
probably maintain a threat for strong to locally severe wind gusts
despite the more hostile airmass for surface-based convection near
and east of the MO River, per the 00Z OAX sounding. 

A lone high-based supercell in east-central WY may persist
east-southeast along the surface front for a couple more hours, with
some potential for an addition storm or two to form after dusk.
Marginal severe hail and wind will remain possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 494
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM MDT Mon Jul 1 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  The Nebraska Panhandle into Northwest Nebraska
  Western and Central South Dakota

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 135 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Initial supercell thunderstorms should pose a threat for
large hail generally 1-2 inches in diameter this afternoon. As this
activity spreads eastward later this afternoon and evening, it
should grow upscale in more of a line/cluster, with a greater threat
for severe/damaging winds up to around 60-70 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 105
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles north northwest
of Mobridge SD to 70 miles southeast of Chadron NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
26035.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0428 PM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Valid 031200Z - 091200Z

Broad zonal flow over the CONUS will transition to strong western
ridging through the first part of this week and continue through the
extended forecast period. Gradually intensifying through mid week,
the ridge will shunt stronger mid-level flow to the northeast over
the eastern Great Basin and northern Rockies. Still, several weak
mid-level perturbations will pass along the eastern periphery of the
trough supporting occasional gusty winds at the surface across parts
of the Northwest and northern Great Basin. Otherwise, extreme heat
is likely under the ridge over much of the West with near record
temperatures and very dry conditions. Area fuels will undergo
significant drying through the period, setting the stage for
increased fire-weather concerns as the ridge begins to break down at
the end of the forecast period.

...Northwest to the Great Basin...
As the ridge quickly intensifies, northwesterly flow aloft should
develop on the eastern periphery over parts of the interior
Northwest and northern Great Basin. A modest upper-level trough
passing over the northern Rockies will bring a weak cold front
through the region on D2/Tuesday with dry and breezy winds likely
behind it D3/Wednesday. Very warm afternoon temperatures behind the
front should support several hours of 15-20% RH and wind gusts of
10-20 mph over parts of southern OR/ID and northern NV into western
UT. A few hours of near-critical fire-weather conditions appear
likely to develop, though there remains some uncertainty on the
spatial and temporal coverage.

Gusty winds are again possible later in the week into the weekend,
as a second trough moves along the eastern part of the ridge
D5/Friday and D7/Sunday. However, confidence in the overlap of hot,
dry and windy conditions this weekend is much less certain, owing to
the stronger ridging aloft. Still, some increase in fire-weather
potential may occur toward the weekend as extreme heat and dry
conditions continue to develop.

...CA...
Beneath the ridge, extreme heat is likely through almost the
entirety of the extended forecast period. The extreme heat will
support the development of a low-level thermal trough across parts
of northern and central CA. This may enhance northerly flow over
parts of the Sacramento Valley D3/Wednesday.

A period of offshore flow may also develop late D4/Thursday into
D5/Friday as the ridge center shifts slightly farther west. While
uncertain in regard to the magnitude of the offshore flow, very low
humidity (sub 10%) could overlap with wind gusts of 25-30 mph over
parts of the Transverse and Peninsular ranges. Otherwise, very dry
and warm conditions may support locally elevated fire-weather
potential. Highlights will be withheld due to the lack of greater
synoptic winds, but fire-weather concerns should continue to
generally increase through next week and into the weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0429 AM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the Interior West today,
encouraging surface low development near the Four Corners region.
The result will be dry and breezy conditions characterized by 15+
mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds overlapping with
10-15 percent RH during the afternoon across much of the Great
Basin. Given drying fuels over much of the Basin, Elevated
highlights have been maintained. An outside chance for a dry
thunderstorm is also possible over portions of the Snake River Plain
in southern Idaho. However, modest fuel receptiveness, and low
confidence in storm coverage, preclude isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights.

Mesoscale Discussion 1492
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Areas affected...northern NJ into western Long Island/NYC Metro
vicinity

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489...

Valid 301826Z - 302000Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489
continues.

SUMMARY...An intense bowing segment will move across northern New
Jersey into western Long Island and the New York City metro vicinity
over the next 1-2 hours. Damaging wind gusts are expected with these
storms.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has rapidly intensified and
developed into a bowing segment near the northern NJ/PA state line
this afternoon. This activity will spread east/southeast over the
next 1-2 hours into the axis of strong instability oriented over the
northern Mid-Atlantic region. These storms have already produced
gusts to near 50 kt and areas of wind damage. This activity is
likely to continue producing severe/damaging wind gusts as storms
spread across northern NJ and the New York City metro vicinity.

Mesoscale Discussion 1491
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0116 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Areas affected...eastern Kentucky...eastern Tennessee...southern
West Virginia...far western Virginia...and western North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 301816Z - 302015Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Marginal threat for strong to severe gusts will remain
possible with thunderstorm activity through the afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity continues to increase in coverage
across portions of eastern Kentucky into western Virginia this
afternoon. The air mass in this region has warmed and become more
unstable through the morning, with around 2000-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE
in recent surface objective analysis. This is also apparent in radar
and satellite trends for in echo tops and cloud top cooling with
ongoing thunderstorm activity. Upper-level flow remains modest
across the region, waning further with south and eastward extent
into far eastern Tennessee/Carolinas. As such, deep layer shear for
organization remains weak, though around 30-35 kts of effective
shear is analyzed across eastern Kentucky. As such, instances of
severe wind should remain fairly isolated and localized. A watch is
unlikely to be needed but trends will continue to be monitored.

1259 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Areas affected...southern NY into southern New England

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489...

Valid 301759Z - 301930Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489
continues.

SUMMARY...A line of intense storms will shift east across southern
New England and Southern New York/portions of Long Island the next
couple of hours. Swaths of wind damage will accompany this activity.

DISCUSSION...A well organized bowing segment over CT will continue
to shift east at around 35-40 kt the next couple of hours. This
activity has a long history of producing wind damage, and this trend
is expected to continue as the bow moves across CT into RI and
southern MA through 4pm EDT.

An area of convection to the southwest of the bow continues to
become better organized from southern NY into western CT. This
activity should also continue generally eastward over the next
couple of hours and may impact portions of Long Island. Damaging
gusts may also accompany this activity.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible on Monday across the
northern/central Plains centered over Nebraska and South Dakota.
Areas of damaging winds and sporadic hail will be possible.

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough will move into the northern and central Plains
on Monday, with a gradual weakening of the upper high over the
southern Plains. The strongest cooling aloft will occur over the
northern Plains, but gradual height falls will also develop over the
central Plains.

At the surface, a large area of high pressure will exist over the
Great Lakes, with a strengthening pressure gradient over the Plains
as low pressure develops over western NE/KS. A cold front will push
into the western Dakotas during the afternoon, with a warm front
lifting north across the mid MO Valley where a narrow plume of
higher dewpoints will exist.

...Central and northern Plains...
Early day elevated thunderstorms are likely over eastern KS and NE
within the warm advection regime, and this should generally weaken
as it lifts northeastward. Behind this activity, a plume of 70s F
dewpoints will spread northwestward into parts of central NE, while
strong heating and mixing develop across CO/western KS/western NE.
Lift will be maximized near the surface low, with clusters of storms
likely by late afternoon. Cellular activity may contain hail
initially before growing upscale into an MCS with damaging winds
increasingly possible as storms move toward the MO Valley. A cell or
two could produce a tornado near the warm front/hot plume interface
prior to storms growing upscale, as low-level shear along the warm
front will be favorable.

To the north and west, ascent with the upper trough will be
strongest from western NE into SD, with late afternoon storms
forming near the eastern WY border. Lengthy hodographs and steeper
midlevel lapse rates will favor hail, with damaging wind as well
developing eastward. Significant theta-e advection around 850 mb
will support both lift and destabilization with the late storms into
southwest MN and western IA.

Valid 301630Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND AND THE EASTERN MID-ATLANTIC...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered to numerous damaging wind gusts are likely across parts of
the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States this afternoon and evening.
Large hail and severe/damaging winds should also occur from southern
Montana into western North Dakota.

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas...
A mid-level trough over the Great Lakes and eastern Canada will
continue moving eastward through the period. An associated cold
front will likewise advance east-southeastward across New England
and much of the Mid-Atlantic through this evening. Based on area 12Z
soundings and recent surface observations, a very moist airmass is
in place ahead of the front, with surface dewpoints generally in the
low to mid 70s. Filtered daytime heating with broken cloud cover
will support weak to moderate instability through late this
afternoon, with most guidance continuing to suggest a narrow
corridor of 1000-2000 J/kg MLCAPE will be in place along/near the
I-95 corridor from southern New England to the eastern Mid-Atlantic.
Mid-level flow will increase through the day in tandem with the
upper trough, which will foster strong deep-layer shear and
organized convection.

Expectations are for thunderstorms to continue increasing in
coverage and intensity this afternoon, both along/ahead of the cold
front and a pre-frontal surface trough. Multiple rounds of intense
convection appear possible. Given a rather favorable thermodynamic
and kinematic parameter space, swaths of severe/damaging winds
generally 60-70 mph will likely occur as a mix of bowing line
segments/clusters and a few supercells sweep eastward through the
afternoon/evening. No changes have been made to the Enhanced Risk
across parts of southern New England into the Mid-Atlantic, where
the greatest concentration of damaging winds is still anticipated.
Isolated hail and perhaps a tornado may also occur with any
sustained supercell, although poor mid-level lapse rates and
modest/veered low-level flow should hinder both of these threats,
respectively. Deep-layer shear will be weaker with southward extent
across the Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas. Convective mode should
also tend to be mainly multicellular across these regions. Even so,
steepened low-level lapse rates and ample instability should support
a threat for scattered damaging winds as thunderstorms develop and
spread eastward to the Atlantic Coast this afternoon/evening.

...Northern/Central High Plains...
A mid-level shortwave trough evident over the Northwest this morning
will progress eastward across the northern Rockies and adjacent High
Plains through tonight. A surface lee cyclone is forecast to deepen
and consolidate over northern WY/southeast MT by this evening, as
large-scale ascent preceding the upper trough overspreads the
northern High Plains. Even though low-level moisture is expected to
remain rather limited across this area, steep lapse rates and
daytime heating will contribute to at least weak instability
developing by late afternoon. Moderate to strong deep-layer shear
will support updraft organization. Cellular convection that
initially develops over the higher terrain of southwest MT and
vicinity should quickly grow upscale into a small bowing cluster as
it moves east-northeastward across central/eastern MT this evening.
Large hail may occur initially, but a transition to mainly a
severe/damaging wind threat appears likely as this mode transition
occurs. Isolated significant severe wind gusts (75-80 mph) appear
possible given the very steep/favorable low/mid-level lapse rates
expected. This wind threat may continue into parts of western ND and
vicinity tonight before convection eventually weakens.

Farther south, isolated to scattered thunderstorms should develop
along/east of the higher terrain from WY into CO. Various NAM/RAP
forecast soundings across this area show favorable shear for
organized convection, including the potential for a mix of
multicells and perhaps a couple of supercells. The southern fringe
of the stronger mid-level flow and the northwest edge of the
monsoonal moisture may overlap enough in western CO to support an
isolated threat for severe wind gusts.

...Arizona...
Low/mid-level moisture should gradually increase through the period
on the western periphery of a mid/upper-level high centered over the
southern Plains. Diurnal heating in the wake of overnight convection
should occur across the higher terrain of eastern/southeast AZ
through this afternoon, which will aid in the development of weak to
moderate instability. Expectations are for thunderstorms to
initially form over the higher terrain, and then slowly westward
late this afternoon and evening in response to around 15-20 kt of
east-southeasterly mid-level flow. A very well mixed boundary layer,
with steep lapse rates through much of the troposphere, should
support a threat for isolated strong to severe wind gusts with this
high-based convection.
