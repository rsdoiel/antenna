Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 AM CDT Tue Jul 02 2024

Valid 021300Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
SOUTHERN IOWA...NORTHERN MISSOURI...NORTHEASTERN KANSAS...AND
EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Damaging thunderstorm winds, a few tornadoes, and large hail are
most likely this afternoon and early evening over southern Iowa,
northern Missouri, and northeastern Kansas.

...Synopsis...
Broadly cyclonic flow in mid/upper levels will persist from the
Pacific Northwest across the central/northern Rockies to the Upper
Great Lakes.  Within that, a series of shortwave troughs were
apparent, the most prominent over the CONUS being located initially
across WY and northeastern UT.  This perturbation should move
eastward to eastern SD and central NE by 00Z, cross the upper
Mississippi Valley overnight, and reach parts of WI and the Upper
Peninsula of MI by the end of the period.  As that occurs, a
persistent subtropical high over the Arklatex region will shift
eastward over the Delta region, but with attached ridging expanding
back across central and west TX to near ELP.  Another attached ridge
will shift eastward across the Ohio Valley and Lower Great Lakes.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a surface low near HLC, with
cold front southwestward across extreme southeastern CO and
northeastern/north-central NM.  A warm front arched from the low
across southeastern NE, then southward near the KS/MO and AR/OK
borders.  The warm front should move northeastward to the mid
Mississippi Valley today while the low moves northeastward and
weakens.  Meanwhile, by 00Z, the cold front should reach western IA,
northeastern through south-central KS, and the northern TX
Panhandle. becoming a warm front into a deepening low over
southeastern CO.  By 12Z, the cold front should reach northern IL,
central/southwestern MO, north-central OK, then into the low, which
will have sagged into the northern TX Panhandle.

...IA/MO/northeastern KS and vicinity...
A swath of decaying convection and associated cloud shield are
ongoing from Lower MI to IA and parts of southeastern NE and
northwestern MO.  This plume of clouds/precip should continue to
shift east-northeastward and erode through the day, but leave behind
an outflow/differential-heating boundary that, southwest of the
synoptic warm front, should act as the primary convective influence
ahead of the cold front.  Convergence near these boundaries, and
strong heating in the richly moist warm sector between, will support
scattered afternoon thunderstorms.  This will include the potential
for a few supercells with tornado and large-hail threats, whether
relatively discrete early in the convective cycle, or embedded in
subsequent quasi-linear evolution.  That upscale convective
organization also will maximize severe-wind potential from late
afternoon into early evening, before activity encounters a
more-stable, nocturnally cooling airmass farther east near the
warm-frontal thermal gradient.

In the preconvective warm sector, 70s F surface dewpoints should be
common, as a Gulf-origin airmass blends with areas of
evapotranspirative moisture contribution.  Though mid/upper-level
lapse rates will be modest, strong low-level destabilization will
combine with a deep troposphere to contribute to MLCAPE in the
2000-3000 J/kg range.  Effective-shear magnitudes will have a large
range -- roughly 35-55 kt based strongly on boundary effects upon
near-surface winds.  Boundary-layer shear/hodographs will be
greatest near the warm front and along any mesoscale boundaries
between the fronts, locally maximizing supercell organization in low
levels.

...Central/southern High Plains...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop
this afternoon over western portions of this area -- initially over
relatively high elevations of southeast WY, east-central/
southeastern CO and northeastern NM, where diurnal heating will
preferentially erode MLCINH.  This activity should move generally
eastward onto the adjoining High Plains, offering sporadic severe
gusts and hail.  The greatest concentration of convection (and
associated severe potential) still appears most probable over
southeastern CO, growing upscale as a complex and moving into parts
of southwestern KS this evening.

Vertical shear will be most favorable for supercells north of the
front, where a substantial easterly component of boundary-layer flow
will contribute to enhanced low-level shear, greater storm-relative
low-level winds, upslope lift, and moist advection (to offset
mixing-related moisture loss somewhat).  The northern lobe of the
(marginal) outlook area will be under the greatest mid/upper-level
flow and strongest deep shear, but also will have weaker low-level
moisture/theta-e and less buoyancy than farther south, with similar
mid/upper-level lapse rates under a monsoonal plume as closer to the
subtropical ridge.  In the Arkansas River Valley region, activity
moving into 50s to low 60s F surface dewpoints, with a strongly
heated boundary layer, will encounter peak diurnal MLCAPE of
500-1500 J/kg across southeastern CO, and 1000-2000 J/kg into
southwestern KS, amidst 45-55 kt effective-shear magnitudes, and
long/nearly straight low-level hodographs favoring large hail with
any discrete supercells.  However, a well-mixed subcloud layer
should support severe outflow and aggregation of outflows, leading
to upscale clustering for a few hours before activity encounters too
much CINH to remain severe over southern/central KS.  Farther south,
along and south of the front, deep-layer flow and shear will be
weaker, as will buoyancy (due to drier, deeper mixed layers), but
convection still may pose a threat for isolated severe downbursts.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Tue Jul 02 2024

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will prevail over much of the CONUS as a mid-level
trough overspreads the northern Rockies tomorrow (Wednesday). During
the afternoon, dry downslope flow will encourage dry and breezy
conditions across much of the Great Basin into the central Rockies.
Latest guidance consensus suggests that 15+ mph sustained westerly
winds (locally higher in terrain-favoring areas) will coincide with
10-15 percent RH for several hours. With fuels beginning to become
at least modestly receptive to wildfire spread on a widespread
basis, Elevated highlights have been introduced.

Mesoscale Discussion 1509
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0643 PM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Areas affected...portions of eastern Nebraska into western Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 012343Z - 020115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe threat will gradually increase as the warm
front approaches and the low-level airmass destabilizes through the
evening. Severe wind and hail are the predominant threats, though a
tornado or two could also occur. A WW issuance will eventually be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Several thunderstorms are progressing eastward across
NE, including a supercell that is traversing the warm frontal zone
with a history of brief tornadoes. The surface warm front is
expected to continue drifting northward with time as low-level
warm-air advection increases in tandem with the strengthening of the
low-level jet. Initially elevated buoyancy will advect over eastern
NE into western IA with large, curved hodographs. The stronger,
longer-lived updrafts that form should become multicellular and
perhaps supercellular, capable of severe wind and hail. The tornado
potential will be largely dependent on the degree of
surface-based/boundary-layer destabilization can materialize this
evening. A WW issuance will eventually be needed as storms across
central NE impinge on the eastern bounds of Tornado Watch 496.

0747 PM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Valid 020100Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN EASTERN NE TO
FAR WESTERN IA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms should persist for a few more hours
across a portion of eastern Nebraska into far western Iowa, before
diminishing tonight.

...01Z Update...
Most of the severe threat across the central and northern Great
Plains has diminished and this trend should largely persist through
the rest of evening. One exception, where a severe wind and brief
tornado threat should persist, is across eastern NE into far western
IA. A leading supercell over south-central NE has recently become
absorbed into a mostly non-severe QLCS. This process may yield some
short-term strengthening of the severe wind threat along the south
side of the QLCS amid a 45-kt low-level jet per UEX VWP data.
Further increase of the low-level jet through the evening will
probably maintain a threat for strong to locally severe wind gusts
despite the more hostile airmass for surface-based convection near
and east of the MO River, per the 00Z OAX sounding. 

A lone high-based supercell in east-central WY may persist
east-southeast along the surface front for a couple more hours, with
some potential for an addition storm or two to form after dusk.
Marginal severe hail and wind will remain possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 494
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
135 PM MDT Mon Jul 1 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  The Nebraska Panhandle into Northwest Nebraska
  Western and Central South Dakota

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 135 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Initial supercell thunderstorms should pose a threat for
large hail generally 1-2 inches in diameter this afternoon. As this
activity spreads eastward later this afternoon and evening, it
should grow upscale in more of a line/cluster, with a greater threat
for severe/damaging winds up to around 60-70 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 105
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles north northwest
of Mobridge SD to 70 miles southeast of Chadron NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
26035.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0428 PM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Valid 031200Z - 091200Z

Broad zonal flow over the CONUS will transition to strong western
ridging through the first part of this week and continue through the
extended forecast period. Gradually intensifying through mid week,
the ridge will shunt stronger mid-level flow to the northeast over
the eastern Great Basin and northern Rockies. Still, several weak
mid-level perturbations will pass along the eastern periphery of the
trough supporting occasional gusty winds at the surface across parts
of the Northwest and northern Great Basin. Otherwise, extreme heat
is likely under the ridge over much of the West with near record
temperatures and very dry conditions. Area fuels will undergo
significant drying through the period, setting the stage for
increased fire-weather concerns as the ridge begins to break down at
the end of the forecast period.

...Northwest to the Great Basin...
As the ridge quickly intensifies, northwesterly flow aloft should
develop on the eastern periphery over parts of the interior
Northwest and northern Great Basin. A modest upper-level trough
passing over the northern Rockies will bring a weak cold front
through the region on D2/Tuesday with dry and breezy winds likely
behind it D3/Wednesday. Very warm afternoon temperatures behind the
front should support several hours of 15-20% RH and wind gusts of
10-20 mph over parts of southern OR/ID and northern NV into western
UT. A few hours of near-critical fire-weather conditions appear
likely to develop, though there remains some uncertainty on the
spatial and temporal coverage.

Gusty winds are again possible later in the week into the weekend,
as a second trough moves along the eastern part of the ridge
D5/Friday and D7/Sunday. However, confidence in the overlap of hot,
dry and windy conditions this weekend is much less certain, owing to
the stronger ridging aloft. Still, some increase in fire-weather
potential may occur toward the weekend as extreme heat and dry
conditions continue to develop.

...CA...
Beneath the ridge, extreme heat is likely through almost the
entirety of the extended forecast period. The extreme heat will
support the development of a low-level thermal trough across parts
of northern and central CA. This may enhance northerly flow over
parts of the Sacramento Valley D3/Wednesday.

A period of offshore flow may also develop late D4/Thursday into
D5/Friday as the ridge center shifts slightly farther west. While
uncertain in regard to the magnitude of the offshore flow, very low
humidity (sub 10%) could overlap with wind gusts of 25-30 mph over
parts of the Transverse and Peninsular ranges. Otherwise, very dry
and warm conditions may support locally elevated fire-weather
potential. Highlights will be withheld due to the lack of greater
synoptic winds, but fire-weather concerns should continue to
generally increase through next week and into the weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0429 AM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the Interior West today,
encouraging surface low development near the Four Corners region.
The result will be dry and breezy conditions characterized by 15+
mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds overlapping with
10-15 percent RH during the afternoon across much of the Great
Basin. Given drying fuels over much of the Basin, Elevated
highlights have been maintained. An outside chance for a dry
thunderstorm is also possible over portions of the Snake River Plain
in southern Idaho. However, modest fuel receptiveness, and low
confidence in storm coverage, preclude isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights.

Mesoscale Discussion 1492
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Areas affected...northern NJ into western Long Island/NYC Metro
vicinity

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489...

Valid 301826Z - 302000Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489
continues.

SUMMARY...An intense bowing segment will move across northern New
Jersey into western Long Island and the New York City metro vicinity
over the next 1-2 hours. Damaging wind gusts are expected with these
storms.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has rapidly intensified and
developed into a bowing segment near the northern NJ/PA state line
this afternoon. This activity will spread east/southeast over the
next 1-2 hours into the axis of strong instability oriented over the
northern Mid-Atlantic region. These storms have already produced
gusts to near 50 kt and areas of wind damage. This activity is
likely to continue producing severe/damaging wind gusts as storms
spread across northern NJ and the New York City metro vicinity.

Mesoscale Discussion 1491
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0116 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Areas affected...eastern Kentucky...eastern Tennessee...southern
West Virginia...far western Virginia...and western North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 301816Z - 302015Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Marginal threat for strong to severe gusts will remain
possible with thunderstorm activity through the afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity continues to increase in coverage
across portions of eastern Kentucky into western Virginia this
afternoon. The air mass in this region has warmed and become more
unstable through the morning, with around 2000-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE
in recent surface objective analysis. This is also apparent in radar
and satellite trends for in echo tops and cloud top cooling with
ongoing thunderstorm activity. Upper-level flow remains modest
across the region, waning further with south and eastward extent
into far eastern Tennessee/Carolinas. As such, deep layer shear for
organization remains weak, though around 30-35 kts of effective
shear is analyzed across eastern Kentucky. As such, instances of
severe wind should remain fairly isolated and localized. A watch is
unlikely to be needed but trends will continue to be monitored.

1259 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Areas affected...southern NY into southern New England

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489...

Valid 301759Z - 301930Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489
continues.

SUMMARY...A line of intense storms will shift east across southern
New England and Southern New York/portions of Long Island the next
couple of hours. Swaths of wind damage will accompany this activity.

DISCUSSION...A well organized bowing segment over CT will continue
to shift east at around 35-40 kt the next couple of hours. This
activity has a long history of producing wind damage, and this trend
is expected to continue as the bow moves across CT into RI and
southern MA through 4pm EDT.

An area of convection to the southwest of the bow continues to
become better organized from southern NY into western CT. This
activity should also continue generally eastward over the next
couple of hours and may impact portions of Long Island. Damaging
gusts may also accompany this activity.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible on Monday across the
northern/central Plains centered over Nebraska and South Dakota.
Areas of damaging winds and sporadic hail will be possible.

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough will move into the northern and central Plains
on Monday, with a gradual weakening of the upper high over the
southern Plains. The strongest cooling aloft will occur over the
northern Plains, but gradual height falls will also develop over the
central Plains.

At the surface, a large area of high pressure will exist over the
Great Lakes, with a strengthening pressure gradient over the Plains
as low pressure develops over western NE/KS. A cold front will push
into the western Dakotas during the afternoon, with a warm front
lifting north across the mid MO Valley where a narrow plume of
higher dewpoints will exist.

...Central and northern Plains...
Early day elevated thunderstorms are likely over eastern KS and NE
within the warm advection regime, and this should generally weaken
as it lifts northeastward. Behind this activity, a plume of 70s F
dewpoints will spread northwestward into parts of central NE, while
strong heating and mixing develop across CO/western KS/western NE.
Lift will be maximized near the surface low, with clusters of storms
likely by late afternoon. Cellular activity may contain hail
initially before growing upscale into an MCS with damaging winds
increasingly possible as storms move toward the MO Valley. A cell or
two could produce a tornado near the warm front/hot plume interface
prior to storms growing upscale, as low-level shear along the warm
front will be favorable.

To the north and west, ascent with the upper trough will be
strongest from western NE into SD, with late afternoon storms
forming near the eastern WY border. Lengthy hodographs and steeper
midlevel lapse rates will favor hail, with damaging wind as well
developing eastward. Significant theta-e advection around 850 mb
will support both lift and destabilization with the late storms into
southwest MN and western IA.

...SUMMARY...
Scattered to numerous damaging wind gusts are likely across parts of
the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States this afternoon and evening.
Large hail and severe/damaging winds should also occur from southern
Montana into western North Dakota.

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas...
A mid-level trough over the Great Lakes and eastern Canada will
continue moving eastward through the period. An associated cold
front will likewise advance east-southeastward across New England
and much of the Mid-Atlantic through this evening. Based on area 12Z
soundings and recent surface observations, a very moist airmass is
in place ahead of the front, with surface dewpoints generally in the
low to mid 70s. Filtered daytime heating with broken cloud cover
will support weak to moderate instability through late this
afternoon, with most guidance continuing to suggest a narrow
corridor of 1000-2000 J/kg MLCAPE will be in place along/near the
I-95 corridor from southern New England to the eastern Mid-Atlantic.
Mid-level flow will increase through the day in tandem with the
upper trough, which will foster strong deep-layer shear and
organized convection.

Expectations are for thunderstorms to continue increasing in
coverage and intensity this afternoon, both along/ahead of the cold
front and a pre-frontal surface trough. Multiple rounds of intense
convection appear possible. Given a rather favorable thermodynamic
and kinematic parameter space, swaths of severe/damaging winds
generally 60-70 mph will likely occur as a mix of bowing line
segments/clusters and a few supercells sweep eastward through the
afternoon/evening. No changes have been made to the Enhanced Risk
across parts of southern New England into the Mid-Atlantic, where
the greatest concentration of damaging winds is still anticipated.
Isolated hail and perhaps a tornado may also occur with any
sustained supercell, although poor mid-level lapse rates and
modest/veered low-level flow should hinder both of these threats,
respectively. Deep-layer shear will be weaker with southward extent
across the Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas. Convective mode should
also tend to be mainly multicellular across these regions. Even so,
steepened low-level lapse rates and ample instability should support
a threat for scattered damaging winds as thunderstorms develop and
spread eastward to the Atlantic Coast this afternoon/evening.

...Northern/Central High Plains...
A mid-level shortwave trough evident over the Northwest this morning
will progress eastward across the northern Rockies and adjacent High
Plains through tonight. A surface lee cyclone is forecast to deepen
and consolidate over northern WY/southeast MT by this evening, as
large-scale ascent preceding the upper trough overspreads the
northern High Plains. Even though low-level moisture is expected to
remain rather limited across this area, steep lapse rates and
daytime heating will contribute to at least weak instability
developing by late afternoon. Moderate to strong deep-layer shear
will support updraft organization. Cellular convection that
initially develops over the higher terrain of southwest MT and
vicinity should quickly grow upscale into a small bowing cluster as
it moves east-northeastward across central/eastern MT this evening.
Large hail may occur initially, but a transition to mainly a
severe/damaging wind threat appears likely as this mode transition
occurs. Isolated significant severe wind gusts (75-80 mph) appear
possible given the very steep/favorable low/mid-level lapse rates
expected. This wind threat may continue into parts of western ND and
vicinity tonight before convection eventually weakens.

Farther south, isolated to scattered thunderstorms should develop
along/east of the higher terrain from WY into CO. Various NAM/RAP
forecast soundings across this area show favorable shear for
organized convection, including the potential for a mix of
multicells and perhaps a couple of supercells. The southern fringe
of the stronger mid-level flow and the northwest edge of the
monsoonal moisture may overlap enough in western CO to support an
isolated threat for severe wind gusts.

...Arizona...
Low/mid-level moisture should gradually increase through the period
on the western periphery of a mid/upper-level high centered over the
southern Plains. Diurnal heating in the wake of overnight convection
should occur across the higher terrain of eastern/southeast AZ
through this afternoon, which will aid in the development of weak to
moderate instability. Expectations are for thunderstorms to
initially form over the higher terrain, and then slowly westward
late this afternoon and evening in response to around 15-20 kt of
east-southeasterly mid-level flow. A very well mixed boundary layer,
with steep lapse rates through much of the troposphere, should
support a threat for isolated strong to severe wind gusts with this
high-based convection.
