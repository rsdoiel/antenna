Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Valid 011300Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible today across the northern/
central Plains, especially parts of Nebraska and South Dakota. Areas
of damaging winds and sporadic hail will be possible, along with a
few tornadoes.

...Synopsis...
A strong mid/upper-level anticyclone centered over north TX is
forecast to shift east-southeastward over northern LA and weaken
slightly.  This will occur as height falls spread across much of the
Great Plains States ahead of a synoptic-scale trough, initially
located from the northern Rockies across the western Great Basin to
the Sierra Nevada.  The trough is expected to progress eastward
through the period, faster on its north end (thus becoming more
positively tilted).  By 12Z tomorrow, it should extend from Lake
Winnipeg southwestward across ND, central WY, and UT, to near LAS.  

A series of minor shortwaves and vorticity maxima will be embedded
in the foregoing southwest flow aloft, and will traverse the
central/northern Plains today and tonight.  That includes small,
convectively generated/enhanced perturbations embedded in a
mid/upper-level monsoonal moisture plume, evident in moisture-
channel imagery from west-central/northwestern MX across AZ, the
Four Corners region, and most of CO/NE.  Farther east, a mid/upper
trough -- initially from the lower St. Lawrence River region of
southeastern Canada across Update NY/PA/WV -- will move eastward off
the Mid-Atlantic and New England Coasts between 00-06Z. 

The surface map at 11Z showed a cold front -- associated with and
preceding the leading mid/upper trough -- across northeastern/south-
central BC, northern parts of SC/GA/AL/MS, across central AR.  The
front is forecast to move offshore from all the Atlantic Coast north
of about SAV by 00Z, then extend from there through a wave over
central GA to near a line from MOB-BTR-GGG, becoming ill-defined
farther northwest.  Another cold front was drawn from a triple-point
low over southwestern ND southwestward across central WY and
northern UT.  By 00Z, the latter front should reach the central
Dakotas, northwestern NE and northwestern CO.  A broad area of low
pressure should slow/stall the front temporarily over northeastern
CO and south-central/southwestern NE tonight, while it advances to
the eastern Dakotas and southeastern UT. 

...Central/northern Plains...
Scattered thunderstorms may develop this afternoon over a broad area
of the western Dakotas, and the central High Plains, along/ahead of
the cold front and near a lee trough/weak dryline over parts of
southwestern NE and eastern CO.  A few strong-severe thunderstorms
also may form in the post-frontal upslope-flow regime near the
Bighorns and offer severe hail/gusts eastward toward the western
Black Hills. 

The most favorable environment for severe will be across parts of
southern/central NE near a prominent moist axis, zone of warm
frontogenesis, and also possibly differential heating (from the
southern rim of morning clouds/precip).  In this regime, backed flow
and relatively maximized moisture will maximize both kinematic and
thermodynamic parameters favorable for supercells.  A corridor of
60s to low 70s F surface dewpoints -- already apparent from eastern
OK across western KS to western NE -- should shift northeastward
through the day, eroded on the west side by heating/mixing (as per
modifying the 12Z DDC RAOB) but reinforced father east through moist
advection.  That moisture, and strong diurnal heating, will support
a narrow plume of MLCAPE around 2000-3000 J/kg.  Locally large
hodographs are expected in the backed surface winds, yielding
effective SRH in the 250-450 J/kg range.  Supercells with all severe
hazards (including a few tornadoes and large hail) will be possible
in that regime, especially with relatively discrete storms. 
Significant (2+ inch diameter) hail cannot be ruled out, but that
threat may be mitigated somewhat by relatively warm temperatures
aloft in the monsoonal moist plume. 

Upscale growth of early convection into lines an clusters is
possible, both in the southern NE regime wherever activity becomes
outflow-dominant before encountering the moisture plume, and farther
north as a possible frontal/prefrontal QLCS.  The most sustained
potential for upscale evolution appears to be with the central/
southern NE activity shifting tonight into eastern NE, western IA
and the Siouxland region, where inflow-layer moisture and
instability should be greatest.  As such, the potential for
cold-pool-aided convective-gust enhancement remains represented by a
significant-wind area inside the broader 15% unconditional wind
line.  If confidence increases in a specific MCS corridor, that
probability may need to be raised in a succeeding outlook.

...Southeast...
Widely scattered to scattered, multicellular thunderstorms are
expected this afternoon between the frontal zone over GA/SC/AL on
the north, and on the south, sea-breeze and differential-heating
boundaries.  The most intense cells will be capable of water-loaded
downbursts near severe limits.  A very moisture-rich boundary layer
will persist across the region, with surface dewpoints commonly in
the low/mid 70s F and PW near 2 inches.  Strong surface heating will
offset modest mid/upper-level lapse rates enough to yield MLCAPE in
the 2000-3000 J/kg.  Low/middle-level flow and shear should be weak,
though a belt of strong northerly to northeasterly winds in upper
levels (near anvil level) may aid in storm organization.  Severe
potential should be isolated and pulse in nature, with short-lived,
localized clustering possible, and should wane after sunset.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0429 AM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the Interior West today,
encouraging surface low development near the Four Corners region.
The result will be dry and breezy conditions characterized by 15+
mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds overlapping with
10-15 percent RH during the afternoon across much of the Great
Basin. Given drying fuels over much of the Basin, Elevated
highlights have been maintained. An outside chance for a dry
thunderstorm is also possible over portions of the Snake River Plain
in southern Idaho. However, modest fuel receptiveness, and low
confidence in storm coverage, preclude isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights.

Areas affected...northern NJ into western Long Island/NYC Metro
vicinity

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489...

Valid 301826Z - 302000Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489
continues.

SUMMARY...An intense bowing segment will move across northern New
Jersey into western Long Island and the New York City metro vicinity
over the next 1-2 hours. Damaging wind gusts are expected with these
storms.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has rapidly intensified and
developed into a bowing segment near the northern NJ/PA state line
this afternoon. This activity will spread east/southeast over the
next 1-2 hours into the axis of strong instability oriented over the
northern Mid-Atlantic region. These storms have already produced
gusts to near 50 kt and areas of wind damage. This activity is
likely to continue producing severe/damaging wind gusts as storms
spread across northern NJ and the New York City metro vicinity.

0116 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Areas affected...eastern Kentucky...eastern Tennessee...southern
West Virginia...far western Virginia...and western North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 301816Z - 302015Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Marginal threat for strong to severe gusts will remain
possible with thunderstorm activity through the afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity continues to increase in coverage
across portions of eastern Kentucky into western Virginia this
afternoon. The air mass in this region has warmed and become more
unstable through the morning, with around 2000-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE
in recent surface objective analysis. This is also apparent in radar
and satellite trends for in echo tops and cloud top cooling with
ongoing thunderstorm activity. Upper-level flow remains modest
across the region, waning further with south and eastward extent
into far eastern Tennessee/Carolinas. As such, deep layer shear for
organization remains weak, though around 30-35 kts of effective
shear is analyzed across eastern Kentucky. As such, instances of
severe wind should remain fairly isolated and localized. A watch is
unlikely to be needed but trends will continue to be monitored.

Areas affected...southern NY into southern New England

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489...

Valid 301759Z - 301930Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489
continues.

SUMMARY...A line of intense storms will shift east across southern
New England and Southern New York/portions of Long Island the next
couple of hours. Swaths of wind damage will accompany this activity.

DISCUSSION...A well organized bowing segment over CT will continue
to shift east at around 35-40 kt the next couple of hours. This
activity has a long history of producing wind damage, and this trend
is expected to continue as the bow moves across CT into RI and
southern MA through 4pm EDT.

An area of convection to the southwest of the bow continues to
become better organized from southern NY into western CT. This
activity should also continue generally eastward over the next
couple of hours and may impact portions of Long Island. Damaging
gusts may also accompany this activity.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 489
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1110 AM EDT Sun Jun 30 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Connecticut
  Northern Delaware
  Massachusetts
  New Jersey
  Southern New York
  Central and Eastern Pennsylvania
  Rhode Island
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning and evening from 1110 AM until
  700 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 75 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A mix of thunderstorm clusters and supercells should pose
a threat for numerous to widespread severe/damaging winds as they
move eastward this afternoon and evening. Peak wind gusts should
generally range around 60-70 mph, with isolated gusts perhaps
reaching up to 75 mph. Occasional hail around 1-1.5 inches in
diameter may also occur with any sustained supercell.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 100
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles north northwest
of Worcester MA to 30 miles west southwest of Philadelphia PA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27035.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 490
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1250 PM EDT Sun Jun 30 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Maine
  New Hampshire
  Eastern Vermont
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 1250 PM until
  800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to intensify this afternoon
while moving quickly eastward. Scattered severe/damaging winds up to
60-70 mph should be the main threat, but isolated hail around 1-1.5
inches in diameter may occur with any supercell. A brief tornado
also appears possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles north northwest
of Caribou ME to 20 miles southwest of Portsmouth NH. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible on Monday across the
northern/central Plains centered over Nebraska and South Dakota.
Areas of damaging winds and sporadic hail will be possible.

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough will move into the northern and central Plains
on Monday, with a gradual weakening of the upper high over the
southern Plains. The strongest cooling aloft will occur over the
northern Plains, but gradual height falls will also develop over the
central Plains.

At the surface, a large area of high pressure will exist over the
Great Lakes, with a strengthening pressure gradient over the Plains
as low pressure develops over western NE/KS. A cold front will push
into the western Dakotas during the afternoon, with a warm front
lifting north across the mid MO Valley where a narrow plume of
higher dewpoints will exist.

...Central and northern Plains...
Early day elevated thunderstorms are likely over eastern KS and NE
within the warm advection regime, and this should generally weaken
as it lifts northeastward. Behind this activity, a plume of 70s F
dewpoints will spread northwestward into parts of central NE, while
strong heating and mixing develop across CO/western KS/western NE.
Lift will be maximized near the surface low, with clusters of storms
likely by late afternoon. Cellular activity may contain hail
initially before growing upscale into an MCS with damaging winds
increasingly possible as storms move toward the MO Valley. A cell or
two could produce a tornado near the warm front/hot plume interface
prior to storms growing upscale, as low-level shear along the warm
front will be favorable.

To the north and west, ascent with the upper trough will be
strongest from western NE into SD, with late afternoon storms
forming near the eastern WY border. Lengthy hodographs and steeper
midlevel lapse rates will favor hail, with damaging wind as well
developing eastward. Significant theta-e advection around 850 mb
will support both lift and destabilization with the late storms into
southwest MN and western IA.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND AND THE EASTERN MID-ATLANTIC...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered to numerous damaging wind gusts are likely across parts of
the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States this afternoon and evening.
Large hail and severe/damaging winds should also occur from southern
Montana into western North Dakota.

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas...
A mid-level trough over the Great Lakes and eastern Canada will
continue moving eastward through the period. An associated cold
front will likewise advance east-southeastward across New England
and much of the Mid-Atlantic through this evening. Based on area 12Z
soundings and recent surface observations, a very moist airmass is
in place ahead of the front, with surface dewpoints generally in the
low to mid 70s. Filtered daytime heating with broken cloud cover
will support weak to moderate instability through late this
afternoon, with most guidance continuing to suggest a narrow
corridor of 1000-2000 J/kg MLCAPE will be in place along/near the
I-95 corridor from southern New England to the eastern Mid-Atlantic.
Mid-level flow will increase through the day in tandem with the
upper trough, which will foster strong deep-layer shear and
organized convection.

Expectations are for thunderstorms to continue increasing in
coverage and intensity this afternoon, both along/ahead of the cold
front and a pre-frontal surface trough. Multiple rounds of intense
convection appear possible. Given a rather favorable thermodynamic
and kinematic parameter space, swaths of severe/damaging winds
generally 60-70 mph will likely occur as a mix of bowing line
segments/clusters and a few supercells sweep eastward through the
afternoon/evening. No changes have been made to the Enhanced Risk
across parts of southern New England into the Mid-Atlantic, where
the greatest concentration of damaging winds is still anticipated.
Isolated hail and perhaps a tornado may also occur with any
sustained supercell, although poor mid-level lapse rates and
modest/veered low-level flow should hinder both of these threats,
respectively. Deep-layer shear will be weaker with southward extent
across the Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas. Convective mode should
also tend to be mainly multicellular across these regions. Even so,
steepened low-level lapse rates and ample instability should support
a threat for scattered damaging winds as thunderstorms develop and
spread eastward to the Atlantic Coast this afternoon/evening.

...Northern/Central High Plains...
A mid-level shortwave trough evident over the Northwest this morning
will progress eastward across the northern Rockies and adjacent High
Plains through tonight. A surface lee cyclone is forecast to deepen
and consolidate over northern WY/southeast MT by this evening, as
large-scale ascent preceding the upper trough overspreads the
northern High Plains. Even though low-level moisture is expected to
remain rather limited across this area, steep lapse rates and
daytime heating will contribute to at least weak instability
developing by late afternoon. Moderate to strong deep-layer shear
will support updraft organization. Cellular convection that
initially develops over the higher terrain of southwest MT and
vicinity should quickly grow upscale into a small bowing cluster as
it moves east-northeastward across central/eastern MT this evening.
Large hail may occur initially, but a transition to mainly a
severe/damaging wind threat appears likely as this mode transition
occurs. Isolated significant severe wind gusts (75-80 mph) appear
possible given the very steep/favorable low/mid-level lapse rates
expected. This wind threat may continue into parts of western ND and
vicinity tonight before convection eventually weakens.

Farther south, isolated to scattered thunderstorms should develop
along/east of the higher terrain from WY into CO. Various NAM/RAP
forecast soundings across this area show favorable shear for
organized convection, including the potential for a mix of
multicells and perhaps a couple of supercells. The southern fringe
of the stronger mid-level flow and the northwest edge of the
monsoonal moisture may overlap enough in western CO to support an
isolated threat for severe wind gusts.

...Arizona...
Low/mid-level moisture should gradually increase through the period
on the western periphery of a mid/upper-level high centered over the
southern Plains. Diurnal heating in the wake of overnight convection
should occur across the higher terrain of eastern/southeast AZ
through this afternoon, which will aid in the development of weak to
moderate instability. Expectations are for thunderstorms to
initially form over the higher terrain, and then slowly westward
late this afternoon and evening in response to around 15-20 kt of
east-southeasterly mid-level flow. A very well mixed boundary layer,
with steep lapse rates through much of the troposphere, should
support a threat for isolated strong to severe wind gusts with this
high-based convection.
