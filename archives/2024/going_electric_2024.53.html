We don’t want to sound alarmist,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/14/which-electric-vehicles-qualify-us-federal-tax-credit-ev-2024/">but
it sure looks like President-elect Donald Trump and his billionaire
buddies are plotting to kill federal EV tax credits somewhat sooner than
later</a> – and the tariffs they’re promising aren’t going to make cars
cheaper anytime soon, either. So if you’re in the market for a new EV,
the time is now to score a sweet 0% financing deal and get those tax
credits
(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/electrek.co/reel/DCjVmEnOFLG/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while
you still can</a>).
</p>
<p>
<strong>UPDATE</strong>: we’ve got a few new additions for the closing
days of 2024, including sweet deals on the Mustang Mach-E GT (above),
Toyota bZ4X, and more!
