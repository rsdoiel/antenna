He was the first president in U.S. history to have entered the office without any prior public office or military experience. He is the first president to have ever been impeached twice, and certainly the first to have openly and explicitly attempted to subvert the peaceful transfer of power to his successor. For all his transgressions, at least Richard Nixon resigned.</p>
