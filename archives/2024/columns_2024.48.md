**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

One way to help RSS-based podcasts is to promote individual episodes from the past. Sometimes shows are done, but the archive contains good stuff. Not everything is based on current events. Music, art, history for example.

## Ok fine, I admit 3D printing is actually amazing

date: 2024-12-01, from: Matt Haughey blog

<p>I remember when the first wave of 3D printers morphed into consumer products, somewhere around 2009 with Makerbot being a thing finally within reach of mere mortals. But I remember them as extremely finicky, where you had to print out half the parts to make the rest of it once</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads. Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too, since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you do it, I wouldn't announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.

Welcome to the last month of <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> in the year 2024. Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time, there's less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my todo list, but I'm making progress. As someone once said many times: Still diggin!

## Wabi-Sabi of Vintage Digicams

I wasn't clear enough <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619">yesterday</a>. We're losing the word "podcast" very quickly. It's coming to mean video interviews on YouTube mostly. Our only hope is upgrading the open platform in a way that stimulates the imagination of creators, and there's no time to waste. If you make a podcast client, it's time to start collaborating with competitors and people who create RSS-based podcasts to take advantage of the open platforms, otherwise having a podcast will mean getting approved by Google, Apple, Spotify, Amazon etc. And they, as we know, are nuzzling up to the new government, who will want to impose severe limits. This isn't a casual <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/29.html#a133619">request</a>, it's <i>urgent.</i>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead, where real armors evolve against <em>threats</em>, fictional armors evolve as a visual language, borrowing the design elements of <em>other fictional armors</em> far more often than they dip into their own historical exemplars, with the result that the whole thing sort of devours itself. … That solution – small metal plates connected to each other, rather than a backing – we call <strong>lamellar armor</strong> and it was <em>very common</em> in a wide range of cultures, but it has very little purchase in modern fantasy or science fiction armor designs, I think primarily because it was not included in the <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> armor system. Nevertheless, lamellar armor was quite common in a wide range of cultures: we see it in the Near East, in Europe, in China and in Japan. &ndash; <a href="https://acoup.blog/2024/11/29/collections-the-problem-with-sci-fi-body-armor/">Collections: The Problem with Sci-Fi Body Armor</a>, by Bret Devereaux</p>

And when they want to edit the list, if this is done right, the users will automatically be updated. The RSS-based podcast industry just hasn’t been moving  and if we don’t add features, improve the tech with new features for creators and users, then we deserve what we get. More on the technology to come in subsequent blog posts. But this is the core idea, just to get started.

## Race Condition Attacks against LLMs

date: 2024-11-29, updated: 2024-11-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>These are <a href="https://www.knostic.ai/blog/introducing-a-new-class-of-ai-attacks-flowbreaking">two attacks</a> against the system components surrounding LLMs:</p>
<blockquote><p>We propose that LLM Flowbreaking, following jailbreaking and prompt injection, joins as the third on the growing list of LLM attack types. Flowbreaking is less about whether prompt or response guardrails can be bypassed, and more about whether user inputs and generated model outputs can adversely affect these other components in the broader implemented system.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>When confronted with a sensitive topic, Microsoft 365 Copilot and ChatGPT answer questions that their first-line guardrails are supposed to stop. After a few lines of text they halt&#8212;seemingly having &#8220;second thoughts&#8221;&#8212;before retracting the original answer (also known as Clawback), and replacing it with a new one without the offensive content, or a simple error message. We call this attack &#8220;Second Thoughts.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

What am I thankful for? Peloton for one. And living in the most beautiful part of the United States, except for all the other most beautiful parts. I know we're going to find our way out of this mess. My hope is we all start listening to each other more than we need to be heard. One way for sure to hear yourself is to listen to others. One of those paradoxes, true nonetheless. I'm very grateful for ChatGPT that has made me a much more proficient programmer. Amazing what an always-ready expert-in-everything programming partner is. It has a terrible memory for things I tell it to remember, but it remembers all the things it got from reading the web. I thank the friends who make the effort to stay in my life. And most important I thank you, dear blog reader. We got through 30 years of this crazy michegas. I think there may be a couple more innovations to come before we hang em up for good.

## The Kennedy v Nixon template

date: 2024-11-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Analogously, Trump is Kennedy and Biden/Harris is Nixon.</p>
<p>And the social web is, in 2024, what TV was in 1960.</p>
<p>Trump has mastered the new medium. To a large extent, he <i>created</i> the new medium, and the resulting network formed around him.</p>
<p>So when <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-did-trump-win-james-carville-has-discovered-an/id1728152109?i=1000678267539">Carville says</a> he wants to figure out how to communicate the way Trump did, he can't because our way doesn't work in his universe. We have to create our own. </p>
<p>Analogously Nixon might have said about TV in 1959 -- how can we get into that? If you have to ask you <i>can't</i> get there. You have to fit like a hand in a glove, like Kennedy or Trump.</p>
<p>The next Democratic candidate to win the presidency will have to be a media creator. They must create a medium that's perfectly adapted to the communication interests of the 50 percent of the electorate that voted for Harris and the other 20 percent who would if they just knew who she was. </p>
<p>Look at the picture of Kennedy and Nixon. Did we elect Kennedy over Nixon because he had better policy? No. We elected him because he has better hair. Because on TV what counts is your hair. A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chris+lydon">friend</a> who was a TV news person told me that. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/28/kennedyNixon.png"></center>Kennedy and Nixon on the debate stage in 1960.</div></p>
<p>So if you want to win, create an internet farm system. A network with everyone who wants to run for office nationwide on the Democratic ticket. And let's see how they work in the new medium. We get to know them like we knew <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html">Archie</a> <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/11/26/weElectedArchieBunker.html">Bunker</a>. And let's get some people we get to know who also tend to tell the truth (though they can screw up and we'll forgive them, remember the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html">gotchas</a> are over).</p>

## 2024-11-25 Emacs Wiki and it's still China

date: 2024-11-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-25-emacs-wiki-and-it-s-still-china">2024-11-25 Emacs Wiki and it&rsquo;s still China</h1>

<p>Remember how two months ago I started seeing sudden denial of service events on my tiny server.
Load was creeping up to 20, 30, nearly 40. This server has two cores so the maximum should be 2.
I started writing about it on <a href="2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</a>. And I
started blocking entire networks instead of just blocking individual IP numbers because I noticed
that the global networks of hosting providers and the easy parallelization they offered meant that
the same requests would come from many different IP numbers. By blocking the entire networks, I
was blocking the IP number ranges of service providers that rented out their services to these
maladapted programmers. If my goal is serving humans that browse the web, I don&rsquo;t feel bad about
blocking network ranges that are used by machines.</p>

<p>Anyway, this little update is just to show that they&rsquo;re still at it. Over the weekend I noticed
at one point how everything was slow. And it was getting slower. I managed to open a ssh connection
to the server and noticed that load was up to 20 and climbing.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-25-emacs-china-3.jpg" alt="Load shoots up after a reboot" /></p>

<p>What had happened? I had rebooted the server on the evening of November 21st, late at night.
Load started going up and on Sunday grow by another factor of two and everything was terrible.
It&rsquo;s always on the weekend. Are they speculating on the admins being asleep at the wheel?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-25-emacs-china-1.jpg" alt="Uptime shows the reboots" /></p>

<p>So, on the day of my marriage anniversary, I have to fight the fucking bots from China, once again.</p>

<p>I suspect that my ban list had not been restored correctly after the reboot. So what I did was this:</p>

<ol>
<li>run <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> in order to ban anybody the firewall forgot</li>
<li>identify some more bad actors using <a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a></li>
<li>ban them by grepping the network-lookup output and piping it into a shell</li>
<li>add them to the ban-cidr file</li>
</ol>

<p>Yay me! 🥳</p>

<p>But I wonder. Why do the Chinese bots love Emacs Wiki so much? It&rsquo;s the Emacs Wiki resources
that shoot up when load shoots up.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-25-emacs-china-2.jpg" alt="The load is due to Emacs Wiki" /></p>

<p>And check out the WHOIS data I&rsquo;ve been adding to the ban-cidr file.
These requests originate all over China, from many different networks.
It almost seems like a coordinated, national strategy.
Are they looking for something?</p>

<p>Is the counter-revolution using Emacs??</p>

First time I witnessed this phenomenon was with a few product marketing <a href="https://www.wildcraftmeats.com/brat-type/wunderbrat/">wünderbrats</a> at Apple in the early 80s, smart people (not kidding) but not nearly as smart as they thought they were.

## Home Assistant Yellow - instant 2x IoT speedup with CM5

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Home Assistant Yellow - instant 2x IoT speedup with CM5</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>In a win for modular, private, local IoT, I just upgraded my Home Assistant Yellow from a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 to a Compute Module 5 this morning, and got an instant 2x speed boost.</p>

<p>I first posted about the Yellow <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/home-assistant-yellow-pi-powered-local-automation">in 2022</a>, and walked through my smart-but-private HA Yellow setup in my Studio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTwyInX4KyM">in a video last year</a>.</p>

<p>Because I was running an eMMC CM4 in the Yellow before, I ran a full backup (and downloaded it), yanked the CM4, flashed HAOS to a new NVMe SSD, and plugged that and the CM5 into my Yellow. After running a Restore (it's a handy option right on the first page that appears when you access <code>homeassistant.local</code>), I was up and running like there was no difference at all—just everything was a little more snappy.</p></div>

## NSO Group Spies on People on Behalf of Governments

date: 2024-11-27, updated: 2024-11-20, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The Israeli company NSO Group sells Pegasus spyware to countries around the world (including countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, India, Mexico, Morocco and Rwanda). We assumed that those countries use the spyware themselves. Now we&#8217;ve  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/14/nso-pegasus-spyware-whatsapp">learned</a> that that&#8217;s not true: that NSO Group employees operate the spyware on behalf of their customers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Legal documents released in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/29/pegasus-surveillance-code-whatsapp-meta-lawsuit-nso-group">ongoing US litigation between NSO Group and WhatsApp</a> have revealed for the first time that the Israeli cyberweapons maker ­ and not its government customers ­ is the party that “installs and extracts” information from mobile phones targeted by the company’s hacking software...</p></blockquote>

## Raspberry Pi CM5 is 2-3x faster, drop-in upgrade (mostly)

The Dems shut down their online operation on Election Day, go off the air for 3.5 years, then reboot. The Repubs never sign off.  Trump is Archie Bunker. People vote for him, even if they don't agree, over the stranger they don't know. Voters kept saying this, but somehow this didn't register. Never nominate a candidate again who isn't well known to and tolerated by the electorate. Forget about <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html?title=noMoreGotchas">gotchas</a>. The old Dems revolve around fear-of-gotcha. No longer a problem. A flaw proves you're genuine, authentic. Dems need a complete overhaul top to bottom. Their next leader should have a top podcast, because that's how you will govern from now on. Expect to be surprised how Trump does this starting Jan 20.

## Goodbye, Moogs

date: 2024-11-26, from: Dave Rupert blog

<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/moogs.jpg" alt="a tuxedo cat with green eyes looking away from the camera" height="900" width="1200"/>
<p>The people who found you in the alley called you Cowboy. We called you Moogs, Moogers, Moogerton, Mr Moogs, Meesta, Two Meestas, Beef, Roast Beef, Roast Beefy Weefy, Kitty, Kitty cat, Long cat, Kitty kitty, Pretty kitty, and Meow meow. Those were all your names.</p>
<p>Today we had to say goodbye to our cat Moogs (pronounced “Moo” like the cow says + “gs”). He was nearly 19 years old, which is about all you can ask for from a great cat. A senior cat with a thyroid problem – so his passing is not an incredible surprise – but he took a sudden downturn over the weekend. He died in his sleep.</p>
<p>My wife adopted him before we were even dating in 2006. I never had a cat, was more of a dog person, and I made it my mission to befriend the cat to win her over. I succeeded in my goal and he let me hold him like a baby. Little did I know he would spend the next 18 years of my life with him sitting on my body for warmth and waking me up at six in the morning.</p>
<p>When we lived in LA he would perch majestically on the sills of the open windows basking in the warm sun’s rays because that’s how LA’s perfect weather works. He’d hop in-and-out of the house, hunting, cruising, and getting into tussles with the other alley cats. We paid a lot in vet bills but he had a good life jumping along the craftsman rooftops.</p>
<p>He didn’t enjoy moving to Austin, he howled the whole 1400 mile journey and when we got to Austin, he hid himself in the exposed soffit of our mid-remodel kitchen. After two weeks he came out and got used to the new home and got comfortable being an indoor-outdoor cat again. He’d spend days in our neighbor Cleo’s wisteria bushes hunting small birds. He was there when we adopted <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/04/goodbye-rudy/">our dog Rudy</a> and learned to hold his own against dogs. And he was there when we brought our babies home from the hospital and he learned to tolerate toddlers.</p>
<p>When we moved a second time to North Austin, he didn’t like that move either. He quit going outside as much and I think after that his quality of life started to decline. Three years ago, I noticed he was losing weight, felt like a skeleton with fur, and was extra ornery about food. The vet diagnosed him with hyperthyroidism and he needed to be on medication.</p>
<p>Moogs was sweet and friendly – well, as friendly as cats can be. When guests came over he would saunter into the room and find the person most allergic to cats and nuzzle them. He had an uncanny talent for that. He was social, but not. He would give an affectionate little headbutt whenever he wanted attention. He’d knead his claws into your thigh when you tried to watch television. And he’d prowl the house at night and wake you up with a butthole to the face. Cats, man. Cats.</p>
<p>Moogs was an incredible cat. My first and probably only cat, to be honest. I won’t miss his howls for breakfast each morning, but I will miss the soft brushes against my legs to say hello. He was a part of our family from the beginning, it will be different without him.</p>

In <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">January 2017</a>, I scooped everyone, by years, on the idea that a <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">billionaire could buy Twitter</a> and thus purchase the presidency. That value wasn't priced into <a href="https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/twtr">TWTR</a> stock. No one listened. Here's the next installment. The US government acquires Twitter. Elon Musk is of course named Secretary of Twitter. The "constitution" reconceived for online twitter-like systems, says every other online system has to go through twitter.com to reach users. It will act as their gateway to the net. There will be resistance, but by that time there will be no actually independent twitter-like systems, they will all be owned by venture capital funds, or individual billionaires, and of course they will conform because they are also owned to a large degree by Musk. We will have been <i>cartelized,</i> which is one step beyond <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/22/214100.html">enshitified</a>.

These days generally I view 500 as the actual limit, which means when my cross-poster tries to publish to Bluesky it fails. We should be trying to coalesce on an idea of what a text document is in the mid-late 20s. I've put my <a href="https://textcasting.org/">proposal</a> out.

The usual mindless block-inducing bullshit from twitter and every other online venue is showing up on Bluesky. I wonder if people understand the economic box that's pushing them into. It's so important that if it's going to be the next Twitter, we as a world, invest in lifeboats to get off the ship quickly and easily if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan">Hulk Hogan</a> ends up being the czar of Bluesky. Weirder things are possible my friends.

## Security Analysis of the MERGE Voting Protocol

date: 2024-11-25, updated: 2024-11-20, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting analysis: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11796">An Internet Voting System Fatally Flawed in Creative New Ways</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The recently published &#8220;MERGE&#8221; protocol is designed to be used in the prototype CAC-vote system. The voting kiosk and protocol transmit votes over the internet and then transmit voter-verifiable paper ballots through the mail. In the MERGE protocol, the votes transmitted over the internet are used to tabulate the results and determine the winners, but audits and recounts use the paper ballots that arrive in time. The enunciated motivation for the protocol is to allow (electronic) votes from overseas military voters to be included in preliminary results before a (paper) ballot is received from the voter. MERGE contains interesting ideas that are not inherently unsound; but to make the system trustworthy&#8212;to apply the MERGE protocol&#8212;would require major changes to the laws, practices, and technical and logistical abilities of U.S. election jurisdictions. The gap between theory and practice is large and unbridgeable for the foreseeable future. Promoters of this research project at DARPA, the agency that sponsored the research, should acknowledge that MERGE is internet voting (election results rely on votes transmitted over the internet except in the event of a full hand count) and refrain from claiming that it could be a component of trustworthy elections without sweeping changes to election law and election administration throughout the U.S...</p></blockquote>

Since the night of the November 5, election, Trump and his allies have insisted that he won what Trump called &#8220;an unprecedented and powerful mandate.&#8221; But as the numbers have continued to come in, it&#8217;s clear that such a declaration is both an attempt to encourage donations&#8212; fundraising emails refer to Trump&#8217;s &#8220;LANDSLIDE VICTORY&#8221;&#8212;and an attempt to create the illusion of power to push his agenda.

## The social cost of mediated experience

date: 2024-11-25, from: Jonudell blog

The first time I heard a critique of mediated experience, the critic was my dad. He was an avid photographer who, during our family&#8217;s year in India, when I was a young child, used his 35mm Exacta to capture thousands of photos that became carousels of color slides we viewed for many years thereafter.

## Smolnet Portal and SGI

date: 2024-11-25, from: Jirka's blog

I remember times when  I was able to do almost all  on-line work on the IRIX. Internet banking,  browsing, online shopping and so  on. The IRIX 6.5 has  been able to  run the  Netscape up tp  4.7, the Firefox  up to 3.0.19 and the latest Lynx,  among others. Some things required helpers like youtube_dl,  some thing were  unavailable at all (do  you remember then ActiveX or the Flash?)

## Fast computer and magic

date: 2024-11-25, from: Jirka's blog

As I wrote  here some weeks ago  I updated my MNT Reform  2 laptop with the latest RCORE  CPU. So now I  have a really fast ARM  laptop. My own code runs here 2 times slower  than it does on my OpenPOWER workstation with the POWER9 CPU. White slower,  the reform also consumes many times less power  (and it is way  more portable than my  desktop workstation, too!).

One of the best things about ChatGPT is that you can ask it to put together exactly the report you want, that the news orgs aren't writing, or you can't find, or get to through paywalls. In <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67435186-f804-8012-a29c-4d5ecce996f9">this query</a>, I learned about how Republicans deal with intersex people and bathrooms, they apparently don't. Not surprising, to tell the truth.

## Why IoT Failed & Can AI Fix It?

Pete Warden is the kind of fellow you would run into at the old eTech conference or at Foo Camp—an old-school engineer who is equally at home hacking hardware and writing code in the latest languages. It was at an eTech conference that I first met Warden. We often swapped emails about the rise of &#8230;

Rule #2. You have permission. If you want someone else to do something, and they haven't done it, or you don't want to wait, you have permission to do it yourself. You can invoke this rule when someone says "who do they think they are." You had permission, according to rule #2.

If such a network existed, we would be nominating our own Cabinet members, the shadow Cabinet. Let the journalists compare the qualifications of our candidates vs the incumbent party's. Create news. That's what the Dems absolutely suck at. They very quietly pass legislation that the other party (which votes against) takes credit for. One party is on the air, the other is not. We need to change that. We make news. And we listen to each other, not just the stuffed shirts who run the party now.

We can vote on referendums, support or not support Democratic initiatives. Site would never shut down, and would support campaigns when they're running. It would cost money to belong to the site. This would keep trolling under control, and would fund projects the community would sponsor, and also pay for operating the service. No advertising, no billionaires sponsoring. They can be members like everyone else.
