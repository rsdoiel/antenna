<p>date: 2024-12-19, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The hype wave around AI has peaked (or close to it), but its impact
on the industry hasn’t yet been felt. I don’t predict that AI will take
us “boldly where no one has gone before.” Instead, it will help us
revisit old territory, digging deeper into abandoned wells to uncover
untapped value, hidden insights,…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-19, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>In 2025, more podcasts will move from audio and video to the stage —
and not just the big ones with big budgets. This already-growing trend
will be adapted and invigorated by mid-tier and smaller shows whose
audiences have been steadily increasing for years, whose listeners yearn

<p>In 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen told the U.S. Senate that
man-made climate change was real, imminent, and potentially
catastrophic. It was a perfect opportunity for the media to start
covering the issue with the importance and urgency it deserved. Yet
journalists did not rise to the occasion. For decades, they peddled
both-sidesism, failing to…</p>

<p>Around the world, illiberal regimes seek to control the flow of

the innovations that other regimes have successfully used to suppress or
obscure information that is unflattering or undermines their authority.

<p>When Trump won in 2016, those in journalism circles wrung their
hands. How had the media missed it? The field settled on an explanation:
America’s elite newsrooms had overlooked middle America and neglected
rural areas. Journalists misunderstood the zeitgeist. Listening became
the new mantra. Employ journalists living in the heartland. Spend time

<p>It’s hardly revelatory that journalism does not reside at the center

<p>In 2015, when I founded Lupa, Brazil’s first organization fully

Donald Trump was still a reality TV personality, and fact-checking was

<p>After the 2016 presidential election, I left institutional journalism

me”?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>If the media wants to survive, it must work on trust and represent
people fairly. If 2024 was a year of enormous media challenge in this
“unique year for democracy” — with half of the world’s population voting
for their elected representatives — then 2025 needs to be a year for
deep reflection and real…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>If I’m going to predict the future, I find it useful to return to the
past. As a kid, I wanted to be a journalist because I dreamed of seeing
the world, meeting people who were different from me, and telling their
stories. I suspect many of us were drawn to journalism for similar
reasons:…</p>

dark patterns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>A significant amount of media attention and scholarship has focused
on mis- and disinformation in news, centering both the platforms that
allow news organizations to share misinformation as well as the news
organizations that have published misinformation — whether about public
health, the elections, or disaster relief. The attention on this kind of
deception is…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>As a lifelong journalist, it’s been disheartening to watch the
election and its aftermath. Like many readers, I’ve always believed that
if you just show the audience the truth or if you uncover wrongdoing,
people will act and demand change. But I’ve spent the last few weeks
questioning my vocation. The divided news ecosystem originated…</p>

journalistic independence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Threats to journalistic independence are appearing at increasing
rates worldwide, including in established democracies — a situation
which, frankly, deserves more attention than it often receives. These
threats have now crossed a new threshold here in the United States. As
Maria Ressa, a Center for News, Technology &amp; Innovation board
member, reminded us in her…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>In 2025, journalism education will face another challenging year.
With declining student enrollment in journalism and mass communication
programs, increasing workloads on educators, and curriculum challenges
with depth and breadth of covering the basics of newsgathering while
providing the latest skillsets, journalism education has its work cut
out for itself. As the news industry continues…</p>
