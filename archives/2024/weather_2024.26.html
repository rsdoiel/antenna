Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0955 AM CDT Fri Jun 28 2024

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Locally elevated conditions are likely in portions of southeast
California into southern Nevada that overlap with the current Fuels
and Fire Behavior Advisory for well above normal fine fuel loading.
Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track.

..Nauslar.. 06/28/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0125 AM CDT Fri Jun 28 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject into the Northern Plains today as
upper ridging builds over the Interior West. A surface cold front
trailing the mid-level trough will sweep southward across the
northern High Plains while monsoonal mid-level moisture meanders
over the central Rockies into parts of the Desert Southwest. While
elevated to critically dry and windy conditions will accompany the
cold front across portions of southern Wyoming, fuels are too poorly
receptive to support significant wildfire-spread potential. The
thunderstorms supported by monsoonal moisture across the central
Rockies into the Southwest should also be relatively slow moving,
wet, and will traverse areas that have received rainfall in previous
days. As such, lightning should occur over relatively moist fuels,
limiting wildfire ignitions to a degree.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0747 AM CDT Fri Jun 28 2024

Valid 281300Z - 291200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF THE
CENTRAL PLAINS INTO PARTS OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Large hail, damaging wind and a few tornadoes will be possible from
parts of the central Plains into parts of the Middle and Upper
Mississippi Valley today and tonight.

...Synopsis...
The main mid/upper-level perturbation influencing convective
potential this period is a strong shortwave trough accompanying a
small cyclone now centered over southwestern SK.  The cyclone is
expected to open up today, with a 00Z trough position from
southwestern MB southwestward across northern/western ND to
northeastern WY.  The trough should accelerate eastward across the
remainder of the Dakotas and MN overnight, reaching WI and Lake
Superior by 12Z tomorrow.  This will occur as a closely following
shortwave digs southeastward across southern MB toward northwestern
MN.  The subtropical ridge will build across the Southeast, southern
Plains and into parts of the Desert Southwest.  Despite rising
absolute height values, this will yield a tightening height gradient
across the central Great Plains between the ridge and the
northern-stream trough.

The 11Z surface analysis showed a low over eastern ND, with cold
front extending across eastern SD, central NE, northwestern KS, and
east-central CO.  A surface trough was drawn from a cold-frontal
intersection over central NE south-southwestward to the southern
High Plains.  The low should cross the Boundary Waters region of the
MN/ON border this afternoon through 00Z, when the cold front should
extend to southern MN, southeastern NE, through a weak frontal-wave
low over central/north-central KS, to southwestern KS, becoming a
diffuse warm front over eastern CO.  By 12Z, the low should reach
that portion of ON northeast of Lake Superior, with cold front to
eastern Upper MI, Lake Michigan, southeastern WI, then near a line
from DVN-MKC-ICT-DHT.

...Central Plains to Mississippi Valley...
This severe-risk area is a composite of two separate potential
convective episodes, with the western (second) potentially lasting
long enough and far enough east to overlap into the hours-earlier
starting region of the first.

1.  Lower Missouri Valley, eastern NE/northern KS eastward:
An extensive area of clouds and precip, with isolated to widely
scattered, embedded, non-severe thunderstorms, was apparent in radar
composites and satellite imagery from astern MN and WI across parts
of IA, northern/western MO and eastern KS.  Although this will delay
substantial diurnal heating across much of the mid/upper Mississippi
and lower Missouri Valley regions, sufficient destabilization (from
diabatic heating and warm advection) is expected by midafternoon to
support surface-based development near the cold front.  Favorable
low-level moisture (dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s F) will
support a prefrontal plume of MLCAPE in the 2000-3500 J/kg range.

Modest low-level flow will limit ambient hodograph size, but
sufficient deep shear will exist (effective-shear magnitudes 35-45
kt) to support both supercells and organized multicells.  Backing of
winds along and just north of the front also will enlarge hodographs
in a narrow corridor, with vorticity from the boundary potentially
ingested into favorably positioned updrafts for locally boosted
tornado potential.  Development should be most likely and dense near
and northeast of the frontal-wave low, south of which low-level lift
will weaken amid rising heights aloft, and buoyancy will decrease
toward the OK border.  As such, probabilities for this lobe of the
outlook area have been tightened northward somewhat.  Still, upscale
coalescence into one or more clusters/lines should occur, with
severe wind the greatest threat this evening into tonight, and a
tornado or two possible.

2.  Central High Plains and eastward:
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are expected this
afternoon over higher terrain of western/central CO, with additional
initiation possible on the foothills, Cheyenne Ridge and Palmer
Divide.  This convection will be supported by sustained diurnal
heating and related weakening of MLCINH, along with moist advection
and upslope lift by the easterly component of post-frontal flow. 
That moist advection also should offset moisture loss from vertical
mixing enough to maintain buoyancy, with MLCAPE in the 250-800 J/kg
range.  A deep subcloud mixed layer with steep lapse rates will
encourage strong-severe downdrafts.  

Though weak, low-level flow will veer with height, leading to long
hodographs and contributing to effective-shear magnitudes ranging
from around 30 kt in the southwestern part of the outlook (where
coverage also is more uncertain but conditional severe potential
still apparent) to 45-50 kt over and downshear from the Cheyenne
Ridge.  As such, a high-based mix of multicells and supercells is
possible, offering mainly damaging gusts and large hail (each with
some significant severe possible).  One or more clusters may evolve
and move eastward to southeastward over KS this evening and
overnight, with severe gusts the main concern.

Mesoscale Discussion 1454
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0647 PM CDT Thu Jun 27 2024

Areas affected...northeastern Wyoming into western South Dakota

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 475...

Valid 272347Z - 280145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 475
continues.

SUMMARY...Risk for locally damaging gusts and isolated hail should
gradually increase across northern portions of WW 475 over the next
1 to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...Latest radar loop shows isolated strong storms east of
the Black hills, and a separate/expanding cluster of storms moving
eastward out of southeastern Montana and northeastern Wyoming into
northern portions of WW 475.  

With a moist/moderately unstable environment in the vicinity of the
warm and cold fronts and the narrow warm sector in between, and
veering flow with height providing ample shear for rotating storms,
the overall environment remains supportive of large hail and
damaging gusts with stronger storms.  As such, as the convection
spreads eastward into western South Dakota, severe risk should
gradually increase.

Mesoscale Discussion 1453
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0621 PM CDT Thu Jun 27 2024

Areas affected...portions of central North Dakota into central South
Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 272321Z - 280045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...The severe threat is increasing across portions of central
ND into central SD as strong to potentially severe storms approach
from the west. Severe gusts are the main threat, though some
instances of severe hail and perhaps a tornado also may occur. A
Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance will be needed within the hour.

DISCUSSION...Multicells and discrete supercells are moving across
western SD/ND and are approaching the eastern bounds of Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 475 and Tornado Watch 476. Meanwhile, a mature
MCS continues to rapidly propagate eastward into ND from MT, and is
poised to reach central ND in the next few hours. As these storms
merge and approach central SD/ND, severe gusts will become likely as
the storms move into a strongly unstable airmass (characterized by
up to 3500 J/kg MLCAPE per 23Z mesoanalysis). Furthermore, the
strengthening of the southerly LLJ (to 40+ kts), beneath increasing
westerly 500 mb flow with the ejection of a mid-level vort max, will
support effective bulk shear values well over 50 kts. Regional VADs
and short-term RUC forecasts show enlarged and curved low-level
hodographs with modest mid-level elongation. As such, any storms
that remain surface based as they move into the central Dakotas
should be accompanied by a severe threat. The eastward moving MCS
should produce at least some severe wind, which is expected to be
the predominant severe hazard. However, embedded mesovortices may be
accompanied by an isolated tornado threat.

A Severe Thunderstorm Watch will be issued within the hour to
address the impending severe threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1452
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0603 PM CDT Thu Jun 27 2024

Areas affected...portions of southwestern North Dakota

Concerning...Tornado Watch 476...

Valid 272303Z - 280030Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 476 continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across Tornado Watch 476. A
few tornadoes remain possible with discrete supercells, but the
severe wind threat should increase as an MCS overtakes the
supercells in the next few hours.

DISCUSSION...Two discrete supercells continue across southwestern ND
as a well-developed MCS (with a history of severe gusts) approaches
from southeastern MT. 22Z mesoanalysis shows modestly
curved/elongated hodographs preceding the supercells, along with
200-300 m2/s2 effective SRH, supporting tornado potential. With
time, the fast approaching MCS from the west will merge with the
supercells. This may augment the severe wind threat, with 75-90 mph
gusts possible. QLCS tornadoes will still be a concern as well.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
UTAH AND WESTERN COLORADO...

...SUMMARY...
The greatest severe-thunderstorm threat is over parts of the
northern/central High Plains this afternoon and evening, where very
large hail, significant damaging winds, and a few tornadoes are
possible.

...Eastern Carolinas/GA...

The Marginal (level 1 of 5) risk has been trimmed from central GA
and portions of the Carolinas based on latest observations/ongoing
convection and the location of the surface trough. Sporadic strong
gusts remain possible into early evening.

...Northern/Central Plains...

The Marginal (level 1 of 5) risk has been trimmed across parts of
southwest/west-central MT based on the current location of the upper
trough and convection developing over the higher terrain shifting
eastward. Meanwhile, the Enhanced (level 3 of 5) risk has been
trimmed across a small part of northern ND. Persistent cloud cover
has limited heating/destabilization across this area, and surface
dewpoints are lower, in the upper 50s to near 60 F.  Current cloud
cover is not expected to lift north/east very quickly. A
differential heating boundary across western ND will likely serve as
an effective warm front, with convection moving east of this
boundary during the evening gradually weakening with time across
central ND. 

Otherwise, overall forecast philosophy remains unchanged from the
previous outlook, and no changes have been made to the outlook
across the central/southern Plains vicinity. See prior discussion
below, or reference MCD 1445 and severe thunderstorm watch 473 for
more information.

...Eastern Great Basin...

No changes have been made to the outlook across this region. See
previous discussion below, or reference MCD 1446 and severe
thunderstorm watch 474 for more information.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1112 AM CDT Thu Jun 27 2024/

...Western MT into Eastern Great Basin...
Morning water vapor loop shows an impressive shortwave trough
rotating across the northwest states.  This feature will result in
strengthening winds aloft across much of the Great Basin and
northern Rockies today, along with increasing large scale forcing
for ascent.  This will lead to scattered thunderstorms over the
higher terrain of western MT into parts of WY/CO/UT by early
afternoon.  Forecast soundings show sufficient westerly flow/shear
through the cloud-bearing layer to support organized and
occasionally supercell storms capable of hail and damaging wind
gusts.

...Eastern MT into the Dakotas...
As convection spreads off the higher terrain into eastern MT, storms
will encounter greater low level moisture/shear, further promoting
supercell structures and the risk of very large hail and perhaps a
few tornadoes.  These storms will progress eastward through the
afternoon/evening into the Dakotas, where upscale growth into bowing
structures is anticipated - capable of significant damaging winds.

...Central Plains...
Farther south, forcing will be weaker and convective coverage should
be less.  However, convection will intensify as outflows from the
High Plains spread eastward into the moist axis, with a combination
of bowing and supercell storms expected.  Damaging winds are
probably the main risk, but substantial low level and deep layer
shear could support large hail and a tornado or two in this region
as well.

...Carolinas/GA...
A very moist and unstable air mass is present today from
central/eastern NC southwestward into eastern GA.  Scattered mid and
high clouds will somewhat mitigate afternoon heating.  But a few
strong/severe storms are expected, with water-loaded downdrafts
capable of locally damaging wind gusts.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0231 PM CDT Thu Jun 27 2024

Valid 291200Z - 051200Z

Confidence in widespread critical fire weather conditions remains
limited through the extended period, though some fire weather
concerns are anticipated over the upcoming weekend across the Great
Basin as an upper trough (recently noted over the northeast Pacific
in water-vapor imagery) approaches the West Coast. Heading into next
week, upper-level ridging is anticipated over the West, which may
lead to a period of relatively weak winds, but warm/dry conditions
favorable for curing fuels. Elsewhere across the CONUS, recent
rainfall and/or precipitation chances should limit critical fire
weather potential. 

...D3/Saturday and D4/Sunday - Great Basin...
Surface pressure falls are anticipated across central NV on D3/Sat
afternoon ahead of the approaching upper trough. Increasing
southerly flow emanating out of the Mojave desert should advect dry
air northward into eastern NV into western UT and support areas of
dry/windy conditions. Ensemble guidance continues to show only a
modest signal for critical fire weather conditions, but most
solutions suggest winds approaching 15 mph are likely with RH in the
teens. This dry air mass will continue to spread northeast into
northern UT and southwest WY by D4/Sun afternoon. A consolidating
cyclone in the northern High Plains should bolster gradient winds
across eastern NV into UT and WY ahead of an approaching cold front.
The anticipation of a deepening cyclone, combined with at least one
preceding day of warm/dry weather, lends higher confidence in the
potential for critical fire weather conditions for Sunday afternoon.
However, much of the risk area has recently received rainfall and/or
may see rainfall over the next 24 hours. As such, fuel dryness may
be modulated to some degree. This concern precludes higher risk
probabilities, but rainfall and fuel trends will continue to be
monitored. 

Beyond D4/Sunday, elevated fire weather conditions may emerge each
day across the northern Great Basin as a zonal flow regime becomes
established. However, confidence in critical conditions is too
limited for additional risk probabilities.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 AM CDT Thu Jun 27 2024

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough initially within the northern Rockies will
eject into the northern/central Plains on Friday. At the surface, a
cold front will move into the upper Midwest and push southward into
parts of the southern Plains before stalling.

...Central/Southern Wyoming...
Strong winds due to the favorable position of the mid-level jet as
well as the strong pressure gradient behind the front will promote
15-25 mph winds across the area. RH could fall to 15-20% with
perhaps localized 10-15% values by the afternoon. Fuel information
and recent fire activity would suggest southeastern Wyoming and
nearby vicinity have the driest fuels. Precipitation that occurred
Wednesday afternoon/evening along with potential precipitation on
Thursday increases uncertainty in how dry fuels will be on Friday.
In southwest/south-central Wyoming, fuels are sparse and present
fuels do not appear overly dry based on current data. Furthermore,
this area could also see some precipitation on Thursday. As impacts
of precipitation on fuels become more clear, elevated highlights
could be added for southeastern Wyoming.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 463
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
410 AM CDT Wed Jun 26 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northwestern Arkansas
  Southeastern Kansas
  Southwestern Missouri
  Northeastern Oklahoma

* Effective this Wednesday morning from 410 AM until 1100 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Merging areas of strong-severe thunderstorms -- already
with a history of severe wind in parts of NE, northeastern KS and
northwestern MO -- should evolve into a new complex and move
southeastward over the 4-state area of the western Ozarks.  Activity
may reach the Arkansas River Valley between Tulsa and the Ft. Smith
area while still potentially severe later this morning.  Damaging
wind will remain the primary threat, with isolated large hail
possible predominantly ahead of the main complex.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles either side of a line from 20 miles northwest of
Chanute KS to 15 miles south southwest of Russellville AR. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 461...WW 462...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
32040.

Mesoscale Discussion 1396
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0518 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

Areas affected...parts of southeastern Minnesota...southwestern
Wisconsin and northeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 242218Z - 250015Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Sustained vigorous thunderstorm development remains
uncertain, but seems more likely after sunset than before.  Trends
are being closely monitored, with rapid thunderstorm intensification
possible, including potential for supercells posing a risk for large
hail in excess of 2 inches in diameter, locally damaging downbursts
and a risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...As a weak mid-level perturbation progresses through
broader-scale anticyclonic flow across the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes
region, modest low-level warm advection has become focused
east-southeast of a surface low over northeastern South Dakota,
across southern Minnesota and adjacent portions of northeastern
Iowa/southwestern Wisconsin.  This forcing for ascent appears likely
to be contributing to the recent thunderstorm initiation near/north
of the Interstate 90 corridor of southern Minnesota.  The
boundary-layer is characterized by seasonably high moisture content
and large CAPE beneath steep mid-level lapse rates, but a plume of
very warm/dry elevated mixed-layer air is in the process of
overspreading much of the region, and some further warming
near/below the 700 mb level may still occur into early evening.

While it still appears probable that inhibition associated with the
warm, dry air aloft will tend to suppress this convection, this is
not entirely certain, and the environment is conditionally
supportive of intense organized convection give the extreme
potential instability.  Higher-based ongoing convective development,
rooted in warm advection closer to the northeastern periphery of the
elevated mixed-layer air, east-southeast of Brainerd, is also being
monitored.  As this spreads into northwestern Wisconsin this
evening, it might undergo considerable further intensification in
the presence of increasing lift and instability near the nose of a
strengthening southwesterly low-level jet (30-50 kt around 850 mb).

Mesoscale Discussion 1397
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0531 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

Areas affected...Northern Minnesota and eastern/southeastern North
Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 242231Z - 250000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop along a
cold front through this evening. Large hail up to 1.75-2.50" in
diameter and damaging wind gusts near 60-70 mph will be possible.

DISCUSSION...Latest satellite and radar imagery suggest thunderstorm
development will continue to occur along a cold front extending
northeast to southwest across portions of far northwestern MN and
eastern ND. A moderate to extreme instability axis extends along and
ahead of this cold front, where temperatures have climbed into the
upper 80s, and dewpoints in the mid 60s to low 70s exist beneath
steep mid-level lapse rates. VAD profiles and objective analysis
across this region indicate sufficient deep layer effective shear
(40-55 kt) is already in place. Storm organization and a few
supercells appear likely along this axis through this evening. Large
hail will initially be possible with the more discrete thunderstorms
that develop, before cell mergers occur with an accompanying
damaging wind threat later this evening as instability wanes. A
severe thunderstorm watch will be needed soon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 452
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northwest and North-Central Minnesota
  Eastern North Dakota

* Effective this Monday afternoon from 550 PM until Midnight CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 3 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Developing supercells along/ahead of a cold front should
initially pose a threat for isolated very large hail up to 2-3
inches in diameter. With time this evening, severe/damaging winds
around 60-70 mph may become more of a concern as thunderstorms
potentially develop into one or more small clusters as they spread
eastward.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles south of Fargo
ND to 45 miles west northwest of International Falls MN. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 451
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
105 PM EDT Mon Jun 24 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern North Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 105 PM until
  800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are expected this afternoon across
eastern North Carolina, in a hot and humid environment. 
Sufficiently strong winds aloft will result in a risk of locally
damaging wind gusts and some hail in the most intense cells.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles northeast of
Elizabeth City NC to 30 miles south southeast of Wilmington NC. For
a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27025.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Areas affected...Portions of eastern PA...southeast NY...northwest
NJ...CT...and southern MA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231923Z - 232130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The area is being monitored for a few strong to severe
storms this afternoon. Damaging winds and perhaps a tornado or two
appear to be the main concerns. Convective and environmental trends
are being monitored for a possible watch for parts of the area.

DISCUSSION...Strong diurnal heating within cloud breaks from eastern
PA northeastward across southern New England is supporting steep
low-level lapse rates amid lower 70s boundary-layer dewpoints. While
large-scale ascent is generally weak across the area, convection
approaching from the west and potentially new development along
mesoscale/differential heating boundaries could become strong to
severe, given 40 kt of deep-layer shear per regional VWP. Ample
low/midlevel flow and the steepened low-level lapse rates will favor
a damaging-wind risk, and sufficient low-level hodograph curvature
could support a brief tornado or two with any sustained supercell
structures. Overall, confidence in the development of persistent
strong/severe updrafts is low owing to the weak forcing for ascent,
though convective and environmental trends are being monitored for a
possible watch this afternoon.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 448...

Valid 231837Z - 232000Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 448 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms forming across eastern New York into north-central
Vermont  have the greatest severe weather potential over the next 1
to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...Storms have developed from eastern New York to
north-central Vermont. These storms have developed within a locally
more favorable environment featuring southerly surface winds and
temperatures in the mid 80s with dewpoints in the low to mid 70s. In
close proximity to the eastward/northeastward advancing warm front
and in terrain favored locations where more backed winds can remain,
a greater tornado threat may exist through the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1383
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1242 PM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Areas affected...Portions of the Ohio River Valley into southern New
York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 231742Z - 231945Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Severe storm risk will gradually increase through the
afternoon, with damaging winds being the primary concern. A watch
will likely be issued for parts of the area in the next few hours.

DISCUSSION...Ahead of a northeast/southwest-oriented cold front
draped across the OH River Valley, a corridor of upper 60s to lower
70s dewpoints and pockets of heating will contribute to moderate
surface-based instability -- despite poor midlevel lapse rates
sampled by 12Z observed soundings. As modest midlevel height falls 
overspread the region, surface-based thunderstorms should gradually
increase in coverage along/ahead of the cold front. 

Storms should slowly increase in intensity as they track eastward
and intercept the destabilizing warm/moist sector. Given ample
deep-layer westerly flow/shear (around 35-kt effective shear)
roughly perpendicular to the front, a mix of loosely organized
clusters and transient supercells are expected. Steepening low-level
lapse rates and the enhanced low/midlevel flow will favor locally
damaging gusts as the primary concern, especially with any localized
upscale growth. However, marginally severe hail and a tornado or two
cannot be ruled out, especially with any sustained semi-discrete
supercells. A watch (potentially two separate watches) will likely
be issued for parts of the area in the next few hours.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF THE
UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will be possible over parts of the
Upper Midwest, mainly from late afternoon Monday into Monday night.
A low-probability scenario of a severe MCS producing destructive
wind gusts is apparent, centered on central parts of Minnesota into
Wisconsin.

...Upper Midwest...
Confidence in tomorrow's severe evolution is low. A wide range in
potential outcomes from a sporadic primarily elevated large hail
threat to a derecho scenario are plausible. Primary change with this
outlook is to add a significant severe wind area for the conditional
potential of destructive wind gusts from an intense MCS.

A shortwave trough should amplify somewhat over the southern Prairie
Provinces, mainly during the latter portion of the period. This will
induce weak mid-level height falls by Monday evening/night across
northern portions of the Upper Midwest. Primary surface cyclone will
similarly track east from southeast SK to far northwest ON. A
north/south-oriented cold front attendant to this cyclone should
push east across the northern Great Plains, with the trailing
portion slowing and eventually stalling near the SD/NE border area. 

A very stout EML characterized by 700-mb temperatures of 14-16 C
will inhibit surface-based warm sector development through much of
the day, with remnant elevated convection from late D1 over ND
potentially persisting on an isolated basis along the periphery of
the EML, mainly over northern MN. Large to extreme buoyancy will
develop, centered on eastern SD into western MN, with MLCAPE in
excess of 4000 J/kg probable. 

Isolated late-afternoon to early-evening storm development will be
possible near the cold front over eastern ND into
west-central/northwest MN. Guidance differs greatly on whether this
will occur or not given the stout capping to the southeast. A more
probable scenario is for elevated convection to develop during the
evening into the overnight as a low-level jet intensifies from the
Mid-MO Valley towards Lake Superior. Guidance also differs on the
evolution of the surface warm front into Monday evening/night with
the 12Z NAM holding farther south and more pronounced with the
baroclinic zone across central MN. Most other guidance advances the
warm front deeper into northern MN. Given these spatial concerns
along with the relatively weak forcing for ascent near/just after
peak heating amid pronounced capping over the open warm sector,
confidence is low in the most likely scenario of convective
evolution. Isolated, very large hail will be possible given
plentiful elevated MUCAPE and strengthening effective bulk shear.
The 12Z HRW-ARW depicts a more ominous scenario with surface-based
development over the Upper Red River Valley growing upscale into an
intense, bowing MCS through central portions of MN/WI. This includes
a signal for extreme rear-inflow jet development to around 95 kts at
the mature stage over west-central WI. Other guidance suggests a
later MCS may develop out of the elevated convection in north parts
of MN/WI, and still other guidance suggests little, if any MCS
development will occur. The decision has been made to defer on a
categorical upgrade and await potentially more consistent guidance
in later outlook cycles.

...Black Hills vicinity into parts of NE and western IA... 
The southern portion of the weak cold front should slow and stall
near the SD/NE border area by early evening Monday. Strong heating
in the vicinity of the boundary will support isolated to widely
scattered high-based thunderstorm development. With generally weak
mid-level flow across the region, storms may quickly become outflow
dominant, but steep tropospheric lapse rates will support at least
isolated severe gusts. The strongest updrafts may also be capable of
producing some hail.  

...Coastal Carolinas...
A cold front is forecast to move across the coastal Carolinas 
vicinity, with scattered thunderstorm development expected during
the afternoon. Moderate to locally strong prefrontal buoyancy (with
MLCAPE of near/above 2000 J/kg) and effective shear generally around
25-30 kt will support potential for a few stronger multicells and
perhaps a marginal supercell or two, with an attendant threat of
locally damaging winds and hail.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Massachusetts
  Western Maine
  New Hampshire
  Northeast New York
  Vermont

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 100 PM until
  800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will develop this afternoon across eastern
New York and track eastward across the watch area through the day. 
Supercells capable of damaging winds, hail, and a few tornadoes are
expected.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 85 statute miles
north and south of a line from 65 miles southwest of Saranac Lake NY
to 25 miles south southeast of Augusta ME. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 26030.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 231630Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEW YORK...VERMONT...NEW
HAMPSHIRE...MASSACHUSETTS...AND WESTERN MAINE....

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING OVER
PARTS OF NORTHEAST MONTANA AND NORTHWEST NORTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds and a few tornadoes are likely across parts
of the Northeast and New England, with additional severe storms
expected across the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic region, as well as the
Northern High Plains.

...New England...
Visible satellite imagery shows broken clouds across central/eastern
NY and parts of southern/western New England, where dewpoints are in
the upper 60s to lower 70s.  This is resulting in rapid
destabilization of the air mass, with a corridor of ~2000 J/kg and
little inhibition.  This should lead to scattered thunderstorm
development early this afternoon over central/eastern NY, tracking
rapidly eastward into VT/NH and northern MA.  Forecast soundings
show substantial vertical shear in this region, as storms develop
beneath the mid-level jet axis.  A remnant surface boundary
currently extends from northeast VT into northeast MA.  As storms
interact with this boundary, locally enhanced low-level shear may
result in a more focused risk for a few tornadoes.  Otherwise,
damaging wind gusts and some hail are the main threats.  

...Upper OH Valley...
An axis of warm/humid conditions is present today from KY
northeastward into western PA, where temperatures will warm through
the 80s with dewpoints in the lower 70s.  Model guidance suggests at
least widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms will form. 
Relatively steep low level lapse rates, significant water-loaded
downdrafts, and favorably strong low/mid level wind fields will pose
a risk of locally damaging wind gusts in the stronger cells through
the afternoon and early evening.

...MT/ND...
Model guidance continues to show the potential for a supercell storm
or two to form over southern Manitoba and track near/across the
international border, affecting parts of northeast MT and northwest
ND tonight - mainly after dark.  Sufficient CAPE/shear parameters
would support a risk of large hail in these storms.
