Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0753 AM CDT Wed Jun 26 2024

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE OHIO
VALLEY INTO NORTHERN MID ATLANTIC...ACROSS PARTS OF THE OZARK
PLATEAU INTO LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...AND TO THE LEE OF THE FRONT
RANGE AND SANGRE DE CRISTO MOUNTAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Clusters of thunderstorms accompanied by potentially damaging wind
gusts are possible today into tonight from the Ohio Valley into
northern Mid Atlantic, across parts of the Ozark Plateau into lower
Mississippi Valley, and to the lee of the Front Range and Sangre de
Cristo Mountains.

...Synopsis...
A strong mid/upper-level high over NM is expected to weaken somewhat
and get shunted southward by a series of low-amplitude shortwave
troughs/vorticity maxima crossing the Four Corners region and
central Rockies.  This will occur as a strong synoptic trough --
apparent in moisture-channel imagery over the northeastern Pacific
between 130W-135W -- approaches the Northwest Coast.  The trough
should move ashore WA/BC around 06Z, accompanied by a broad, closed
cyclone centered over or near Vancouver Island.  By 12Z, the 500-mb
low should reach south-central BC, with trough southward to northern
CA. In response to these developments, the downstream synoptic ridge
over the northern/central Rockies also will weaken and shift
eastward over the adjacent High Plains.

Farther downstream, northwest flow aloft will prevail over most of
the Plains States and Mississippi Valley.  A shortwave trough and
MCV -- related to an ongoing convective complex moving into the
northern Ozarks region -- should pivot southeastward to the southern
Appalachians and Tennessee Valley regions by 12Z tomorrow.  A
northern-stream shortwave trough -- initially located over MN --
will cross the Upper Great Lakes today, reaching southern/eastern ON
and Lake Erie by 00Z.  This feature may be preceded by an MCV now
evident near the Wabash River Valley and moving northeastward.  By
12Z, the combined perturbation should reach ME and coastal southern
New England.

The surface chart at 11Z showed a cold front from southern QC across
Lake Huron, central Lower MI, southern WI, southern IA, northwestern
MO, southwestern KS and southeastern CO.  This front is (and will
remain) preceded across much of its length west of the Mississippi
River by convective outflows.  By 00Z, the front should reach
northern NY, western PA, parts of OH and western KY, northern AR and
central OK, becoming a quasistationary to warm front from there over
the northern TX Panhandle into southern CO.  By 12Z, the front
should extend from coastal MA across NJ, VA, TN, AR, OK, to central
CO.

...Ozarks/Mid-South to lower Mississippi Valley...
An extensive area of convection is apparent over the northern/
western Ozarks region into northeastern OK, with ragged reflectivity
and satellite presentation, but strong surface pressure/theta-e
deficits, and lingering areas of enhanced rear inflow above the
surface.  Occasional damaging to severe gusts are possible with this
activity as it proceeds southward through eastern OK and AR into the
afternoon.  See SPC Severe Thunderstorm Watch 463 and accompanying
mesoscale discussions for latest near-term guidance.

Some re-intensification or new development associated with this
convectively generated perturbation may occur as associated
low-level forcing impinges on a diurnally heating/destabilizing and
very moist air mass it its path.  Any such activity will pose a
threat for strong-severe gusts across at least parts of AR and
eastern OK, and the ArkLaMiss region -- perhaps persisting
southeastward toward the Gulf Coast.  Additional development is
possible (but still not certain) from late afternoon into tonight,
near or even just behind the outflow boundary from the morning
activity over AR and eastern OK.  A few convection-allowing model
solutions that develop a second MCS out of such a regime move it
southwestward around the ridge toward east or even parts of
north-central TX, which is a reasonable (albeit conditional)
potential, given the ambient flow and high-theta-e potential inflow
airmass along such a track.  The marginal unconditional outlook, and
to some extent the slight risk, have been expanded in that direction
on such a convective contingency.  Should confidence further
increase in later outlooks, so would unconditional probabilities.

...Upper Ohio Valley to northern Mid-Atlantic...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected by mid/late afternoon over a
broad swath of the Ohio Valley region into the central Appalachians,
shifting/expanding eastward across the northern Mid-Atlantic region
with time this evening.  Scattered damaging gusts are expected, some
of which may be severe in magnitude (50+ kt).

Activity is expected to develop amidst weak MLCINH along/ahead of
the surface cold front, as well as near prefrontal surface trough(s)
and outflow/differential-heating boundaries.  Development will be
supported by strengthening large-scale ascent ahead of the shortwave
trough and ejecting MCV, which should increase poor antecedent
midlevel lapse rates somewhat.  Low-level lapse rates will be
steepened by daytime heating.  That, along with favorable moisture
with 60s F surface dewpoints being common, will contribute to a
field of 500-1200 J/kg peak/preconvective MLCAPE across the outlook
area.  Though low-level shear will be limited by near unidirectional
deep-layer flow and lack of stronger boundary-layer winds, deep
shear will increase enough ahead of the trough aloft to support
organized convective bands and clusters offering localized
strong-severe wind swaths, as well as pulse severe from
predominantly multicellular structures.

...Central/southern High Plains...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop by late
this afternoon, and continuing into early evening, along the eastern
rim of the higher terrain from southeastern WY to northeastern NM.

Difluent northwest flow and weak large-scale lift in mid/upper
levels will prevail by the afternoon convective period, ahead of the
central Rockies/Four Corners perturbations.  This should help to
maintain steep lapse rates in the overlying EML, while diurnal
heating/mixing strongly destabilize a deepening boundary layer. 
Orographic and thermal lift will initiate the convection, which
should move eastward to southeastward over the High Plains, offering
sporadic severe gusts and large hail.  Though modest low/middle-
level flow is expected area-wide, considerable veering of winds with
height will yield favorable deep shear for organized multicells,
and, in about the northern half of the area, isolated supercells. 
Forecast soundings suggest effective-shear magnitudes varying from
less than 20 kt across the CAO/DHT region (where hot, very deep
subcloud layers are expected) to about 45-50 kt near BFF (still
well-mixed thermally), along with surface dewpoints remaining
generally in the 50s F even through the mixing cycle.  This should
support wind/hail potential with the most vigorous cells, until
activity moves into nocturnally cooling lower elevations and weakens
tonight.

...Southern ID to northern Rockies...
Widely scattered thunderstorm development is anticipated this
afternoon, as increasing large-scale ascent and mid/upper flow
preceding the mid/upper-level trough superimpose a well-heated,
deeply mixed boundary layer over and near the Snake River Plain of
southern ID.  Some of this activity may carry over from the isolated
dry-thunderstorm areas of southeastern OR forecast in the SPC fire-
weather outlook.  Convection will encounter increasing moisture/
buoyancy as it moves northeastward, but should remain over favorably
high-DCAPE, strongly mixed subcloud layers with inverted-v
thermodynamic profiles, beneath around 200-800 J/kg MLCAPE.  This
will support localized strong-severe wind potential, until moving
past higher mountains and into evening diabatic
cooling/destabilization.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 463
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
410 AM CDT Wed Jun 26 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northwestern Arkansas
  Southeastern Kansas
  Southwestern Missouri
  Northeastern Oklahoma

* Effective this Wednesday morning from 410 AM until 1100 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Merging areas of strong-severe thunderstorms -- already
with a history of severe wind in parts of NE, northeastern KS and
northwestern MO -- should evolve into a new complex and move
southeastward over the 4-state area of the western Ozarks.  Activity
may reach the Arkansas River Valley between Tulsa and the Ft. Smith
area while still potentially severe later this morning.  Damaging
wind will remain the primary threat, with isolated large hail
possible predominantly ahead of the main complex.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles either side of a line from 20 miles northwest of
Chanute KS to 15 miles south southwest of Russellville AR. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 461...WW 462...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
32040.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 AM CDT Wed Jun 26 2024

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid to upper-level shortwave trough, jet max, and associated cold
front will pass over the Pacific Northwest and western/northwestern
Great Basin Thursday. Although some cloud cover is expected
throughout the day, pockets of clearer skies will allow for deeper
mixing through the lower troposphere near the Upper Snake River
Plain and portions of the northern Great Basin around the UT/NV
border. This, along with a tightening surface pressure gradient,
will support sustained winds around 25 to 30 mph (with localized
gusts up to 40 mph possible) across the Upper Snake Region and 15 to
20 mph winds further south. Warm temperatures and dry boundary-layer
conditions near a prefrontal trough axis will also yield RH in the
upper to lower teens north to south respectively.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 456
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
500 AM CDT Tue Jun 25 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Extreme eastern Iowa
  Northern Illinois
  Northern Indiana
  Southern Lower Michigan
  Northwestern Ohio
  Southeastern Wisconsin
  Lake Erie
  Lake Michigan

* Effective this Tuesday morning from 500 AM until 1100 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...An ongoing severe complex of thunderstorms may continue to
pose a threat for damaging gusts into parts of southern lower MI,
northern IN and northwestern OH before weakening later this morning.
 Meanwhile, a newer belt of strong thunderstorms may reach severe
levels over portions of northern IL, southern Lake Michigan and
northern IN, perhaps merging with the trailing part of the older
activity.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles either side of a line from 40 miles west of Janesville
WI to 25 miles northeast of Findlay OH. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU6).

Mesoscale Discussion 1396
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0518 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

Areas affected...parts of southeastern Minnesota...southwestern
Wisconsin and northeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 242218Z - 250015Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Sustained vigorous thunderstorm development remains
uncertain, but seems more likely after sunset than before.  Trends
are being closely monitored, with rapid thunderstorm intensification
possible, including potential for supercells posing a risk for large
hail in excess of 2 inches in diameter, locally damaging downbursts
and a risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...As a weak mid-level perturbation progresses through
broader-scale anticyclonic flow across the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes
region, modest low-level warm advection has become focused
east-southeast of a surface low over northeastern South Dakota,
across southern Minnesota and adjacent portions of northeastern
Iowa/southwestern Wisconsin.  This forcing for ascent appears likely
to be contributing to the recent thunderstorm initiation near/north
of the Interstate 90 corridor of southern Minnesota.  The
boundary-layer is characterized by seasonably high moisture content
and large CAPE beneath steep mid-level lapse rates, but a plume of
very warm/dry elevated mixed-layer air is in the process of
overspreading much of the region, and some further warming
near/below the 700 mb level may still occur into early evening.

While it still appears probable that inhibition associated with the
warm, dry air aloft will tend to suppress this convection, this is
not entirely certain, and the environment is conditionally
supportive of intense organized convection give the extreme
potential instability.  Higher-based ongoing convective development,
rooted in warm advection closer to the northeastern periphery of the
elevated mixed-layer air, east-southeast of Brainerd, is also being
monitored.  As this spreads into northwestern Wisconsin this
evening, it might undergo considerable further intensification in
the presence of increasing lift and instability near the nose of a
strengthening southwesterly low-level jet (30-50 kt around 850 mb).

Mesoscale Discussion 1397
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0531 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

Areas affected...Northern Minnesota and eastern/southeastern North
Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 242231Z - 250000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop along a
cold front through this evening. Large hail up to 1.75-2.50" in
diameter and damaging wind gusts near 60-70 mph will be possible.

DISCUSSION...Latest satellite and radar imagery suggest thunderstorm
development will continue to occur along a cold front extending
northeast to southwest across portions of far northwestern MN and
eastern ND. A moderate to extreme instability axis extends along and
ahead of this cold front, where temperatures have climbed into the
upper 80s, and dewpoints in the mid 60s to low 70s exist beneath
steep mid-level lapse rates. VAD profiles and objective analysis
across this region indicate sufficient deep layer effective shear
(40-55 kt) is already in place. Storm organization and a few
supercells appear likely along this axis through this evening. Large
hail will initially be possible with the more discrete thunderstorms
that develop, before cell mergers occur with an accompanying
damaging wind threat later this evening as instability wanes. A
severe thunderstorm watch will be needed soon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 452
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northwest and North-Central Minnesota
  Eastern North Dakota

* Effective this Monday afternoon from 550 PM until Midnight CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 3 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Developing supercells along/ahead of a cold front should
initially pose a threat for isolated very large hail up to 2-3
inches in diameter. With time this evening, severe/damaging winds
around 60-70 mph may become more of a concern as thunderstorms
potentially develop into one or more small clusters as they spread
eastward.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles south of Fargo
ND to 45 miles west northwest of International Falls MN. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

Valid 261200Z - 021200Z

Confidence in critical fire weather conditions remains limited
through the second half of the work week and into the upcoming
weekend. However, at least low-end fire concerns are expected to
persist across parts of the Great Basin. 

...D3/Wednesday to D4/Thursday - northern Great Basin...
Recent GOES water-vapor imagery reveals a upper low over the
northern Pacific that is gradually approaching the Pacific
Northwest. Concurrently, mid-level moisture is slowly streaming
northward through central/southern CA. A combination of increasing
moisture and ascent ahead of the wave should promote isolated to
scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Pacific Northwest and
parts of the Great Basin beginning early D3/Wed. Increasing
low-level winds within the dry slot of the maturing low will promote
dry/windy conditions in the lee of the northern Sierra Nevada.
Recent ensemble guidance continues to show a signal for elevated to
critical fire weather conditions across northwest NV and adjacent
portions of OR; however, the extent of the fire weather threat may
be conditional on morning rainfall amounts and sufficient clearing
in the wake of morning showers/thunderstorms. 

The mid-level jet max is forecast to pass over the northern Great
Basin/northern Rockies around peak heating on D4/Thur. The westerly
downslope flow regime across much of NV and southern ID should
continue to promote dry conditions, especially across areas that
receive little rainfall in the preceding 24 hours. Ensemble
solutions show a strong signal for 15+ mph winds, and drier
solutions - notably the deterministic GFS as well as a few GEFS
members - suggest winds may reach 20-30 mph as strong mid-level flow
mixes to the surface. Consequently, elevated to critical fire
weather conditions appear possible. 

...D6/Saturday to D7/Sunday - Great Basin...
Long-range ensembles and cluster analyses continue to suggest that a
second, perhaps more amplified, upper wave will approach the Pacific
Northwest/northern Great Basin during the D6/Sat to D7/Sun period.
While spread in guidance is noted (and expected at this range), the
overall synoptic regime implies increasing rain chances for the
Pacific Northwest with fire weather potential across central NV into
UT where drier/windier conditions are probable. Trends in this
system will be monitored for potential fire concerns heading into
the upcoming weekend.

105 PM EDT Mon Jun 24 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern North Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 105 PM until
  800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are expected this afternoon across
eastern North Carolina, in a hot and humid environment. 
Sufficiently strong winds aloft will result in a risk of locally
damaging wind gusts and some hail in the most intense cells.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles northeast of
Elizabeth City NC to 30 miles south southeast of Wilmington NC. For
a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

Valid 242000Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE UPPER MS
VALLEY ACROSS SOUTH WI...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SEPARATELY IN EAST
NC...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected over parts of the Upper
Midwest late this afternoon into tonight. A corridor of potentially
widespread destructive wind gusts could develop over parts of
Minnesota into Wisconsin.

...20Z Update...
Overall forecast scenario remains valid with potential for an
intense, bowing MCS this evening into tonight. With continued
spatiotemporal differences among recent guidance for initial
supercell development, confidence is below-average for further
increases in severe probabilities along the north-northwest to
south-southeast oriented MLCAPE gradient over the Upper MS Valley. 
In addition, the likely orientation of the MCS with respect to the
instability gradient suggest the significant severe wind threat may
be relatively confined owing to abundant warm-moist sector MLCIN to
the west and diminishing instability to the east. The corridor
previously highlighted, that is centered on a portion of the Upper
MS Valley into south WI, remains the most probable zone for
potentially destructive wind gusts.

..Grams.. 06/24/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1131 AM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024/

...Upper Midwest...
A weakening MCS continues to track eastward across central MN,
associated with a shortwave trough over southern Canada.  Extreme
instability will develop along the southern fringe of this MCS and
accompanying cloud shield, with hot/humid conditions leading to
MLCAPE values over 4500 J/kg by late afternoon across southwest MN. 
Very warm temperatures aloft will likely suppress convective
development in this volatile air mass, but strengthening
southwesterly low-level winds by early evening will enhance warm
advection and likely lead to thunderstorms over central MN.  Initial
storms will be supercellular, with forecast soundings showing ample
low level and deep-layer shear to support a risk of very large hail,
damaging winds, and a few tornadoes.  

As the evening progresses, most morning CAM solutions indicate that
the cluster of supercells will grow upscale into a fast moving
bowing MCS.  However, there is considerable diversity regarding the
track of the most intense storms.  Given the very warm temperatures
aloft, it seems likely the storms will track southeastward along the
thermal gradient - across central/southern WI and into northern IL. 
The potential exists for a corridor of widespread and occasionally
significant (exceeding 65 kt) wind damage, so have upgraded to ENH. 
The low-level air mass will become increasingly less unstable as the
storms move across Lake Michigan and into northern IN by early Tue
morning, suggesting a weakening trend.

...Central High Plains...
Scattered high-based showers and thunderstorms are expected to
develop over the central Rockies and Black Hills today and spread
eastward into parts of SD/NE/KS.  Hot surface temperatures and
inverted-v profiles will support a risk of gusty/damaging winds with
this activity for a few hours early this evening.

...Eastern NC/SC...
A surface front is sagging southeastward across NC today, with a
very moist and moderately unstable air mass in place ahead of the
front.  Thunderstorms are expected to form in this environment, with
sufficient westerly flow aloft to help organize the storms and
promote a risk of damaging wind gusts.  Given the amount of heating
that is occurring in eastern NC, and morning guidance showing
substantial coverage of storms, have added a SLGT risk for parts of
this area.

Mesoscale Discussion 1385
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Areas affected...Portions of eastern PA...southeast NY...northwest
NJ...CT...and southern MA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231923Z - 232130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The area is being monitored for a few strong to severe
storms this afternoon. Damaging winds and perhaps a tornado or two
appear to be the main concerns. Convective and environmental trends
are being monitored for a possible watch for parts of the area.

DISCUSSION...Strong diurnal heating within cloud breaks from eastern
PA northeastward across southern New England is supporting steep
low-level lapse rates amid lower 70s boundary-layer dewpoints. While
large-scale ascent is generally weak across the area, convection
approaching from the west and potentially new development along
mesoscale/differential heating boundaries could become strong to
severe, given 40 kt of deep-layer shear per regional VWP. Ample
low/midlevel flow and the steepened low-level lapse rates will favor
a damaging-wind risk, and sufficient low-level hodograph curvature
could support a brief tornado or two with any sustained supercell
structures. Overall, confidence in the development of persistent
strong/severe updrafts is low owing to the weak forcing for ascent,
though convective and environmental trends are being monitored for a
possible watch this afternoon.

0137 PM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Areas affected...eastern New York...Vermont...and western New
Hampshire.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 448...

Valid 231837Z - 232000Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 448 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms forming across eastern New York into north-central
Vermont  have the greatest severe weather potential over the next 1
to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...Storms have developed from eastern New York to
north-central Vermont. These storms have developed within a locally
more favorable environment featuring southerly surface winds and
temperatures in the mid 80s with dewpoints in the low to mid 70s. In
close proximity to the eastward/northeastward advancing warm front
and in terrain favored locations where more backed winds can remain,
a greater tornado threat may exist through the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1383
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1242 PM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Areas affected...Portions of the Ohio River Valley into southern New
York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 231742Z - 231945Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Severe storm risk will gradually increase through the
afternoon, with damaging winds being the primary concern. A watch
will likely be issued for parts of the area in the next few hours.

DISCUSSION...Ahead of a northeast/southwest-oriented cold front
draped across the OH River Valley, a corridor of upper 60s to lower
70s dewpoints and pockets of heating will contribute to moderate
surface-based instability -- despite poor midlevel lapse rates
sampled by 12Z observed soundings. As modest midlevel height falls 
overspread the region, surface-based thunderstorms should gradually
increase in coverage along/ahead of the cold front. 

Storms should slowly increase in intensity as they track eastward
and intercept the destabilizing warm/moist sector. Given ample
deep-layer westerly flow/shear (around 35-kt effective shear)
roughly perpendicular to the front, a mix of loosely organized
clusters and transient supercells are expected. Steepening low-level
lapse rates and the enhanced low/midlevel flow will favor locally
damaging gusts as the primary concern, especially with any localized
upscale growth. However, marginally severe hail and a tornado or two
cannot be ruled out, especially with any sustained semi-discrete
supercells. A watch (potentially two separate watches) will likely
be issued for parts of the area in the next few hours.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF THE
UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will be possible over parts of the
Upper Midwest, mainly from late afternoon Monday into Monday night.
A low-probability scenario of a severe MCS producing destructive
wind gusts is apparent, centered on central parts of Minnesota into
Wisconsin.

...Upper Midwest...
Confidence in tomorrow's severe evolution is low. A wide range in
potential outcomes from a sporadic primarily elevated large hail
threat to a derecho scenario are plausible. Primary change with this
outlook is to add a significant severe wind area for the conditional
potential of destructive wind gusts from an intense MCS.

A shortwave trough should amplify somewhat over the southern Prairie
Provinces, mainly during the latter portion of the period. This will
induce weak mid-level height falls by Monday evening/night across
northern portions of the Upper Midwest. Primary surface cyclone will
similarly track east from southeast SK to far northwest ON. A
north/south-oriented cold front attendant to this cyclone should
push east across the northern Great Plains, with the trailing
portion slowing and eventually stalling near the SD/NE border area. 

A very stout EML characterized by 700-mb temperatures of 14-16 C
will inhibit surface-based warm sector development through much of
the day, with remnant elevated convection from late D1 over ND
potentially persisting on an isolated basis along the periphery of
the EML, mainly over northern MN. Large to extreme buoyancy will
develop, centered on eastern SD into western MN, with MLCAPE in
excess of 4000 J/kg probable. 

Isolated late-afternoon to early-evening storm development will be
possible near the cold front over eastern ND into
west-central/northwest MN. Guidance differs greatly on whether this
will occur or not given the stout capping to the southeast. A more
probable scenario is for elevated convection to develop during the
evening into the overnight as a low-level jet intensifies from the
Mid-MO Valley towards Lake Superior. Guidance also differs on the
evolution of the surface warm front into Monday evening/night with
the 12Z NAM holding farther south and more pronounced with the
baroclinic zone across central MN. Most other guidance advances the
warm front deeper into northern MN. Given these spatial concerns
along with the relatively weak forcing for ascent near/just after
peak heating amid pronounced capping over the open warm sector,
confidence is low in the most likely scenario of convective
evolution. Isolated, very large hail will be possible given
plentiful elevated MUCAPE and strengthening effective bulk shear.
The 12Z HRW-ARW depicts a more ominous scenario with surface-based
development over the Upper Red River Valley growing upscale into an
intense, bowing MCS through central portions of MN/WI. This includes
a signal for extreme rear-inflow jet development to around 95 kts at
the mature stage over west-central WI. Other guidance suggests a
later MCS may develop out of the elevated convection in north parts
of MN/WI, and still other guidance suggests little, if any MCS
development will occur. The decision has been made to defer on a
categorical upgrade and await potentially more consistent guidance
in later outlook cycles.

...Black Hills vicinity into parts of NE and western IA... 
The southern portion of the weak cold front should slow and stall
near the SD/NE border area by early evening Monday. Strong heating
in the vicinity of the boundary will support isolated to widely
scattered high-based thunderstorm development. With generally weak
mid-level flow across the region, storms may quickly become outflow
dominant, but steep tropospheric lapse rates will support at least
isolated severe gusts. The strongest updrafts may also be capable of
producing some hail.  

...Coastal Carolinas...
A cold front is forecast to move across the coastal Carolinas 
vicinity, with scattered thunderstorm development expected during
the afternoon. Moderate to locally strong prefrontal buoyancy (with
MLCAPE of near/above 2000 J/kg) and effective shear generally around
25-30 kt will support potential for a few stronger multicells and
perhaps a marginal supercell or two, with an attendant threat of
locally damaging winds and hail.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1117 AM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The previous forecast generally remains on track with only minor
adjustments made to reflect recent fire reports, morning surface
observations, and trends in latest high-res guidance. A dry frontal
passage is underway across the Pacific Northwest as mid-level winds
increase over the central Cascades (based on the evolution of
high-level cirrus over the region). Surface pressure falls in the
lee of the Cascades/northern Sierra Nevada should become more
apparent in the coming hours with an attendant increase in surface
winds. Latest guidance suggests the onset of elevated fire weather
conditions will be around 18 UTC along/east of the Sierra Nevada and
Cascades with a slightly later onset for the Snake River Plain.
Localized critical conditions also remain possible through the
Columbia Gorge and along the NV/OR border; however, higher RH with
northward extent and displacement from the stronger mid-level flow
with southern extent continue to limit confidence in the
coverage/duration of critical conditions.

..Moore.. 06/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move through parts of the Northwest
today, favorably timed with peak heating. Surface low pressure will
deepen in the lee of the northern and Canadian Rockies. Surface
winds will increase across the region and into the northern Great
Basin.

...Columbia Basin...
Winds of 15-20 mph (higher downwind of the Cascade Gaps) are
expected by the afternoon. RH may only lower to around 20% in many
places due to at least some push of marine air across the Cascades.
Given the relatively dry fuels and the expected winds, elevated fire
weather is possible.

...OR/NV/CA...
Temperatures will be warmer and RH lower farther south. RH could
fall to near 10-15% over a broad area. Winds away from the mid-level
jet will be slightly weaker, but 15-20 mph is still possible,
especially near terrain features. With dry fuels in these areas,
fire weather concerns will be elevated.

...Snake River Plain...
The southern periphery of the mid-level jet will sag into southern
Idaho. This, combined with the strengthening surface pressure
gradient, will promote 15-25 mph winds within the valley. RH of
15-20% appears probable. Duration of potentially critical conditions
will be minimal and fuels are not yet critically dry. That said,
elevated to locally critical fire weather is expected during the
afternoon.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEW YORK...VERMONT...NEW
HAMPSHIRE...MASSACHUSETTS...AND WESTERN MAINE....

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING OVER
PARTS OF NORTHEAST MONTANA AND NORTHWEST NORTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds and a few tornadoes are likely across parts
of the Northeast and New England, with additional severe storms
expected across the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic region, as well as the
Northern High Plains.

...New England...
Visible satellite imagery shows broken clouds across central/eastern
NY and parts of southern/western New England, where dewpoints are in
the upper 60s to lower 70s.  This is resulting in rapid
destabilization of the air mass, with a corridor of ~2000 J/kg and
little inhibition.  This should lead to scattered thunderstorm
development early this afternoon over central/eastern NY, tracking
rapidly eastward into VT/NH and northern MA.  Forecast soundings
show substantial vertical shear in this region, as storms develop
beneath the mid-level jet axis.  A remnant surface boundary
currently extends from northeast VT into northeast MA.  As storms
interact with this boundary, locally enhanced low-level shear may
result in a more focused risk for a few tornadoes.  Otherwise,
damaging wind gusts and some hail are the main threats.  

...Upper OH Valley...
An axis of warm/humid conditions is present today from KY
northeastward into western PA, where temperatures will warm through
the 80s with dewpoints in the lower 70s.  Model guidance suggests at
least widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms will form. 
Relatively steep low level lapse rates, significant water-loaded
downdrafts, and favorably strong low/mid level wind fields will pose
a risk of locally damaging wind gusts in the stronger cells through
the afternoon and early evening.

...MT/ND...
Model guidance continues to show the potential for a supercell storm
or two to form over southern Manitoba and track near/across the
international border, affecting parts of northeast MT and northwest
ND tonight - mainly after dark.  Sufficient CAPE/shear parameters
would support a risk of large hail in these storms.
