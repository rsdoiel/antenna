<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Pepper Scale</p>
Madras curry is known for being spicier than your average Thai curry,

In these Turkish treasures, a super-savory, juicy mix of beefsteak,
onion, tomato, and bell pepper comes cupped in boat-shaped, crusty
flatbread. Spiced with cumin and paprika, that full-flavored filling
gets its fiery kick from thinly sliced cayenne peppers. Called <em>pide

are crave-worthy all day long. That’s only amplified by the extra-hot
spiciness of these habanero hash browns. As a snack, serve them with a
