Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CDT Thu Jun 27 2024

Valid 271300Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
The greatest severe-thunderstorm threat is over parts of the
northern/central High Plains this afternoon and evening.  Gusts near
80 mph, damaging hail greater than 2.5 inches and a few tornadoes
are possible.

...Synopsis...
The mid/upper-level pattern will feature a progressive northern
stream, with troughs initially located over the inland Pacific
Northwest and over the Northeast.  A series of phased vorticity
maxima extend from the Northeastern trough southwestward across the
central/southern Appalachians to parts of MS/LA in recent moisture-
channel imagery.  This feature should shift eastward to the eastern
Carolinas, southern GA and coastal MS by 00Z, becoming stationary
tonight across GA and the Gulf Coast east of LA, but moving offshore
from NC and SC.

The Northwestern trough will move eastward astride the international
border, with a closed 500-mb low forming and moving over extreme
southern parts of AB/SK tonight.  By 12Z tomorrow, the trough should
extend from the southern SK low across central MT to southern ID. 
Though the flow will remain nearly zonal well to its southeast over
the central High Plains, height falls are expected to extend as far
south as parts of the OK/TX Panhandles.

At the surface, the 11Z analysis showed a cold front across western
MT, central ID and northern CA, and a warm front from near HVR
across east-central MT, western/southern SD and northern NE. 
Cyclogenesis will continue over MT through the day, shifting
eastward.  By 00Z, the main low should reach the MT/ND border area
roughly between GDV-DIK, with cold front southwestward across
northwestern WY, southeastern ID and central NV.  A dryline should
sharpen over the High Plains through the day, and by 00Z, extend
from near the MT/SD line across eastern CO to the western TX
Panhandle.  The warm front should extend from the low southeastward
over the western Dakotas and central parts of NE/KS, becoming
diffuse and fragmented farther southeast.  A lingering segment of a
separate front should be quasistationary and act as a surface
trough/convergence zone across southern parts of AL/GA and the
central/eastern Carolinas.

...Great Plains...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop in multiple episodes
over the northern/central Plains, probably leading off with
cold-frontal initiation from late morning through afternoon across
parts of western/central MT, where large-scale lift will be
strongest with the approach of the northwestern trough aloft.  This
activity -- which may arise from the same vertical-motion field now
associated with convection in higher elevations of southwestern MT
-- should move generally eastward over the Plains, with upscale
organization possible.  Severe gusts (some exceeding 70 mph) and
sporadic hail (some exceeding 2 inches diameter) will be the main
concerns.  Subsequent development is expected closer to the surface
low, dryline and warm front over the northeastern MT/western Dakotas
area this afternoon/evening, also posing a threat for large to very
large hail and severe gusts.  Tornado potential will be relatively
maximized with any discrete or embedded supercell(s) moving into the
plume of greatest low-level moisture and backing of surface flow
near the low and warm front (east of the dryline).

Deep-layer shear should strengthen throughout the day ahead of the
cold front, across the central/northern High Plains, while heating
gradually weakens MLCINH, and regional lift increases in relation to
low-level cyclogenesis.  This will combine with a plume of favorable
low-level moisture (dewpoints generally in the 60s F by mid/late
afternoon) to support a corridor of MLCAPE in the 1000-2000 J/kg
range near and just west of the warm front.  Effective-shear
magnitudes in the 40-55-kt range (strongest on the northern areas)
will support supercell potential, with longer hodographs west of the
warm front favoring destructive-hail production.  One or more storm
clusters may evolve and grow upscale into MCS activity this evening,
further reinforcing the wind potential, with support from moisture
transport and enhanced storm-relative flow of a 40-50-kt LLJ.

Convection should be more isolated southward down the dryline and
lee trough into the western KS/OK Panhandle region, with deep shear
also weakening southward.  However, intense surface heating and
somewhat high LCL will foster boundary-layer conditions suitable for
at least isolated severe gusts and hail.  Some clustering and
mesobeta-scale cold-pool aggregation may occur to maximize
severe-wind potential for a few hours sub-regionally.

...UT and western parts of CO/WY...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are expected to form
atop a seasonally moist, well-heated and weakly capped boundary
layer this afternoon, offering locally severe gusts, isolated large
hail, and a marginal/conditional tornado threat.  This activity
should develop as height falls spread over the area related to the
Northwestern trough, along/ahead of the surface cold front.  Diurnal
heating will reduce MLCINH substantially, especially in the presence
of moisture characterized by 50s F surface dewpoints remaining in
many basins/valleys through the heating mixing cycle, while
orographic forcing also aids lift locally.  That moisture, combined
with steep low/middle-level lapse rates, will support MLCAPE of
500-1500 J/kg, atop favorable subcloud thermal profiles to support
downdraft accelerations to severe levels.  Although environmental
flow should be nearly unidirectional through most of the
troposphere, terrain-forced backing will enhanced deep shear
locally, with effective-shear magnitudes generally in the 25-40-kt
range.  Mostly multicells and a few supercells are possible.

...Southeast...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon into early evening, from the NC Coastal Plain
southwestward to southern portions of AL/GA.  Damaging to isolated
severe gusts will be the main concern.  Activity should develop most
densely near the remnant front/convergence zone as the mid/upper
trough closely approaches, as well as along sea-breeze, outflow and
differential-heating boundaries south/southeast of the front. 
Despite weak midlevel lapse rates, a combination of strong diurnal
heating and rich low-level moisture (with surface dewpoints commonly
in the upper 60s to mid 70s F) should yield MLCAPE in the 1500-2000
J/kg range.  Weak low/middle-level flow will limit vertical shear
substantially, and convection should be multicellular in nature with
some clustering and local cold-pool development possible.  Though
moist-, subcloud layers nonetheless should be well-mixed, supporting
strong/locally severe downdrafts.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 AM CDT Thu Jun 27 2024

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough initially within the northern Rockies will
eject into the northern/central Plains on Friday. At the surface, a
cold front will move into the upper Midwest and push southward into
parts of the southern Plains before stalling.

...Central/Southern Wyoming...
Strong winds due to the favorable position of the mid-level jet as
well as the strong pressure gradient behind the front will promote
15-25 mph winds across the area. RH could fall to 15-20% with
perhaps localized 10-15% values by the afternoon. Fuel information
and recent fire activity would suggest southeastern Wyoming and
nearby vicinity have the driest fuels. Precipitation that occurred
Wednesday afternoon/evening along with potential precipitation on
Thursday increases uncertainty in how dry fuels will be on Friday.
In southwest/south-central Wyoming, fuels are sparse and present
fuels do not appear overly dry based on current data. Furthermore,
this area could also see some precipitation on Thursday. As impacts
of precipitation on fuels become more clear, elevated highlights
could be added for southeastern Wyoming.

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northwestern Arkansas
  Southeastern Kansas
  Southwestern Missouri
  Northeastern Oklahoma

* Effective this Wednesday morning from 410 AM until 1100 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Merging areas of strong-severe thunderstorms -- already
with a history of severe wind in parts of NE, northeastern KS and
northwestern MO -- should evolve into a new complex and move
southeastward over the 4-state area of the western Ozarks.  Activity
may reach the Arkansas River Valley between Tulsa and the Ft. Smith
area while still potentially severe later this morning.  Damaging
wind will remain the primary threat, with isolated large hail
possible predominantly ahead of the main complex.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles either side of a line from 20 miles northwest of
Chanute KS to 15 miles south southwest of Russellville AR. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 1396
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0518 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

Areas affected...parts of southeastern Minnesota...southwestern
Wisconsin and northeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 242218Z - 250015Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Sustained vigorous thunderstorm development remains
uncertain, but seems more likely after sunset than before.  Trends
are being closely monitored, with rapid thunderstorm intensification
possible, including potential for supercells posing a risk for large
hail in excess of 2 inches in diameter, locally damaging downbursts
and a risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...As a weak mid-level perturbation progresses through
broader-scale anticyclonic flow across the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes
region, modest low-level warm advection has become focused
east-southeast of a surface low over northeastern South Dakota,
across southern Minnesota and adjacent portions of northeastern
Iowa/southwestern Wisconsin.  This forcing for ascent appears likely
to be contributing to the recent thunderstorm initiation near/north
of the Interstate 90 corridor of southern Minnesota.  The
boundary-layer is characterized by seasonably high moisture content
and large CAPE beneath steep mid-level lapse rates, but a plume of
very warm/dry elevated mixed-layer air is in the process of
overspreading much of the region, and some further warming
near/below the 700 mb level may still occur into early evening.

While it still appears probable that inhibition associated with the
warm, dry air aloft will tend to suppress this convection, this is
not entirely certain, and the environment is conditionally
supportive of intense organized convection give the extreme
potential instability.  Higher-based ongoing convective development,
rooted in warm advection closer to the northeastern periphery of the
elevated mixed-layer air, east-southeast of Brainerd, is also being
monitored.  As this spreads into northwestern Wisconsin this
evening, it might undergo considerable further intensification in
the presence of increasing lift and instability near the nose of a
strengthening southwesterly low-level jet (30-50 kt around 850 mb).

0531 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

Areas affected...Northern Minnesota and eastern/southeastern North
Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 242231Z - 250000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop along a
cold front through this evening. Large hail up to 1.75-2.50" in
diameter and damaging wind gusts near 60-70 mph will be possible.

DISCUSSION...Latest satellite and radar imagery suggest thunderstorm
development will continue to occur along a cold front extending
northeast to southwest across portions of far northwestern MN and
eastern ND. A moderate to extreme instability axis extends along and
ahead of this cold front, where temperatures have climbed into the
upper 80s, and dewpoints in the mid 60s to low 70s exist beneath
steep mid-level lapse rates. VAD profiles and objective analysis
across this region indicate sufficient deep layer effective shear
(40-55 kt) is already in place. Storm organization and a few
supercells appear likely along this axis through this evening. Large
hail will initially be possible with the more discrete thunderstorms
that develop, before cell mergers occur with an accompanying
damaging wind threat later this evening as instability wanes. A
severe thunderstorm watch will be needed soon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 452
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northwest and North-Central Minnesota
  Eastern North Dakota

* Effective this Monday afternoon from 550 PM until Midnight CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 3 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Developing supercells along/ahead of a cold front should
initially pose a threat for isolated very large hail up to 2-3
inches in diameter. With time this evening, severe/damaging winds
around 60-70 mph may become more of a concern as thunderstorms
potentially develop into one or more small clusters as they spread
eastward.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles south of Fargo
ND to 45 miles west northwest of International Falls MN. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 451...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean storm motion vector
27035.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

Valid 261200Z - 021200Z

Confidence in critical fire weather conditions remains limited
through the second half of the work week and into the upcoming
weekend. However, at least low-end fire concerns are expected to
persist across parts of the Great Basin. 

...D3/Wednesday to D4/Thursday - northern Great Basin...
Recent GOES water-vapor imagery reveals a upper low over the
northern Pacific that is gradually approaching the Pacific
Northwest. Concurrently, mid-level moisture is slowly streaming
northward through central/southern CA. A combination of increasing
moisture and ascent ahead of the wave should promote isolated to
scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Pacific Northwest and
parts of the Great Basin beginning early D3/Wed. Increasing
low-level winds within the dry slot of the maturing low will promote
dry/windy conditions in the lee of the northern Sierra Nevada.
Recent ensemble guidance continues to show a signal for elevated to
critical fire weather conditions across northwest NV and adjacent
portions of OR; however, the extent of the fire weather threat may
be conditional on morning rainfall amounts and sufficient clearing
in the wake of morning showers/thunderstorms. 

The mid-level jet max is forecast to pass over the northern Great
Basin/northern Rockies around peak heating on D4/Thur. The westerly
downslope flow regime across much of NV and southern ID should
continue to promote dry conditions, especially across areas that
receive little rainfall in the preceding 24 hours. Ensemble
solutions show a strong signal for 15+ mph winds, and drier
solutions - notably the deterministic GFS as well as a few GEFS
members - suggest winds may reach 20-30 mph as strong mid-level flow
mixes to the surface. Consequently, elevated to critical fire
weather conditions appear possible. 

...D6/Saturday to D7/Sunday - Great Basin...
Long-range ensembles and cluster analyses continue to suggest that a
second, perhaps more amplified, upper wave will approach the Pacific
Northwest/northern Great Basin during the D6/Sat to D7/Sun period.
While spread in guidance is noted (and expected at this range), the
overall synoptic regime implies increasing rain chances for the
Pacific Northwest with fire weather potential across central NV into
UT where drier/windier conditions are probable. Trends in this
system will be monitored for potential fire concerns heading into
the upcoming weekend.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 451
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
105 PM EDT Mon Jun 24 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern North Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 105 PM until
  800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are expected this afternoon across
eastern North Carolina, in a hot and humid environment. 
Sufficiently strong winds aloft will result in a risk of locally
damaging wind gusts and some hail in the most intense cells.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles northeast of
Elizabeth City NC to 30 miles south southeast of Wilmington NC. For
a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024

Valid 242000Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE UPPER MS
VALLEY ACROSS SOUTH WI...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SEPARATELY IN EAST
NC...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected over parts of the Upper
Midwest late this afternoon into tonight. A corridor of potentially
widespread destructive wind gusts could develop over parts of
Minnesota into Wisconsin.

...20Z Update...
Overall forecast scenario remains valid with potential for an
intense, bowing MCS this evening into tonight. With continued
spatiotemporal differences among recent guidance for initial
supercell development, confidence is below-average for further
increases in severe probabilities along the north-northwest to
south-southeast oriented MLCAPE gradient over the Upper MS Valley. 
In addition, the likely orientation of the MCS with respect to the
instability gradient suggest the significant severe wind threat may
be relatively confined owing to abundant warm-moist sector MLCIN to
the west and diminishing instability to the east. The corridor
previously highlighted, that is centered on a portion of the Upper
MS Valley into south WI, remains the most probable zone for
potentially destructive wind gusts.

..Grams.. 06/24/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1131 AM CDT Mon Jun 24 2024/

...Upper Midwest...
A weakening MCS continues to track eastward across central MN,
associated with a shortwave trough over southern Canada.  Extreme
instability will develop along the southern fringe of this MCS and
accompanying cloud shield, with hot/humid conditions leading to
MLCAPE values over 4500 J/kg by late afternoon across southwest MN. 
Very warm temperatures aloft will likely suppress convective
development in this volatile air mass, but strengthening
southwesterly low-level winds by early evening will enhance warm
advection and likely lead to thunderstorms over central MN.  Initial
storms will be supercellular, with forecast soundings showing ample
low level and deep-layer shear to support a risk of very large hail,
damaging winds, and a few tornadoes.  

As the evening progresses, most morning CAM solutions indicate that
the cluster of supercells will grow upscale into a fast moving
bowing MCS.  However, there is considerable diversity regarding the
track of the most intense storms.  Given the very warm temperatures
aloft, it seems likely the storms will track southeastward along the
thermal gradient - across central/southern WI and into northern IL. 
The potential exists for a corridor of widespread and occasionally
significant (exceeding 65 kt) wind damage, so have upgraded to ENH. 
The low-level air mass will become increasingly less unstable as the
storms move across Lake Michigan and into northern IN by early Tue
morning, suggesting a weakening trend.

...Central High Plains...
Scattered high-based showers and thunderstorms are expected to
develop over the central Rockies and Black Hills today and spread
eastward into parts of SD/NE/KS.  Hot surface temperatures and
inverted-v profiles will support a risk of gusty/damaging winds with
this activity for a few hours early this evening.

...Eastern NC/SC...
A surface front is sagging southeastward across NC today, with a
very moist and moderately unstable air mass in place ahead of the
front.  Thunderstorms are expected to form in this environment, with
sufficient westerly flow aloft to help organize the storms and
promote a risk of damaging wind gusts.  Given the amount of heating
that is occurring in eastern NC, and morning guidance showing
substantial coverage of storms, have added a SLGT risk for parts of
this area.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Areas affected...Portions of eastern PA...southeast NY...northwest
NJ...CT...and southern MA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231923Z - 232130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The area is being monitored for a few strong to severe
storms this afternoon. Damaging winds and perhaps a tornado or two
appear to be the main concerns. Convective and environmental trends
are being monitored for a possible watch for parts of the area.

DISCUSSION...Strong diurnal heating within cloud breaks from eastern
PA northeastward across southern New England is supporting steep
low-level lapse rates amid lower 70s boundary-layer dewpoints. While
large-scale ascent is generally weak across the area, convection
approaching from the west and potentially new development along
mesoscale/differential heating boundaries could become strong to
severe, given 40 kt of deep-layer shear per regional VWP. Ample
low/midlevel flow and the steepened low-level lapse rates will favor
a damaging-wind risk, and sufficient low-level hodograph curvature
could support a brief tornado or two with any sustained supercell
structures. Overall, confidence in the development of persistent
strong/severe updrafts is low owing to the weak forcing for ascent,
though convective and environmental trends are being monitored for a
possible watch this afternoon.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 448...

Valid 231837Z - 232000Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 448 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms forming across eastern New York into north-central
Vermont  have the greatest severe weather potential over the next 1
to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...Storms have developed from eastern New York to
north-central Vermont. These storms have developed within a locally
more favorable environment featuring southerly surface winds and
temperatures in the mid 80s with dewpoints in the low to mid 70s. In
close proximity to the eastward/northeastward advancing warm front
and in terrain favored locations where more backed winds can remain,
a greater tornado threat may exist through the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1383
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1242 PM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Areas affected...Portions of the Ohio River Valley into southern New
York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 231742Z - 231945Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Severe storm risk will gradually increase through the
afternoon, with damaging winds being the primary concern. A watch
will likely be issued for parts of the area in the next few hours.

DISCUSSION...Ahead of a northeast/southwest-oriented cold front
draped across the OH River Valley, a corridor of upper 60s to lower
70s dewpoints and pockets of heating will contribute to moderate
surface-based instability -- despite poor midlevel lapse rates
sampled by 12Z observed soundings. As modest midlevel height falls 
overspread the region, surface-based thunderstorms should gradually
increase in coverage along/ahead of the cold front. 

Storms should slowly increase in intensity as they track eastward
and intercept the destabilizing warm/moist sector. Given ample
deep-layer westerly flow/shear (around 35-kt effective shear)
roughly perpendicular to the front, a mix of loosely organized
clusters and transient supercells are expected. Steepening low-level
lapse rates and the enhanced low/midlevel flow will favor locally
damaging gusts as the primary concern, especially with any localized
upscale growth. However, marginally severe hail and a tornado or two
cannot be ruled out, especially with any sustained semi-discrete
supercells. A watch (potentially two separate watches) will likely
be issued for parts of the area in the next few hours.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF THE
UPPER MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will be possible over parts of the
Upper Midwest, mainly from late afternoon Monday into Monday night.
A low-probability scenario of a severe MCS producing destructive
wind gusts is apparent, centered on central parts of Minnesota into
Wisconsin.

...Upper Midwest...
Confidence in tomorrow's severe evolution is low. A wide range in
potential outcomes from a sporadic primarily elevated large hail
threat to a derecho scenario are plausible. Primary change with this
outlook is to add a significant severe wind area for the conditional
potential of destructive wind gusts from an intense MCS.

A shortwave trough should amplify somewhat over the southern Prairie
Provinces, mainly during the latter portion of the period. This will
induce weak mid-level height falls by Monday evening/night across
northern portions of the Upper Midwest. Primary surface cyclone will
similarly track east from southeast SK to far northwest ON. A
north/south-oriented cold front attendant to this cyclone should
push east across the northern Great Plains, with the trailing
portion slowing and eventually stalling near the SD/NE border area. 

A very stout EML characterized by 700-mb temperatures of 14-16 C
will inhibit surface-based warm sector development through much of
the day, with remnant elevated convection from late D1 over ND
potentially persisting on an isolated basis along the periphery of
the EML, mainly over northern MN. Large to extreme buoyancy will
develop, centered on eastern SD into western MN, with MLCAPE in
excess of 4000 J/kg probable. 

Isolated late-afternoon to early-evening storm development will be
possible near the cold front over eastern ND into
west-central/northwest MN. Guidance differs greatly on whether this
will occur or not given the stout capping to the southeast. A more
probable scenario is for elevated convection to develop during the
evening into the overnight as a low-level jet intensifies from the
Mid-MO Valley towards Lake Superior. Guidance also differs on the
evolution of the surface warm front into Monday evening/night with
the 12Z NAM holding farther south and more pronounced with the
baroclinic zone across central MN. Most other guidance advances the
warm front deeper into northern MN. Given these spatial concerns
along with the relatively weak forcing for ascent near/just after
peak heating amid pronounced capping over the open warm sector,
confidence is low in the most likely scenario of convective
evolution. Isolated, very large hail will be possible given
plentiful elevated MUCAPE and strengthening effective bulk shear.
The 12Z HRW-ARW depicts a more ominous scenario with surface-based
development over the Upper Red River Valley growing upscale into an
intense, bowing MCS through central portions of MN/WI. This includes
a signal for extreme rear-inflow jet development to around 95 kts at
the mature stage over west-central WI. Other guidance suggests a
later MCS may develop out of the elevated convection in north parts
of MN/WI, and still other guidance suggests little, if any MCS
development will occur. The decision has been made to defer on a
categorical upgrade and await potentially more consistent guidance
in later outlook cycles.

...Black Hills vicinity into parts of NE and western IA... 
The southern portion of the weak cold front should slow and stall
near the SD/NE border area by early evening Monday. Strong heating
in the vicinity of the boundary will support isolated to widely
scattered high-based thunderstorm development. With generally weak
mid-level flow across the region, storms may quickly become outflow
dominant, but steep tropospheric lapse rates will support at least
isolated severe gusts. The strongest updrafts may also be capable of
producing some hail.  

...Coastal Carolinas...
A cold front is forecast to move across the coastal Carolinas 
vicinity, with scattered thunderstorm development expected during
the afternoon. Moderate to locally strong prefrontal buoyancy (with
MLCAPE of near/above 2000 J/kg) and effective shear generally around
25-30 kt will support potential for a few stronger multicells and
perhaps a marginal supercell or two, with an attendant threat of
locally damaging winds and hail.

## SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-06-23, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1117 AM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The previous forecast generally remains on track with only minor
adjustments made to reflect recent fire reports, morning surface
observations, and trends in latest high-res guidance. A dry frontal
passage is underway across the Pacific Northwest as mid-level winds
increase over the central Cascades (based on the evolution of
high-level cirrus over the region). Surface pressure falls in the
lee of the Cascades/northern Sierra Nevada should become more
apparent in the coming hours with an attendant increase in surface
winds. Latest guidance suggests the onset of elevated fire weather
conditions will be around 18 UTC along/east of the Sierra Nevada and
Cascades with a slightly later onset for the Snake River Plain.
Localized critical conditions also remain possible through the
Columbia Gorge and along the NV/OR border; however, higher RH with
northward extent and displacement from the stronger mid-level flow
with southern extent continue to limit confidence in the
coverage/duration of critical conditions.

..Moore.. 06/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Sun Jun 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move through parts of the Northwest
today, favorably timed with peak heating. Surface low pressure will
deepen in the lee of the northern and Canadian Rockies. Surface
winds will increase across the region and into the northern Great
Basin.

...Columbia Basin...
Winds of 15-20 mph (higher downwind of the Cascade Gaps) are
expected by the afternoon. RH may only lower to around 20% in many
places due to at least some push of marine air across the Cascades.
Given the relatively dry fuels and the expected winds, elevated fire
weather is possible.

...OR/NV/CA...
Temperatures will be warmer and RH lower farther south. RH could
fall to near 10-15% over a broad area. Winds away from the mid-level
jet will be slightly weaker, but 15-20 mph is still possible,
especially near terrain features. With dry fuels in these areas,
fire weather concerns will be elevated.

...Snake River Plain...
The southern periphery of the mid-level jet will sag into southern
Idaho. This, combined with the strengthening surface pressure
gradient, will promote 15-25 mph winds within the valley. RH of
15-20% appears probable. Duration of potentially critical conditions
will be minimal and fuels are not yet critically dry. That said,
elevated to locally critical fire weather is expected during the
afternoon.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEW YORK...VERMONT...NEW
HAMPSHIRE...MASSACHUSETTS...AND WESTERN MAINE....

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING OVER
PARTS OF NORTHEAST MONTANA AND NORTHWEST NORTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds and a few tornadoes are likely across parts
of the Northeast and New England, with additional severe storms
expected across the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic region, as well as the
Northern High Plains.

...New England...
Visible satellite imagery shows broken clouds across central/eastern
NY and parts of southern/western New England, where dewpoints are in
the upper 60s to lower 70s.  This is resulting in rapid
destabilization of the air mass, with a corridor of ~2000 J/kg and
little inhibition.  This should lead to scattered thunderstorm
development early this afternoon over central/eastern NY, tracking
rapidly eastward into VT/NH and northern MA.  Forecast soundings
show substantial vertical shear in this region, as storms develop
beneath the mid-level jet axis.  A remnant surface boundary
currently extends from northeast VT into northeast MA.  As storms
interact with this boundary, locally enhanced low-level shear may
result in a more focused risk for a few tornadoes.  Otherwise,
damaging wind gusts and some hail are the main threats.  

...Upper OH Valley...
An axis of warm/humid conditions is present today from KY
northeastward into western PA, where temperatures will warm through
the 80s with dewpoints in the lower 70s.  Model guidance suggests at
least widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms will form. 
Relatively steep low level lapse rates, significant water-loaded
downdrafts, and favorably strong low/mid level wind fields will pose
a risk of locally damaging wind gusts in the stronger cells through
the afternoon and early evening.

...MT/ND...
Model guidance continues to show the potential for a supercell storm
or two to form over southern Manitoba and track near/across the
international border, affecting parts of northeast MT and northwest
ND tonight - mainly after dark.  Sufficient CAPE/shear parameters
would support a risk of large hail in these storms.
