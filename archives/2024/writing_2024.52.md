## We Are All Ghosts in the Forest by Lorraine Wilson: Review by Niall Harrison

date: 2024-12-28, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>We Are All Ghosts in the Forest</strong>, Lorraine Wilson (Solaris 978-1-83786-144-6, 400pp, £18.99, hc). November 2024. Cover by Jo Walker.</p>
<p>The image that I think will stay with me longest from Lorraine Wilson’s resonant new novel, <strong>We Are All Ghosts in the For­est</strong>, comes a little over halfway through the book. The novel’s protagonist, Katerina, has completed a trade in a village on the shore of Lake Peipus,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/we-are-all-ghosts-in-the-forest-by-lorraine-wilson-review-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p class="normal" xml:lang="en-us">The 28th ICon was held October 20-22, 20-24 in Tel Aviv, Israel, and included almost 350 panels, lectures, workshops, games, and roleplaying. Some 11,000 tickets were sold to the different events. In each of the three days, at a certain point, entrance to the venue had to be restricted to those who had tickets, because the 1,800 people limit on premises, set for health and safety reasons, was reached.</p>

## Write On: 'Nosferatu' Writer & Director Robert Eggers

date: 2024-12-27, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-nosferatu-writer-director-robert-eggers" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Write%20On%20Robert%20Eggers%20-%20Nosferatu_.png" alt="Write On podcast with 'Nosferatu' writer/director Robert Eggers" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<div>
  “As someone who’s been obsessed with vampires since I was a little kid, I don’t totally know [why we love vampire movies so much]. Obviously, sex and death are always interesting and in vampire stories, including the very earliest accounts of folk vampirism in Eastern Europe, that connection has always been there. Some of these early folkloric vampires didn’t drink blood but fornicated with their widows until they died. And then, being undead, rising from the grave, you know Dracula and Jesus have had the most movies made about them of any popular characters in Western cultures, so there must be something to that as well,” says Robert Eggers, writer/director of 
 <em>Nosferatu</em>, starring Lily Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult and Bill Skarsgård.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>In this episode, Eggers talks about the play-version of Nosferatu that he wrote and directed when he was in high school, writing the Ellen character (Depp) as a woman at war with herself, and making Orlok (Skarsgård) the villain without making him too arch or campy.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>“[Orlok] has a sense of humor and he has a sense of poetry. He’s a well-learned man so that’s enjoyable. It’s fun to write dialogue for someone who had their heyday in the 16th century and English was like their 17th language, that’s fun,” says Eggers.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>We also asked Eggers about telling an old story but making it relevant to today. He says that while he doesn’t worry about making a film with a specific message, “I don’t live in a vacuum. So even if I’m not trying to write a film with a message, whatever is happening around me is coming out. Also, it’s interesting that the movie didn’t get made until when it did. The original 
 <em>Nosferatu</em> came out a couple of years after the Spanish flu. This is coming out a couple of years after the pandemic. And I wrote all that stuff before the pandemic. In fact, they had face coverings originally, and I took them away because it felt too much on the nose. So, I think it’s all there for the taking,” he says.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>To hear more about the power of vampires and Egger’s writing process, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;

## Sargassa by Sophie Burnham: Review by Liz Bourke

date: 2024-12-27, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Sargassa</strong>, Sophie Burnham (DAW 978-0-7564-1936-3, $28.00, 416pp, hc) October 2024.</p>
<p>Sophie Burnham’s <strong>Sargassa </strong>is another first novel, and another novel that flits with playful seriousness between the trappings of fantasy, science fiction, and alternate history, using all three to question and upend the reader’s assumptions about the world of the novel (and perhaps the world at large) and how it works. <strong>Sargassa </strong>takes the aura of Rome – perennial  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/sargassa-by-sophie-burnham-review-by-liz-bourke/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## How ‘Disclaimer’ Redefines Narration and Structure

</div> 
<p><em>Disclaimer</em> warns audiences at the beginning to be wary of narratives and forms that distract from hidden truths. Written and directed by auteur Alfonso Cuarón, this AppleTV+ miniseries weaves together storylines to uncover the truth about what happened years ago between a young Catherine Ravenscroft (Leila George) and Jonathan Brigstocke (Louis Partridge), the deceased son of a grieving widow.<br><br>After the adult Catherine (Cate Blanchett) receives a copy of an independently published novel with the disclaimer: “Any resemblance to persons living or dead is not a coincidence,” the mystery begins to unravel before the audience.<br><br>With a heavy focus on form and structure, <em>Disclaimer</em> offers valuable lessons for screenwriters looking to hook audiences with a shocking mystery.</p>

<p>Like all conscientious and well-meaning read­ers, I strive to bring an open mind unsullied by prejudice and bias to any fiction work. However, based solely on the title and cover of Kay Chro­nister’s new novel, <strong>The Bog Wife</strong>, I assumed it was a revisionist fairytale based on Celtic mythology that takes place  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/the-bog-wife-by-kay-chronister-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Sapling Cage by Margaret Killjoy: Review by Alex Brown

<p><strong>The Sapling Cage</strong>, Margaret Killjoy (The Femi­nist Press 978-1-55861-331-7, $17.95, 336pp, tp) September 2024.</p>
<p>The trope of gender-based magic is an old one in fantasy fiction. It never fails to annoy me, and not just because I’m gen­derqueer. Besides the whole gender essentialism thing, I just find it to be lazy and uninspired.

## AUTHORS ALLIANCE SUBMITS AMICUS BRIEF IN SEDLIK v. DRACHENBERG

date: 2024-12-23, from: Author's Union blog

The case Sedlik v. Drachenberg, currently pending before the 9th Circuit, presents the 9th Circuit a first opportunity to interpret the fair use right in the wake of the Warhol decision. Anticipating the far-reaching consequences for artists and authors, Authors Alliance filed an amicus brief in support of KVD. In our brief, we explained that (1) a distinct purpose is required for the first factor to tilt in favor of fair use, (2) a successful social media presence does not automatically render all postings “commercial,” and (3) concrete evidence is needed to prove the existence of a licensing market or the likelihood of it developing.

<p>There are different ways of writing medical SF. One, as in the case of Rajaniemi above, or Greg Egan occasionally, is to crank up the verisimilitude and extrapolate specific diseases or treatments in the best net-up hard-SF fashion; another is to lean into medicine as a system rather than a sci­ence and build  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/12/a-simple-intervention-by-yael-inokai-review-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
