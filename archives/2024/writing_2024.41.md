## Your Shadow Half Remains by Sunny Moraine: Review by Gabino Iglesias

date: 2024-10-12, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Your Shadow Half Remains, </strong>Sunny Moraine (Nightfire 978-1-25089-220-1, $16.99, 176pp, tp) February 2024.</p>
<p>If you look at someone, you‚Äôre dead. Not just dead, but dead in some horrible, violent way. That‚Äôs the premise at the core of Sunny Moraine‚Äôs <strong>Your Shadow Half Remains</strong>. Yes, readers familiar with Josh Malerman‚Äôs <strong>Bird Box </strong>may see a similarity to that novel in that premise, but <strong>Your Shadow Half Remains </strong>is very different,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/your-shadow-half-remains-by-sunny-moraine-review-by-gabino-iglesias/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Artist Left with Heavy Fees by Copyright Troll Law Firm

date: 2024-10-11, from: Author's Union blog

The final outcome of the case: the plaintiff was ordered to cover $102,404 in fees and $165.72 in costs for the defendant. This should serve as a cautionary tale for would-be plaintiffs: copyright lawsuits, like any other type of litigation, are primarily meant to address the damages plaintiffs actually suffered, and the final settlement should make plaintiffs whole again‚Äîthat is, as if no infringement has ever occurred. Copyright lawsuits (or the threat to sue) should not be undertaken as a way to create brand new income streams.¬†

<p>It can be incredibly difficult to venture into an established genre like the <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-reasons-you-should-write-a-sports-biopic-like-clipped">sports drama.</a><br><br>It‚Äôs a tried-and-true narrative with some equally tested‚Äîand beloved‚Äîtropes. Sometimes the team is a ragtag group of misfits, the underdogs no one believes in. Sometimes the coach has taken on this post after failing in the big leagues. Often, the most dramatic moment comes down to the last play in the big game.<br><br>Writer/director Sydney Freeland (Din√©) knows all these tropes. And instead of fighting against them during the writing process, she embraced them, flipped them, gave them a unique spin, and made them work for the story.&nbsp;</p>

## HOLD YOUR BREATH Writer Explores Dark Side of Motherhood in Horror Tale

date: 2024-10-07, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hold-your-breath-writer-explores-dark-side-of-motherhood-in-horror-tale" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Hold%20Your%20Breath.png" alt="Sarah Paulson in HOLD YOUR BREATH" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p><em>Hold Your Breath</em> is an achingly beautiful film that resonates in many powerful ways. While hitting many of the necessary tropes of psychological horror, it‚Äôs the incredible acting performances that hook you and won‚Äôt let you escape ‚Äì even when it‚Äôs hard to breathe.&nbsp;<br><br>Set in Oklahoma in the 1930s Dust Bowl, famine, disease and death abound. But for Margaret (Sarah Paulson), and her two daughters, 12-year-old Rose (Amiah Miller) and 7-year-old Ollie (Alona Jane Robbins) who‚Äôs deaf, it‚Äôs not just the pervasive dust that‚Äôs threatening their lives, but something much more sinister. Even when the mysterious stranger Wallace (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) shows up menacingly in the night, the film asks: could the mother-daughter bond be the most dangerous threat of all?&nbsp;<br><br>Written by Karrie Crouse, best known for TV‚Äôs <em>Westworld</em>, and directed by Crouse and Will Joines, the movie seems like a dark fable inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, when just breathing the air might put your life at risk. But surprisingly (and eerily), the screenplay was written before the pandemic even started. Crouse says the inspiration for the film actually came from watching the Ken Burns documentary <em>The Dust Bowl</em>.&nbsp;</p>
