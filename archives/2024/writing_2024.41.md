## Cinderwich by Cherie Priest: Review by Colleen Mondor

date: 2024-10-08, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Cinderwich</strong>, Cherie Priest (Apex Book Com­pany 978-1-955-76520-6, $21.95, 162pp, tp) May 2024.</p>
<p>Cherie Priest’s novella <strong>Cinderwich </strong>gifts readers with a bit of a haunted tree folktale, some true crime detecting, a frustrated ghost, and a couple of academic ladies with a sometimes prickly friendship who are more than willing to sit through countless diner dinners to get to a much-needed truth. In other words, it’s catnip for readers who  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/cinderwich-by-cherie-priest-review-by-colleen-mondor/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>Scary is in. Fear is fashionable. Horror is hot. That’s what we’re told. Judging strictly by box office returns and critical acclaim—not to mention the occasional Academy Award® for best screenplay—horror does seem to be having a moment in the zeitgeist.</p>

## HOLD YOUR BREATH Writer Explores Dark Side of Motherhood in Horror Tale

date: 2024-10-07, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hold-your-breath-writer-explores-dark-side-of-motherhood-in-horror-tale" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Hold%20Your%20Breath.png" alt="Sarah Paulson in HOLD YOUR BREATH" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p><em>Hold Your Breath</em> is an achingly beautiful film that resonates in many powerful ways. While hitting many of the necessary tropes of psychological horror, it’s the incredible acting performances that hook you and won’t let you escape – even when it’s hard to breathe.&nbsp;<br><br>Set in Oklahoma in the 1930s Dust Bowl, famine, disease and death abound. But for Margaret (Sarah Paulson), and her two daughters, 12-year-old Rose (Amiah Miller) and 7-year-old Ollie (Alona Jane Robbins) who’s deaf, it’s not just the pervasive dust that’s threatening their lives, but something much more sinister. Even when the mysterious stranger Wallace (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) shows up menacingly in the night, the film asks: could the mother-daughter bond be the most dangerous threat of all?&nbsp;<br><br>Written by Karrie Crouse, best known for TV’s <em>Westworld</em>, and directed by Crouse and Will Joines, the movie seems like a dark fable inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, when just breathing the air might put your life at risk. But surprisingly (and eerily), the screenplay was written before the pandemic even started. Crouse says the inspiration for the film actually came from watching the Ken Burns documentary <em>The Dust Bowl</em>.&nbsp;</p>

## Hum by Helen Phillips: Review by Ian Mond

<p><strong>Hum</strong>, Helen Phillips (Marysue Rucci Books 978-1-66800-883-6, $27.99, 272pp, hc) August 2024.</p>
<p>The novels I review for this column are not chosen with a theme in mind. If one does pop up, it’s purely coincidental. That goes for this month. I had no idea <strong>Hum</strong>, <strong>Napalm in the Heart</strong>, and <strong>Ultra 85 </strong>would all be dystopian novels. The good news is that they’re very different in tone,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/hum-by-helen-phillips-review-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## What is “Derivative Work” in the Digital Age?

date: 2024-10-07, from: Author's Union blog

 Ideas and concepts, including “derivative works,” are only important to the extent they elucidate our understanding of the world. When the use of “derivative works” leads to more confusion than clarity, we should be cautious in adopting the new meaning being superimposed on “derivative works.”

## No/Mad/Land by Francisco Verso: Review by Paul Di Filippo

date: 2024-10-06, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>No/Mad/Land</strong>, Franceso Verso (Flame Tree Press 978-1787589278, hardcover, 384pp, $26.95) September 2024</p>
<p>Even when deploying familiar tropes of the genre in totally au courant ways, science fiction by non-Anglo authors always reveals an idiosyncratic slant or attitude or worldview. This has been evident at least since Stanislaw Lem burst onto the English-language publishing scene, and is witnessed more recently in works from such accomplished authors as Cixin Liu, Hannu  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/no-mad-land-by-francisco-verso-review-by-paul-di-filippo/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
