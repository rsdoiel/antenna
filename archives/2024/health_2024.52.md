## Metagenomic next-generation sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid: a diagnostic approach for varicella zoster virus-related encephalitis

date: 2024-12-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

PurposeVaricella zoster virus-related encephalitis (VZV-RE) is a rare and often misdiagnosed condition caused by an infection with the VZV. It leads to meningitis or encephalitis, with patients frequently experiencing poor prognosis. In this study, we used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to rapidly and accurately detect and identify the VZV pathogen directly from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, aiming to achieve a definitive diagnosis for encephalitis patients.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics and laboratory evaluations of 28 patients at the Harrison International Peace Hospital in Hebei, China, between 2018 and 2024. These patients were diagnosed with neurological disorders using mNGS techniques applied to CSF.ResultsIn this cohort of 28 patients, 11 were females and 17 males, with a median age of 65 (IQR: 42.3-70). VZV-RE presented with a range of clinical manifestations, the most common being headaches (81.2%), fever>38°C (42.9%), and vomiting (42.9%). Less frequent symptoms include personality changes (10.7%), speech impairments (21.4%), cranial nerve involvement (21.4%), altered consciousness (17.9%) and convulsions (3.6%). Herpes zoster rash was observed in 35.7% of the cases. Neurological examination revealed nuchal rigidity in only 5 patients. CSF analysis indicated mild pressure and protein levels increase, with all patients having negative bacterial cultures. Abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) findings were noted in 10.7% (N=3), and encephalorrhagia on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was observed in 3.6%. VZV-RE was confirmed through mNGS analysis of CSF within three days of admission. All patients received empiric treatment with acyclovir or valacyclovir, with 21.4% receiving hormonotherapy, and 7.14% receiving immunoglobulin therapy. At the three-month follow-up, 10.7% of the patients had persistent neurologic sequelae, and the mortality rate was 3.6%.ConclusionsPerforming mNGS on CSF offers a rapidly and precisely diagnostic method for identifying causative pathogens in patients with VZV central nervous system (CNS) infections, especially when traditional CNS examination results are negative. Furthermore, the cases reported highlight the positive therapeutic effect of ganciclovir in treating VZV infections.

## Fumarprotocetraric acid and geraniin were identified as novel inhibitors of human respiratory syncytial virus infection in vitro

date: 2024-12-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) remains a major international public health concern. However, disease treatment is limited to preventive care with monoclonal antibodies and supportive care. In this study, natural products were screened to identify novel anti-RSV inhibitors.MethodsThe antiviral effect of 320 compounds on RSV in HEp-2 cells was tested using a Cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay. The antiviral effect of fumarprotocetraric acid (FUM) and geraniin (GE) were confirmed by Real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (Real-time RT-PCR), plaque reduction test, immunofluorescence assay, and Western blot analysis. Real-time PCR was used to detect inflammatory factor expression. ATP assay and JC-1 stain were used to evaluate mitochondrial protection function. The experiment of administration time was used to determine the stages in the RSV life cycle inhibited by FUM and GE. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) were used to evaluate the antiviral activities of other respiratory viruses of FUM and GE. Finally, Air-liquid interface human airway epithelium (ALI-HAE) cells were used to evaluate the antiviral effect and mechanism of FUM and GE to RSV.ResultsThe results showed that FUM and GE can inhibit the replication of RSV in multiple-cell models. Both compounds could dose-dependent inhibit the viral load, RSV nucleic acids level, and RSV-F protein level. Besides, FUM and GE showed good anti-inflammatory activity, mitochondrial protection, and antiviral activity to HMPV and HRV. Meanwhile, our result indicated that FUM and GE can inhibit RSV replication in ALI-HAE cells.ConclusionsFUM and GE were identified as new inhibitors of RSV infection. At the same time, FUM and GE have anti-inflammatory activity, mitochondrial protection function, and broad-spectrum antiviral activity. These results provide evidence that FUM and GE are potential candidates for the development of novel anti-RSV drugs.

## The risk factors and prediction model for postoperative pneumonia after craniotomy

date: 2024-12-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundCraniotomy is highly susceptible to postoperative pneumonia, which significantly impacts the outcomes of patients undergoing such procedures. Our study aims to examine the risk factors associated with postoperative pneumonia and establish a predictive model with a nomogram to assess this risk.MethodsWe conducted a matched 1:1 case-control study involving 831 adult patients undergoing craniotomy at our hospital. Cases consisted of patients who developed postoperative pneumonia within 30 days after surgery, as defined by consensus criteria. Controls were randomly selected from a pool of eligible patients.ResultsThe overall incidence rate of postoperative pneumonia is 12.39% in a total of 831 surgeries, which associated with unfavorable outcomes. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be the most common causative agents and approximately 27.94% of cases attributed to multi-drug resistant strains. The logistic regression analysis revealed five independent risk factors, as follows: smoking history, surgical duration, postoperative albumin, unplanned re-operation, and deep vein catheterization. A risk prediction model was derived and a nomogram was constructed. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test yielded X2 = 3.871 (P=0.869), and the receiver operator characteristic curve analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.898 (P<0.05), with a sensitivity of 79.6% and a specificity of 85.4%, indicating excellent model fit and predictive performance. In addition, the C-index of the nomogram model was 0.898(95%CI, 0.853~0.941). The calibration curves of the nomogram model showed p-values of 0.797 and the Brier scores were 0.127. The analysis of the clinical decision curve showed that the nomograph model had high clinical application value.ConclusionsPostoperative pneumonia patients after craniotomy exhibits distinct pathogen distribution and is strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes. The risk prediction model developed in this study demonstrates a good fitting degree and predictive performance. The constructed nomogram model is objective, specific, and easily applicable in clinical practice.

## Breaking the cellular defense: the role of autophagy evasion in Francisella virulence

date: 2024-12-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Many pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to evade autophagy, a crucial cellular defense mechanism that typically targets and degrades invading microorganisms. By subverting or inhibiting autophagy, these pathogens can create a more favorable environment for their replication and survival within the host. For instance, some bacteria secrete factors that block autophagosome formation, while others might escape from autophagosomes before degradation. These evasion tactics are critical for the pathogens’ ability to establish and maintain infections. Understanding the mechanisms by which pathogens avoid autophagy is crucial for developing new therapeutic strategies, as enhancing autophagy could bolster the host’s immune response and aid in the elimination of pathogenic bacteria. Francisella tularensis can manipulate host cell pathways to prevent its detection and destruction by autophagy, thereby enhancing its virulence. Given the potential for F. tularensis to be used as a bioterrorism agent due to its high infectivity and ability to cause severe disease, research into how this pathogen evades autophagy is of critical importance. By unraveling these mechanisms, new therapeutic approaches could be developed to enhance autophagic responses and strengthen host defense against this and other similarly evasive pathogens.

## Recent advances in gut microbiota and thyroid disease: pathogenesis and therapeutics in autoimmune, neoplastic, and nodular conditions

date: 2024-12-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

This review synthesizes key findings from the past five years of experimental literature, elucidating the gut microbiome’s significant influence on the pathogenesis of thyroid diseases. A pronounced shift in the gut microbiota composition has been consistently observed, with a significant reduction in bacteria such as Bifidobacterium, Bacillaceae, Megamonas, and Clostridium, and a notable increase in bacteria, including Bacteroides, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Desulfobacterota, and Klebsiella. These alterations are implicated in the development and progression of thyroid diseases by impacting metabolic pathways including bile acid and cytokine production, including a decrease in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are crucial for immune regulation and thyroid hormone homeostasis. The review also highlights the therapeutic implications of probiotics in managing thyroid conditions. Evidence suggests that probiotic adjunct therapy can modulate the gut microbiota, leading to improvements in thyroid function and patient outcomes. The use of specific probiotic strains, such as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 299v and Bifidobacterium longum, has demonstrated potential in enhancing the effects of traditional treatments and possibly restoring a balanced gut microbiota. Notably, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a promising intervention in Graves’ Disease (GD), demonstrating the potential to recalibrate the gut microbiota, thereby influencing neurotransmitters and trace elements via the gut-brain and gut-thyroid axes. The integration of microbiome-based therapies with traditional treatments is anticipated to usher in a new era of personalized thyroid disease management, offering a more nuanced approach to patient care. By integrating this body of work, the review offers an innovative perspective on the gut microbiome’s broad impact on thyroid diseases and the therapeutic applications of probiotics.

## Characterization and genomic analysis of Salmonella Abortusequi phage, vB_SalP_LDDK01, and its biocontrol application in donkey meat

date: 2024-12-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Salmonella Abortusequi (S. Abortusequi) is the primary cause of abortions in equine animals, and can cause serious foodborne illness. Thus, effective biocontrol strategies are needed to decontaminate and control the emergence of foodborne diseases. In recent years, phages have been used as a new strategy for modulating foodborne pathogens and food safety. In this study, a new phage, vB_SalP_LDDK01, was isolated from donkey farm bedding. The data indicated that the incubation period of vB_SalP_LDDK01 was 10 min, the burst size was 378 PFU/cell, as well as a wide range of heat resistance (40-70°C) and pH stability (4-12). Furthermore, genomic analysis and electron microscopy indicated that vB_SalP_LDDK01 belongs to the Class Caudoviricetes and genus Jerseyvirus. Moreover, its genome was 42,378 bp long, encoded 57 ORFs, was double-stranded DNA with a 49.52% GC content, and lacked virulence and drug-resistant genes. In addition, how vB_SalP_LDDK01 inhibits the growth of S. Abortusequi and removes the biofilm of S. Abortusequi was assessed in a liquid broth medium, and the results showed that vB_SalP_LDDK01 inhibited the growth of S. Abortusequi for about 8 h and significantly reduced the viable bacteria abundance compared with the phage-free positive control. Further, vB_SalP_LDDK01 treated the host bacteria for 12 h and effectively destroyed the biofilm of S. Abortusequi. This study further investigated how effectively vB_SalP_LDDK01 modulates bacterial contamination in donkey meat inoculated with S. Abortusequi LCU-S-ABORT-F at 4°C and 25°C. Furthermore, after 72 h of vB_SalP_LDDK01 treatment with different multiplicity of infection (1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001), the bacterial contamination on the surface of donkey meat was reduced by 4.3, 3.7, 3.3, and 3.5 log10 CFU/piece at 25°C, and 4.5, 3.9, 2.8, and 2.7 log10 CFU/piece at 4°C. Whereas the phage titers at different temperatures were basically comparable to the initial titers. Overall, these results indicated that vB_SalP_LDDK01, the new phage, can serve as an effective biological agent and inhibit S. Abortusequi in donkey meat.
