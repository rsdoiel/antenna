## Reaching the hard-to-reach

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

I expect journalists to be consumed in the coming year with the riddle of how to break through to people who don&#8217;t read or trust them. Easy answers elude our industry. We rightly bemoan the gutting of local news, and the sense of connection and trust the best of these places were able to build....

## Newsrooms face a left-brain/right-brain divide

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The real divide in newsrooms isn&#8217;t between editorial and advertising — it&#8217;s between left-brain (math, logic) and right-brain (creativity, intuition) functions. Hidden left-brained infrastructure underpins modern media businesses. It enables editors, product managers, brand strategists, developers, and sales teams to focus on higher-order, right-brain problems. In print publishing, this hidden infrastructure manages printing, sales, and...

## Journalism faces its Kobayashi Maru moment

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

2025 presents journalism with its Kobayashi Maru moment — an impossible scenario created by two converging forces. First, the 2024 U.S. election exposed how traditional media has lost its position as the primary information source for many Americans. While mainstream news invested heavily in conventional election coverage, audiences turned to alternative sources — from subject-matter-expert...

## News faces its final unbundling

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The coming year will reveal the final phase in the long unbundling of the news industry. The industry will have to confront the growing class of podcasters, influencers, and Substackers, combined with the waning reach on social media, that has separated those that build knowledge through reporting from the voices that help make sense of...

## There will be no second Trump Bump

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The last Trump presidency catalyzed a movement around the importance of journalism. Billionaire-led newspapers crafted bold, public-facing mission statements like &#8220;Democracy Dies in Darkness.&#8221; Budgets soared. So did pageviews. When I told people what I did for a living at a party, I&#8217;d get a nod and a &#8220;So important.&#8221; And journalism organizations, for the...

## Followers stop following

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Over the past decade (often in this annual roundup!), we&#8217;ve heard a lot about journalist-influencers and journalists who go independent through services like Patreon and Substack. But we seldom hear about the people reading these independent newsletters or listening to these podcasts or viewing journalistic social media content. My prediction is that many of these...

## Local newsrooms get a boost from data collaborations

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

It&#8217;s not enough to simply liberate big, messy datasets and hope other journalists will pick them up and run with a series of investigations. But help is here, and more is on the way, as an emerging model of support spreads and matures in 2025. Is it &#8220;concierge data journalism&#8221;? Is it &#8220;white-glove collaborations&#8221;? No...

## It’s time to redefine sustainability

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

I predict that, over the next few years, funders will increasingly prioritize equity over inclusion when considering support for BIPOC-led media organizations. Inclusion often means adding BIPOC voices to the conversation, but equity requires a deeper commitment — one that reallocates resources, addresses historical disparities, and ensures that BIPOC-led media have the capacity to thrive...

## Focus on the “flabby middle” of the audience funnel

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Your New Year&#8217;s resolution should be to get a fatter middle. You should widen the waistline of the audience funnel, paying more attention to the engaged middle than the fly-by traffic at top. Build a smart strategy for the full funnel by making 2025 the year of audience journey mapping. And ensure your key performance...

## The year we put everything on the table

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

About the last thing anyone wants to remember from this most recent election is that the Google search &#8220;did joe biden drop out&#8221; spiked on Election Day. Not good for the people who believe in an informed electorate being vital to democracy. I think it&#8217;s time we start looking at this a little closer, with...

## Ethical state funding for the press

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The business model for the news media industry in the digital era remains uncertain. But a liberal democracy cannot function properly without an independent and free press. State funding, an increasing trend across the European Union, offers a potential solution to this challenge. According to the 2024 study Public financing of news media in the...

## Why 2025 is all about user needs

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In 2025, I challenge you to send me a news user need I have yet to come across. A year ago, I predicted the spread of user needs models in global publishing, and I stand vindicated. Across continents, newsrooms have been enthusiastically adopting their own models, leveraging AI tools to conduct relevant analysis, develop specific...

## Should we predict or define?

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

When it comes to looking at the year ahead, we can approach it in two ways: We can either predict what we think will happen, based on the trends, or we can define what outcome we want to achieve. I&#8217;m going to do both, because they&#8217;re not the same. Let&#8217;s talk predictions first. There are...

## Following utter failure

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Hard to talk about anything to come for American journalism in 2025 without dwelling on the failures of 2024&#8230;because journalism failed us. It failed its role in our democracy. I&#8217;ve been utterly disinterested (and rather disgusted) by blame hurled at activists by the Democratic Party and its allied pundits. But I am not above hurling...

## Focusing on what people actually need

date: 2024-12-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In 2025, journalism is going to get a much-needed reality check. Instead of sticking to old habits and assuming people will adapt to how we deliver news, we&#8217;ll finally start designing content that fits into real lives — short attention spans and busy schedules. The focus will shift to meeting people where they are, offering...

## Content creators find a place in newsrooms

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

What would you do to get your reporting in front of an audience of hundreds of thousands? Or maybe even millions? Here&#8217;s a hint: You don&#8217;t have to get on the evening news. In 2025, let&#8217;s imagine a new type of journalist in newsrooms across the country: A content creator. Picture a modern-day news anchor...

## Media owners will protect the powerful

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

We find ourselves in a moment that can be best described as a negative moment. We are returning to the sunken place, overcome with terror at what might be, still burdened by the scars from last time. We saw respectable news organizations make a political choice of &#8220;neutrality&#8221; in the face of what many saw...

## Visual investigations become a mainstay of news

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Over the last decade, many major news organizations have set up teams and sub-brands devoted to &#8220;visual investigations&#8221; or &#8220;visual forensics.&#8221; Their success signals the next major shift in reporting practices. Similar to &#8220;data journalism&#8221; before them, visual investigations are poised to move from niche desks to standard operating procedure in newsrooms in 2025 as...

## Right-wing studies’ time has come

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

When Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, there was a collective sense of shock — I don&#8217;t think even he expected to win. This time, it&#8217;s giving resignation and despair — or triumphalism depending on your political persuasion. The last time this happened, scholars and journalists sought to explain what then seemed inexplicable....

## We’ll stop looking down on content creators

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The recent U.S. presidential election made it even clearer (if anyone needed proof) that podcasters, YouTubers, and content creators are closer to the audience than traditional media and journalists, and their opinions mobilize more people. This has been happening for years, but in many sectors of journalism (at least in Latin America) we&#8217;ve refused to...

## We harness listening to build collective resilience

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

It&#8217;s ironic that listening is one of the core skills in journalism and yet we spend very little time listening inward — to our own selves and to each other. Focusing on our external audience is essential to our business; however, paying attention and caring for our colleagues is just as important to our sustainability....

## We’ll draw the lines we will not cross

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In the past, I&#8217;ve made predictions about emerging tech or, like last year, predicted the painful shortcomings of our industry leaders. (I&#8217;m sorry that one keeps coming true.) This year, I could predict that Bluesky will successfully emerge as the new social media platform of choice for news/media friends and junkies. (Follow me here.) Or...

## Building new ways to get information to readers

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

There are many factors that got us to where we are, but the fact of the matter is that a significant portion of the population does not want to engage with traditional news organizations. Reporters Without Borders found that, in a less-than-two-month span, Donald Trump insulted, attacked, or threatened the press more than 100 times...

## Newsrooms confront lies and win

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

That the mission of journalism is to speak truth to power and hold power accountable doesn&#8217;t need explaining or defending — except, currently, to many of the powers in question. It&#8217;s not news, of course, that accessible fact-based journalism is increasingly under threat. But in the past year — and even the past month, with...

## Journalists keep getting harassed

A year ago, the International Women&#8217;s Media Foundation was preparing to launch a nationwide journalism initiative that would provide in-person holistic safety training and wrap-around support to journalists and newsrooms before the U.S. elections. My prediction then was a call to action that, as an industry, we had an obligation to better prepare journalists due...

## Philanthropy steps up for local news

Predictions are not exactly the business of the AP, where I work — rather, our mission is trusted, fact-based, independent journalism that is free from influence.

## Journalists will learn to stop worrying and love the business plan

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The migration started years ago, and the path from journalist to media operator (mogul?) has become more popular — and profitable. See how Jessica Lessin bootstrapped The Information, Nicholas Thompson revived the 167-year-old Atlantic, Vice expats built 404 Media, or former Politico reporters made Punchbowl a massive success.

## Video-first “podcasts” bring a new kind of coverage

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

2025 will bring us a video-first news podcast that will take advantage of massive changes in media consumption to change how global news is covered.

There&#8217;s no doubt that 2025 will be a tough year across journalism. There are many unknowns and more disruptions in store than in years past. One thing I think may seem doom-and-gloom but has a silver lining is the death of the media darling. You know them. They&#8217;re the handful of &#8220;rising star&#8221; news organizations...

## Traceability becomes table stakes for AI

date: 2024-12-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In its third year, generative AI&#8217;s potential as a force for good will become clearer — but only if trust, traceability and transparency come to the fore. If we are to reap the rewards that AI can afford us, we will need to be able to source the origin of information down to the very...

In 2024, we saw media and tech companies flood resources and investments into the potential of generative AI. Now that the initial excitement has dwindled, it&#8217;s time to deliver.

## Publishers find the AI era not all that lucrative

&#8220;The AI era,&#8221; Sara Fischer writes in Axios, &#8220;is proving lucrative for media publishers looking to offset a slowdown in ads and subscription fatigue.&#8221; My prediction for 2025 is that this will not be true for most news organizations, because they&#8217;ll find that no technology companies are interested in paying for their content.

We live in a time of media fragmentation and hyperpolarization. This year&#8217;s presidential election raised further questions about traditional media&#8217;s relevance.

## We stop excusing the lack of accessibility in news

As we stumble into 2025, the conversation around accessibility in journalism is more relevant than ever.

Yet many newsrooms still overlook even the most basic accessibility elements of publishing, even though...

You&#8217;ve seen them yank endorsements, sand down headlines, play both sides, and bend the knee at Mar-a-Lago. There&#8217;s a movement in media c-suites to get right with Donald Trump, or at least to be a little less antagonistic. It&#8217;s going to fail, and it&#8217;s going to fail badly.

## How do we cover “people like me”?

If 2024 was a year of enormous media challenge in this &#8220;unique year for democracy&#8221; — with half of the world&#8217;s population voting for their elected representatives — then 2025 needs to be a year for deep reflection and real...
