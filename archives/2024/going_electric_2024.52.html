2024’s Electrek EV of the year will again be controversial: The
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/05/volvo-ex30-review/">Volvo
EX30</a>. The svelt car from the Swedish brand that is owned by a
Chinese company tops our list because it embodies the future of EVs. The
EX30 was originally going to be made in only in China, but is now being
built in Europe as well and it could even be built in the US where
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/06/volvo-confirms-ex30-will-arrive-in-us-by-end-of-2024/">deliveries
are just now starting</a>.
</p>
<p>
The non controversial part is that this is an amazing EV. From the
Swedish minimalist interior and exterior styling, to the AWD version’s
3.4 0-60 time (the quickest accelerating Volvo) to its $35,000 starting
price, the EX30 screams innovation. But, as they say, that’s not all…
