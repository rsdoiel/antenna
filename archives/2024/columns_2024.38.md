**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/huckabee-sanders-harris-lacks-humility-raising-biological-children/story?id=113800656">Sarah Huckabee Sanders</a> forced us to think of her as a mom. I don't think that works out very well in her favor, probably best not to go there.

## Driving on a mountain road

date: 2024-09-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/06/03/tinaTheBearNurseFromBojackHorseman.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I was driving on a mountain road yesterday to pick up a pizza in a nearby town. I drive it fairly regularly, and I have a car that handles well so I drive at the speed limit or a little above. </p>
<p>Still, what often happens on this road is some asshole tailgates, getting so close that if I hit the brakes suddenly they would have no time to react, and would slam into the rear of my car. And you do sometimes have to hit the brakes because animals appear on the road, deer, turkeys are common. Sometimes even bears. </p>
<p>I've never hit an animal, but I have come close.  </p>
<p>There's no way to pass on this road. </p>
<p>I've been in the other driver's place when a tourist is driving 30 in a 45 mph zone, and what do you do? Keep your distance and don't freak out. It's perfectly legal to go 30 in a 45 mph zone. </p>
<p>Anyway I slow down, to send a signal to the other driver, and also to mitigate damage if there is an accident. This asshole leans on their horn. I slow down more. </p>
<p>And when I come to a stop sign I come to a full stop and pause, thinking okay they'll pass me now, and I'll get a chance to see who this asshole is. They stayed behind and leaned on the horn again.  </p>
<p>When we come to the next stop sign, it's the end of the road and you can go left or right. I'm going right, they're going left, and the road is wide so the asshole pulls up to the left of me and I look over and see a middle-aged woman, could be a teacher or a nurse. I was amazed. The last kind of person I would expect to make such a scene. </p>
<p>If I had a chance I would have asked what the hell they were doing. </p>
<p>BTW, I don't speed on these roads because I like driving them, I love the mountains, and the fresh air, and I wasn't in any kind of a hurry. It's not uncommon to get a tailgater but usually they take the hint when I slow down and add a few car lengths between us. </p>
<p>One of the reasons I have a blog is so I have a place to write these stories. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>

## Aesthetic fascism

date: 2024-09-19, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Aesthetics seem to come before functionality in tech now&#8230; My husband and I both have new old Pixel phones (6a and 7a), which we both *hate* in comparison to the 3a we had previously. The new phones are exceedingly slippery, sliding off of seemingly flat surfaces constantly. They&#8217;re too large to comfortably hold, for either [&#8230;]

## 2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China

date: 2024-09-18, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-18-emacs-wiki-and-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</h1>

<p><strong>2024-09-14</strong>. I&rsquo;m somewhere in the Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland with my wife. There is a lot of running, hiking, hugging, kissing, eating and drinking involved. ü•∞</p>

<p><strong>2024-09-15</strong>. Still on the trip but late at night I spent more than an hour trying to figure out why my server had a load of nearly 40. üíª</p>

<p>All I discovered is that load went down when I shut down Emacs Wiki. See also <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2024-09-16">2024-09-16</a> on Emacs Wiki.</p>

<p>Well, I needed to sleep and I‚Äòve got plans for the next few days so I shut it down while I slept hoping that the misconfigured spider is fixed or the inept programmer discovers their mistake. Just another day in the Butlerian Jihad. Some misguided soul probably wanted to download it all and wrote a broken web crawler and when that got blocked they bought some nice scaling infrastructure from Amazon, Hetzner, OHV or Alibaba Cloud or whatever they are called, allowing them to use a gazillion different IP numbers that will eventually lead me to implement some sort of cloud service provider block.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-09-15-emacs-china.png" alt="Load shoots up to nearly 40 around midnight. The graph is for an entire week so the peaks are not shown. It just goes up to 30 multiple times." /></p>

<p><strong>2024-09-16</strong>. Switched Emacs Wiki back on after a few hours of sleep and it did fine. But then it restarted again&hellip; at 18:00, 19:00, 21:00, 22:00&hellip; and so I switched Emacs Wiki off again. Time to ban some networks!</p>

<p>Anybody interested in my banning of IP ranges and possibly interested in me reverting any of these, take a look at <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> &hellip; from a network that isn&rsquo;t banned, I guess. üòè</p>

<p><strong>2024-09-17</strong>. This continues to keep me busy and angry every evening. Too bad I don&rsquo;t have a real fast <a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a> to firewall ban pipeline. I&rsquo;m using this script instead of carefully checking IP numbers and networks. I&rsquo;m also sick and tired of the same networks popping up again and again.</p>

<p>I added over a hundred Chinese networks to the firewall rules and I&rsquo;m seriously considering blocking the whole country for a week. It seems that most of the offenders are networks run by China Telecoms and China Mobile.</p>

<p><strong>2024-09-18</strong>. So far, so good. Load stays below two.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s example usage for <code>network-lookup</code>, filtering for Emacs Wiki and a URL parameter used when requesting recent changes or a RSS feed for a single page only. That would count as suspicious misbehaving crawler behaviour in my book.</p>

## Remotely Exploding Pagers

date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-18, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-pagers-attack-hezbollah/index.html">Wow</a>.</p>
<p>It seems they all exploded simultaneously, which means they were triggered.</p>
<p>Were they each tampered with physically, or did someone figure out how to trigger a thermal runaway remotely? Supply chain attack? Malicious code update, or natural vulnerability?</p>
<p>I have no idea, but I expect we will all learn over the next few days.</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD: I&#8217;m <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-september-17-2024/">reading</a> nine killed and 2,800 injured. That&#8217;s a <i>lot</i> of collateral damage. (I haven&#8217;t seen a good number as to the number of pagers yet.)</p>
<p>EDITED TO ADD: Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/dozens-hezbollah-members-wounded-lebanon-when-pagers-exploded-sources-witnesses-2024-09-17/">writes</a>: &#8220;The <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pagers-drones-how-hezbollah-aims-counter-israels-high-tech-surveillance-2024-07-09/">pagers</a> that detonated were the latest model brought in by Hezbollah in recent months, three security sources said.&#8221; That implies supply chain attack. And it seems to be a large detonation for an overloaded battery...</p>

It is generally quite difficult to upset the denizens of a <a href="https://www.quotes.net/mquote/90955">wretched hive of scum and villainy</a> by further besmirching their reputation, but recently the Trump family has succeeded.<br />
<br />
Below the fold I explain how they did it, and why the denizens of the wretched hive are not happy.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Matt Levine identified the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-10/the-fastest-options-are-the-most-fun">fundamental mechanism</a> at play here:<br />
<blockquote>
But you don‚Äôt have to just take your counterparties as you find them; you can work to encourage and develop bad ones. This is often a matter of product development: If you build a product that does nothing for sophisticated professionals but that is really good for noisy addicted gamblers, you will attract exactly the right sort of counterparty. This arguably explains much of crypto.
</blockquote>
The additional point he omitted is that, in order to "attract exactly the right sort of counterparty" you have to advertise the product. This will bring it to the attention of others seeking the same kind of counterparty. They will seek to leverage your product design for their own ends.<br />
<br />
Trump has perfected the art of attracting "the right sort of counterparty". From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_University">Trump University</a> to the banks he stiffed in his <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/donald-trump-business-bankruptcies-4152019">multiple bankruptcies</a>, to the stockholders of Truth Social his counterparties have always been the "<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/09/poker-patsy/">sucker at the poker table</a>". Key to this success has always been moving on to the next scam as the previous one implodes.<br />
<br />
By the side of the road to <strike>Damascus</strike> the White House the former crypto-skeptic President encountered a small crowd of large cryptocurrency companies, including Coinbase, Ripple, Andreessen Horowitz and Jump Capital. They were waving <a href="https://followthecrypto.org/">immense sums of money</a>. Trump underwent an instant conversion to the cryptocurrency faith, announcing he would make the US the "<a href="https://coinaute.com/en/trump-harris-debate-the-ignored-cryptocurrencies/">Bitcoin capital of the world</a>".<br />
<br />
Apart from the general idea that "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FSVSL6NZnU">more is better</a>", why would these immense sums of money be attractive to this alleged billionaire? Apart from the costs of running a Presidential campaign, some of which ends up in his own pocket, there is the need to pay his legions of lawyers, and the looming judgements that these lawyers failed to avert, including $88.3M before interest to E. Jean Carroll and $454M before interest in his New York fraud case.<br />
<br />
With <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-earnings-results-revenue-4f6701cbebcbc5c9ed5079ab096cb346">Truth Social's Q2 financials</a> reporting a loss of 1,911% of revenue, which was down 30% year-on-year, and with the stock down 80% from its peak, it was clearly time to move on.<br />
<br />
On 31<sup>st</sup> August Jasper Goodman posted <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/31/trump-crypto-family-affair-00176764"><i>Crypto is the new Trump family business. Ethics watchdogs have concerns.</i></a> rating a well-deserved "Well Duh!":<br />
<blockquote>
Trump‚Äôs eldest sons are gearing up to launch a new cryptocurrency venture called <a href="https://www.worldlibertyfinancial.com/">World Liberty Financial</a>, which is already receiving a big social media boost from their father. Government ethics watchdogs say the project could create a conflict of interest if Trump returns to the White House next year.<br />
<br />
Trump has vowed to enact an array of pro-crypto policies in a bid to win votes ‚Äî and campaign cash ‚Äî from digital asset enthusiasts in recent months. Now, he‚Äôs <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1829141447087648796">weaving the overtures</a> into his pitch for his sons‚Äô forthcoming startup.<br />
<br />
While the details of Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.'s crypto endeavor haven‚Äôt yet been announced, it could stand to benefit from a second Trump administration‚Äôs approach to support the industry.<br />
...<br />
<a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/president-trump-legacy-corruption-3700-conflicts-interest/">CREW identified more than 3,700</a> conflicts of interest during Trump‚Äôs first term.<br />
<br />
But critics said the crypto project differs because it could align his family‚Äôs financial interest with policy changes that he would be poised to enact.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúThe prior conflicts and illegalities took advantage of preexisting loopholes,‚Äù said Norman Eisen, an ethics lawyer who served in the Obama White House and later helped build the first impeachment case against Trump. ‚ÄúHere, Trump appears to be promising to create the loopholes while his family is simultaneously designing a business venture to exploit them.‚Äù
</blockquote>
The headline on World Financial's "coming soon" web page is "World Liberty Financial - The Only Crypto DeFi Platform supported by Donald J. Trump". There are dozens of "DeFi Platforms", but the unique selling point of World Liberty is that it is "supported by Donald J. Trump". So the counterparties it is intended to attract are the gullible members of the Trump cult, the ones who have allegedly made him a billionaire.<br />
<br />
With this unique selling point the actual product doesn't need to be very good to compete with the market leader, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/decentralized-crypto-exchanges-market-share">Uniswap</a>, for its chosen counterparties. As Molly White reported, <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-65/">it wasn't</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
CoinDesk has gotten hold of a white paper for this supposed World Liberty Financial, which they note appears to be a clone of Dough Finance, a crypto lending platform that was hacked for around $2 million just a month and a half ago. The hack was not a sophisticated one, and instead exploited sloppiness on behalf of the development team.
</blockquote>
Of course, many people interested in gullible counterparties noticed all the hype, and they didn't have to wait to hack the actual product launch to <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-65/">get in on the action</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The project hasn‚Äôt even launched yet, and it‚Äôs off to a bumpy start. First, Donald Trump Jr. had to issue a statement to try to stop people from buying up all the fake tokens purporting to be associated with their murky project. Then, Twitter accounts for Lara and Tiffany Trump were both compromised and used to send tweets announcing a supposed token launch. ‚ÄúThis is a scam!!!‚Äù tweeted Eric, himself retweeting the tweet from his wife‚Äôs account containing the scam token address.
</blockquote>
Nic Carter tweeted:<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">can't secure twitter accounts but i'm sure they'll be able to protect an (already hacked) defi protocol from hacks</p>‚Äî nic carter (@nic__carter) <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1831148088125161477?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script> 
The reason for this fiasco was that, as usual, the Trumps hired "<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-boasts-hiring-best-picks-haunt">only the best people</a>". Sam Kessler, Danny Nelson &amp; Cheyenne Ligon dug into the project's white paper in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/09/03/inside-the-trump-crypto-project-linked-to-a-2m-defi-hack-and-former-pick-up-artist/"><i>Inside the Trump Crypto Project Linked to a $2M DeFi Hack and Former Pick-Up Artist</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The document and other reporting describe a borrowing and lending service strikingly similar to <a href="https://www.certik.com/resources/blog/3SMOuGMCSttY4pQW6I49W2-dough-finance-incident-analysis">Dough Finance, a recently hacked blockchain app</a> built by four people listed as World Liberty Financial team members. Other participants include all three of Trump's sons (including 18-year-old Barron, who is identified as the project's "DeFi visionary"), financiers and e-commerce influencers.
</blockquote>
The leader of the Dough Finance team was Chase Herro. When it came time to move on, he obviously found in the Trumps the ignorant and greedy counterparty he needed.

Herro, a fast-talking 39-year-old who shows off his fancy cars and private-jet rides on social media, is an unknown in the crypto world. More than a dozen prominent digital-asset investors said in interviews they had never heard of him. The only crypto project with which he was publicly affiliated attracted only a few million dollars and suffered a devastating hack. A token he promoted on influencer Logan Paul‚Äôs podcast dropped 96% afterward. In one speech in 2018, he called himself ‚Äúthe dirtbag of the internet‚Äù and said that regulators should ‚Äúkick s---heads like me out.‚Äù<br />
<br />
‚ÄúYou can literally sell s--- in a can, wrapped in piss, covered in human skin, for a billion dollars if the story's right, because people will buy it,‚Äù Herro said about crypto in a 2018 YouTube video recorded as he drove in a Rolls-Royce. ‚ÄúI'm not going to question the right and wrong of all that.‚Äù

Jasper Goodman reported on the cryptosphere's reaction to this incompetent blatant grift in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/06/trump-family-crypto-startup-00177566"><i>‚ÄòA huge mistake‚Äô: Trump‚Äôs crypto allies cringe over family‚Äôs startup</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
‚ÄúThis is a huge mistake,‚Äù said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter who is a founding partner at the crypto-focused venture capital firm Castle Island Ventures. ‚ÄúIt looks like Trump‚Äôs inner circle is just cashing in on his recent embrace of crypto in a kind of naive way, and frankly it looks like they‚Äôre burning a lot of the good will that‚Äôs been built with the industry so far.‚Äù<br />
...<br />
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very typical playbook of smaller operators or more amateur operations in the crypto space to try to generate a lot of hype before revealing the details,‚Äù said Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at NYU‚Äôs Stern School of Business who previously led the risk and portfolio management operation at the crypto firm Paxos. ‚ÄúThat makes them susceptible to all sorts of nonsense.‚Äù<br />
...<br />
One crypto industry representative in Washington, granted anonymity because of sensitivities around criticizing Trump, described having ‚Äúa laundry list of concerns.‚Äù A big worry is that that it could reflect poorly on the industry as it pushes for policy changes that would help legitimize the sector.<br />
<br />
‚ÄúMaybe it doesn‚Äôt move the needle for most people, but if this thing is hacked or regular folks lose money on it or it opens up the door for the SEC to investigate the team, it only looks like it has downside risk,‚Äù Carter said. ‚ÄúIt looks to have very little upside risk.‚Äù
</blockquote>
As with Trump University and Truth Social, the whole point is for "regular folks" to lose money. But, if you're a candidate positioning yourself as pro-crypto in the hope of getting large checks from the cryptosphere,  making this obvious to everyone but the cult members is a bad idea.<br />

I did the same on Threads and heard people say ugly personal things about Dorsey. This really pissed me off, because he's a human being who made a large contribution to the technology we use, and I think his heart has been in the right place. Nobody is purely good or bad. If my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l4e2ismckd2l">theory</a> is right about why Dorsey is disappointed, it's a valid point, Bluesky was started with its prime mission as creating a distributed system. The more they dig in on nice-to-have features that have nothing to do with being distributed, the more they go down the same path as Twitter did. Jack was openly talking about turning Twitter into a developer platform as early as 2007. Had they realized the system he talked about, basically global object storage with real financial backing, we'd be much further along with the web as an operating system. We're paradoxically so close to that now, but so far, for a reason I don't understand. We should start having a public discussion about this. It can't hurt to talk about what-if's instead of barrelling down the same ridiculous cul de sac as we did in the 00's. I've been writing about this since 1994, the loop we refuse to break out of. Well let's start talking about how we break out, because it's not going to "just happen" organically.

## Python Developers Targeted with Malware During Fake Job Interviews

date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting social engineering attack: luring potential job applicants with fake recruiting pitches, trying to <a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/fake-recruiter-coding-tests-target-devs-with-malicious-python-packages">convince them</a> to download malware. From a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/python-developers-targeted-by-north-korean-lazarus-group-with-fake-jobs-and-malware-disguised-as-coding-tests">news article</a></p>
<blockquote><p>These particular attacks from North Korean state-funded hacking team Lazarus Group are new, but the overall malware campaign against the Python development community has been running since at least August of 2023, when a number of popular open source Python tools were maliciously duplicated with added malware. Now, though, there are also attacks involving &#8220;coding tests&#8221; that only exist to get the end user to install hidden malware on their system (cleverly hidden with Base64 encoding) that allows remote execution once present. The capacity for exploitation at that point is pretty much unlimited, due to the flexibility of Python and how it interacts with the underlying OS...</p></blockquote>

We've rarely seen it as a human thing both by the people who make the meals and the people who love great food. The world thinks of it as billionaires and influencers and lying fascist politicians.

## How I cross-post to Threads

date: 2024-09-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Twitter, WordPress and RSS. </p>
<p>Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,</p>
<p><a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">The RSS feed</a> is doing a lot of the work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Links from the RSS feed show up on my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">Links page</a> and in the <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly emails</a>.</li>
<li>The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through micro.blog. I am able to <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">give</a> it the <a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">URL</a> of the linkblogging feed, and then click on <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png">Add Threads</a> -- and that's it. When I post something to the feed it shows up on Threads. </li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most people don't know it's there. It's sort of a Grand Central station for moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you're a micro.blog user, its <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">Feeds page</a> is where you set it up. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/microblogScreen.png">Screen shot</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="label">Part 1</span> Automation is driving the next wave of commoditization, threatening to replace skilled workers</h4>
      <p>As we have said before, the software industry has a decades-long history of cost-cutting, commoditization, and a successful sales model of "pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap." This has worrying consequences if your skill set is the next one to be commoditized. But there may be ways out of this narrowing commercial bottleneck.</p>

For me, Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter is still here, but I use it a lot less than I used to. Each of them acts as if they are alone, except for ActivityPub but that's more complicated than it may seem. As often is the case, the tech industry is depending on confusion. This may be a strategic mistake. I could cite a few examples where this didn't work, when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users, completely erased the ecosystem that came before, often with remarkable speed. Each of them is playing for all of it, wanting to control their users, make it so they only post to one system. And some people do. I think it's better if we, as users, remain diversified.

date: 2024-09-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>You'll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been in every presidential election because then they'd have to fire half their political reporters. </p>

It's a shame to work something out, come up with the answer that worked, and then to have to do it all over again 23 months later when you encounter the same problem.

## Let‚Äôs bring back browsing

date: 2024-09-15, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

When the web started one of the best parts about it was the naming of things. To &#8220;surf the web&#8221; implied fun and adventure and to &#8220;browse&#8221; implied serendipity.
