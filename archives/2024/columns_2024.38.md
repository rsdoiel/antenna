## Techno-financial imperium

date: 2024-09-16, from: Enlightenment Economics blog

Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy by Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman is a rip-roaring read and simultaneously terrifying. The reader is left with the clear impression of fragility in the world financial system &#8211; bad enough in &#8230; <a href="http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2024/09/techno-financial-imperium/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## How I cross-post to Threads

date: 2024-09-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I have a linkblogging tool crossposts to Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Twitter, WordPress and RSS. </p>
<p>Every time I publish a link it goes to all those places,</p>
<p><a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">The RSS feed</a> is doing a lot of the work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Links from the RSS feed show up on my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">Links page</a> and in the <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly emails</a>.</li>
<li>The RSS feed is also used to connect to Threads, going through micro.blog. I am able to <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">give</a> it the <a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">URL</a> of the linkblogging feed, and then click on <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/addthreads.png">Add Threads</a> -- and that's it. When I post something to the feed it shows up on Threads. </li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is tucked away in a corner of micro.blog and I suspect most people don't know it's there. It's sort of a Grand Central station for moving stuff around among the twitter-like systems. If you're a micro.blog user, its <a href="https://micro.blog/account/feeds">Feeds page</a> is where you set it up. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/16/microblogScreen.png">Screen shot</a>.</p>

<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/podcast0/2024/09/16/firstTradeSecretsPodcast.html">Shownotes page</a> for the first Trade Secrets podcast, on this day in 2004. I was in Seattle, Adam was coming from Belgium. Haven't written any notes about it yet. If others are interested in listening and commenting on these podcasts, this is when it was all coming together, let me know and perhaps we can start a thread on Mastodon.

## Remembering Iris Harrelson

date: 2024-09-16, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

In the late &#8217;70s, I worked for a while at the Psychical Research Foundation, which then occupied a couple of houses on Duke University property and did scientific research into the possibility of life after death. My time there was a lever that has lifted my life on Earth ever since, including many deep and [&#8230;]

## The future of software? Imagine a bot, stamping on a human face – forever

date: 2024-09-16, updated: 2024-09-16, from: Liam Proven's articles at the Register

<h4><span class="label">Part 1</span> Automation is driving the next wave of commoditization, threatening to replace skilled workers</h4>
      <p>As we have said before, the software industry has a decades-long history of cost-cutting, commoditization, and a successful sales model of "pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap." This has worrying consequences if your skill set is the next one to be commoditized. But there may be ways out of this narrowing commercial bottleneck.</p>

## Trump’s hate is no joke

date: 2024-09-16, from: Robert Reich's blog

While utterly despicable, yesterday&#8217;s apparent assassination attempt on Trump can be seen as a symptom of the hate-filled politics he and Vance are peddling.

## Zaurus on Internet

date: 2024-09-16, from: Jirka's blog

I still  have the SHARP  Zaurus SL-C3200. A  cute tiny clamshell  PDA - actually  a tiny  Linux  laptop. I  have  got it  when  it was  already obsolete and  used it little.  It's the  most expensive model  with the biggest RAM (128  MB, I think), the bigges storage  space (the 6GB HDD) and - of course - the biggest power consumption.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I was recruited to speak at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA_Novosti">Ria Novosti</a> conference in Moscow in June 2011, but decided not to go. This was back when we thought naively that Russia was a democracy, and working with Russian journalists, when American journalists wouldn't, seemed like a fair deal. Something about it didn't smell right though, so I stayed home.

I used to think of <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">Twitter as a coral reef</a>, but its role as a world wide notification system is fading, and we haven't replaced it with anything. I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">this</a> in 2007 when the utility of Twitter was just becoming apparent.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/02/16/gaslight.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Something has changed in the twitterverse, it's grown new centers. For me, Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter is still here, but I use it a lot less than I used to. Each of them acts as if they are alone, except for ActivityPub but that's more complicated than it may seem. As often is the case, the tech industry is depending on confusion. This may be a strategic mistake. I could cite a few examples where this didn't work, when an open ecosystem whose benefits were by then obvious to users, completely erased the ecosystem that came before, often with remarkable speed. Each of them is playing for all of it, wanting to control their users, make it so they only post to one system. And some people do. I think it's better if we, as users, remain diversified.

## Ignore polls

date: 2024-09-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>You'll never see an article in the NYT saying how wrong polls have been in every presidential election because then they'd have to fire half their political reporters. </p>
<p>If you want a better idea of how it's going, look at where the ad dollars are going, and where the candidates are campaigning. </p>
<p>And make sure all your friends know that you're voting and who you're voting for. I think that makes a difference. </p>
<p>I'm voting straight Democratic party line.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I find that a lot of my posts on my blog are just like the tweets I post on Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads and Twitter. I used to have an icon in my outliner that tweeted the text of the bar cursor headline.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If ChatGPT had a simple, non-AI scrapbook, like the old Mac OS had, where you could just throw something over your shoulder so you can find it later with a text search, that would make it a lot more useful for retaining practices that work. It's a shame to work something out, come up with the answer that worked, and then to have to do it all over again 23 months later when you encounter the same problem.

## Let’s bring back browsing

date: 2024-09-15, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

When the web started one of the best parts about it was the naming of things. To &#8220;surf the web&#8221; implied fun and adventure and to &#8220;browse&#8221; implied serendipity. And we seem to have lost that. Let&#8217;s go back. When I discovered the internet it was pretty much just taking off. I didn&#8217;t go to [&#8230;]
