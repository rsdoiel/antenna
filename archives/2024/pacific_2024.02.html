ǀ Truth 3: A MLK Day Reality Check Special — A Day On, not a Day Off
&amp; Kudos Joeten</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-14, updated: 2024-01-14, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH is Dr. King was REAL and what he did was historical as he
not only changed America but he even changed most of the world and today
is “a day on, not a day off” to promote his dream of “racial equality
for all people of color.”  The reality is the CNMI would look &amp; be
very different had it not been for Dr. King — for TRUE, believe it or
not! The Civil Rights Movement was not just about Blacks but about ALL
the People of color, which included the local population of Chamorros
&amp; Carolinians who would have gone to Black schools with me
back-in-the-day and called the “N-word” just like I was called.  MLK Day
is not just for Black folks and it is my sincere hopes and prayers that
ONE Day that THIS-DAY will truly be celebrated island-wide on the
beaches or wherever people can gather in celebration because the Civil
Rights Movement was for all people of color, especially the local people
who benefited from the end-results of the movement which was the 1964,
Civil Rights Act.</p>
