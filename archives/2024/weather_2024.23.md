Mesoscale Discussion 1165
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0455 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Areas affected...Southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 391...

Valid 042155Z - 042330Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 391
continues.

SUMMARY...A few damaging wind gusts up to 60-65 mph and localized
instances of marginally severe hail near 0.75-1.25" in diameter may
continue to accompany a linear complex of thunderstorms through this
evening.

DISCUSSION...Latest radar and satellite imagery show an MCS
progressing east-southeastward across portions of southern LA and
southern MS. A moderately unstable air mass remains in place ahead
of this system, where diurnal heating has resulted in surface
temperatures climbing into the upper 80s and 90s, with dewpoints
generally in the mid 70s. Recent trends from the POE VAD profiler
indicate westerly 0-3 km shear has increased to around 50 kt over
the past 30 minutes behind the system. This may support an
increasing opportunity for bowing segments, and damaging wind gusts,
oriented north-south on the eastern flank of the complex, and a
general eastward progression into south-central/southeastern MS over
the next 1-2 hours. In addition, brief instances of marginally
severe hail will be possible within any of the more robust updrafts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1164
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0413 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Areas affected...Portions of central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 042113Z - 042315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Rapid thunderstorm initiation is expected within the next
1-2 hours across portions of central Oklahoma. Large hail up to
1.50-2.50" in diameter, wind gusts exceeding 65-75 mph, and perhaps
a tornado or two are expected.

DISCUSSION...Latest visible satellite imagery trends indicate air
mass modification is continuing across north central and central OK
late this afternoon. A developing cumulus field is apparent near a
mesolow just north of I-40 and Clinton, OK. A surface trough and
dryline extend southward from this low into portions of southwestern
OK. An axis of extreme instability has developed within
southeasterly surface winds on the western edge of a residual cold
pool from earlier this morning. As destabilization continues, and
cooler mid-level temps accompany a mid-level trough slowly
progressing eastward over the northern half of OK early this
evening, rapid thunderstorm development is expected near the surface
low and convergence zones.

Although very modest mid to upper flow should limit persistent,
discrete storm organization, a few transient discrete supercells
will remain possible via veering and increasing flow within the
lowest 4 km of the troposphere. In addition, very large CAPE and
steep lapse rates (~8.5 C/km) within the hail growth zone could
support large hail with any of the discrete cells. Furthermore,
localized enhanced 0-1 km SRH is expected near and south of I-40
where surface 10-15 kt winds will likely remained backed increasing
the potential for a tornado or two before storms begin to build
upscale later this evening. Severe, damaging winds will become more
likely by this time. A severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
soon.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Valid 061200Z - 121200Z

An upper-level ridge will settle over the western CONUS as
northwesterly flow aloft becomes established across the eastern
CONUS through the remainder of the week into this weekend.
Thereafter, medium range guidance depicts a gradual breakdown of the
upper-level ridge into early next week, with perhaps a mid-level
trough developing over the southern Plains at the end of the period
(Day 8/Tuesday). The evolution of the aforementioned upper-air
pattern will support multiple rounds of potential meaningful
rainfall at several locales east of the Rockies, dampening fuel
receptiveness to wildfire spread in the process. However, prolonged
warm and dry conditions are expected from portions of the Lower
Colorado River Basin into the Great Basin. Medium range guidance
agreement on stronger surface winds overlapping the expected lower
RH is not overly strong, so no Critical probabilities have been
delineated this outlook. However, the prolonged dry conditions,
along with the lack of appreciable rainfall accumulations, should
support the continued curing of fuels over portions of the Interior
West.

0308 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Valid 042000Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are probable across central and
eastern Oklahoma this evening.  A tornado and large to very large
hail will be possible this evening, before severe outflow winds of
60-85 mph potentially accompany the more intense downdrafts this
evening into tonight.

...20Z Update...
Forecast reasoning and related graphical risk depictions remain
largely unchanged, although some spatial adjustments were made in
Louisiana and Mississippi related to an ongoing MCS and Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 391.

..Guyer.. 06/04/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1129 AM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024/

...Southern Plains to lower MS Valley through tonight...
Radar/satellite imagery late this morning shows a
south-southeastward moving MCS along the TX/LA border.  Heating of
the airmass ahead of the MCS will continue to lead to strong
destabilization.  A rejuvenation of storm intensity along the
western flank of the MCS is possible where a reservoir of very rich
low-level moisture and steep 700-500 mb lapse rates will aid in
strong/severe storm potential.  Damaging gusts and perhaps large
hail will be the primary hazards with the stronger storms.

Outflow from the morning storms will reinforce a composite outflow
boundary across north TX northward into OK.  It appears that the
outflow air mass will modify through the day across OK.  Surface
dewpoints are forecast to increase into the mid 70s across
central-southern OK where isolated thunderstorm development is
forecast by late this afternoon/early evening along the edge of
richer moisture.  Forecast soundings show MLCAPE could exceed 5000
J/kg with only small convective inhibition.  However, forcing for
ascent will be rather nebulous and storm initiation/initial coverage
is uncertain.  Nonetheless, a short window of opportunity may exist
for a tornado risk if a quasi-discrete mode can occur early in the
convective life cycle.  Very large buoyancy and nearly dry adiabatic
lapse rates across OK will support large/tall storms capable of
producing isolated very large hail initially, and an increase in the
threat for damaging winds (60-85 mph) as storms grow upscale into
another MCS tonight.  Have opted to upgrade to a 30-percent
significant wind area for greater confidence in a severe MCS across
central/eastern OK.  Farther north, thunderstorms for forecast to
develop across KS this afternoon into early tonight, as a weak
surface cold front and associated midlevel trough will move
southeastward and impinge on the very moist/unstable warm sector. 
Hail/wind will be the primary risks with those stronger storms.

...Mid MO to upper MS Valleys this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel shortwave trough and associated cold front will move
eastward from NE/Dakotas to eastern KS/IA and WI by the end of the
period.  The richest low-level moisture will remain farther south,
but surface heating in pre-frontal cloud breaks and boundary-layer
dewpoints in the 60s will contribute to MLCAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg. 
Some low-level hodographs enlargement in northern MN may aid in some
brief updraft rotation potential before an extensive band of storms
becomes outflow dominant.  Vertical shear will be relatively weak in
the warm sector which will primarily support multicell clusters and
line segments capable of producing occasional wind damage and
marginally severe hail.

...MO/IL today...
A midlevel low over west central MO this morning will move
northeastward toward central/northern IL by this evening.  Lingering
clouds will tend to slow surface heating, though cloud breaks could
allow modest destabilization and support a few strong thunderstorm
clusters capable of producing isolated strong/damaging outflow gusts
and marginally severe hail.

The previous forecast (see below) remains unchanged.

..Squitieri.. 06/04/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will rapidly build over the western third of the
CONUS Wednesday. As flow aloft is shunted northward, surface winds
across much of the Southwest are forecast to weaken while the air
mass below remains quite hot. A backdoor front over the eastern half
of NM will allow for higher RH recoveries and the potential for
isolated thunderstorms over the southern Rockies/High Plains. This
along with much weaker winds should limit the potential for dry and
breezy conditions over much of the Desert Southwest. While isolated
pockets of 10-15 mph surface winds and RH below 15% are possible
over the higher terrain in western NM and eastern AZ, coverage and
duration appears limited.

1236 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MIDWEST AND PARTS OF TEXAS TO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe storms will be possible Wednesday across the Midwest
including portions of Indiana and Ohio into Lower Michigan. Severe
storms may also occur across parts of south/east Texas to the Lower
Mississippi Valley.

...Midwest/Ohio Valley...
Height falls and strengthening cyclonic westerlies are expected via
a shortwave trough over the western Great Lakes, to the southeast of
a substantial mid/upper-level trough over the Canadian Prairies. The
potential for at least widely scattered early day precipitation and
cloud cover casts some uncertainty regarding the exact degree, and
preferred regional corridors, of more appreciable diurnal
destabilization within a moist airmass ahead of an
eastward-advancing cold front. However, parts of Indiana into
southern Lower Michigan and Ohio currently appear to have the most
diurnally favorable ingredients for severe storms. While multicells
capable of wind damage and possibly some hail should be the most
common scenario regionally, somewhat stronger mid/low-level flow
across Ohio may be conducive for a few supercells and possibly some
tornado risk.

...South-central/East Texas to Lower Mississippi Valley...
The region, mainly from east Texas northeastward, will be glancingly
influenced by a weak height falls and moderately strong
northwesterly winds aloft, but more directly by a probable MCS that
could be located across the ArkLaTex, or perhaps even a bit farther
south across Louisiana/east Texas around sunrise. This MCS may have
largely weakened by daybreak Wednesday morning, but some
strong/locally severe storms are plausible. Related convective
outflow may also regionally focus renewed storm development and
intensification into the afternoon. The details of storm
development/likelihood are more uncertain with southwestward extent
into south-central Texas and toward the Rio Grande, but a few severe
storms could occur if/where storms develop within a hot and very
unstable environment.

...Minnesota/Wisconsin...
Low-topped thunderstorms are expected to develop Wednesday afternoon
in the post-frontal environment characterized by limited boundary
layer moisture (40s to lower 50s F surface dewpoints) and steep
low/mid-level lapse rates. Relatively strong westerlies in the
cloud-bearing layer and around 25+ degree F diurnal
temperature/dewpoint spreads are suggestive of the possibility of
strong convectively enhanced wind gusts, and possibly some hail. The
region will be reevaluated into the Day 1 time frame for the
potential introduction of low severe probabilities.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH TONIGHT
FROM THE LOWER MS VALLEY TO OK...THEN NORTHWARD ACROSS EASTERN
KS...IA AND MN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong-severe storms with wind damage and large hail will
be possible this afternoon/evening from the middle Missouri Valley
to the upper Mississippi Valley.  An ongoing storm cluster near the
Arklatex could persist through the day with some damaging-wind
threat, and storms will be capable of producing isolated very large
hail and severe outflow winds of 60-80 mph this evening into tonight
across Oklahoma.

...Southern Plains to lower MS Valley through tonight...
Another in a series of overnight MCSs is moving southeastward near
the Arklatex, though the bowing system appears to have weakened
prior to sunrise.  The MCS is moving into an area overturned
yesterday across LA/AR, with the primary moisture/buoyancy feed into
the MCS from the south-southwest from the unstable warm sector in
TX.  There will still be some potential for eventual intensification
of the storms as the low levels warm and moisten during the day, and
the stronger embedded storms could produce damaging winds.

Outflow from the morning storms will reinforce a composite outflow
boundary, though the outflow is already somewhat diffuse with
west/northwestward extent.  It appears that the outflow air mass
will modify through the day across OK during the day.  There will be
the potential for isolated thunderstorm development later this
afternoon along the west edge of the richer moisture (near the
western OK/TX border) where MLCAPE could exceed 5000 J/kg with only
small convective inhibition.  However, forcing for ascent will be
rather nebulous and storm initiation/coverage are both in question. 
If storms form, there will be just enough vertical shear for
supercells capable of producing isolated very large hail, and
perhaps an isolated tornado. Confidence is greater in renewed
thunderstorm development across KS this afternoon and into OK late
this evening into early tonight, as a weak surface cold front and
associated midlevel trough will move southeastward and impinge on
the very moist/unstable warm sector.  Very large buoyancy and nearly
dry adiabatic lapse rates across OK will support large/tall storms
capable of producing isolated very large hail initially, and an
increase in the threat for damaging winds (60-80 mph) as storms grow
upscale into another MCS tonight.

...Mid MO to upper MS Valleys this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel shortwave trough and associated cold front will move
eastward from NE/Dakotas to eastern KS/IA and WI by the end of the
period.  The richest low-level moisture will remain farther south,
but surface heating in pre-frontal cloud breaks and boundary-layer
dewpoints in the 60s will contribute to MLCAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg. 
Vertical shear will be relatively weak in the warm sector which will
primarily support multicell clusters and line segments capable of
producing occasional wind damage and marginally severe hail.

...MO/IL today...
A midlevel low over west central MO this morning will move
northeastward toward central/northern IL by this evening.  Lingering
clouds will tend to slow surface heating, though cloud breaks could
allow modest destabilization and support a few strong thunderstorm
clusters capable of producing isolated strong/damaging outflow gusts
and marginally severe hail.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 384
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
500 AM CDT Mon Jun 3 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  South central Kansas
  Northern and central Oklahoma

* Effective this Monday morning from 500 AM until NOON CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 80 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A well-developed MCS with embedded bowing segments will
continue east-southeastward through the morning from southwest
Kansas into south central Kansas and northern/central Oklahoma. 
Damaging winds of 65-80 mph will be the main threat, while the
stronger embedded storms could produce isolated large hail of 1-1.5
inches in diameter.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 40 miles south of
Medicine Lodge KS to 30 miles southeast of Ponca City OK. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 383...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
31035.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1017 AM CDT Mon Jun 03 2024

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed based on latest surface observations and trends in high-res
guidance. Confidence remains reasonably high in the emergence of
elevated fire weather conditions this afternoon across portions of
AZ into southern NM and far west TX between the 20-01 UTC period.
South-central NM into the Trans Pecos region of far west TX should
see the longest duration of 15+ mph winds with 5-15% RH where deeper
boundary-layer mixing should favor frequent gusts between 20-25 mph.
See the previous discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 06/03/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Jun 03 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broad and weak zonal flow will continue over parts of the Southwest
and southern US as a subtle shortwave moves eastward into the
Plains. Gusty winds are possible over parts of NM and west TX where
receptive fuels and hot/dry temperatures are also expected.

...New Mexico and far West TX...
Despite being weaker than the past several days, westerly mid-level
flow should remain strong enough to bolster surface winds to around
10-15 MPH over parts of central/eastern NM and far West TX this
afternoon behind a dryline. With RH values in the low teens and
temperatures of 90+ F, the dry and breezy air mass will likely
support a few hours of elevated fire-weather potential within
receptive fuels. The most likely corridor for more sustained and
stronger winds will be closer to the dryline/surface trough across
far west TX.

A few hours of locally elevated fire-weather conditions may also
extend farther west in to central AZ. While winds are expected to be
more sporadic, dry surface conditions along the Mogollon Rim have
allowed for continued drying of fuels. As such, at least a few hours
of 15-20 mph wind gusts and RH below 15% may support some elevated
fire-weather risk.
