URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 384
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
500 AM CDT Mon Jun 3 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  South central Kansas
  Northern and central Oklahoma

* Effective this Monday morning from 500 AM until NOON CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 80 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A well-developed MCS with embedded bowing segments will
continue east-southeastward through the morning from southwest
Kansas into south central Kansas and northern/central Oklahoma. 
Damaging winds of 65-80 mph will be the main threat, while the
stronger embedded storms could produce isolated large hail of 1-1.5
inches in diameter.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 40 miles south of
Medicine Lodge KS to 30 miles southeast of Ponca City OK. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 383...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
31035.

## SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-06-03, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy1.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/day1fireotlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1017 AM CDT Mon Jun 03 2024

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed based on latest surface observations and trends in high-res
guidance. Confidence remains reasonably high in the emergence of
elevated fire weather conditions this afternoon across portions of
AZ into southern NM and far west TX between the 20-01 UTC period.
South-central NM into the Trans Pecos region of far west TX should
see the longest duration of 15+ mph winds with 5-15% RH where deeper
boundary-layer mixing should favor frequent gusts between 20-25 mph.
See the previous discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 06/03/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Jun 03 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broad and weak zonal flow will continue over parts of the Southwest
and southern US as a subtle shortwave moves eastward into the
Plains. Gusty winds are possible over parts of NM and west TX where
receptive fuels and hot/dry temperatures are also expected.

...New Mexico and far West TX...
Despite being weaker than the past several days, westerly mid-level
flow should remain strong enough to bolster surface winds to around
10-15 MPH over parts of central/eastern NM and far West TX this
afternoon behind a dryline. With RH values in the low teens and
temperatures of 90+ F, the dry and breezy air mass will likely
support a few hours of elevated fire-weather potential within
receptive fuels. The most likely corridor for more sustained and
stronger winds will be closer to the dryline/surface trough across
far west TX.

A few hours of locally elevated fire-weather conditions may also
extend farther west in to central AZ. While winds are expected to be
more sporadic, dry surface conditions along the Mogollon Rim have
allowed for continued drying of fuels. As such, at least a few hours
of 15-20 mph wind gusts and RH below 15% may support some elevated
fire-weather risk.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CDT Mon Jun 03 2024

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH TONIGHT
FOR OK/NORTH TX EASTWARD TO THE ARK-LA-MISS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible from much of the
Mississippi Valley into the Ozark Plateau and southern Plains today.
A more concentrated area of severe thunderstorm risk may become
focused across southwest and southern Oklahoma this evening into
early tonight.

...Southern Plains to the lower MS Valley through tonight...
As has been the case for the past several nights across the Great
Plains, nocturnal convection has persisted into the morning in a few
different clusters.  The most substantial of these has been an MCS
with a history of 60-80 mph measured gusts earlier this morning
across southwest KS.  This MCS has weakened more recently, but some
form of the convection should continue east-southeastward through
the morning toward central OK, along the north edge of the MUCAPE up
to 3000 J/kg.  Confidence in the details of the MCS evolution is
low, though there is some potential for the storms to potentially
reach the Ark-La-Tex and the western half of AR by this evening, and
perhaps as far east as the Ark-La-Miss region early tonight before
the storms weaken.

Outflow trailing southwestward from these morning storms will likely
provide a mesoscale focus for supercell development this afternoon
along the stalling boundary in the vicinity of southwest OK border. 
Here, rich low-level moisture (boundary-layer dewpoints in the
low-mid 70s) and surface heating will drive MLCAPE to near 5000 J/kg
with weakening convective inhibition after peak surface heating.  At
least isolated thunderstorm development is expected late this
afternoon/evening near the outflow/dryline intersection (close to
the southwest OK/southeast TX Panhandle border), and storms will
subsequently move southeastward along the stalled boundary.  Despite
rather modest flow aloft, an enhanced easterly component to the
low-level flow near the outflow boundary will contribute to
sufficient hodograph length/curvature for right-moving supercells. 
The extreme buoyancy, sufficiently low LCL heights and some
enhancement to low-level shear along the boundary will favor the
potential for a couple of tornadoes, in addition to isolated very
large hail (up to 3 inches in diameter) and damaging gusts.  These
evening storms, or additional storms associated with warm advection,
will be possible tonight across southern and central OK.

...Southern WI and vicinity this afternoon/evening...
A remnant MCV over IA will move northeastward over WI this
afternoon, atop a subtle surface front/trough and differential
heating zone.  As surface temperatures warm to 75-80 F in cloud
breaks and boundary-layer dewpoints increase to 65-70 F, moderate
buoyancy (MLCAPE near 1500 J/kg) will develop in the warm sector
from eastern IA/northwest IL into southern WI.  Despite some
localized enhancement to vertical shear with the remnant MCV,
deep-layer vertical shear will generally remain weak (primarily
supporting multicell clusters and low-end supercell structures). 
Thus, expect a few clusters of storms capable of producing
occasional wind damage and isolated large hail of 1-1.5 inches in
diameter for a few hours this afternoon/evening.
