Mesoscale Discussion 1565
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CDT Tue Jul 09 2024

Areas affected...western/central Kentucky and adjacent portions of
southeastern Illinois/southern Indiana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 091839Z - 092045Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Potential for supercells posing a risk for tornadoes
appears likely to increase through 5-7 PM EDT, particularly near the
Ohio River from Evansville/Owensboro through the Greater Louisville
area.

DISCUSSION...Beryl's remnant surface low is currently in the process
of migrating east-northeastward across southeastern Missouri into
the lower Ohio Valley, with a zone of strengthening differential
surface heating becoming better defined near the Ohio River
downstream toward the Greater Cincinnati area.  South of this zone,
boundary-layer destabilization is ongoing, supported by both
insolation and slowly increasing moisture.  The increasingly buoyant
low-level environment is supporting the development of showers and
isolated to widely scattered weak thunderstorms, but this is
occurring beneath a notably warm and warming mid-level environment,
which will tend to slow, if not suppress, intensifying convective
development.

Into the 21-23Z time frame, in the peaking boundary-layer
instability, latest Rapid Refresh suggests that a relatively minimum
in mid-level inhibition may linger near the Ohio River, roughly from
Evansville IN/Owensboro Ky through the Greater Louisville area, near
the nose of the stronger southerly flow around 850 mb associated
with Beryl.  Although this jet streak is forecast to weak some,
speeds on the order of 30+ kt appear likely to still contribute to
sizable clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, particularly along 
or just south of the differential heating zone.  

Given dynamic forcing associated with occasionally strengthening
low-level mesocyclones, and the near-surface buoyancy associated
with the high boundary-layer dew points (increasing to 75+ F),
low-level upward accelerations may become increasingly conducive to
tornadic potential in evolving supercell structures.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Tue Jul 09 2024

Valid 092000Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
LOWER OHIO VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Several tornadoes are possible this afternoon into tonight across
the lower Ohio Valley in association with the remnants of Beryl.

...20Z Update...

...Lower Ohio Valley/Middle Mississippi Valley...
Buoyancy continues to increase across the Lower/Middle OH Valley,
downstream of the surface low centered about 35 miles southwest of
PAH. There also appears to be a corridor of slightly better
low-level (i.e. dewpoints around 76/77 deg F) immediately downstream
of this low over southwest KY. General expectation is that
thunderstorm coverage will increase over the next few hours, with
the greatest coverage anticipated across central and northern
KY/southern IN vicinity. Area VAD profiles continue to show moderate
low to mid-level flow atop the modest southerly/southeasterly
surface winds, supporting the potential for tornadoes and/or
damaging gusts within any of the deeper, more persistent updrafts.

...New England...
As mentioned in recently issued MCD #1564, splitting marginal
supercells capable of isolated large hail and damaging winds remain
possible across the region this afternoon and into this evening.

...New Mexico...
Forecast outlined previously (appended below) remains valid, with
thunderstorm development expected to increase this afternoon and
evening across the higher terrain of NM. A few organized multicells
and perhaps a transient supercell or two are possible.

..Mosier.. 07/09/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1137 AM CDT Tue Jul 09 2024/

...Lower Ohio Valley/Middle Mississippi Valley...
Beryl has become a post-tropical cyclone with its remnant surface
circulation (1004 MB) shifting northeastward across the Mid-South
this morning, and it will continue toward the confluence of the
Ohio/Mississippi Rivers today and Wabash Valley vicinity of southern
Illinois and central/southern Indiana tonight. Short-term
global/mesoscale guidance varies on the strength of 2-3km AGL winds
diurnally, but recent WSR-88D VWP data from Memphis substantiates
the possibility of somewhat-stronger-than-guidance low-level winds,
with a more uniform guidance consensus otherwise that low-level
winds/shear will likely regionally strengthen into this evening.

Preceding the surface low, a warm front will effectively shift
north-northeastward from western/northern Tennessee across Kentucky
toward the Ohio River, oriented generally parallel to the river
later today, with increasingly prevalent lower to middle 70s F
surface dewpoints within the nearby warm sector. Cloud breaks and a
steady warming of the boundary layer will promote an increase and
intensification of storms this afternoon. Enlarged low-level
hodographs, especially in proximity to the warm front, and on the
east-southeast periphery of the surface wave, will support
semi-discrete rotating storms/supercells capable of tornadoes this
afternoon through at least early/mid-evening, particularly within a
corridor across northwest Tennessee, much of Kentucky, into southern
Illinois, southern Indiana, and southern Ohio. Even with a gradual
wane in boundary layer buoyancy and low-level parcel accelerations,
at least some potential for wind damage and/or tornado risk will
continue through the late-night hours northeastward across Ohio
toward the Lake Erie vicinity.

...New England...
A low-amplitude shortwave trough and mid-level speed max will
influence the region, with increasing thunderstorm development
expected this afternoon along a weak/remnant front, with additional
influence by higher terrain and differential heating. A few
organized multicells and perhaps a transient supercell or two can be
expected, with wind gusts of 50-65 mph and severe hail possible this
afternoon through around sunset.

...New Mexico...
The region will be influenced by a relatively moist air mass over
interior areas along with a belt of modestly strong northwesterly
flow aloft. Thunderstorm development should semi-focus this
afternoon near the Raton Mesa as well as the Gila National Forest
vicinity, with storms subsequently generally moving south. Steep
lapse rates and sufficient moisture/buoyancy, in the presence of
moderately strong/vertically veering wind profiles, may allow for
some strong to locally severe storms this afternoon through early
evening.

1230 PM CDT Tue Jul 09 2024

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...20Z Update...

Portions of NW Arizona may experience some isolated dry
thunderstorms, but fuels are only modestly receptive and the threat
is too localized for additional highlight areas at this time.

No further forecast updates are necessary, as current thinking
remains unchanged. See previous discussion for further detail.

..Halbert/Weinman.. 07/09/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Tue Jul 09 2024/

...Synopsis...
A belt of strengthening west-southwesterly mid-level flow will
impinge across the top of the western US ridge on Wednesday, leading
to gusty westerly surface winds along and east of the Cascades
within the Columbia Basin. Fuels within this region are critically
dry, with several days of very warm and dry condition preceding the
increase in surface winds. Elevated to Critical conditions are
expected by the afternoon, as relative humidity reductions to around
10-15 percent will overlap with sustained winds 15-20 mph (locally
stronger). As Critical conditions appear to be fairly localized, an
Elevated delineation was maintained with this outlook.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1224 PM CDT Tue Jul 09 2024

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHERN PA
AND MUCH OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN NY INTO SOUTHERN NH/VT AND WESTERN
MA....

...SUMMARY...
Damaging gusts and a few tornadoes are possible mainly from northern
Pennsylvania and much of central and southern New York into southern
New Hampshire/Vermont and western Massachusetts.

...Synopsis...
Upper troughing is expected to persist across the central and
eastern CONUS on Wednesday, supported by a pair of shortwave troughs
moving through the cyclonic flow aloft. Most prominent of these
shortwaves is associated with the remnants of TC Beryl and is
forecast to move quickly northeastward from its early period
position over the Middle OH Valley and Lower MI through the Lower
Great Lakes region and eastern Ontario. An associated surface low is
expected to progress northeastward just ahead of its parent
shortwave trough, moving from central IN/OH into the St. Lawrence
Valley while occluding. Cold front attendant to this system will
move eastward across the OH Valley and into the Mid-Atlantic.
Secondary surface cyclogenesis is possible Wednesday afternoon at
the triple point (which will likely be in the southwestern NY/Finger
Lakes vicinity), with the resulting low tracking northeastward into
northern NY.

Farther west, upper ridging centered over southern NV is expected to
build throughout the day, covering much of the western CONUS by
early Thursday morning. Modest northwesterly flow aloft is
anticipated between these two features over the High Plains, with
associated lee surface troughing.

...Northern Mid-Atlantic into Upper OH Valley and Northeast...
A occluded front will likely extend from the primary surface low
near the northern/central IN/OH border east-northeastward to the
triple point in the northeast OH/northwest PA vicinity early
Wednesday morning, with a warm front continuing eastward from the
triple point across southwest/south-central NY into MA. The
associated warm sector is expected to be characterized by dewpoints
in the upper 60s to low 70s, which are forecast to advect northward
as the surface low pushes east and the warm front lifts north.
Strong heating is anticipated within this warm sector as well, with
afternoon temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s. These
thermodynamic conditions will support moderate to strong buoyancy
throughout the warm sector, with MLCAPE around 2000 J/kg.

Thunderstorm development is anticipated along the cold front, with
some pre-frontal development within areas of low-level confluence
possible as well. Deep-layer vertical shear across the warm sector
will be moderate (i.e. around 30-40 kt from 0-6 km bulk shear),
supporting the potential for organized storm structures and a few
supercells. Warm temperatures aloft will likely mitigate the hail
threat, but strong heating and resulting steep low-level lapse rates
will support damaging gusts. Additionally, some backing of the
surface winds (particularly near the warm front), could also result
in enough low-level veering with height to result in some tornado
potential. Greatest severe coverage is anticipated from southwest
NY/northwest PA northeastward across much of central and southern NY
into southern NH/VT and western MA.

...Portions of NM and west TX...
Afternoon and evening thunderstorms development is possible across
the region, beginning over the higher terrain, as the airmass
destabilizes amid strong heating and a low-amplitude shortwave
trough rounds the eastern periphery of the upper ridge. Buoyancy
will be modest, but high cloud bases and steep low-level lapse rates
will still support the potential for strong outflow capable of
damaging wind gusts. A few small clusters could aggregate outflow
for a couple hours to locally enhance the convective wind potential.
The threat should wane quickly during the evening as the boundary
layer stabilizes.

Several tornadoes are possible this afternoon into tonight across
the lower Ohio Valley in association with the remnants of Beryl.

...Lower Ohio Valley/Middle Mississippi Valley...
Beryl has become a post-tropical cyclone with its remnant surface
circulation (1004 MB) shifting northeastward across the Mid-South
this morning, and it will continue toward the confluence of the
Ohio/Mississippi Rivers today and Wabash Valley vicinity of southern
Illinois and central/southern Indiana tonight. Short-term
global/mesoscale guidance varies on the strength of 2-3km AGL winds
diurnally, but recent WSR-88D VWP data from Memphis substantiates
the possibility of somewhat-stronger-than-guidance low-level winds,
with a more uniform guidance consensus otherwise that low-level
winds/shear will likely regionally strengthen into this evening.

Preceding the surface low, a warm front will effectively shift
north-northeastward from western/northern Tennessee across Kentucky
toward the Ohio River, oriented generally parallel to the river
later today, with increasingly prevalent lower to middle 70s F
surface dewpoints within the nearby warm sector. Cloud breaks and a
steady warming of the boundary layer will promote an increase and
intensification of storms this afternoon. Enlarged low-level
hodographs, especially in proximity to the warm front, and on the
east-southeast periphery of the surface wave, will support
semi-discrete rotating storms/supercells capable of tornadoes this
afternoon through at least early/mid-evening, particularly within a
corridor across northwest Tennessee, much of Kentucky, into southern
Illinois, southern Indiana, and southern Ohio. Even with a gradual
wane in boundary layer buoyancy and low-level parcel accelerations,
at least some potential for wind damage and/or tornado risk will
continue through the late-night hours northeastward across Ohio
toward the Lake Erie vicinity.

...New England...
A low-amplitude shortwave trough and mid-level speed max will
influence the region, with increasing thunderstorm development
expected this afternoon along a weak/remnant front, with additional
influence by higher terrain and differential heating. A few
organized multicells and perhaps a transient supercell or two can be
expected, with wind gusts of 50-65 mph and severe hail possible this
afternoon through around sunset.

...New Mexico...
The region will be influenced by a relatively moist air mass over
interior areas along with a belt of modestly strong northwesterly
flow aloft. Thunderstorm development should semi-focus this
afternoon near the Raton Mesa as well as the Gila National Forest
vicinity, with storms subsequently generally moving south. Steep
lapse rates and sufficient moisture/buoyancy, in the presence of
moderately strong/vertically veering wind profiles, may allow for
some strong to locally severe storms this afternoon through early
evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 AM CDT Tue Jul 09 2024

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No further forecast updates are necessary, as current thinking
remains unchanged. See previous discussion for further detail.

..Halbert/Weinman.. 07/09/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Tue Jul 09 2024/

...Synopsis...
Strong upper-level ridging aloft will generally keep winds generally
light across the western US today where the most critical fuels are
presently located. Very warm and dry conditions are forecast, with
afternoon relative humidity reductions to 5-15 percent across much
of the region. Sundowner winds will lead to localized Elevated to
Critical fire weather concerns across Santa Barbra County in
southern California, but these conditions remain too localized for
highlights. 

Isolated dry thunderstorms are possible across the Central Rockies
Tuesday afternoon. Overall, this threat remains too localized for
highlights.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR WESTERN
KENTUCKY AND SOUTHERN INDIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Several tornadoes are possible today over the lower Ohio Valley in
association with the remnants of Beryl.

...Lower Ohio Valley/Mid Mississippi Valley...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a progressive mid-level
shortwave trough moving east across the lower MO Valley/Ozarks. 
This mid-level trough is forecast to reach Lake Michigan/Indiana by
late tonight.  The remnants of Beryl will move across the mid
Mississippi and lower Ohio Valleys today.  Ahead of the associated
surface low, morning surface analysis indicates a reservoir of lower
70s deg F dewpoints from the IN/OH/KY tri-state south/southwest into
the Mid South ahead of the low.  Surface streamlines show a warm
frontal zone extending east-northeast from the low.  The warm front
will advance northward to near the OH River by mid afternoon and
serve as a focus for severe thunderstorm potential.

Despite considerable cloud cover this morning, significant cloud
breaks south of the warm front and pockets of heating will
destabilize the airmass from the mid MS Valley to the OH Valley. 
Moderate buoyancy is forecast to develop in the vicinity of the warm
front and to its south over parts of KY/TN.  Models imply, and this
notion is supported by morning observational trends, that a couple
of convective bands will preferentially favor storm development
today.  Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are forecast to
develop within a moderately unstable airmass (1000-1500 J/kg
MLCAPE).  Forecast hodographs will become enlarged --especially in
the warm frontal zone where backed low-level flow will reside-- as a
30-40 southerly 850-mb LLJ overspreads the OH Valley during the
afternoon/evening.  One or more bands of quasi-discrete supercells
are forecast with tornado potential greatest in a southwest to
northeast corridor paralleling the OH River this afternoon into the
evening.  

...New England...
A low-amplitude trough at mid-levels will move eastward across
Quebec and New England during the period.  Heating of a seasonably
moist airmass by afternoon will aid in the development of scattered
thunderstorms.  A few organized multicells and perhaps a transient
supercell or two, will pose an isolated risk for 50-65 mph gusts and
large hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 1557
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0753 AM CDT Mon Jul 08 2024

Areas affected...southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana

Concerning...Tornado Watch 513...

Valid 081253Z - 081500Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 513 continues.

SUMMARY...The tornado threat with Beryl continues today.

DISCUSSION...Currently the primary tornado threat is associated with
a few bands of supercells across southeast Texas. Some guidance
indicates more cellular convection across southwest Louisiana and
eastern Texas by later this morning which could pose some tornado
threat given the wind profile shown by the LCH VWP. Therefore, when
tornado watch 513 expires at 15Z, a new watch may be needed which
may also need to be expanded farther inland to cover this threat as
it develops northward through the day.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 513
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1045 PM CDT Sun Jul 7 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Upper Texas Coast
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday night and Monday morning from 1045 PM
  until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Tropical Storm Beryl will move ashore overnight.  Embedded
thunderstorms in the rainbands to the east of the center will pose a
risk of isolated tornadoes through Monday morning.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
east and west of a line from 50 miles south of Angleton TX to 60
miles north northeast of Houston TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 511...WW 512...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail

Mesoscale Discussion 1551
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0334 PM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024

Areas affected...Texas Panhandle/South Plains into
southwestern/central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 072034Z - 072230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few storms are possible from the Texas South Plains into
central Oklahoma. Discrete storms would pose a risk for large hail,
though severe winds will likely be the predominant threat. Potential
for upscale growth into a cluster/linear segment is possible. Trends
are being monitored for a possible watch later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Weak warm advection over the cold pool from this
mornings convection has contributed to the development of elevated
storms in parts of western and central Oklahoma. The outflow itself
has modified and MLCAPE has risen to around 2000 J/kg. With
additional heating and the approach of the cold front, at least
isolated development is possible within the next few hours. Steep
mid-level lapse rates and 30-35 kts of effective shear will promote
supercells capable of large hail and severe winds.

Farther west, cumulus have been deepening in the Texas South Plains
within a weak surface trough. A few additional storms are possible
in this region as well as suggested by some of the latest CAM
guidance. Large temperature-dewpoint spreads here would likely mean
a quicker transition to a linear storm mode and a primary risk of
severe winds.

With storm coverage uncertain, trends will need to be monitored for
a possible watch later this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1550
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024

Areas affected...north-central into much of eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 072012Z - 072245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are likely to increase along the Front Range this
afternoon, with many producing hail and locally strong gusts as they
continue into the Plains through evening.

DISCUSSION...Visible imagery shows an expansive cumulus field over
much of eastern Colorado where surface winds remain out of the east
and northeast. Weak thunderstorms have developed into far
north-central CO with increasing northern surface winds with high
pressure to the north. Pressures continue to fall near the Colorado
Springs area.

While pockets of drier air do exist around the Denver area, in
general, a moist air mass exists, especially over southeast CO with
mid to upper 50s F dewpoints. Given cool midlevel temperatures,
additional heating will result in sufficient instability to
sustained scattered severe cells. Low-level/weak easterlies below
increasing mid to high level winds will result in favorable shear
profiles for large hail. By evening, storms are expected to
consolidate into an MCS pushing into southeast CO, with damaging
winds possible.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0459 PM CDT Sun Jul 07 2024

Valid 091200Z - 151200Z

...Northwest...
On Day 4/Wednesday, the northern periphery of a large-scale ridge
centered over the Great Basin will break down, as a belt of moderate
midlevel west-southwesterly flow overspreads the Northwest. This
will promote an increase in westerly surface winds along/east of the
Cascades (especially in the Columbia Basin) -- where hot/dry
conditions will remain in place. Elevated to locally critical
conditions are expected, though sustained critical conditions may
remain localized to the Cascade gaps (e.g., the Columbia Gorge) --
precluding 70-percent Critical probabilities at this time.

The strengthening midlevel flow along the northern periphery of the
ridge may continue to promote dry/breezy conditions across the
Northwest (including northern CA into southern ID) through the
remainder of the extended forecast period. However, confidence in
any more than locally critical conditions is too low to add
additional probabilities.

Additionally, thunderstorm potential may increase across parts of
the Northwest late in the extended forecast period (i.e., Days
7-8/Saturday-Sunday), as a midlevel moisture plume spreads northward
along the western portion of the eastward-shifting large-scale
ridge. Confidence in thunderstorm development is too low to add Dry
Thunderstorm probabilities right now, though this scenario will be
monitored closely. 

...Central/Southern CA...
An enhanced onshore pressure gradient will continue to support hot,
dry, and locally breezy conditions primarily across inland portions
of central and southern CA through the period. While this will favor
elevated to locally critical conditions, the threat appears too
localized for probabilities.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 511
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
250 PM MDT Sun Jul 7 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Colorado
  Northeast New Mexico

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 250 PM until
  1100 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2 inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms will develop and
increase through late afternoon and early evening, initially
including areas near/east of the I-25 corridor across eastern
Colorado and northeast New Mexico. These storms will be capable of
large hail, and severe-wind potential may also increase as storms
cluster into this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles east and west of a line from 60 miles north of Limon
CO to 60 miles south southeast of Raton NM. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
30025.

Day 1 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0842 PM CDT Sat Jul 06 2024

Valid 070100Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL PLAINS...

CORRECTED FOR FLIPPED THUNDER LINE

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms will continue this evening across parts of
the central Plains. A few marginally severe storms will be possible
further west into the southern and central High Plains, and
northward into the mid Missouri Valley.

...Central Plains/Southern and Central High Plains/Mid Missouri
Valley...
The latest water vapor imagery shows an upper-level low over the
eastern Dakotas, with a shortwave trough extending southward from
the low into the central Plains. At the surface, a cold front is
located from western Nebraska into southeastern South Dakota, along
which a marginal severe threat will continue this evening. Further
southeastward into the warm sector, a couple convective systems are
ongoing along and to the east of the shortwave trough. An organized
line segment is located in far southeast Nebraska, along the western
edge of a corridor of moderate instability, where the RAP is
analyzing MLCAPE in the 1000 to 1500 J/kg range. WSR-88D VWPs in
this area have southeasterly winds at the surface, with winds
gradually veering to westerly in the mid-levels. This wind profile
will continue to be favorable for linear organization, and a
wind-damage threat is expected to continue in the vicinity of far
southeast Nebraska and far northwest Missouri this evening. Hail
will also likely accompany the stronger cells embedded in this line.

Further to the southwest into west-central Kansas, a severe
convective cluster is also ongoing along and to the east of a
north-to-south corridor of moderate instability. Near this area, the
RAP is analyzing MLCAPE in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range. This
convection is located just to the north of the Dodge City WSR-88D
VWP, which has 0-6 km shear near 40 knots. This shear environment
should be enough to continue a threat for supercells this evening.
Supercells will likely be capable of isolated large hail. A few
severe wind gusts will also be possible. The ongoing convective
systems in Kansas and Nebraska are expected to continue into the
late evening, but the severe threat should become more isolated with
time as instability gradually decreases across the central Plains.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 508
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 PM CDT Sat Jul 6 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Northern Kansas
  Central and Southern Nebraska

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 1225 PM
  until 800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Clusters of storms will continue to develop and intensify,
initially near/north of the Interstate 80 corridor in Nebraska early
this afternoon, but also across northwest Kansas. Storms should
become more scattered/widespread by late afternoon, especially
across south-central Nebraska, where large hail and damaging wind
potential may be most focused.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles north and south of a line from 65 miles south of
Imperial NE to 35 miles east of Grand Island NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
29030.
