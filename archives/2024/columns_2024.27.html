<h2 id="new-open-ssh-vulnerability">New Open SSH Vulnerability</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-03, updated: 2024-07-03, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
It’s a
<a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/07/01/regresshion-remote-unauthenticated-code-execution-vulnerability-in-openssh-server">serious
one</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The vulnerability, which is a signal handler race condition in OpenSSH’s
server (sshd), allows unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) as
root on glibc-based Linux systems; that presents a significant security
risk. This race condition affects sshd in its default configuration.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
This vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to full system compromise
where an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest
privileges, resulting in a complete system takeover, installation of
malware, data manipulation, and the creation of backdoors for persistent
access. It could facilitate network propagation, allowing attackers to
use a compromised system as a foothold to traverse and exploit other
vulnerable systems within the organization…

<p>Somehow, even though I watched an hour of news on MSNBC last night,
and was on all the social media all day, I didn’t hear about Pelosi’s
comments, and the leaked poll data, until this morning. It wasn’t until
I looked at the synopsis of Olbermann’s podcast that I learned that
something had changed. For whatever reason, even though I have made a
significant investment in time to stay informed, it isn’t working.
Fact.</p>

<p>Friends, The only time I recall Democrats being in more chaos and
upheaval than now was in 1968. That, not incidentally, was when they
held their last open convention. If Joe Biden were to drop out, should
Dems have another open convention to sort everything out?</p>

<h2 id="ssh-hardening">2024-07-02 SSH hardening</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-02, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-02-ssh-hardening">
2024-07-02 SSH hardening
</h1>
<p>
Today I decided to harden my SSH server configuration and did the one
thing you should never do: I logged out before testing the new
configuration and promptly locked myself. Don’t be like me.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I wanted to do: Positron Security’s
<a href="https://www.sshaudit.com/">SSH Configuration Auditor</a> gave
me a B+ grade and there were
<a href="https://www.sshaudit.com/hardening_guides.html#debian_12">some
suggestions</a>. I had already implemented some of them because a long
time ago I had followed
<a href="https://disknotifier.com/blog/simple-ssh-security/">a different
SSH hardening guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
The thing that broke my setup is that the new hardening guide specified
the following:
</p>
<pre><code>RequiredRSASize 3072
</code></pre>
<p>
The effect was that I could no longer log in:
</p>
<pre><code>alex@alexschroeder.ch: Permission denied (publickey).
</code></pre>
<p>
That’s because I have passwords disabled. You can only get in via public
key. And my public key wasn’t good enough: it has 2048 bits:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -lf .ssh/id_rsa
2048 SHA256:************/****************************** alex@Megabombus.local (RSA)
</code></pre>
<p>
So what I had to do:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Visit the hosting provider’s website
</li>
<li>
Enable VNC
</li>
<li>
Open a “NoVNC” window
</li>
<li>
Enable login using passwords without having access to Shift or Control
keys (wtf?)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That meant commenting these two in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
PasswordAuthentication no
</code></pre>
<p>
Restarted <code>sshd</code> on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl restart sshd
</code></pre>
<p>
I already had an <code>ed25519</code> identity:
</p>
<pre><code>ls .ssh/id* 
.ssh/id_ed25519  .ssh/id_ed25519.pub  .ssh/id_rsa  .ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre>
<p>
I probably created them using the following:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519
</code></pre>
<p>
I used <code>ssh-copy</code> to copy them to the server:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_ed25519 sibirocobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
And I added the correct setting to my <code>.ssh/config</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>Host sibirocobombus
  HostName alexschroeder.ch
  Port 882
  User alex
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</code></pre>
<p>
I use the <code>ssh</code> config file all the time!
</p>
<p>
This allowed me to uncomment these two in
<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> again:
</p>
<pre><code>PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
PasswordAuthentication no
</code></pre>
<p>
I restarted <code>sshd</code> on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl restart sshd
</code></pre>
<p>
Note to self: Should I ever need to check the server fingerprints, see
<a href="ssh">ssh</a>.
</p>
<p>
My <code>git</code> server needed the same public key in
<code>/home/git/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.

is the first of

for today.
</p>
<p>
It started out being one podcast, but I hit the wrong button after 14
minutes and ended up with two audio files instead of one.
</p>
<p>
I don’t like editing, so you get two for the price of one. :-)
</p>
<p>
It’s a rambler, starts out with me talking about
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Allow-Me-Retort-Black-Constitution/dp/1620976811">Elie
Mystal</a> on abortion and slavery.
</p>
<p>
The second podcast explains how we’re in a war, and it’s about time we
recognized it as such.
</p>
<p>
We need the Democrats to do what we elected them to do, save the
freaking United States, which by the way after yesterday’s decision by
the Supreme Court, doesn’t really exist any longer. We go into that in
the second episode.
</p>
<p>
It’s not enough to win the election. We have to get the Supreme Court
back to a semblance of what it was. They’re behaving in a way that’s
inconsistent with the continued existence of the country they’re
supposed to be part of the government of.
</p>
<p>
But we can have a laugh along the way. The world hasn’t completely
fallen apart, <i>yet.</i> <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

<p>
But Ansible has a lot of dependencies, and some of these dependencies
have caused frustration from time to time on x86 and Arm (so having
issues with a dependency is just a way of life when you enter
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">dependency
hell</a>)… but in this case, for the past few months, I’ve never had
luck installing Ansible from PyPI (Python’s Package Index) on any RISC-V
system, using <code>pip install ansible</code>.
</p>
<p>
I prefer installing this way (rather than compiling from source or from
system packages) because it generally gets the latest version of
Ansible, with an easy upgrade/downgrade path. It’s also easy to add
<code>ansible</code> to a Python <code>requirements.txt</code> file and
install it alongside other package dependencies.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, the <code>cryptography</code> library, which requires a Rust
compiler to build if the package is not already built for a particular
system, has made it difficult to install Ansible from <code>pip</code>:

If you’ve been reading my blog, you’ve noticed that I have written a lot
about AI and democracy, mostly with my co-author Nathan Sanders. I am
pleased to announce that we’re writing a book on the topic.

This isn’t a book about deep fakes, or misinformation. This is a book
about what happens when AI writes laws, adjudicates disputes, audits
bureaucratic actions, assists in political strategy, and advises
citizens on what candidates and issues to support. It’s a book that
tries to look into what an AI-assisted democratic system might look
like, and then at how to best ensure that we make use of the good parts
while avoiding the bad parts…

<p>Friends, Apologies for sending you a second letter today, but like
many of you, I’ve been going over Chief Justice John Roberts’s
presidential immunity decision, trying to understand the distinction it
sets out between “official” acts of a president, which are immune from
prosecution, and “unofficial” acts, which are not immune. And I wanted
to share with you a particularly troubling aspect.</p>

I apologize that this post is a little late. On 19<sup>th</sup> June the
X Window System celebrated its 40th birthday. Wikipedia has a
comprehensive
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System#History">history
of the system</a> including the e-mail Bob Scheifler sent announcing the
first release:<br /> <small>
<pre>From: rws@mit-bold (Robert W. Scheifler)
To: window@athena
Subject: window system X
Date: 19 June 1984 0907-EDT (Tuesday)

I've spent the last couple weeks writing a window
system for the VS100. I stole a fair amount of code
from W, surrounded it with an asynchronous rather
than a synchronous interface, and called it X. Overall
performance appears to be about twice that of W. The
code seems fairly solid at this point, although there are
still some deficiencies to be fixed up.

We at LCS have stopped using W, and are now
actively building applications on X. Anyone else using
W should seriously consider switching. This is not the
ultimate window system, but I believe it is a good
starting point for experimentation. Right at the moment
there is a CLU (and an Argus) interface to X; a C
interface is in the works. The three existing
applications are a text editor (TED), an Argus I/O
interface, and a primitive window manager. There is
no documentation yet; anyone crazy enough to
volunteer? I may get around to it eventually.

Anyone interested in seeing a demo can drop by
NE43-531, although you may want to call 3-1945
first. Anyone who wants the code can come by with a
tape. Anyone interested in hacking deficiencies, feel
free to get in touch.
</pre>
</small> Scheifler was right that it was a “good starting point for
experimentation”, but it wasn’t really a usable window system until
version 11 was released on 15<sup>th</sup> September 1987. I was part of
the team that burned the midnight oil at MIT to get that release out,
but my involvement started in late 1985.<br /> <br /> Below the fold are
some reflections on my contributions, some thoughts on the astonishing
fact that the code is still widely deployed after 40 years, and some
ideas on why it has been so hard to replace.<br />

<h3>
Involvement
</h3>
I arrived at Sun in September 1985 to work with James Gosling on a
window system for Sun’s workstations. We had worked together developing
the window system for Carnegie-Mellon’s
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/5666.5671">Andrew</a> project.
We both realized that, if Unix and Unix workstations like Sun’s were to
succeed, they had to have a widely adopted window system. Ideally, we
thought, it would have three key attributes:<br />
<ul>
<li>
An <b>imaging model</b> at a higher level than simply a grid of pixels,
so that applications didn’t have to adapt to varying screen resolutions.
The clear favorite was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">Adobe
PostScript</a>’s, which had appeared on the Apple LaserWriter in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript#History">January
1985</a>.
</li>
<li>
<b>Networking</b>, so that applications could run wherever it made sense
with their user interface where the user was. In the mid-80s both
workstations and networks were slow, running a window system was a big
load on a Motorola 68000. Having two CPUs working on an application, the
client-server model, helped.
</li>
<li>
<b>Programmability</b>, because it was hard to provide a good user
experience if there was a slow network round-trip required for each
response to a user action. If the window system were programmable, the
code that responded to the user’s actions could run on the user’s
workstation, eliminating the network round-trip.
</li>
</ul>
Gosling had left C-MU some months earlier. He was adamant that it was
possible to implement PostScript on a 68000 fast enough to be a window
system. Adding networking, mouse and keyboard extensions to PostScript
would satisfy all three of our requirements. Because Adobe’s PostScript
in the 68000-based LaserWriter was notoriously slow I was skeptical, but
I should have known better than to doubt his coding skills. A couple of
months later when Gosling showed me a prototype PostScript interpreter
running incredibly fast on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-1">Sun/1</a>, I was convinced
to join him on what became the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS">NeWS project</a>.<br />
<br /> Once at Sun I realized that it was more important for the company
that the Unix world standardized on a single window system than that the
standard be Sun’s NeWS system. At C-MU I had already looked into X as an
alternative to the Andrew window system, so I knew it was the obvious
alternative to NeWS. Although most of my time was spent developing NeWS,
I rapidly ported X version 10 to the Sun/1, likely the second port to
non-DEC hardware. It worked, but I had to kludge several areas that
depended on DEC-specific hardware. The worst was the completely
DEC-specific keyboard support.<br /> <br /> Because it was clear that a
major redesign of X was needed to make it portable and in particular to
make it work well on Sun hardware, Gosling and I worked with the teams
at DEC SRC and WRL on the design of X version 11. Gosling provided
significant input on the imaging model, and I designed the keyboard
support. As the implementation evolved I maintained the Sun port and did
a lot of testing and bug fixing. All of which led to my trip to Boston
to pull all-nighters at MIT finalizing the release.<br /> <br /> My
involvement continued after the first release. I was the editor and main
author of the X Inter-Client Communications Conventions Manual (ICCCM)
that forms Part III of Robert Scheifler and Jim Gettys’
<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/29985888"><i>X Window
System</i></a>. A user’s X environment consists of a set of client
applications, an X server managing displays and input devices, and a
<b>window manager</b> application implementing a user interface that
allows the user to allocate the server’s resources such as windows to
the clients. The window manager needs to communicate the resource
allocations to the clients, and the clients need to communicate between
themselves to support, for example, cut-and-paste. The
<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/29985888">ICCCM explains its
scope thus</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Being a good citizen in the X Version 11 world involves adhering to
conventions that govern inter-client communications in the following
ares:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Selection mechanism
</li>
<li>
Cut buffers
</li>
<li>
Window manager
</li>
<li>
Session manager
</li>
<li>
Manipulation of shared resources
</li>
<li>
Device color characterization
</li>
</ul>
This part of the book proposes suitable conventions without attempting
to enforce any particular user interface.

There is a certain justice in
<a href="https://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf">The UNIX-HATERS
Handbook</a>’s description of my efforts:<br />
<blockquote>
one of the most amazing pieces of literature to come out of the X
Consortium is the “Inter Client Communication Conventions Manual,” … It
describes protocols that X clients must use to communicate with each
other via the X server, including diverse topics like window management,
selections, keyboard and colormap focus, and session management. In
short, it tries to cover everything the X designers forgot and tries to
fix everything they got wrong. But it was too late—by the time ICCCM was
published, people were already writing window managers and toolkits, so
each new version of the ICCCM was forced to bend over backwards to be
backward compatible with the mistakes of the past.

who ran the

project at C-MU</a>, was very wise about what we were getting into:
“We’re either going to have a disaster, or a success disaster”. He often
added: “And I know which I prefer!”. Jim was exaggerating to make two
points:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Being a success didn’t mean the problems were over, it meant a different
set of problems.
</li>
<li>
Ignoring the problems of success was a good way of preventing it.
</li>
</ul>
X11 was definitely a “success disaster”.<br />

</table>
NeWS was amazing technology, providing each of our requirements with
usable performance on a 68000. Its interpreter was a clean-room
implementation of PostScript from the “Blue Book”, with extensions that
provided cooperative multi-threading, networking, arbitrary-shaped
translucent windows, and a fully object-oriented toolkit. Steve Jobs
agreed with us that PostScript was the right imaging model, although the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_PostScript">Display
PostScript</a> interpreter he licensed from Adobe for the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP">NextSTEP</a> window
system was far more restricted. The overwhelming success of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> has
validated our argument for programmability. So why did X11 take over the
world? My view is that there are three main arguments, any one of which
would have been decisive:<br />
<ul>
<li>
We and Jobs were wrong about the imaging model, for at least two
reasons. First, early on pixels were in short supply and applications
needed to make the best use of the few they were assigned. They didn’t
want to delegate control to the PostScript interpreter. Second, later on
came GPUs with 3D imaging models. The idea of a one-size-fits-all model
became obsolete. The reason that Wayland should replace X11 is that it
is agnostic to the application’s choice of imaging model.
</li>
<li>
Although we were right about the need for programmability, PostScript
was the wrong language. Even back in 1985 Gosling and I were veteran
programmers, with experience in many languages including not just C and
Assembler, but also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>. We
didn’t find PostScript’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming">stack-based</a>
language intimidating. But already by that time Darwinian evolution had
focused CS education on C-like languages, so the majority of application
programmers were intimidated. And NeWS wasn’t just
<i>stack-oriented</i>, it was also <i>object-oriented</i> and
<i>multi-threaded</i>, and none of these were optional, making it even
more intimidating. In a sense NeWS was an echo of the success of Sun in
the early days — a bunch of really good engineers building the system
<i>they</i> wanted to use, not one for the mass market.
</li>
<li>
A major reason for Sun’s early success was that they in effect
open-sourced the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System">Network File
System</a>. X11 was open source under the MIT license. I, and some of
the other Sun engineers, understood that NeWS could not displace X11 as
the Unix standard window system without being equally open source. But
Sun’s management looked at NeWS and saw superior technology, an
extension of the PostScript that Adobe was selling, and couldn’t bring
themselves to give it away. But they also couldn’t ignore the fact that
X11 was popular with their customer base, who could run the MIT X11
environment any time they wanted. The result was the ghastly kludge
called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xnews_(X11_server)">Xnews
server</a>, a monument to the inability of Sun to follow McNealy’s “all
the wood behind one arrow” dictum. Wikipedia
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xnews_(X11_server)">correctly
notes that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This seriously degraded the NeWS interpreter performance and was not
considered a very good X11 server either.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Longevity
</h3>
The anniversary bought forth several commentaries on its extraordinary
longevity, including:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Richard Speed’s
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/21/x_window_system_is_40/"><i>The
X Window System is still hanging on at 40</i></a> is aptly subtitled
“Never underestimate the stickiness of legacy technology” and
concludes:<br />
<blockquote>
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/22/the_x_window_system_just/">In
2022, we wondered</a> if “Wayland has what it takes to replace X.” Two
years later, the question is still open, although the direction of
travel is clear. Yet the stickiness of “it just works” is not to be
underestimated, and we would not be surprised if the 50th anniversary
rolls around and there is still someone clinging to X11 for that one old
app that won’t run properly on anything else.
</blockquote>
This is very likely. In order to displace X11, Wayland had to be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Compatibility_with_X">compatible
with it</a> via the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XWayland">XWayland</a> server. So
there is little motivation to rewrite existing applications to use
Wayland directly.

guess</i></a> starts:<br />
<blockquote>
Often times, when I am researching something about computers or coding
that has been around a very long while, I will come across a document on
a university website that tells me more about that thing than any
Wikipedia page or archive ever could.<br /> <br /> It’s usually a PDF,
though sometimes a plaintext file, on a .edu subdirectory that starts
with a username preceded by a tilde (~) character. This is typically a
document that a professor, faced with the same questions semester after
semester, has put together to save the most time possible and get back
to their work. I recently found such a document inside Princeton
University’s astrophysics department:
“<a href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~strauss/AST303/Xintro.pdf">An
Introduction to the X Window System</a>,” written by
<a href="https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/robert-lupton">Robert
Lupton</a>.<br /> <br /> X Window System, which
<a href="https://www.talisman.org/x-debut.shtml">turned 40 years old
earlier this week</a>, was something you had to know how to use to work
with space-facing instruments back in the early 1980s, when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100s</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX-11">VAX-11/750s</a>, and Sun
Microsystems boxes would share space at college computer labs. As the
member of the AstroPhysical Sciences Department at Princeton who knew
the most about computers back then, it fell to Lupton to fix things and
take questions.
</blockquote>
I really like
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-x-window-system-is-40-archaic-as-heck-and-still-relevant/">Lupton’s
assessment</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“It worked, at least relative to the other options we had,” Lupton said.
He noted that Princeton’s systems were not “heavily networked in those
days,” such that the network traffic issues some had with X weren’t an
issue then. “People weren’t expecting a lot of GUIs, either; they were
expecting command lines, maybe a few buttons… it was the most portable
version of a window system, running on both a VAX and the Suns at the
time… it wasn’t bad.”
</blockquote>
Purdy quotes Evan Jenkins from
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2011/03/the-linux-graphics-stack-from-x-to-wayland/"><i>thirteen
years ago</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
X is the oldest lady at the dance, and she insists on dancing with
everyone. X has millions of lines of source, but most of it was written
long ago, when there were no GPUs, and no specialized transistors to do
programmable shading or rotation and translation of vertexes. The
hardware had no notion of oversampling and interpolation to reduce
aliasing, nor was it capable of producing extremely precise color
spaces. The time has come for the old lady to take a chair.

<h1 id="2024-06-28-biden">
2024-06-28 Biden
</h1>
<p>
When I see all this talk about Biden and the US elections I keep
thinking: almost all that matters is that Biden has a vice president
that can take over as soon as things break down. I still remember
thinking when Biden got elected: this guy has nothing; he is the most
boring and conflict averse choice. And this was exactly what the US
needed. And it’s what the US still needs. A boring candidate whose
administration gets stuff done.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the US also needs a lot of other things: reforms, policy
changes, and on and on. And you can have both! Do not vote for the
fascist and keep the criticism up. So I can say: racism, Israel,
Ukraine, immigration, gerrymandering, gun control, Snowden… work on all
these things!! Do it! But just because I’m unhappy about the lack of
progress does not mean you should abstain or vote for a fascist.
</p>
<p>
The fact that both candidates are old white men is a shame, yes of
course! But it is not a reason to hand power to the fascists.
</p>
<p>
And often things can get done at the local level. The Swiss based their
constitution on the US constitution (senate, congress, states,
federalism) and I know that what is impossible to achieve at the
national level can sometimes be achieved at the state level, and what
cannot be achieved at the state level can be achieved at the city level,
in the community, in the library, at the bar, at home.
</p>
<p>
Wherever things are not first past the post you can kick Democrats where
it hurts and beat them. And then, perhaps, one day, things will get
better.
</p>
<p>
Then again, here in Switzerland percentages go up and down here and
there and yet one feels that nothing really changes. It’s hard and
people aren’t as social I would prefer them to be.
</p>
<p>
I do like flowers and trees and birds and amphibians and bees and ants
and marine mammals and bison and many other things, though. The help me
through the dark times.

class="citation" data-cites="mekkaokereke">@mekkaokereke</span></a> eye
to be quite interesting. He says stuff like the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A quote from the Biden Trump debate. Which candidate said this, Trump or
Biden?
</p>
<p>
“I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration
has. He wants to cut the cops.”
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, Biden is the candidate that needs more Black men to vote
for him, or he is likely to lose the election.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, Biden is the one that pushed for and passed the 80s crime
bill.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, Biden is the one that instructed cities to transfer ~$1B
of Covid relief funds to police budgets.
</p>
<p>
Y’all are betting the future of the free world on Biden being able to
say and do stuff like this, and then still get 95% of the votes of Black
men? Seriously? That’s the strategy?
</p>
<p>
Man, lemme go ahead and prepare for this next Trump term then, because
that strategy is awful.
</p>
<p>
How did y’all ever think that would work?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note how he isn’t in favour of Trump. But he sure isn’t in favour of
Biden, either. The message that I’m hearing: Democrats, do better! And
by “do better”, I mean: Do better for the constituents that you expect
to vote for you.
</p>
<p>
This is what all the austerity has led to: People hate the current
government and don’t see anybody else to trust and vote for.
</p>
<p>
This is not about poor misguided undesirables voting for Trump. This is
about the Democrats not doing enough for the people that aren’t voting.

<h1 id="2024-07-02-the-importance-of-moderation">
2024-07-02 The importance of moderation
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a> recently wrote
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/usenet">Usenet had to die</a>,
arguing that Usenet was wasteful, everybody carrying a copy of everybody
else, including spam and binaries. I agree with all the points made. The
idea that there is one global network of groups, with everybody carrying
all the groups and everybody being allowed to post led to the downfall
of Usenet.
</p>
<p>
Having recently hooked my laptop and server server to a handful of other
servers using UUCP, NNCP and NNTP for file copies, mail and news, I just
want to emphasize that the same technology can be used to build a
different net.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UUCP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Calling systems can be required to
have a username and password.
</li>
<li>
NNTP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Systems can be known peers based on
IP numbers and users can be required to authenticate themselves.
</li>
<li>
Servers don’t have to mirror all the groups. Systems can be selective in
what they accept and in what they pass on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The spam problem arises when two systems “trust” each other and peer
messages but one of the systems doesn’t act on abuse and moderation
reports. Perhaps Usenet generated too much of a workload for system
administrators so they stopped following up on those reports. Perhaps
some servers had become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
I think we have the exact same problems with fedi. Some instances seem
too big to defederate from.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn’t work. If my posts end up on
an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me, the post
shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the other users
that I don’t like can comment and those comments are sent back to me. I
can block them all individually or block the large instance including my
small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are not
to blame for the downfall of Usenet. It was the lack of moderation that
killed Usenet. It was the ease of setting up web forums and being able
to moderate them that made Usenet irrelevant. In the end, to all these
people federation was not as important as moderation.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to drop the groups that were overrun with
people that needed moderation. This is a problem on all platforms with
groups, e.g. Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to create new groups for people in their
niches. At least nobody seems to be making that mistake again. IRC,
Reddit, Discord – they all demonstrated that ad-hoc group formation and
self-moderation was viable.
</p>
<p>
This is why I think moderation, group forming and selectivity of
federation are the most important quality of a platform.
</p>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.

<p>Today the United States Supreme Court overthrew the central premise
of American democracy: that no one is above the law. It decided that the
president of the United States, possibly the most powerful person on
earth, has “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution for crimes
committed as part of the official acts at the core of presidential
powers. The court also said it should be presumed that the president
also has immunity for other official acts as well, unless that
prosecution would not intrude on the authority of the executive
branch.</p>

I just did an approx 40 minute
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/01/jeffJarvisDiscusses.m4a">podcast</a>
interview and discussion with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a>. I
know Jeff from the early days of blogging. He was one of the best
discussion leaders at BloggerCon. And he’s an accomplished author and
educator.
</p>
<p>
We talk about how to organize news for people who are information
starved by whatever it is that our news sources are doing, which is
really hard to figure out, but in the end (I argue) who cares why, we
have a problem to solve, so let’s get on with it.
</p>
<p>
I talk about the blogging at the Dean campaign in 2004, that’s how they
got around journalism. I’m sure that’s where we have to go, put together
what we think would be the Biden blog if the campaign was being run by
Joe and Nicco, and I’d be on board, so would Jeff, and we’d help Heather
Cox Richardson, and amplify anyone who is making sense and supports
democracy.
</p>
<p>
It could be funded by the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/01/1342.html">People’s PAC</a>, or
something like it. It wouldn’t take very much money, it’s just a blog.
But it would have powerful ideas that cut through the bullshit, and
great videos, and we’d organize marches where people show up to help
people.
</p>
<p>
And the campaign would never stop, we’d always be organizing.
</p>
<p>
This is the discussion I wanted to start.
</p>
<p>
Hope you enjoy! :-)
</p>
<p>
PS: Jeff’s mike is much better than mine. Gotta work on that.

class="citation" data-cites="bortzmeyer">@bortzmeyer</span></a>. Since
we’re using SSH, there will be a key pair, and since we’re using UUCP,
we’ll still a username and password. It’s going to be both.
</p>
<p>
I know, why aren’t we using NNCP.
</p>
<p>
Generate the key pair.
</p>
<pre><code>cd /var/spool/uucp
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown uucp:uucp .ssh
cd .ssh
sudo -u uucp ssh-keygen -C &quot;uucp@melanobombus&quot; -f id_rsa
</code></pre>
<p>
The file <code>uucp-key.pub</code> now has the public key.
</p>
<p>
On the server (!), add a line to
<code>/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, replacing the public
key:
</p>
<pre><code>restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Umelanobombus -l&quot; ssh-rsa KEY_FROM_ID_RSA_PUB uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>
<p>
We will be using the username <code>Umelanobombus</code> to connect to
the server. This is not a real user!
</p>
<p>
On the server, save username and password in
<code>/etc/uucp/passwd</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>Umelanobombus *secret*
</code></pre>
<p>
On the laptop, save system name, username and the same password in
<code>/etc/uucp/call</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>sibirocobombus Umelanobombus *secret*
</code></pre>
<p>
Now we have both levels: the public and private keys that allow the
<code>uucp</code> user to connect via <code>ssh</code> – and the
username and password that is used by <code>uucp</code>.
</p>
<p>
Define our own name in <code>/etc/uucp/config</code> on the laptop.
</p>
<pre><code>nodename melanobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s add the system to <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code>. That is, on the
laptop, define the server we’re going to call. Since I already know that
sibirocobombus will report itself as <code>campaignwiki</code>, I’m
setting up an <code>alias</code>. The <code>commands</code> line is
important because by default only <code>rmail</code> and
<code>rnews</code> are allowed but I want to allow <code>rsmtp</code>,
too. The <code>chat</code> script waits for the “Password:” prompt and
then sends it. Note that this chat script is much shorter than the one
used in “UUCP over SSH”, linked above. Apparently there’s no “Login:”
prompt on my server so I had to change it.
</p>
<pre><code>system sibirocobombus
alias campaignwiki
commands rmail rnews rsmtp
call-login *
call-password *
time any
chat Password: \P
chat-timeout 30
protocol i
port ssh_campaignwiki
</code></pre>
<p>
Add the new port to <code>etc/uucp/port</code>. Note that I’m listening
to incoming <code>ssh</code> connections on a non-standard port so I
have to provide. Also note that here we’re defining the
<code>uucp</code> “port” with a non-standard <code>ssh</code> “port”.
Just in case you’re not already confused.
</p>
<pre><code>port ssh_campaignwiki
type pipe
command /usr/bin/ssh -a -x -q -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org
reliable true
protocol etyig
</code></pre>
<p>
Before doing our first test, make sure that the server is a “known host”
on the laptop, for the <code>uucp</code> user. Note how I am not using
<code>-q</code> because I want to see the prompt!
</p>
<p>
The password to give on the prompt is the one in
<code>/etc/uucp/call</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u uucp ssh -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org
The authenticity of host '[campaignwiki.org]:882 ([2a02:418:6a04:178:209:50:237:1]:882)' can't be established.

</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s add the laptop to <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the server. Since
the server is never going to call the laptop, no credentials and no port
is required.
</p>
<pre><code>system melanobombus
called-login Umelanobombus
commands rmail rnews rsmtp
local-send /
local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic

protocol i
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s test it!
</p>
<p>
On the client:
</p>
<pre><code>echo hallo &gt; hallo.txt
uucp hallo.txt 'sibirocobombus!~/'
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s check the log.
</p>
<p>
This is what it looks like when things don’t work:
</p>
<pre><code>uulog|tail

</code></pre>
<p>
You can try to replace <code>-q</code> with <code>-v</code> in
<code>/etc/uucp/port</code> in order to see what <code>ssh</code> has to
say.
</p>
<p>
If you try again, the log says that the system is not ready to try
again:

</code></pre>
<p>
Force a call and check the log again.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u uucp uucico -S sibirocobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
You might be specifying the wrong login, or using the wrong chat script.
On the server, the log might look as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>uulog|tail

</code></pre>
<p>
Check the passwords:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/call</code> on the laptop says what username and
password to use
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/passwd</code> on the server says what username and
password to accept, separated by a TAB (!)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Check the system:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/config</code> on the laptop says what the client is
called
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the laptop says what the server is called
and how to connect to it, using what port
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/port</code> on the laptop describes that port
</li>
<li>
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> on the server says what the client is called,
what username to expect
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Check the login again, by going through it by hand. Check whether the
chat script would have worked.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u uucp ssh -p 882 uucp@campaignwiki.org

<p>
When calling the server, specify a high debugging level:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u uucp uucico -x 11 -S sibirocobombus

To look at the debug output. Here’s an example where I mistyped the

<h2 id="model-extraction-from-neural-networks">Model Extraction from
Neural Networks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, updated: 2024-06-28, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1526">new paper</a>, “Polynomial
Time Cryptanalytic Extraction of Neural Network Models,” by Adi Shamir
and others, uses ideas from differential cryptanalysis to extract the
weights inside a neural network using specific queries and their
results. This is much more theoretical than practical, but it’s a really
interesting result.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
</p>
<p>
Billions of dollars and countless GPU hours are currently spent on
training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for a variety of tasks. Thus, it is
essential to determine the difficulty of extracting all the parameters
of such neural networks when given access to their black-box
implementations. Many versions of this problem have been studied over
the last 30 years, and the best current attack on ReLU-based deep neural
networks was presented at Crypto’20 by Carlini, Jagielski, and Mironov.
It resembles a differential chosen plaintext attack on a cryptosystem,
which has a secret key embedded in its black-box implementation and
requires a polynomial number of queries but an exponential amount of
time (as a function of the number of neurons). In this paper, we improve
this attack by developing several new techniques that enable us to
extract with arbitrarily high precision all the real-valued parameters
of a ReLU-based DNN using a polynomial number of queries and a
polynomial amount of time. We demonstrate its practical efficiency by
applying it to a full-sized neural network for classifying the CIFAR10
dataset, which has 3072 inputs, 8 hidden layers with 256 neurons each,
and about 1.2 million neuronal parameters. An attack following the
approach by Carlini et al. requires an exhaustive search over 2^256
possibilities. Our attack replaces this with our new techniques, which
require only 30 minutes on a 256-core computer…

good mood :) Need to make sure to do this more often, and not get so
caught up in the endless “life” grind. It’d be nice if seeing friends
was still as easy as bumping into them at school/wherever, but it’s not,
so, making the effort is worth it, haha.

<p>In addition to his comments about Russia in Ukraine, Trump said
something else in Thursday’s CNN presentation that should be called out
for its embrace of one of the darkest moments in U.S. history. In
response to a question about what the presidential candidates would say
to a Black voter disappointed with racial progress in the United States,
President Joe Biden pointed out that, while there was still far to go,
more Black-owned businesses were started under his administration than
at any other time in U.S. history, that Black unemployment is at a
historic low, and that the administration has relieved student debt,
invested in historically Black colleges and universities, and is working
to provide for childcare costs, all issues that affect Black
Americans.</p>

<h2 id="mini-4wd">Mini 4WD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The algorithm sucked me into another model craft hobby: Mini 4WD racing
(ミニ四駆). A Mini 4WD is a 1:32 scale model that is a mix between slot
cars and RC cars. You don’t control these cars with a remote control nor
do they drive in an electrified slot, rather you place your racecar in a
plastic track with high walls and send them speeding down the track at
~40km/h.
</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2ZZL5i8vOXM?si=ED2YFsLdI9z7BMbG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>
The twist is you don’t know
<a href="https://tamiya.com/japan/mini4wd/feature/2019/1206.html">what
the track looks like</a> until race day, so you have to be ready to
adapt. There might a big jump, moguls, or a tall mountain to climb. Once
racers have seen the course, they have some time to make adjustments by
balancing engineering choices about weight, power, braking, handling,
batteries, downforce, and more. Are you going to make your car lighter
and full send it over the tabletops? Or is slow and steady going to win
the race? The races are a brief cacophony of slapping plastic and
whirring motors but I can feel the electricity of the room through the
screen.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Where YouTube hooked me was watching custom 4WD Mini builders like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@azpaca0">アズパカ</a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Niwakara">にわから</a>, and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@techyuuta">ユウタ</a>. They are
hellbent on making their cars as fast as possible. In Japanese they call
it “タイムアタック” (“Time Attack”). For their time attacks, they use
the
<a href="https://d7z22c0gz59ng.cloudfront.net/cms/japan/mini4wd/topics/feature/2019_12/circuit_1911_2c1_002.jpg">Japan
Cup Junior Circuit</a> (JCJC) course; a three lane track with a wave
feature and a wicked lane change from the inner lane to the outer lane
that will send light or fast cars flying off the course. The
standardized course (and video
format<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>)
is where the similarities stop because their cars are anything but
conventional.
</p>
<p>
The videos are all about iteration and experimentation. Testing all
kinds of parts and gimmicks like 3D printed chassis, side rollers,
battery types, motors, wheels, and downforce options. Sometimes the
tweaks are small, sometimes they are radical innovations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8mXdQ9oW2c">An entirely
“blade” flat chassis</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rgALusRMAs&amp;t=396s">A
chassis with all the weight to one side</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o--_xP1xBA">A bendy chassis to
bend around corners.</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKWx_TMOzvo">A chassis with a
motor on each wheel</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8mXdQ9oW2c">A chassis with a
computer fan in the middle</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlLuqw_Bf08">A car with
knives</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1J8fqEXrv0">A dual-fan chassis
that looks like a GPU</a>.
</li>
<li>
A car with model rocket engines!?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRpmNh-kOkE">Why not</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That sort of raw, no-rules experimentation is refreshing to watch. It
looks like dumb fun. A reason to own a 3D printer. They experiments
don’t always work and will fail spectacularly, but lessons get learned.
And if you watch enough videos, you see them getting faster.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A stock car will complete all three laps in about 5 seconds.
</li>
<li>
Cars they made a year ago will go around in 3 seconds.
</li>
<li>
Cars they made six months ago, 2 seconds.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyoc3my8suY&amp;t=3s">A car
from one month ago, 1.63 seconds.</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m not sure why Mini 4WD strikes such a chord with me. It could be
nostalgia for my RC car days as a ten year old. It could be my penchant
for Japanese model making. But I probably know what hooks me the most:
this is the flavor of engineering optimization work I like to do. Make
it lighter, faster, and able to handle bumps in the road. Websites are
of course vastly different than mechanical engineering… but the
correlation between weight and speed are enough to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240227130052/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alZvGsOVh3o">activate
my brain</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mini4wd.jpg" alt="Untitled" />
</p>
<p>
So I bought a <a href="https://amzn.to/3W5aHoc">Mini 4WD Starter
Pack</a> (and one for my son) to close the loop on my curiosity. They’re
only ~$20, so why not. The hitch in the plan is that a beginner track
costs $120. It would nice to have an opportunity to run around a complex
track without an upfront cost. My hobby shop used to host races and have
a track in-store before COVID, but not anymore. Maybe I can provide this
as a service to my kids’ friends… yeah… that’s a good justification.

what we need from Biden, and how we need journalism to get out of the
way. Biden has a base. He should communicate directly with us. Joe, tell
us you saw what we saw. A snake oil salesman. A con man. A loser. A
criminal. We heard the tape of him blackmailing the Secretary of State
of Georgia. He wanted the military to shoot Black Lives Matter
protestors. Did he sell our secrets to Putin and others? He did all
kinds of horrible stuff that the press has forgotten to talk about. The
biggest problem here isn’t Biden’s age, though it is a problem, it’s the
controlling nature of our journalism, and the lack of any oversight.
They can’t be criticized because all we have are our individual voices,
with no organization. We keep paying the price. This podcast is in the
form of a voicemail to an old friend,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Jarvis">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who
I introduce at the beginning of the podcast. We share the same
frustrations, I can see it in his posts on various social media
networks. I’d like to elevate our discourse. And in the meantime, imho,
it’s a pretty good story. <i>10 minutes.</i> <span

<p>Challenging questions: Why don’t journalists cover the Biden base? Do
they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think
they are the base? I thought they weren’t supposed to care who the
nominees are? Why do they feel entitled to say one candidate should
withdraw but not the other? Have any of them even thought this
through?</p>
