<h1>
VASL Templates
</h1>
<p>
I’m trying to get <a href="https://vasl-templates.org/">VASL
Templates</a> to run on my laptop so that I can create nice setups for
Advanced Squad Leader. As it turns out, I have to use <code>pipx</code>
because that automatically creates virtual environments for me, as far
as I understand.
</p>
<pre><code>cd src
git clone https://code.pacman-ghost.com/public/vasl-templates.git
cd vasl-templates
pipx install .
</code></pre>
<p>
As it turns out, this is not enough:
</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
</code></pre>
<p>
So now you need to install PyQt5 into the virtual environment used by
vasl-templates:
</p>
<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQt5
</code></pre>
<p>
Next error:
</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'
</code></pre>
<p>
Fix:
</p>
<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQtWebEngine
</code></pre>
<p>
And now it works at last! 😅

<h2 id="morning-chatgpt-notes">Morning ChatGPT Notes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
spent a couple of days putting together a JSON text editor in a modal
dialog for a project I’m working on. I’m combining the Ace editor with
the Bootstrap toolkit. I’ve used both components before, but never
together. And they’re always a bit tricky to get working because I’m
impatient and the docs are spread out, and there are different versions.
It’s all kind of a mess, so you just get it working and move on, never
quite sure why it works, and I rarely end up with reusable code. But
it’s certainly a lot better than starting from scratch, which basically
is impossible, given the depth of the two components. After spinning my
wheels a bit, I did what I always do in 2024, I turned to ChatGPT,
outlined the problem, and asked if it knew of any sample code, which it
proceeded to write for me, in about two seconds (not kidding about
that). I copied their code and pasted it into my editor and ran it. It
worked. Then I went through a number of iterations, restructuring the
code to meet my needs, each time checking with ChatGPT, asking what it
thought of my code. And of course there were problems, for example at
one point there were two vertical scrollbars, and each time we worked
<i>together</i> to figure out the problem and the fix. In the end, I
have a solid editor that works exactly as I want it to, and best of all,
I understand how it works. Here’s the
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/840e8159-9988-4159-8289-5167d6fb78c8">transcript
of the work</a> I did with it, over more than 24 hours, a few different
sessions.
</p>
<p>
I’ll try to remember when this code ships as part of a product, to link
to this perspective.
</p>
<p>
Next up, I’d like to get it to understand my coding conventions, so when
it shares code with me it can save me the step of having to convert its
conventions to mine. In other words, I’d like to return the favor. It’s
doing a great job of teaching and coaching me. I’d like to teach it how
to do that better, so we work better together over time. And perhaps it
can teach human programmers what I’ve learned about programming in over
50 years of doing this work.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A
bit of philosophy. People say these things aren’t intelligent, but
seriously, if I can engage with it as if it were intelligent, far more
intelligent in ways than I am, what’s the difference between that and
actually being intelligent? I know from a lifetime of dealing with
supposedly intelligent humans, and being one myself, how rarely we focus
on the idea that the person we’re conversing with has an inner life
that’s vastly different from ours and no less complex, and
contradictory. We tend to think of others as being like us, or like
someone who raised us. Always in a movie, never in the moment. So why is
it interesting that ChatGPT is a machine? These are questions thinkers
and writers have been pondering for decades if not centuries, but –
<i>now we’re living it.</i> I’m so happy to have made it this far! An
amazing experience, so much learning in so little time. I don’t
understand how people can sit on the sidelines and not want to be the
first to try all this stuff out, to be part of its evolution. I feel so
lucky.
</p>
<p>
A puzzling thing, in the transcripts I’m identified as “anonymous,” but
I am logged in. It must know my name. I bet this is some kind of setting
which defaults to anonymous, to play it safe.
</p>
<p>
One more thing. I copied and pasted the text above into ChatGPT.
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5fe361cd-1fca-4e8d-82cc-920514e8c4b8">Here
are its comments</a>. A funny thing about ChatGPT is that you can’t ask
it how to use ChatGPT itself. It doesn’t know about the chat UI?

<h2 id="drivethru-i-am-unhappy">Drivethru, I am unhappy!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Drivethru, I am unhappy!
</h1>
<p>
The DrivethruRPG website so depends on shit that it loads from other
domains that I cannot log in no matter how many exceptions I add to
uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or the Firefox content blocking
preferences. And with every second I spend doing this, I resent them
more. And when I finally start Chromium to try and connect, I’m already
ranting as I sit at my laptop. And then I get Connection timed out from
cloudflare and really… I feel like they don’t want my money. Uuuugh.
</p>
<p>
I used their contact form. When I hit the submit button I was greeted by
a white page. I don’t know if they go an email. (I did try the next day
from a phone and that worked – which sort of illustrates the point.)
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I wrote:
</p>
<p>
I think in a world where big tech is tracking us, where everybody and
their uncle is spying on us, it is only natural that people start
locking down their browser. I have uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger
installed and I tell all my browsers to do as much content blocking as
they can, I delete all cookies when I close the browser. It’s the right
thing to do. It is all the more galling when a website such as Drivethru
becomes practically unusable as a consequence of me trying to do the
right thing. It feels as if Drivethru is betraying me to the big tech
corporations, helping them spy on me. It’s a revolting feeling. These
days, I have it every time I remember to use an unprotected Chromium
browser just to log into Drivethru. Every single time I wish for an
alternative. Every single time I hope that itch.io and other competitors
end up replacing you.
</p>
<p>
If only you had a simple, straight forward website, served your own
Javascript, had no tracking, and allowed me to browse stuff and buy it.
I don’t really expect an answer to this email. It just feels unfair to
rant on social media about the situation without telling you about it.
</p>
<p>
I hope Drivethru improves. I really do. I believe that change is
possible and I hope that you do, too.

creates a 100MB version of Windows 11 by axing the windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you know your Windows history, you’ll know that the operating
system got that name when it moved away from using pure MS-DOS and
started using a graphical user interface to show things. As it turns
out, you can force Windows 11 back to its legacy roots and reduce it
back to a command-line interface. This is what the developer of Tiny11
has achieved, calling their new creation “Minwin.” The developer of
Win11, NTDev, posted a video on YouTube about their project. There’s
absolutely nothing flashy here; no Copilot, no Start menu, and
definitely no UI. It’s as graphically complex as the Command Prompt,
which meant that NTDev had to resort to fancy 00s-era ASCII logos to
announce that Minwin was working. ↫ Simon Batt at XDA Definitely a neat
proof-of-concept, and it shows just how modular Windows could be if only
Microsoft allowed its users to take out the parts they don’t need. I
wonder how close this is to Nano Server, an installation option for
Windows Server you’ve probably never heard of. I also like the nod to
MinWin, the informal codename Microsoft used internally to refer to an
effort by a small number of expert Windows kernel engineers to untangle
the spaghetti ball of dependencies that had sprouted between the various
architectural layers of Windows. This project started around Vista, and
eventually made it possible to make broader, sweeping changes to Windows
without breaking things all over the place because the spaghetti ball of
internal, low-level dependencies wasn’t mapped out.</p>

months in Servo: better inline layout, stable Rust, and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another month, another pile of improvement to Servo, the rendering
engine written in Rust, originally a Mozilla project. This month the
proof-of-concept browser UI got forward and backward buttons, making
this bare-bones UI just a tiny bit more usable. Of course, the vast
majority of changes and improvements are all focused on the actual
rendering engine, which makes sense because Servo definitely isn’t ready
for any prime time use – nor is anyone claiming it is. I’m incredibly

About Barman
</h3>
<p>
Backup and Recovery Manager (or Barman) is an open-source administration
tool for remote backups and disaster recovery of PostgreSQL servers in
business-critical environments. It relies on PostgreSQL’s robust and
reliable Point-In-Time Recovery technology, allowing DBAs to remotely
manage a complete catalog of backups and the recovery phase of multiple
remote servers – all from one location. Barman is distributed under GNU
GPL 3 and maintained by <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com">EDB</a>.
