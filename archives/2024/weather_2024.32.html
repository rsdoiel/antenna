Mesoscale Discussion 1831
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0659 PM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Areas affected...southern Minnesota

Concerning...Tornado Watch 600...

Valid 052359Z - 060100Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 600 continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado risk continues within WW600. Localized damaging
wind threat may increase in the next hour.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of supercells is currently moving
southeastward across portions of southern MN. These cells have a
history of producing tornadoes and large hail (up to 1.5 inches in
diameter). The risk for tornadoes will continue in the short term
with these cells, with MPX VAD indicating 0-3 km SRH 430 m2/s2.
These cells are also producing very heavy precipitation, with the
potential for evaporative cooling and strong outflow winds
increasing as cells evolve into a more linear mode. Isolated
damaging gusts 65-80 mph are possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 601
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 PM CDT Mon Aug 5 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Illinois
  Northwest Indiana
  Southern Wisconsin

* Effective this Monday afternoon from 550 PM until Midnight CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Isolated to scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are
forecast this evening.  A few of the stronger storms may evolve into
supercells posing a risk for large hail (1 to 1.5 inches in
diameter), severe gusts, and perhaps a tornado.  Strong to severe
multicells are forecast near the Indiana and Illinois border this
evening.  A localized risk for hail and wind may accompany these
storms.  By later this evening, other storms may develop and move
into western parts of the Watch and yield a threat for locally
damaging gusts and perhaps large hail.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles north and south of a line from 70 miles west northwest
of Rockford IL to 85 miles east southeast of Marseilles IL. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0442 PM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Valid 071200Z - 131200Z

The extended period will be characterized primarily by modest
mid-level zonal flow across the Northwest and Northern Rockies, as
well as warming and drying across much of the Western U.S. beneath a
mid-level anticyclone centered over the Great Basin. Some chances
for isolated dry thunderstorms will exist early on in the forecast
period, but predictability of thunderstorm occurrence later on in
the period will be low. Mid-level zonal flow and a shortwave trough
are expected to bring dry and windy conditions to portions of the
Northwest by D6/Saturday.

...Dry Thunder...
Monsoonal moisture will persist over the Great Basin, resulting in
chances for dry thunderstorms across eastern UT, western CO, and far
southern WY on D3/Wednesday and D4/Thursday. By D4/Thursday, modest
PWAT values of 0.6-0.75 in will overspread portions of far eastern
Idaho into southern Montana, resulting in some chances for dry
thunderstorms further north into those regions. Some modification to
these areas may be needed due to wetting rainfall in the preceding
days. Dry thunderstorm chances could persist into D6/Saturday and
D7/Sunday, but predictability remains too low at this time to
highlight any specific areas. 

...Dry/Windy...
Modest zonal flow will support some Elevated to locally Critical
fire-weather conditions across the Snake River Plain in Idaho on
D3/Wednesday. Afterwards, flow will remain generally weak until
D6/Saturday, when Euro and GFS forecasts signal an intensification
of the geopotential height gradient over Idaho owing to an
approaching shortwave trough, increasing mid-level flow. Dry and
windy conditions beneath this enhanced flow could result in Critical
fire-weather conditions, and these conditions may persist into
D7/Sunday. However, uncertainties remain in the magnitude of the
flow and resulting surface winds, so highlights have been reserved
for D6/Saturday, where there is better agreement in critical
conditions.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 PM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Satellite imagery shows that the low-level center of Fabio is on 
the north side of an area of strong, but loosely curved, convective 
bands.  Scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar data received 
since the last advisory indicate that the circulation is closed and 
that the maximum winds are near 35 kt in the eastern semicircle.  
This is in good agreement with satellite intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB, and it is the initial intensity for this advisory.

The initial motion is now 310/13 kt.  Fabio's motion should be 
dominated by interaction with Tropical Storm Emilia to the 
west-southwest, with Fabio expected to move northwestward and 
westward at an increased forward speed around the north side of 
Emilia for the next 36-48 h.  The new forecast track has only 
minor changes from the previous track.

Some strengthening should occur in the next 12 h or so.  After 
that, the intensity forecast is mainly based on the global model 
forecasts that Fabio will wind up being absorbed into Emilia, with 
the various model times of this absorption being between 12-36 h.  
The official forecast shows Fabio dissipating between 36-48 h in 
best agreement with the GFS model.  However, the cyclone could 
dissipate at any time before then.  Confidence in this forecast is 
increasing due to the more consistent global model solutions that 
Emilia will absorb Fabio.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
Issued by NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Carlotta continues to struggle within hostile environmental
conditions, with sea surface temperatures below 25C and significant
vertical shear. The center of the tropical cyclone is fully exposed,
with the remaining deep convection confined to an outer rainband in
its northern quadrant. The TAFB intensity estimate was 35 kt, CIMSS
ADT was 25 kt, and CIMSS AiDT was 32 kt. The initial intensity for
this advisory is a conservative 35 kt.
 
Carlotta should continue to spin down as it moves over cool sea 
surface temperatures and remains within significant vertical shear. 
If current trends continue, and persistent deep convection does not 
redevelop, post-tropical cyclone status will occur soon.
 
The initial motion for Carlotta is 280/7 kt. This general motion
should continue for the rest of today, then should turn toward the
west-southwest as Carlotta's circulation becomes increasingly
shallow. This scenario is consistent with the objective aids. The
forecast track for this advisory reflects a slight northward
adjustment from the previous advisory and is close to the dynamical
consensus.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 PM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Satellite imagery shows that Emilia remains a sheared cyclone this
afternoon, with the low-level center still located near the
northeastern edge of a large convective mass with cloud tops to
near -80C.  A recent ASCAT overpass showed winds of 40+ kt in the
southern semicircle, while the various subjective and objective
satellite intensity estimates remain in the 35-40 kt range.  Based
on the scatterometer data, the initial intensity is increased to  
45 kt.  The initial wind radii were adjusted based on the ASCAT 
data.
 
The latest global model runs continue to forecast that Emilia will
be the survivor in its interaction with the Tropical Storm Fabio to
the east, and the intensity forecast is based on this scenario and
the expectation of continued moderate easterly shear. The forecast
follows the trend of the intensity guidance and now forecasts a
peak intensity of 55 kt in 36 h.  After that time, although the
shear is forecast to decrease, Emilia is expected to slowly weaken
as it moves over decreasing sea surface temperatures.  The new
forecast is again an update of the previous forecast.  Confidence
in this forecast is increasing due to the more consistent model
guidance that Emilia will absorb Fabio and not the other way around.
 
The interaction with Fabio should steer Emilia southward for the
next 12 h or so.  After that, a turn toward the northwest or
north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is expected as
Emilia starts to absorb Fabio.  After Fabio dissipates in about 48
h, Emilia should generally move west-northwestward on the south
side of a low- to mid-level ridge to the north, with this general
motion expected for the remainder of the forecast period.  The new
forecast track has only minor changes from the previous track.

Tropical Depression Daniel Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
A recent ASCAT-B pass over Daniel this afternoon revealed that
Daniel barely has a closed circulation and its maximum winds
have decreased to 30 kt, making Daniel a tropical depression.
Daniel's convective organization is also lacking, but it has
produced persistent deep convection over its center for the past
several hours.
 
Little change was made to the NHC forecast. Daniel should 
weaken and wrap cyclonically around the larger and more robust 
circulation of Carlotta during the next couple of days. Global 
models indicate that Daniel could open into a trough at any time, 
Even if it maintains its circulation, its unlikely to maintain its 
organized deep convection beyond tonight. Therefore the largest 
change in the NHC forecast is to show Daniel becoming a remnant low 
tonight or early tomorrow and dissipating soon after that.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Valid 052000Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM SOUTHERN
MINNESOTA INTO PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST...AND OVER A SMALL PART OF THE
COASTAL SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms remain possible today and tonight from the
Upper Ohio Valley into New England, across portions of the Upper
Midwest, and from northern Florida into southeast South Carolina.

Little overall change to the outlook at 20Z.

An expansive shield of heavy rain stretches from northern FL into SC
in association with Tropical Storm Debby. Low-level shear remains
favorable to support rotation within any stronger embedded cells,
and a brief tornado or two cannot be ruled out. For more information
see mesoscale discussion 1826.

A corridor of strong instability has developed from eastern SD into
northern IL. Storms may develop soon near the SD/MN border, with
east/southeastward development along a warm front. For more
information see mesoscale discussion 1827.

..Jewell.. 08/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1115 AM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024/

...FL/GA/SC...
TS Debby continues to track slowly northeastward across northern FL.
 Widespread clouds over the eastern semi-circle will suppress
heating/destabilization through the day, although recent trends
suggest some mid-level drying beginning to wrap around the south
side of the system.  Despite weak thermodynamics, overall shear
profiles are quite strong and would support a risk of a few
tornadoes through the afternoon and night.  The threat will spread
northeastward along the SC coast through the day as well.

...OH to New England...
Fast zonal flow is present today across the Great Lakes and
northeast states today, with a 70 knot mid-level jet max tracking
from eastern ONT into New England this evening.  A corridor of
mostly clear skies and strong heating is apparent from northern OH
into NY/PA and much of New England today, where afternoon MLCAPE
values will range from 1000-1500 J/kg.  Most 12z model guidance
continues to indicate widely scattered thunderstorms will develop in
this zone, with sufficient vertical shear for a few supercell or
small bowing structures.  Mid-level lapse rates are weak, but the
stronger storms may produce locally damaging winds and perhaps hail.

...MN/IA/WI/IL...
Latest surface analysis shows a low over southeast SD, with a warm
front extending east-southeastward from the low across central IA. 
Pockets of heating and ample low-level moisture on the north side of
the warm front are expected to result in scattered thunderstorms
(possibly surface-based) by mid-late afternoon over northwest
IA/southwest MN, with storms tracking southeastward along/north of
the front.  Large CAPE values, steep mid-level lapse rates, and
substantial vertical shear profiles will promote supercell storm
structures capable of large hail, damaging winds, and a tornado or
two.

...ID/MT...
Water vapor imagery shows a plume of mid-level moisture spreading
northward across ID, ahead of a pair of minor shortwave troughs
moving across NV/OR/WA.  This should lead to scattered high-based
showers and thunderstorms this afternoon across much of ID and
western MT.  Steep low and mid-level lapse rates will promote a risk
of locally damaging winds in the stronger cells this afternoon and
evening.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Satellite imagery shows that Emilia remains a sheared cyclone this 
morning, with the low-level center located near the northeastern 
edge of a large convective mass with cloud tops to near -85C.  The 
various subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
nudged upward to the 35-40 kt range, and the initial intensity is 
set at 40 kt.

The latest global model runs continue to suggest that Emilia will be 
the survivor in interaction with the newly formed Tropical Storm 
Fabio to the east, and the intensity forecast is based on this 
scenario and the expectation of continued moderate easterly shear.  
The forecast follows the trend of the intensity guidance and 
forecasts a peak intensity of 60 kt in 48 h.  After that time, 
Emilia is expected to slowly weaken as it moves over decreasing sea 
surface temperatures.  The new forecast is basically an update of 
the previous forecast.  It should be noted that this forecast is low 
confidence due to the possibility that Fabio might still end up as 
the dominant cyclone.

Interaction with Fabio should steer Emilia south-southwestward to 
southward for the next 12 h or so.  After that, a turn toward the 
northwest or north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is 
expected as Emilia start to absorb Fabio.  After Fabio dissipates in 
about 60 h, Emilia should generally move west-northwestward on the 
south side of a low- to mid-level ridge to the north.  The first 96 
h of the forecast track have been adjusted somewhat based on the GFS 
and Canadian model forecasts of the interaction between Emilia and 
Fabio.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Satellite imagery this morning indicates that the disturbance 
located well southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico has 
continued to become better organized, and that it now has sufficient 
convection and a well-enough defined circulation to be considered a 
tropical cyclone.  With an initial intensity of 35 kt based on 
earlier scatterometer data, advisories are being initiated on 
Tropical Storm Fabio.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 310/10.  Fabio's motion 
should be dominated by interaction with Tropical Storm Emilia to 
the west, with Fabio expected to move northwestward and westward at 
an increased forward speed around the north side of Emilia through 
the next 48 h.  

The intensity forecast is based on the global model forecasts 
that Fabio will wind up being absorbed into Emilia in the not 
too distant future.  Some strengthening is expected during the next 
12-24 h.  After that, the global models are forecasting that Fabio 
will dissipate as it is absorbed into Emilia by the 60 h point.  
The intensity forecast and dissipation time lean toward the GFS and 
Canadian model solutions, which keep Fabio separate from Emilia 
through about 48 h.  This forecast is low confidence due to the 
possibility that Fabio could try to absorb Emilia.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Daniel's organization continues to decrease, and it has become 
difficult to distinguish Daniel from the surrounding ITCZ/Monsoon 
Trough convection. Subjective and objective intensity estimates 
vary around 30-35 kt, so the initial intensity remains 35 kt 
for this advisory. 

It is very hard to determine how well-defined Daniel's surface 
circulation is, so its possible that the cyclone is already near 
dissipation, but this will be easier to determine after the sun has 
been up over Daniel for longer. Regardless, the system should not 
be around as a tropical cyclone for much longer as it is quickly 
moving into a more hostile environment. Some intensity models, 
including the GFS, indicate Daniel could dissipate as soon as 
this afternoon. Even if it maintains its circulation for a few 
days, all models suggest it will lose deep convection by tomorrow 
evening and become a remnant low.

Daniel has accelerated slightly toward the east-northeast, and 
should continue heading in that direction today, within low- to 
mid-level southwesterly monsoonal flow. After that, dynamical models 
continue to indicate that Daniel or its remnants will bend 
northward, and then westward, around the outer circulation of 
Carlotta. The NHC forecast continues to closely follow the consensus 
models and is very similar to the previous advisory.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

If not for a recent small burst of convection nearly 60 n mi from 
its center, Carlotta would be devoid of organized deep convection. 
The intensity estimate remains 40 kt, close to a recent UW-CIMSS 
SATCON estimate. Deep convection may persist today, but could cease 
at just about any time due to cold waters beneath Carlotta and a 
surounding dry and stable environment. By this time tomorrow, 
Carlotta should be a post-tropical cyclone.

Carlotta's initial motion remains 280/8kt. This general motion 
should continue today as long as Carlotta maintains some deep 
convection. A slight left turn toward the west-southwest should 
begin once the last of Carlotta's convection is gone. No significant 
changes were made to the NHC track or intensity forecasts.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 596
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
555 AM EDT Mon Aug 5 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and northern Florida
  Southeastern Georgia
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Monday morning and afternoon from 555 AM until
  400 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible

SUMMARY...Per NHC forecasts, Hurricane Debby should move slowly
northeastward/inland after landfall, to near the FL/GA line during
the duration of this watch.  Associated tornado potential -- mainly
northeast through southeast of center -- should spread over the
watch area and across more of northern FL and southeastern GA
through early/mid afternoon.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 50 statute miles
east and west of a line from 50 miles east southeast of Saint
Petersburg FL to 50 miles north of Brunswick GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...This tornado watch replaces tornado
watch number 595. Watch number 595 will not be in effect after
555 AM EDT. 

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 18035.

0749 AM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE UPPER
OHIO VALLEY INTO NEW ENGLAND...ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE UPPER
MIDWEST...AND FROM NORTHERN FLORIDA INTO SOUTHERN GEORGIA AND
SOUTHEAST SOUTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible today and tonight from the Upper
Ohio Valley into New England, across portions of the Upper Midwest,
and from northern Florida into southern Georgia and southeast South
Carolina.

...Synopsis...
With height falls well underway on its northern rim -- over the
northern Rockies -- the Four Corners regional anticyclone has become
ore zonally elongated, with a shift/reformation of the associated
500-mb high over the San Juan Mountains or adjoining San Luis
Valley. Through the period, associated ridging will extend
east-southeastward across southern KS to AR, west-southwestward over
the LAS area to southern CA, and will rebuild northwestward over the
northern Rockies.  The latter will occur as a series of closely
spaced shortwave perturbations -- apparent in moisture-channel
imagery from the western Dakotas to north-central MT -- shift
eastward across the Dakotas to MN by 00Z.  These features then
should cross WI and Lake Michigan tonight.  Just west of the ridge,
a weak shortwave trough now over the central/northern Sierra should
move north-northeastward toward the northern Rockies through the
day.

Farther east, a strong shortwave trough was evident over northern ON
north of Lake Superior, in the southwest quadrant of a vast cyclone
covering most of eastern Canada.  This trough should move
east-southeastward across southernmost QC to ME by 06Z, then over
the Canadian Maritimes.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a wavy, slow-moving (mostly
stationary) frontal zone from central New England to a weak low over
southern Lake Huron, across southern Lake Michigan and northern IA,
to another low over south-central SD between PIR-VTN, then across
central WY.  As the mid/upper shortwave trough approaches and grazes
the area, the eastern part of the front should move slowly
southeastward across the Lower Great Lakes, Adirondacks, White
Mountains and much of ME by 00Z.  The trailing part should drift
southward into northern parts of OH/IN/IL, then decelerate/stall
overnight.  The SD low should ripple east-southeastward along the
front and across the Siouxland region by 00Z, then over northern IA
tonight.  The trailing cold front from there should extend across
eastern NE, northwestern KS and southeastern CO by 00Z, stalling
overnight over southwestern KS and southeastern CO in response to
cyclogenesis near LAA.

...FL/GA/SC -- Hurricane Debby...
Hurricane Debby has made landfall in the FL "Big Bend" coastal area,
and the center is forecast by NHC to proceed slowly northeastward
over the FL/GA line through the period.  See SPC Tornado Watch 596
and related mesoscale discussions for near-term potential.  Refer to
latest NHC advisories for forecast track/intensity of Debby, and
tropical watches/warnings.

The existing tornado potential southeast of center largely is
expected to translate along with Debby, while expanding
northeastward to the Atlantic Coast of northeastern FL and GA, as
favorable low-level theta-e advection from the Atlantic destabilizes
the nearshore airmass there.  An extensive area of precip northeast
through north of center should be maintained, substantially
restricting instability over northwestern FL and southwestern/
south-central GA to the left of the forecast center track, and
reinforcing the baroclinic gradient there.  That should act as a
buoyancy-limiting northwestern bound to the supercell/tornado
threat.  Meanwhile, as low-level flow veers further on the FL West
Coast through the remainder of this morning, and weaker lift with a
more skeletal convective structure moves across the area south of
center, supercell/tornado potential will diminish there.  The
optimal CAPE/shear parameter space should shift through northern FL
into southeastern GA today, while expanding along the GA and
eventually SC Coast later today through tonight.

...Northeast and Great Lakes to upper Mississippi Valley...
Through tonight, multiple rounds of strong to severe convection are
possible across this lengthy but relatively narrow corridor near the
front, through tonight.  Damaging winds will be the main concern in
the Northeast, though enough low-level shear/hodograph enlargement
exists in forecast soundings across parts of northern New England to
support some supercell potential.  Meanwhile, supercells with large
hail and a tornado threat may develop before dark or in early
evening between southern MN and southern Lake Michigan.  Activity
overall should evolve upscale to a more clustered, wind-driven
threat with time, lasting later in the evening over western areas.

Surface-based development is likely to occur earlier in the eastern
"slight risk" area -- from midday through this afternoon, as
peripheral mass response to the Canadian perturbation increases
low-level convergence and tightens the height gradient aloft.  The
latter will increase deep shear, though nearly unidirectional wind
profiles should persist over the corridor, except in parts of
north-central New England and northern IA/southern MN, each to the
east of frontal-wave lows.  Strong diurnal warming will occur in
conjunction with favorable low-level moisture, with surface
dewpoints commonly in the mid/upper 60s from OH eastward and low 70s
from northern IN across the upper Mississippi Valley.  This should
yield peak/preconvective MLCAPE ranging from around 500-1500 J/kg
over the Northeast -- where midlevel lapse rates will be weaker --
to 2000-3000 J/kg in a narrow corridor near the front from northern
OH to the IA/MN border vicinity.  However, capping will be stronger
over the IA/MN/WI part of the front, and diurnal development/
coverage accessing the greatest surface-based buoyancy is more
uncertain than evening/overnight severe hail/gust potential near and
north of the front.

...Northern Rockies and vicinity...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop this
afternoon and evening over much of ID into western MT, as modest
large-scale ascent preceding the shortwave trough spreads across
diurnally heated higher elevations.  Development will be supported
further by at least marginally favorable moisture, represented by
lower-elevation surface dewpoints now in the upper 40s to low 60s F,
and not expected to dry very much via mixing through early/mid
afternoon.  Still, heating/mixing should be strong enough to build
steep low/middle-level lapse rates and "inverted-v" thermodynamic
profiles supporting strong/isolated severe gusts,  Some of this
activity also may take the form of dry thunderstorms, especially in
eastern areas -- see SPC Fire Weather products for more on that
concern.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
...Isolated Dry Thunderstorms...
Increasing mid-level ascent associated with a shortwave trough will
impact the northern and central Rockies on Tuesday. Mainly mid-level
moisture above drier boundary layer conditions will support dry
thunderstorm chances, with little wetting rainfall expected. Fuels
from southwestern MT, southeastward into WY, eastern UT, and
northwestern CO are sufficiently dry for new lightning ignitions. In
addition, gusty and erratic outflow winds will be possible with any
stronger storms that develop. 


...Elevated Fire Weather, Snake River Plain Idaho...
As the shortwave advances across the northern/central Rockies, a
band of enhanced mid-level westerly flow will overspread portions of
Idaho and Montana. An increase in winds is expected across the Snake
River Plain, where relative-humidity reductions to 10-15 percent
will overlap sustained winds 15-20 mph. Occasional localized
critical conditions may be possible. Overall, this looks to be too
localized to include an area with this outlook.

Mesoscale Discussion 1815
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1247 PM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Areas affected...much of the Florida Peninsula and far southern
Georgia

Concerning...Tornado Watch 594...

Valid 041747Z - 041945Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 594 continues.

SUMMARY...Mini supercells within the outer bands of intensifying TC
Debby will remain capable of tornadoes this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...As of 1745 UTC, the latest NHC Aircraft recon fixed the
low-level center of TS Debby near 27.0 N, 84.3 W. As the TC
continues to deepen, low-level hodograph expansion has been noted at
most of the radar sites east/northeast of the center. A few
tornadoes are possible with miniature supercells embedded within the
spiral rain bands as they move ashore into moderate low-level SRH.
Stronger low-level mesocyclones within the most westward band have
moved offshore over the past few hours, but a new band developing to
the east has shown some stronger convective development recently. As
low-level shear continues to intensify, tornado potential should
increase, especially where low-level flow is more backed. Warmer
surface temperatures to the north of the main cloud shield may also
support more intense convection and a locally greater tornado or
damaging gust risk this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1814
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1234 PM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Areas affected...far northern New York eastward into Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041734Z - 042000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Some storms may produce localized hail, primarily at or
below severe levels, over the next several hours.

DISCUSSION...On the periphery of an upper trough over Quebec,
relatively cool midlevel temperatures extend southward into parts of
New England. Daytime heating near a surface trough and also north of
a more extensive cirrus shield is resulting in moderate
destabilization from northern NY eastward into parts of ME.

Wind profiles do not favor particularly organized storms, as winds
below 500 mb are weak. However, stronger speeds exist in the upper
levels which may aid venting somewhat.

Overall, it appears that short-lived, strong storm cores capable of
marginally severe hail will be the primary risk with these cells
over the next few hours as they travel east/southeast across the
narrow instability zone.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHERN FL
INTO EASTERN GA AND SOUTHERN SC...ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE UPPER
MIDWEST...AND FROM THE UPPER OH VALLEY INTO NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe thunderstorms are possible Monday into Monday night
from the Upper Ohio Valley into New England, across portions of the
Upper Midwest, and from northern Florida into southern Georgia and
southeast South Carolina.

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced westerlies is forecast to extend across the
length US/Canada border, from the Pacific Northwest through the
northern Plains/Upper Midwest and Northeast. Several shortwave
troughs will be embedded within these westerlies, the most prominent
of which is a wave that is forecast to progress quickly from central
Ontario through southern Quebec and northern ME. Another,
low-amplitude shortwave trough is expected to move through the
northern Plains, Upper Midwest, and Upper Great Lakes. 

Expansive upper ridging is expected to remain centered over the Four
Corners,  extending from the southern Great Basin vicinity through
the lower MS Valley. Tropical Cyclone Debby is expected to move
between the eastern periphery of the Four Corners ridge and
subtropical ridging over the western Atlantic, progressing across
northern FL and reaching the southeast GA/southern SC vicinity by
early Tuesday morning. 

Surface pattern early Monday is expected to feature a low over the
central SD/NE border vicinity, with a stationary front extending
eastward from this low across central IA, northern IL, and southern
Lower MI before arcing more northeastward along the St. Lawrence
Valley to another low over New Brunswick. Eastern portion of this
front is expected to progress southeastward across the Northeast
throughout the day, while the portion of the front closer to the
SD/NE surface low transitions to a warm front amid southerly
low-level flow ahead of the low.

A cold front will extend westward from the SD/NE surface low into
eastern WY, where it intersects lee troughing extending across the
northern and central High Plains. This front is expected to push
southward across the central Plains as the low progresses
eastward/southeastward through IA. 

...Northern FL into southern GA and far southern SC...
Tropical cyclone Debby is forecast to progress across northern FL
throughout the day, reaching the southeast GA/southern SC vicinity
by early Tuesday morning. Strong low-level flow attendant to this
system will support the potential for tornadoes within deeper, more
persistent updrafts. These updrafts are most likely in the areas
where dewpoints exceed 74/75 deg F. This appears most likely across
northern FL and southeast GA. However, a more westerly track would
allow this more favorable low-level moisture to penetrate inland
more of southern GA and perhaps even southern SC. 5-percent tornado
probabilities were adjusted northward to account for this
possibility.

...Northern OH Valley through the Northeast/New England...
Thunderstorm development is anticipated Monday afternoon along the
length of the cold front extending from ME into northern IN/OH.
Dewpoints ranging from the mid 60s across central ME to the low 70s
across IN/OH will support moderate buoyancy, with the strongest
buoyancy across the OH Valley where greater low-level moisture
exists. Moderate mid-level flow will extend across the region as
well, with the stronger flow and greater vertical shear expected
across New England. While there is some displacement between the
strongest shear and greatest buoyancy, there is still enough overlap
to support scattered strong to severe storms, including even some
supercells across New England. Damaging gusts will be the primary
severe hazard.

...Upper Midwest...
Late afternoon/evening thunderstorm development is expected near the
surface low and associated warm front moving across IA. The airmass
will be very unstable, supported by temperatures in the upper
80s/low 90s and dewpoints in the mid 70s. Even so, there is some
question whether true warm sector storms will initiate, given the
potential for significant mixing and warm mid-level temperatures.
Storms north of the warm front could still pose a severe risk, with
large hail and damaging gusts as the primary threats. A
surface-based, warm sector storm would have these threat as well,
but with an added potential for very large hail and potentially even
a tornado or two, given the potential for a supercellular mode.
After the initial cellular mode, a quick transition to a more
linear/forward-propagating mode is expected.  

...Northern Rockies...
A low-amplitude shortwave trough is forecast to move through the
northern periphery of the ridge across the northern Rockies Monday
afternoon. Ascent and increased mid-level moisture attendant to this
wave combined with orographic ascent and deep boundary-layer mixing
will help support afternoon/evening thunderstorms. Deep-layer
vertical shear is strong enough to some organized, more persistent
updrafts. High storm bases and steep low-level lapse rates will help
support damaging gusts with the strongest storms.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1154 AM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...Update...
Latest observational trends in satellite data, combined with recent
CAMs and other model output, suggest the most likely area for
isolated dry thunderstorm coverage will be shifted southeast from
the previous forecast across portions of central UT, southern WY,
and western CO, with a small area of additional elevated, dry
thunderstorms possible near and east/northeast of the Cascades of
OR. These areas will have relatively lower PWATs and drier boundary
layer conditions this afternoon. Further north across MT and the
rest of WY, wetting thunderstorms are anticipated within an area of
stronger mid-level ascent and deeper moisture. In addition, very few
thunderstorms are now expected to develop over ID on the backside of
an exiting vorticity maximum, and as a result, dry Thunderstorms
have been removed from the forecast there. For additional details
pertaining to the unchanged Elevated area for windy and dry
conditions this afternoon across the High Plains of WY, SD, and NE
please see the previous discussion below.

..Barnes.. 08/04/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024/

...Synopsis...
...Isolated Dry Thunderstorms...
A midlevel disturbance moving across the Great Basin into the
northern Rockies will bring isolated dry thunderstorm chances across
eastern Oregon into Idaho southward and eastward into Utah and
Wyoming this afternoon. In these regions, mid-level moisture will
overlap dry surface conditions with faster storm motions. With
little to no precipitation expected, dry fuels within these regions
will support potential for new ignitions. Gusty and erratic outflow
will also be possible. Better potential for wetting rainfall into
central/northern Montana precludes the need to include these areas,
though fuels in these regions are also sufficiently dry.

...Windy/Dry...
A surface low will deepen across eastern MT/WY this afternoon.
Surface winds will increase across these regions into western
Nebraska and southern South Dakota amid relative humidity reductions
to 15-20 percent. Some portions of the Nebraska Panhandle received
wetting rainfall in the last 24 hours, though heavier totals were
more sparse. Given ERCs near the 95th percentile before this light
to moderate rainfall, fuels may still be receptive to fire spread
with Elevated fire weather conditions expected.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1123 AM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Valid 041630Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR A FEW
TORNADOES OVER PARTS OF FLORIDA AND EXTREME SOUTHERN GEORGIA. 
DAMAGING WINDS MAY ALSO AFFECT PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST MONTANA THIS
EVENING....

...SUMMARY...
Tropical Storm Debby may produce a few tornadoes over parts of
Florida and extreme southern Georgia through early tomorrow morning
as it intensifies.  Scattered thunderstorms may produce damaging
wind gusts across parts of Montana this evening.

...FL/South GA...
Tropical Storm Debby continues to intensify off the west coast of
the FL.  Low-level wind fields are enlarging, resulting in
strengthening shear profiles across much of peninsula.  Dewpoints in
the mid-upper 70s and pockets of heating, combined with deep
tropical moisture, will result in scattered to widespread afternoon
thunderstorms.  Given the favorable wind fields, a few tornadoes are
possible.

...MT/WY...
Water vapor loop shows a well-defined mid-level shortwave trough
moving eastward across ID.  This feature and an associated mid-level
speed max will cross the northern Rockies and into southern
MT/northern WY this afternoon/evening.  A consensus of 12z model
guidance shows clusters of thunderstorms forming in this region,
tracking eastward across southern MT through the evening.  CAMs have
a consistent signal for a more organized damaging wind threat, so
have added a small SLGT to account for this scenario.

...SD/MN/IA...
A strengthening low-level jet will enhance warm advection and lift
over eastern SD/western MN this evening/tonight.  Isolated
thunderstorm development is possible in this regime, perhaps not
until after midnight.  This region will be beneath the southern
fringe of stronger west-northwest flow aloft, and in a region of
relatively steep mid-level lapse rates.  Elevated storms capable of
hail and perhaps gusty winds are possible.

...Northeast States...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected today across much of New
England and eastern NY/PA into NJ.  Surface conditions are
considerably cooler than recent days, which should weaken low-level
lapse rates and temper the overall severe threat.  Nevertheless, a
few strong storms are possible - capable of gusty wind and small
hail.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 594
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1055 AM EDT Sun Aug 4 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Northern Florida
  Southern Georgia
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning and evening from 1055 AM until
  800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity within the outer bands of Tropical Storm Debby this
afternoon.  As wind fields strengthen, the potential will exist for
a few tornadoes in the stronger cells.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 70 statute miles
east and west of a line from 25 miles east northeast of Valdosta GA
to 20 miles southeast of Naples FL. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 14030.

...Hart

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Carlotta's deep convection has become quite limited this
morning. Subjective Dvorak and objective satellite estimates like
the UW-CIMSS ADT are all decreasing, and support an initial
intensity estimate of 55 kt. No changes of note were made to the NHC
forecast, and further weakening should continue as Carlotta moves
over SSTs that are already below 25 deg C. The SSTs will only get
colder during the next couple of days as Carlotta moves along the
forecast track. The tropical storm is forecast by most models to
lose its remaining deep convection in about 48 h, and based on
current trends this could occur even sooner. Dissipation is still
expected around mid-week.
 
The tropical storm is still moving westward to west-northwestward. 
This general motion should continue for the next day or two as 
Carlotta is steered by a deep-layer ridge centered well to its 
northeast. As the cyclone weakens further and becomes more 
vertically shallow, low-level steering will likely cause it to turn 
westward and slow down slightly in a couple of days.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Daniel's convective structure continues to sputter along, with the 
coldest cloud tops organized in two regions to the northeast and 
southwest of the center, which appears to be mostly exposed this 
morning. The latest round of both subjective and objective intensity 
guidance has not changed much from overnight, and so the initial 
intensity remains 35 kt this advisory. 

It appears that the tropical storm is finally starting to track more 
north-northeastward this morning, with the estimated motion at 030/4 
kt. A somewhat faster northeastward motion is expected to begin 
later today through Monday as Daniel's motion is influenced by the 
southwesterly monsoonal flow being picked up by Carlotta passing to 
the north. The global models still show a turn north and 
northwestward as Daniel gets caught in the outer periphery  of 
Carlotta's larger circulation. The NHC track forecast is quite 
similar to the prior advisory, close to the multi-model consensus. 
 
While the vertical wind shear that was previously affecting Daniel 
is starting to subside, there is quite a bit of environmental dry 
air to the north of the storm, which will likely keep it in check, 
and only a modest amount of intensification is forecasted. After 48 
h, this dry air is expected to fully envelop the circulation, 
choking off the remaining convection, marking the storm's transition 
to a post-tropical remnant low. The low is finally forecast to open 
up into a trough by midweek.

Tropical Depression Five-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM MST Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Convection associated with a low located well offshore Mexico has 
steadily increased in coverage and organization since yesterday. 
Overnight ASCAT and first-light visible imagery indicate that the 
cyclone also has a well-defined, if somewhat broad, circulation. 
Subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB were both 2.0 
at 1200 UTC, which support initiating advisories on the system as a 
30 kt depression.

The depression is located within a very convectively active 
environment over the east Pacific, deep-layer wind shear is low, and 
SSTs are plenty warm, so strengthening is expected in the short 
term. The biggest source of uncertainty for this forecast is an 
expected interaction with a larger disturbance, currently Invest 
96E, which is approaching from the east. Based on the available 
global and hurricane dynamical model forecasts, the most likely 
scenario is that 96E will be the dominant system. In that case, the 
new depression will only have a short window to strengthen before it 
is wrapped into and dissipates within the other circulation. Models 
historically handle interaction cases like this poorly, so 
confidence in the forecast is not high, despite the near universal 
agreement between the dynamical guidance on this upcoming evolution.

The NHC forecast is very close to the consensus guidance through 24 
to 36 h.  After that, the model trackers appear to be getting fooled 
by the close proximity of 96E and TD Five-E and are following the 
stronger vortex instead. The NHC forecast is based heavily on a 
broad consensus of model fields beyond 36 h and shows dissipation 
occuring by 60 h.  There is some chance that the depression could 
persist longer than forecast if the two systems remain farther 
apart, however there is not enough guidance with a trackable vortex 
to justify an explicit forecast beyond what is currently shown.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Five-E
was located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 112.9 West. The
depression is nearly stationary, but a slow generally southward 
motion is expected to begin later today and continue into Monday. A 
sharp turn back toward the north is possible by Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Slow strengthening is expected today and the system is forecast to 
become a tropical storm tonight. The cyclone will then begin to 
interact with another larger disturbance approaching from the east, 
which is expected to cause this system to dissipate in a few days.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
