Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1210 PM CDT Thu Aug 08 2024

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN
PA...NJ...AND THE NORTHERN DELMARVA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
There may be at least some continuing risk for damaging gusts
tornadoes in advance of the remnant low of Debby. Greatest severe
potential is expected from eastern Pennsylvania into New Jersey and
the northern Delmarva Peninsula.

...Synopsis...
A mid-latitude cyclone is forecast to begin the period over central
Ontario before shifting gradually throughout the day. Moderate to
strong flow is anticipated throughout the base of this cyclone,
spreading from the Upper Midwest across the Great Lakes and OH
Valley and into the Northeast as a shortwave trough progresses from
the Upper Midwest across the Upper Great Lakes into southwest
Quebec. Overall evolution of this cyclone and associated shortwave
trough will interact with Tropical Cyclone Debby, which may be in
its extratropical phase by early Friday morning. This interaction
will result in an accelerated northeastward progression of Debby,
taking it from its initial position near the WV/MD/VA border
vicinity quickly northeastward through the Northeast and into the
Upper St. Lawrence Valley by early Saturday.

Farther west, dampened upper ridging will persist across the
Southwest and southern Plains. A convectively generated,
low-amplitude shortwave trough is forecast to move through the
northern periphery of this ridging, from eastern CO into the
Mid-South. Another low-amplitude shortwave trough may follow in the
wake of the first, reaching the central KS/western OK by early
Saturday morning. 

...Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast...
Robust low to mid-level flow is forecast to extend throughout the
eastern periphery of TC Debby, from eastern NC into southern ME,
early Friday morning. This strong flow will persist throughout the
day, gradually shifting northeastward with the parent system. The
strongest low/mid-level flow (i.e. 50+ kt at 850mb) will remain in
close proximity to the cyclone, spreading from far northeast
VA/central MD early Friday into eastern PA/NJ by the afternoon and
into southern New England by late Friday/early Saturday
 
Widespread cloud cover and limited heating is anticipated across the
region, but deep convection still appears possible amid the strong
warm-air advection. Buoyancy will be limited, likely tempering the
overall updraft strength within this convection. However, ample
moisture will be in place, which should combine with the strong
low-level shear to support some organized storm structures. Damaging
gusts will be the greatest severe threat, but embedded circulations
could be strong enough to produce brief tornadoes as well. 

Highest severe potential is expected from eastern PA to the I-95
corridor in NJ, where the timing of the system allows for the best
overlap between the buoyancy/daytime heating and the low-level
shear. Strong forcing could still result in some damaging gusts
farther north into NY and western New England, despite very limited
buoyancy. Buoyancy will be greater farther south across eastern
VA/NC, but shear will be weaker, likely keeping the severe threat
isolated. 

...Northeast NM/Southeast CO into TX Panhandle and Western OK...
Scattered showers and thunderstorms will likely be ongoing across
the TX Panhandle vicinity early Friday, with some potential that
this activity will persist downstream into western OK throughout the
day. Limited buoyancy and shear should keep the severe threat low. 

Another round of thunderstorms is possible Friday afternoon,
beginning in the Raton Mesa vicinity and then continuing
eastward/southeastward through the evening and potentially
overnight, maintained by a moderate low-level jet across west TX. As
with the early morning storms, limited buoyancy and shear should
keep the severe threat low.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 614
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1245 PM EDT Thu Aug 8 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern North Carolina
  Central and Southeast Virginia
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 1245 PM
  until 800 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms embedded within the outer bands of Tropical
Storm Debby will continue to track northeastward across the watch
area through the afternoon, posing a risk of a few tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 80 statute miles
east and west of a line from 50 miles northwest of Richmond VA to 50
miles southeast of New Bern NC. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 613...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 14030.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1105 AM CDT Thu Aug 08 2024

Valid 081630Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
TONIGHT OVER PORTIONS OF NORTH CAROLINA AND THE MID ATLANTIC
REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated tornadoes are possible today and tonight over portions of
the Mid Atlantic region.  Strong thunderstorm wind gusts may affect
portions of Utah and Arizona.

...Mid Atlantic...
The center of circulation of TS Debby will lift northward today and
tonight across central NC/VA, with the zone of strongest low level
winds/shear just to the northeast of the low.  A consensus of 12z
CAM solutions suggest the main threat of semi-discrete convection
and a few tornadoes this afternoon and evening will be across
north-central NC and south-central VA.  This threat will build
northward into parts of northern VA and the Eastern WV Panhandle
after dark, and eventually into central PA by Friday morning. 
Please refer to MCD #1866 for further short-term details.

...UT/AZ...
Pockets of strong heating, ample mid-level moisture, and a remnant
MCV tracking westward across northern AZ will help to promote
thunderstorms capable of locally damaging wind gusts this afternoon
from western UT into northwest AZ.  Morning surface analysis shows a
very moist boundary-layer in place across central and southeast AZ,
with dewpoints in the upper 60s and full sunshine expected.  This,
combined with 12z CAM solutions of active afternoon thunderstorms,
has prompted an expansion of the MRGL risk into that region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1107 AM CDT Thu Aug 08 2024

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

The notable changes on this update are to expand the Isolated Dry
Thunder area into Nevada and to add an Isolated Dry Thunder area in
portions of northeast Washington. Both of these changes reflect
greater confidence in lightning occurrence in an environment with
dry fuels and precipitable water values between 0.5-0.75 inches.
Otherwise, see the previous discussion for more details.

..Supinie.. 08/08/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0112 AM CDT Thu Aug 08 2024/

...Synopsis...
As a trough moving across the northern Rockies into the northern
Plains suppresses the western US ridge today, flow aloft will
shift to become more northwesterly with monsoonal moisture shifting
southward. Isolated dry thunderstorm chances will be possible along
the fringes of the deeper monsoonal moisture across southern/central
Utah into western Colorado and western Wyoming. In these regions,
precipitable water values around 0.50-0.75 inch and mainly mid-level
moisture will result in high-based convection, with potential for
new ignitions amid receptive fuels, and little precipitation. Gusty
and erratic winds will be possible near thunderstorms.

Mesoscale Discussion 1866
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1018 AM CDT Thu Aug 08 2024

Areas affected...eastern North Carolina into southeastern Virginia

Concerning...Tornado Watch 613...

Valid 081518Z - 081715Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 613 continues.

SUMMARY...Local risk for brief tornadoes will continue, north and
east of the center of T.S. Debby.

DISCUSSION...Latest radar loop shows low-topped, occasionally
rotating convective cells moving northwestward across eastern North
Carolina, within the northeast quadrant of Debby(now centered over
northeastern South Carolina).  A lack of inland lightning is
currently observed, reflecting the weak CAPE within the tropical
environment revealed by area/morning RAOBs.  With that said, a very
favorable low-level wind field is also indicated, with flow veering
and increasing notable with height through the lower portion of the
troposphere, reaching/exceeding 50 kt from the southeast at 800m to
1000m AGL.  This is providing a favorable environment for
occasional, and briefly strong -- low-level spin-ups, and expect
this trend to continue through the day today.  With WW 613 set to
expire at 08/17Z, a new tornado watch will be needed, extending
farther northward to include central Virginia.

either side of a line from 30 miles south southwest of Goldsboro NC
to 35 miles east northeast of Elizabeth City NC. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...This tornado watch replaces tornado
watch number 612. Watch number 612 will not be in effect after
245 AM EDT. 

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 14035.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
Issued by the NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
800 AM PDT Thu Aug 08 2024

Emilia is producing small bursts of convection near its center this 
morning, with little convective activity elsewhere within the 
circulation. Based on a blend of the latest Dvorak current intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB, the initial intensity is held at 35 kt. 
This is also in good agreement with the overnight scatterometer 
data that showed 30-35 kt winds with the storm.
 
The center of Emilia has been tugged slightly south of the previous 
forecast track by recent convective bursts, but the long-term motion 
remains west-northwestward (285/16 kt). The storm is expected to 
continue on a west-northwestward to westward heading with a slower 
forward speed over the next few days. The latest NHC track forecast 
follows the multi-model consensus trends and has been nudged a bit 
south of the previous prediction. Emilia is moving over cooler 
waters and into a drier, more stable environment, making it unlikely 
that Emilia will remain a tropical cyclone for much longer. The 
updated NHC forecast shows Emilia becoming a post-tropical remnant 
low in 24 h. The weakening system will likely take a few days to 
spin down, and the global models indicate the cyclone should open 
into a trough and dissipate by day 5.

0742 AM CDT Thu Aug 08 2024

Valid 081300Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF NORTH
CAROLINA AND VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
The main severe-weather threat today is for tornadoes from Tropical
Storm Debby, in parts of North Carolina and Virginia.

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level ridging has been suppressed considerably over the
West, as a highly amplified northern-stream pattern takes shape over
Canada and the northern tier of the CONUS.  A compact but well-
defined cyclone -- evident in moisture-channel imagery over southern
MB -- will pivot southeastward then eastward over the MN/ON Boundary
Waters region, then Lake Superior and adjoining portions of
northwestern ON.  As that occurs, height falls and strengthening
cyclonic flow will spread over the Great Lakes, contributing to
greater poleward advance of the deep-layer low accompanying T.S.
Debby. 

At the surface, 11Z analysis shows a cold front from northwestern ON
across western Lake Superior to west-central KS and southeastern CO,
preceded by a strong outflow boundary across western MO,
northwestern/central/southwestern OK, the southern TX Panhandle, and
eastern NM just south of I-40.  While supporting thunderstorm
formation today, lack of greater shear will preclude enough severe
potential near the boundary or front for an accompanying,
unconditional severe risk.

...T.S. Debby: NC/VA...
The tornado threat from T.S. Debby ramped up again overnight, with
several strong mesocyclones and a few tornadic-debris signatures
noted.  Most of this activity has been occurring in response to two
internal factors that continue:
1.  Stronger low-level convergence/lift over the northeast quadrant
of the system, helping to sustain both a persistent spiral band of
embedded supercells and an occasional discrete/semi-discrete
supercell outside the band;
2.  Northwestward shift of favorable boundary-layer
theta-e/buoyancy, as the inland rain shield and its stabilizing
effects have shifted likewise, and as the cyclone as a whole has
made landfall and moved roughly the same way. 

Though the more deeply overland path of Debby will foster gradual
weakening of the wind fields overall, per NHC wind-radii forecasts,
sufficiently strong low-level wind shear and enlarged hodographs
will remain over a favorably moist and unstable sector well
northeast of center.  In that sector, both band-embedded and
discrete supercells should continue to form and move northwestward
as the system (and favorable sector) shift poleward. This will
spread the tornado threat into more of northeastern NC and into
southeastern VA with time today, perhaps reaching parts of central
VA by evening. 

See SPC Tornado Watch 613 and related mesoscale discussions for
near-term coverage of the tornado threat.  Refer to NHC advisories
for latest track/intensity forecasts for Debby, as well as tropical
watches/warnings. 

...Southern Great Basin, southwestern Colorado Plateau...
Isolated severe gusts are possible this afternoon into early evening
from thunderstorms over portions of northern AZ and southern UT. 

The northern periphery of a trough in the easterlies (equatorward of
the remaining ridge) will continue to move slowly westward over
western AZ and the lower Colorado River Valley today.  This includes
a well-defined MCV -- produced by yesterday's convection over
southern AZ -- and now moving west-northwestward roughly over I-10
in western AZ.  These features are expected to tighten the midlevel
flow gradient northward toward the ridge just enough to encourage
slow westward motion of thunderstorms developing this afternoon over
the Mogollon Rim, North Rim/Kaibab Plateau, and other higher-
elevation areas, where heating will preferentially remove MLCINH
soonest.  Activity in the transition zone between richer moisture to
the south, and deeper mixing/dry-thunder potential to the north,
will pose a risk of isolated severe gusts from either wet or dry
downbursts, with small clusters/cold pools possibly forming also. 
Peak MLCAPE in the 300-800 J/kg range should overlie a very deep
subcloud mixed layer supporting even larger vales of DCAPE, with
surface dewpoints commonly remaining in the 40s to low 50s at lower
elevations.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CDT Thu Aug 08 2024

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will traverse the northern periphery of the
western US ridge on Friday with a modest increase in moisture across
the Pacific Northwest, mainly west of the Cascades. Along the high
terrain of the Cascades, isolated dry thunderstorms will be possible
with precipitable water values forecast to be around 0.50-0.75 in.
While some mix of wet/dry thunderstorms may evolve, fuels in this
region are critically dry and will support new ignitions.

Further isolated thunderstorm development is expected across Idaho
into southwestern Montana, western Wyoming, and northern Utah.
Precipitable water values are expected to be around 0.50-0.60 inch
with very dry low-level profiles. This will support high-based
storms with little to no precipitation. Fuels within this region
remain in the 80th-90th percentile for dryness and receptive to new
ignitions.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0458 PM CDT Wed Aug 07 2024

Valid 091200Z - 151200Z

In the mid-levels, a belt of modest mid-level flow will remain over
the northern half of CONUS through the weekend into early next week.
Several shortwave troughs embedded in the flow are expected to
provide lift for thunderstorm activity as well as stronger surface
winds. One such shortwave trough is expected to traverse the
northwestern CONUS with attendant thunderstorm activity. Low
precipitable water values may result in a dry lightning risk
overlapping with receptive fuels across portions of the northwest
and northern Rockies.

By early next week, a longwave trough is expected to develop over
the northwestern CONUS, with the stronger mid-level flow pushing
southward around the periphery of the trough. This may result in
some Elevated or Critical fire risk across portions of the Great
Basin. At the moment, the highest confidence for overlap of strong
winds with low RH and receptive fuels in the region is on
D4/Saturday and D6/Monday. Therefore, a 40% highlight has been
maintained on D4, and one been introduced on D6 for this area.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 611
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
215 PM MDT Wed Aug 7 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Far Northwest Kansas
  Western Nebraska
  Far Southeast Wyoming

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 215 PM
  until 1000 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is expected to continue across
the southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado, with these
storms then moving downstream into western Nebraska and far
northwest Kansas. The environment supports large hail with the
early, more cellular storms, with a trend towards a more linear mode
anticipated thereafter. Damaging gusts are the more likely threat as
the line of storms moves into western Nebraska and far northwest
Kansas.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 65
statute miles north and south of a line from 25 miles south
southwest of Cheyenne WY to Mccook NE. For a complete depiction of
the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 610...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27035.

...Mosier

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 PM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024

Emilia's cloud pattern has become a little ragged-looking since 
earlier today, and the low-level center appears to be located near 
the northern edge of the main area of deep convection.  The storm's 
circulation has been interacting with Fabio, which is rotating 
around the western side of Emilia while dissipating.  Emilia is 
expected to absorb the remnant disturbance of Fabio within the next 
day or so.  The current intensity is set at 55 kt based on a blend 
of subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB.  This is 
also within the range of various objective intensity estimates from 
UW-CIMSS.

The system appears to be continuing on a generally northwestward 
track, with an initial motion estimate of 305/16 kt.  The steering 
flow associated with a mid-level ridge to the north of Emilia is 
likely to cause a generally west-northwestward motion for the next 
few days.  The official forecast track lies roughly in the middle 
of the track guidance suite.

Although the vertical shear over Emilia is expected to remain fairly 
low, The cyclone will be traversing progressively cooler waters 
during the next 48 hours or so.  Low- to mid-level relative humidity 
is also forecast to decrease during this period as well.  Therefore, 
gradual weakening is anticipated during the next couple of days and 
Emilia should become a post-tropical remnant low on Friday.  This is 
similar to the scenario shown by the previous official forecast.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Fabio Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 PM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
This afternoon's satellite presentation shows that Fabio has 
succumbed to the increasingly harsh surrounding environment.  Only a 
poorly defined surface circulation of low cloud elements is what 
remains of the tropical cyclone.  Therefore, Fabio no longer meets 
the definition of a tropical cyclone, and this will be the last NHC 
advisory.  The post-tropical cyclone's initial intensity is reduced 
to 35 kt, based on the TAFB and SAB satellite intensity estimates.  
Further weakening is forecast in the short term before merging with 
Emilia on Thursday.
 
Fabio's initial motion is estimated to be southwestward or
225/14 kt and this general motion is expected to continue through
tonight, while it moves around the western periphery of Emilia's
circulation and eventually merges with Emilia on Thursday, or
sooner.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical cyclone please see
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under
AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN03 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Wed Aug 07 2024

Valid 072000Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL PLAINS...AND COASTAL NC/SC....

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms capable of damaging gusts are
possible across the central High Plains this afternoon and evening.
A few tornadoes remain possible today and tonight across the coastal
Carolinas.

The only change for this outlook update is to add a small area of
SLGT risk for parts of coastal NC/SC.  Isolated tornadoes have
occurred this afternoon over parts of these areas, and the potential
exists for further development of semi-discrete cells offshore that
rotate inland.  Shear profiles remain sufficiently strong to support
further tornado risk.  Please refer to MCD #1858 and WW #610 for
further details.

..Hart.. 08/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1121 AM CDT Wed Aug 07 2024/

...Synopsis...
Expansive upper ridging will continue across the Southeast and
southern Plains today, although some dampening is possible along its
northern/northeastern periphery. This dampening will occur as a
series of shortwave troughs rotate through the base of the upper
troughing extending from the Hudson Bay into the Pacific Northwest.
Lead shortwave trough in this series is currently moving across the
northern Plains, with another shortwave farther west across the
northern Rockies. Eastward progression of the lead shortwave trough
will encourage an associated eastward/southeastward push of the cold
front that currently extends from far northwestern Ontario into
east-central WY. Thunderstorm development is anticipated along this
front from the eastern Dakotas and MN into NE. Low-level upslope
flow into the central High Plains will also support thunderstorms
ahead of this cold front from southwest WY/eastern CO into the
central Plains.

Farther east, Tropical Storm Debby remain centered off the SC Coast.
Steering currents remain weak in its vicinity, with only modest
northwesterly progress anticipated throughout much of the period.
See latest NHC advisories for track/intensity forecasts for Debby,
as well as tropical watches/warnings.

...Central High Plains/Central Plains...
Southeasterly low-level, upslope flow will help maintain at least
moderate low-level moisture amid strong boundary-layer mixing this
afternoon across the central High Plains. General expectation is for
dewpoints to be in the mid/upper 50s by 21Z, which should be
sufficient for air mass destabilization as temperatures warm into
the mid 90s. Glancing ascent from the shortwave trough moving
through northern Rockies coupled with orographic effects is expected
to result in thunderstorm development across the high terrain, with
these storms then moving into the moderately buoyant and sheared
airmass downstream. Given the moderate shear (i.e. 0-6 around 40
kt), some more organized and persistent updrafts are possible. High
cloud bases and steep low-level lapse rates will also support strong
downdrafts with these more persistent storms. 

Given the close storm proximity and high coverage, there is some
chance for cold pool amalgamation, with resulting downstream
propagation into more of the central High Plains. Additionally,
interaction with the frontal boundary could augment updrafts while
also providing a corridor of greater severe-wind potential.
Potential for damaging gusts appears high enough to introduce a 15%
area from far northeast CO/NE Panhandle southeastward into southwest
NE and far northwest KS. Some isolated hail is possible, both with
initial development in the vicinity of the high terrain as well as
any post-frontal development across the central High Plains.
Isolated hail is also possible with any initial development along
the front farther east from far southwest MN/southeast SD into
central NE.

...Coastal Carolinas/TS Debby...
As mentioned in MCD #1857, the near-term tornado risk along the
coastal Carolinas associated with Debby is low, owing to limited
destabilization and poor low-level lapse rates. Even so, rain bands
will continue to wrap around the system throughout the day, and,
given the strong low-level shear in place, any deeper, more
persistent convective cores may be able to produce tornadoes. A
relatively greater (but still quite low) threat may be able to
develop across the Outer Banks vicinity if pockets of heating can
occur within any cloud breaks.  

As the system gradually moves northwestward tonight, the loss of
daytime heating suggests the tornado threat may become more confined
closer to the center of the system over coastal northeast SC and
coastal southern NC.

Mesoscale Discussion 1857
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1020 AM CDT Wed Aug 07 2024

Areas affected...portions of coastal North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 071520Z - 071745Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A brief tornado cannot be ruled out through early
afternoon. A WW issuance is not currently expected.

DISCUSSION...Tropical Storm Debby continues to meander off of the
coastline of the Carolinas as widespread rain/clouds from outer rain
bands continue to overspread inland areas. Regional VADs
(particularly LTX) depict sizable low-level hodographs and nearly
300 m2/s2 0-1 km SRH. However, despite mid to upper 70s F
contributing to over 1000 J/kg SB/MLCAPE, boundary-layer lapse rates
remains quite poor (both the 12Z MHX observed sounding and 15Z
mesoanalysis show 5 C/km in the 0-3 km layer). Given the favorable
low-level shear, a brief tornado cannot be completely ruled out,
especially over far southern NC, where some breaks in the clouds
were noted. Nonetheless, overall tornado coverage is expected to be
sparse, and a WW issuance is not currently anticipated.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
Fabio is barely a tropical cyclone this morning. Water vapor imagery
shows dry air wrapping into the circulation from the west, and
vertical wind shear associated with nearby Tropical Storm Emilia
continues to disrupt the convective organization of Fabio.
Currently, the storm is only producing small bursts of sheared
convection over 100 n mi to the northeast of its exposed low-level
center. A blend of the latest Dvorak current intensity estimates
from TAFB and SAB supports holding the initial intensity at 40 kt.
 
Passive microwave and proxy-visible satellite images indicate Fabio
is now moving south of due west (265/18 kt). This general motion
should continue through tonight while Fabio interacts with the outer
circulation of Emilia. The new NHC track forecast has been adjusted
to the south of the previous one based on recent motion trends.
Given the hostile environmental conditions described above, Fabio
appears unlikely to become better organized in the short term. The
NHC forecast shows Fabio becoming a post-tropical cyclone in 12 h
before merging with Emilia on Thursday.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
Conventional satellite imagery and a recent SSMI/S microwave 
overpass indicate that Emilia has become better organized this 
morning.  The northeasterly shear impeding the system's northeast 
quadrant has decreased, allowing for improved outflow aloft.  A 
Central Dense Overcast (CDO) with cloud tops of -88C has formed over 
the surface center, and the microwave image revealed a banding eye 
feature wrapping from the south side of the cyclone.  The satellite 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are 65 kt and 55 kt, 
respectively, and a recent SATCON analysis indicated 57 kt.  Based 
on a blend of these data, the initial intensity is raised to 60 kt.
 
Although the northeasterly deep-layer shear that has been inhibiting 
Emilia's growth has subsided, the cyclone is expected to move over 
decreasing oceanic surface temperatures later today while the 
thermodynamic environment becomes less conducive.  Therefore, 
weakening is expected to commence by Thursday morning.  By the 
48-hour period, Emilia should spin down and degenerate into a 
post-tropical remnant low, and this is in agreement with the 
deterministic models and the statistical hurricane intensity 
guidance.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 320/15 kt.  
A gradual turn to the west-northwest with a slower forward speed is 
expected on Thursday while the cyclone moves around the southwest 
periphery of a mid-tropospheric subtropical high.  Toward the end of 
the period, vertically shallow Emilia is expected to turn toward the 
west within the low-level trade wind flow and eventually open up 
into a trough around day 5.  Only slight along-track adjustments 
were made to this forecast, closely following the various consensus 
aids.

Mesoscale Discussion 1842
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0959 AM CDT Tue Aug 06 2024

Areas affected...portions of northeast Ohio into central
Pennsylvania

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 061459Z - 061630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe threat should increase through early afternoon.
Multiple rounds of storms are possible, with damaging gusts as the
main threat, though a couple of tornadoes are also possible. A WW
issuance will eventually be needed.

DISCUSSION...Multiple rounds of thunderstorms are percolating in
intensity as they traverse a pronounced west-to-east oriented
baroclinic boundary positioned from eastern OH into central PA. With
continued surface heating and the approach of a 500 mb vort max over
the Great Lakes, storms should continue to increase in coverage and
intensity into early afternoon. 40+ kts of effective bulk shear,
driven by strengthening 700-500 mb flow approaching from the west,
will support organized updrafts amid 1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE. More
discrete storms could become supercellular, posing the threat for
damaging gusts and perhaps a couple of tornadoes or instances of
large hail. It is also possible that an MCS (perhaps even a bow
echo) could develop over central PA later today, which could support
a corridor of narrow but focused damaging gusts along the baroclinic
boundary. 

A WW issuance will likely be needed in the next couple of hours to
address the increasing severe threat.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM MST Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Fabio has remained steady this morning despite its close proximity 
to Tropical Storm Emilia. Cold cloud-top temperatures associated 
with the central dense overcast area that developed overnight have 
persisted this morning. Further, subjective and objective intensity 
estimates from TAFB and UW-CIMSS continue to suggest that Fabio is 
holding its own. Based on these estimates and recent satellite 
trends, the initial intensity estimate is held steady at 55 kt.

Fabio's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward or
300/15 kt. Uncertainty remains among the track guidance solutions, 
particularly related to the interaction between Fabio and Emilia. 
The current forecast favors the ECMWF solution that Emilia will 
absorb Fabio, and the current forecast shows this merger occurring 
in about 36 hours. However, the GFS shows two cyclones that remain 
distinct and rotate around each other during the next three to four 
days.  The current forecast leans toward a merger and is similar to 
the prior advisory and better-performing consensus aids.

While Fabio remains in a favorable shear and thermodynamic 
environment, the proximity to Emilia should preclude significant 
strengthening.  The new NHC intensity forecast now shows Fabio 
remaining steady for the next 24 h before weakening slightly and 
subsequently merging into Emilia. This is close to the IVCN and 
HCCA consensus aids. However, based on the divergent solutions in 
the global models, a change in the forecast philosophy could be
required in subsequent advisories.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM PDT Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Following a burst of deep convection near the center of circulation 
overnight, Emilia has remained steady this morning. Scatterometer 
data overnight showed a well-organized circulation, and a 
combination of subjective Dvorak estimates and objective intensity 
estimates indicate that the intensity has not changed much since 
the prior advisory. Thus, the intensity is held at 55 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Emilia has begun a turn toward the west-northwest, but the 
motion remains an uncertain 300/5 kt. Emilia and Tropical 
Storm Fabio are in the midst of a complex interaction, which will 
determine the fate of both storms. The systems are forecast to 
rotate slightly around each other, prior to Emilia becoming the 
dominant storm. Of note is that the global GFS and ECMWF ensemble 
systems show different solutions, with the GFS solution keeping 
Emilia and Fabio more distinct. The current advisory leans toward 
Emilia becoming dominant, absorbing Fabio, and turning westward over 
the next several days. The current forecast is similar to the prior 
forecast and near the consensus models.
 
The interaction with Fabio makes the intensity forecast 
challenging. The current forecast favors the solution in which 
Emilia absorbs Fabio in a few days. Thus, steady intensification is 
forecast over the next 24 h, with Emilia reaching hurricane 
strength on Wednesday.  While the timing of the merger is uncertain, 
the storm is forecast to gradually weaken into a remnant low by the 
end of the forecast period as it moves over cooler ocean waters and 
into a generally less favorable environment.  Due to the 
uncertainty associated with the interaction with Tropical Storm 
Fabio, changes to Emilia's forecast could be necessary in later 
advisory packages.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 604
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
805 AM EDT Tue Aug 6 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Extreme northeastern Indiana
  Southern Lower Michigan
  Northwestern Ohio
  Lake Erie

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 805 AM until
  300 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A small cluster of thunderstorms -- including a strong
supercell that has intensified over southwestern Lower MI, should
move east-southeastward along a baroclinic zone through the
remainder of the morning.  This environment will maintain enough
vertical shear for tornado potential, as well as some potential
increase in instability.  Upscale growth into a damaging-wind-
producing bow or cluster also is possible.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 30 statute miles
north and south of a line from 15 miles southwest of Kalamazoo MI to
45 miles east of Toledo OH. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 603...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 28030.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 603
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
655 AM EDT Tue Aug 6 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeastern North Carolina
  Eastern South Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 655 AM until
  500 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible

SUMMARY...As T.S. Debby moves slowly northeastward (per NHC
forecasts), the threat for a few tornadoes should persist and shift
across the watch area into more of eastern SC and adjoining coastal
NC.  Instability will be greatest near the coast, supporting
occasional supercells with a tornado threat.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 30 statute miles
either side of a line from 25 miles west of Charleston SC to 70
miles northeast of Myrtle Beach SC. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...This tornado watch replaces tornado
watch number 602. Watch number 602 will not be in effect after
655 AM EDT. 

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 13035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1831
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0659 PM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Areas affected...southern Minnesota

Concerning...Tornado Watch 600...

Valid 052359Z - 060100Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 600 continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado risk continues within WW600. Localized damaging
wind threat may increase in the next hour.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of supercells is currently moving
southeastward across portions of southern MN. These cells have a
history of producing tornadoes and large hail (up to 1.5 inches in
diameter). The risk for tornadoes will continue in the short term
with these cells, with MPX VAD indicating 0-3 km SRH 430 m2/s2.
These cells are also producing very heavy precipitation, with the
potential for evaporative cooling and strong outflow winds
increasing as cells evolve into a more linear mode. Isolated
damaging gusts 65-80 mph are possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 600
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
525 PM CDT Mon Aug 5 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Northern Iowa
  Southern Minnesota
  Southwest Wisconsin

* Effective this Monday afternoon from 525 PM until Midnight CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are forecast to intensify this evening with
several supercells expected to evolve from the initial thunderstorm
activity over southern Minnesota.  A tornado risk may accompany any
established and mature supercell.  The risk for large to very large
hail (1 to 2.5 inches in diameter) and severe gusts (60-70 mph) will
also increase this evening.  Upscale growth into a linear cluster is
forecast later this evening with the severe threat transitioning to
mainly a wind risk, with perhaps a lingering tornado threat.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 50 statute miles
north and south of a line from 45 miles north northwest of Spencer
IA to 45 miles north northeast of Dubuque IA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 597...WW 598...WW 599...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 29030.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 601
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 PM CDT Mon Aug 5 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Illinois
  Northwest Indiana
  Southern Wisconsin

* Effective this Monday afternoon from 550 PM until Midnight CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Isolated to scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are
forecast this evening.  A few of the stronger storms may evolve into
supercells posing a risk for large hail (1 to 1.5 inches in
diameter), severe gusts, and perhaps a tornado.  Strong to severe
multicells are forecast near the Indiana and Illinois border this
evening.  A localized risk for hail and wind may accompany these
storms.  By later this evening, other storms may develop and move
into western parts of the Watch and yield a threat for locally
damaging gusts and perhaps large hail.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles north and south of a line from 70 miles west northwest
of Rockford IL to 85 miles east southeast of Marseilles IL. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 PM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Satellite imagery shows that the low-level center of Fabio is on 
the north side of an area of strong, but loosely curved, convective 
bands.  Scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar data received 
since the last advisory indicate that the circulation is closed and 
that the maximum winds are near 35 kt in the eastern semicircle.  
This is in good agreement with satellite intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB, and it is the initial intensity for this advisory.

The initial motion is now 310/13 kt.  Fabio's motion should be 
dominated by interaction with Tropical Storm Emilia to the 
west-southwest, with Fabio expected to move northwestward and 
westward at an increased forward speed around the north side of 
Emilia for the next 36-48 h.  The new forecast track has only 
minor changes from the previous track.

Some strengthening should occur in the next 12 h or so.  After 
that, the intensity forecast is mainly based on the global model 
forecasts that Fabio will wind up being absorbed into Emilia, with 
the various model times of this absorption being between 12-36 h.  
The official forecast shows Fabio dissipating between 36-48 h in 
best agreement with the GFS model.  However, the cyclone could 
dissipate at any time before then.  Confidence in this forecast is 
increasing due to the more consistent global model solutions that 
Emilia will absorb Fabio.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
Issued by NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Carlotta continues to struggle within hostile environmental
conditions, with sea surface temperatures below 25C and significant
vertical shear. The center of the tropical cyclone is fully exposed,
with the remaining deep convection confined to an outer rainband in
its northern quadrant. The TAFB intensity estimate was 35 kt, CIMSS
ADT was 25 kt, and CIMSS AiDT was 32 kt. The initial intensity for
this advisory is a conservative 35 kt.
 
Carlotta should continue to spin down as it moves over cool sea 
surface temperatures and remains within significant vertical shear. 
If current trends continue, and persistent deep convection does not 
redevelop, post-tropical cyclone status will occur soon.
 
The initial motion for Carlotta is 280/7 kt. This general motion
should continue for the rest of today, then should turn toward the
west-southwest as Carlotta's circulation becomes increasingly
shallow. This scenario is consistent with the objective aids. The
forecast track for this advisory reflects a slight northward
adjustment from the previous advisory and is close to the dynamical
consensus.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 PM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Satellite imagery shows that Emilia remains a sheared cyclone this
afternoon, with the low-level center still located near the
northeastern edge of a large convective mass with cloud tops to
near -80C.  A recent ASCAT overpass showed winds of 40+ kt in the
southern semicircle, while the various subjective and objective
satellite intensity estimates remain in the 35-40 kt range.  Based
on the scatterometer data, the initial intensity is increased to  
45 kt.  The initial wind radii were adjusted based on the ASCAT 
data.
 
The latest global model runs continue to forecast that Emilia will
be the survivor in its interaction with the Tropical Storm Fabio to
the east, and the intensity forecast is based on this scenario and
the expectation of continued moderate easterly shear. The forecast
follows the trend of the intensity guidance and now forecasts a
peak intensity of 55 kt in 36 h.  After that time, although the
shear is forecast to decrease, Emilia is expected to slowly weaken
as it moves over decreasing sea surface temperatures.  The new
forecast is again an update of the previous forecast.  Confidence
in this forecast is increasing due to the more consistent model
guidance that Emilia will absorb Fabio and not the other way around.
 
The interaction with Fabio should steer Emilia southward for the
next 12 h or so.  After that, a turn toward the northwest or
north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is expected as
Emilia starts to absorb Fabio.  After Fabio dissipates in about 48
h, Emilia should generally move west-northwestward on the south
side of a low- to mid-level ridge to the north, with this general
motion expected for the remainder of the forecast period.  The new
forecast track has only minor changes from the previous track.

Tropical Depression Daniel Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
A recent ASCAT-B pass over Daniel this afternoon revealed that
Daniel barely has a closed circulation and its maximum winds
have decreased to 30 kt, making Daniel a tropical depression.
Daniel's convective organization is also lacking, but it has
produced persistent deep convection over its center for the past
several hours.
 
Little change was made to the NHC forecast. Daniel should 
weaken and wrap cyclonically around the larger and more robust 
circulation of Carlotta during the next couple of days. Global 
models indicate that Daniel could open into a trough at any time, 
Even if it maintains its circulation, its unlikely to maintain its 
organized deep convection beyond tonight. Therefore the largest 
change in the NHC forecast is to show Daniel becoming a remnant low 
tonight or early tomorrow and dissipating soon after that.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Satellite imagery shows that Emilia remains a sheared cyclone this 
morning, with the low-level center located near the northeastern 
edge of a large convective mass with cloud tops to near -85C.  The 
various subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
nudged upward to the 35-40 kt range, and the initial intensity is 
set at 40 kt.

The latest global model runs continue to suggest that Emilia will be 
the survivor in interaction with the newly formed Tropical Storm 
Fabio to the east, and the intensity forecast is based on this 
scenario and the expectation of continued moderate easterly shear.  
The forecast follows the trend of the intensity guidance and 
forecasts a peak intensity of 60 kt in 48 h.  After that time, 
Emilia is expected to slowly weaken as it moves over decreasing sea 
surface temperatures.  The new forecast is basically an update of 
the previous forecast.  It should be noted that this forecast is low 
confidence due to the possibility that Fabio might still end up as 
the dominant cyclone.

Interaction with Fabio should steer Emilia south-southwestward to 
southward for the next 12 h or so.  After that, a turn toward the 
northwest or north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is 
expected as Emilia start to absorb Fabio.  After Fabio dissipates in 
about 60 h, Emilia should generally move west-northwestward on the 
south side of a low- to mid-level ridge to the north.  The first 96 
h of the forecast track have been adjusted somewhat based on the GFS 
and Canadian model forecasts of the interaction between Emilia and 
Fabio.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Satellite imagery this morning indicates that the disturbance 
located well southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico has 
continued to become better organized, and that it now has sufficient 
convection and a well-enough defined circulation to be considered a 
tropical cyclone.  With an initial intensity of 35 kt based on 
earlier scatterometer data, advisories are being initiated on 
Tropical Storm Fabio.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 310/10.  Fabio's motion 
should be dominated by interaction with Tropical Storm Emilia to 
the west, with Fabio expected to move northwestward and westward at 
an increased forward speed around the north side of Emilia through 
the next 48 h.  

The intensity forecast is based on the global model forecasts 
that Fabio will wind up being absorbed into Emilia in the not 
too distant future.  Some strengthening is expected during the next 
12-24 h.  After that, the global models are forecasting that Fabio 
will dissipate as it is absorbed into Emilia by the 60 h point.  
The intensity forecast and dissipation time lean toward the GFS and 
Canadian model solutions, which keep Fabio separate from Emilia 
through about 48 h.  This forecast is low confidence due to the 
possibility that Fabio could try to absorb Emilia.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Daniel's organization continues to decrease, and it has become 
difficult to distinguish Daniel from the surrounding ITCZ/Monsoon 
Trough convection. Subjective and objective intensity estimates 
vary around 30-35 kt, so the initial intensity remains 35 kt 
for this advisory. 

It is very hard to determine how well-defined Daniel's surface 
circulation is, so its possible that the cyclone is already near 
dissipation, but this will be easier to determine after the sun has 
been up over Daniel for longer. Regardless, the system should not 
be around as a tropical cyclone for much longer as it is quickly 
moving into a more hostile environment. Some intensity models, 
including the GFS, indicate Daniel could dissipate as soon as 
this afternoon. Even if it maintains its circulation for a few 
days, all models suggest it will lose deep convection by tomorrow 
evening and become a remnant low.

Daniel has accelerated slightly toward the east-northeast, and 
should continue heading in that direction today, within low- to 
mid-level southwesterly monsoonal flow. After that, dynamical models 
continue to indicate that Daniel or its remnants will bend 
northward, and then westward, around the outer circulation of 
Carlotta. The NHC forecast continues to closely follow the consensus 
models and is very similar to the previous advisory.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

If not for a recent small burst of convection nearly 60 n mi from 
its center, Carlotta would be devoid of organized deep convection. 
The intensity estimate remains 40 kt, close to a recent UW-CIMSS 
SATCON estimate. Deep convection may persist today, but could cease 
at just about any time due to cold waters beneath Carlotta and a 
surounding dry and stable environment. By this time tomorrow, 
Carlotta should be a post-tropical cyclone.

Carlotta's initial motion remains 280/8kt. This general motion 
should continue today as long as Carlotta maintains some deep 
convection. A slight left turn toward the west-southwest should 
begin once the last of Carlotta's convection is gone. No significant 
changes were made to the NHC track or intensity forecasts.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 596
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
555 AM EDT Mon Aug 5 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and northern Florida
  Southeastern Georgia
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Monday morning and afternoon from 555 AM until
  400 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible

SUMMARY...Per NHC forecasts, Hurricane Debby should move slowly
northeastward/inland after landfall, to near the FL/GA line during
the duration of this watch.  Associated tornado potential -- mainly
northeast through southeast of center -- should spread over the
watch area and across more of northern FL and southeastern GA
through early/mid afternoon.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 50 statute miles
east and west of a line from 50 miles east southeast of Saint
Petersburg FL to 50 miles north of Brunswick GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...This tornado watch replaces tornado
watch number 595. Watch number 595 will not be in effect after
555 AM EDT. 

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 18035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1815
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1247 PM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Areas affected...much of the Florida Peninsula and far southern
Georgia

Concerning...Tornado Watch 594...

Valid 041747Z - 041945Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 594 continues.

SUMMARY...Mini supercells within the outer bands of intensifying TC
Debby will remain capable of tornadoes this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...As of 1745 UTC, the latest NHC Aircraft recon fixed the
low-level center of TS Debby near 27.0 N, 84.3 W. As the TC
continues to deepen, low-level hodograph expansion has been noted at
most of the radar sites east/northeast of the center. A few
tornadoes are possible with miniature supercells embedded within the
spiral rain bands as they move ashore into moderate low-level SRH.
Stronger low-level mesocyclones within the most westward band have
moved offshore over the past few hours, but a new band developing to
the east has shown some stronger convective development recently. As
low-level shear continues to intensify, tornado potential should
increase, especially where low-level flow is more backed. Warmer
surface temperatures to the north of the main cloud shield may also
support more intense convection and a locally greater tornado or
damaging gust risk this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1814
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1234 PM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Areas affected...far northern New York eastward into Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041734Z - 042000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Some storms may produce localized hail, primarily at or
below severe levels, over the next several hours.

DISCUSSION...On the periphery of an upper trough over Quebec,
relatively cool midlevel temperatures extend southward into parts of
New England. Daytime heating near a surface trough and also north of
a more extensive cirrus shield is resulting in moderate
destabilization from northern NY eastward into parts of ME.

Wind profiles do not favor particularly organized storms, as winds
below 500 mb are weak. However, stronger speeds exist in the upper
levels which may aid venting somewhat.

Overall, it appears that short-lived, strong storm cores capable of
marginally severe hail will be the primary risk with these cells
over the next few hours as they travel east/southeast across the
narrow instability zone.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Carlotta's deep convection has become quite limited this
morning. Subjective Dvorak and objective satellite estimates like
the UW-CIMSS ADT are all decreasing, and support an initial
intensity estimate of 55 kt. No changes of note were made to the NHC
forecast, and further weakening should continue as Carlotta moves
over SSTs that are already below 25 deg C. The SSTs will only get
colder during the next couple of days as Carlotta moves along the
forecast track. The tropical storm is forecast by most models to
lose its remaining deep convection in about 48 h, and based on
current trends this could occur even sooner. Dissipation is still
expected around mid-week.
 
The tropical storm is still moving westward to west-northwestward. 
This general motion should continue for the next day or two as 
Carlotta is steered by a deep-layer ridge centered well to its 
northeast. As the cyclone weakens further and becomes more 
vertically shallow, low-level steering will likely cause it to turn 
westward and slow down slightly in a couple of days.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Daniel's convective structure continues to sputter along, with the 
coldest cloud tops organized in two regions to the northeast and 
southwest of the center, which appears to be mostly exposed this 
morning. The latest round of both subjective and objective intensity 
guidance has not changed much from overnight, and so the initial 
intensity remains 35 kt this advisory. 

It appears that the tropical storm is finally starting to track more 
north-northeastward this morning, with the estimated motion at 030/4 
kt. A somewhat faster northeastward motion is expected to begin 
later today through Monday as Daniel's motion is influenced by the 
southwesterly monsoonal flow being picked up by Carlotta passing to 
the north. The global models still show a turn north and 
northwestward as Daniel gets caught in the outer periphery  of 
Carlotta's larger circulation. The NHC track forecast is quite 
similar to the prior advisory, close to the multi-model consensus. 
 
While the vertical wind shear that was previously affecting Daniel 
is starting to subside, there is quite a bit of environmental dry 
air to the north of the storm, which will likely keep it in check, 
and only a modest amount of intensification is forecasted. After 48 
h, this dry air is expected to fully envelop the circulation, 
choking off the remaining convection, marking the storm's transition 
to a post-tropical remnant low. The low is finally forecast to open 
up into a trough by midweek.

Tropical Depression Five-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM MST Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Convection associated with a low located well offshore Mexico has 
steadily increased in coverage and organization since yesterday. 
Overnight ASCAT and first-light visible imagery indicate that the 
cyclone also has a well-defined, if somewhat broad, circulation. 
Subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB were both 2.0 
at 1200 UTC, which support initiating advisories on the system as a 
30 kt depression.

The depression is located within a very convectively active 
environment over the east Pacific, deep-layer wind shear is low, and 
SSTs are plenty warm, so strengthening is expected in the short 
term. The biggest source of uncertainty for this forecast is an 
expected interaction with a larger disturbance, currently Invest 
96E, which is approaching from the east. Based on the available 
global and hurricane dynamical model forecasts, the most likely 
scenario is that 96E will be the dominant system. In that case, the 
new depression will only have a short window to strengthen before it 
is wrapped into and dissipates within the other circulation. Models 
historically handle interaction cases like this poorly, so 
confidence in the forecast is not high, despite the near universal 
agreement between the dynamical guidance on this upcoming evolution.

The NHC forecast is very close to the consensus guidance through 24 
to 36 h.  After that, the model trackers appear to be getting fooled 
by the close proximity of 96E and TD Five-E and are following the 
stronger vortex instead. The NHC forecast is based heavily on a 
broad consensus of model fields beyond 36 h and shows dissipation 
occuring by 60 h.  There is some chance that the depression could 
persist longer than forecast if the two systems remain farther 
apart, however there is not enough guidance with a trackable vortex 
to justify an explicit forecast beyond what is currently shown.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Five-E
was located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 112.9 West. The
depression is nearly stationary, but a slow generally southward 
motion is expected to begin later today and continue into Monday. A 
sharp turn back toward the north is possible by Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Slow strengthening is expected today and the system is forecast to 
become a tropical storm tonight. The cyclone will then begin to 
interact with another larger disturbance approaching from the east, 
which is expected to cause this system to dissipate in a few days.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
