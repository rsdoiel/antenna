Mesoscale Discussion 1857
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1020 AM CDT Wed Aug 07 2024

Areas affected...portions of coastal North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 071520Z - 071745Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A brief tornado cannot be ruled out through early
afternoon. A WW issuance is not currently expected.

DISCUSSION...Tropical Storm Debby continues to meander off of the
coastline of the Carolinas as widespread rain/clouds from outer rain
bands continue to overspread inland areas. Regional VADs
(particularly LTX) depict sizable low-level hodographs and nearly
300 m2/s2 0-1 km SRH. However, despite mid to upper 70s F
contributing to over 1000 J/kg SB/MLCAPE, boundary-layer lapse rates
remains quite poor (both the 12Z MHX observed sounding and 15Z
mesoanalysis show 5 C/km in the 0-3 km layer). Given the favorable
low-level shear, a brief tornado cannot be completely ruled out,
especially over far southern NC, where some breaks in the clouds
were noted. Nonetheless, overall tornado coverage is expected to be
sparse, and a WW issuance is not currently anticipated.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
Fabio is barely a tropical cyclone this morning. Water vapor imagery
shows dry air wrapping into the circulation from the west, and
vertical wind shear associated with nearby Tropical Storm Emilia
continues to disrupt the convective organization of Fabio.
Currently, the storm is only producing small bursts of sheared
convection over 100 n mi to the northeast of its exposed low-level
center. A blend of the latest Dvorak current intensity estimates
from TAFB and SAB supports holding the initial intensity at 40 kt.
 
Passive microwave and proxy-visible satellite images indicate Fabio
is now moving south of due west (265/18 kt). This general motion
should continue through tonight while Fabio interacts with the outer
circulation of Emilia. The new NHC track forecast has been adjusted
to the south of the previous one based on recent motion trends.
Given the hostile environmental conditions described above, Fabio
appears unlikely to become better organized in the short term. The
NHC forecast shows Fabio becoming a post-tropical cyclone in 12 h
before merging with Emilia on Thursday.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM PDT Wed Aug 07 2024
 
Conventional satellite imagery and a recent SSMI/S microwave 
overpass indicate that Emilia has become better organized this 
morning.  The northeasterly shear impeding the system's northeast 
quadrant has decreased, allowing for improved outflow aloft.  A 
Central Dense Overcast (CDO) with cloud tops of -88C has formed over 
the surface center, and the microwave image revealed a banding eye 
feature wrapping from the south side of the cyclone.  The satellite 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are 65 kt and 55 kt, 
respectively, and a recent SATCON analysis indicated 57 kt.  Based 
on a blend of these data, the initial intensity is raised to 60 kt.
 
Although the northeasterly deep-layer shear that has been inhibiting 
Emilia's growth has subsided, the cyclone is expected to move over 
decreasing oceanic surface temperatures later today while the 
thermodynamic environment becomes less conducive.  Therefore, 
weakening is expected to commence by Thursday morning.  By the 
48-hour period, Emilia should spin down and degenerate into a 
post-tropical remnant low, and this is in agreement with the 
deterministic models and the statistical hurricane intensity 
guidance.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 320/15 kt.  
A gradual turn to the west-northwest with a slower forward speed is 
expected on Thursday while the cyclone moves around the southwest 
periphery of a mid-tropospheric subtropical high.  Toward the end of 
the period, vertically shallow Emilia is expected to turn toward the 
west within the low-level trade wind flow and eventually open up 
into a trough around day 5.  Only slight along-track adjustments 
were made to this forecast, closely following the various consensus 
aids.

0747 AM CDT Wed Aug 07 2024

Valid 071300Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL GREAT PLAINS AND COASTAL CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Marginal severe-weather potential is apparent over parts of the
central Great Plains and coastal Carolinas.

...Synopsis...
The persistent western CONUS anticyclone will contract through the
period and shift westward across the southern Great Basin, in
response to both infusions of positive vorticity in its eastern
semicircle, and more strongly, amplification/progression of a
northern-stream synoptic trough over western/central Canada.  That
trough -- evident in moisture-channel imagery from a low over
north-central MB west-southwestward across the Canadian Rockies --
will move southward through the period.  By 12Z tomorrow, the 500-mb
low should cross the remainder of central/southern MB to near the
eastern ND/MB border.  Associated height falls and cyclonic flow
aloft will spread southward over the northern Plains today, to the
central Plains late tonight.  

Downstream, the northern-stream flow will flatten to a more-zonal
configuration through the period, across the Upper Great Lakes, the
St. Lawrence Valley and northern New England.  This temporarily
maintains a dearth of steering flow near T.S. Debby, with weak
poleward/inland motion forecast by NHC through 12Z tomorrow.  
See latest NHC advisories for track/intensity forecasts for Debby,
as well as tropical watches/warnings.  

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a wavy, quasistationary to
slowly moving cold front from southern New England coastal waters
westward over northeastern PA, then southwestward through a low near
HTS, becoming a cold front over central KY to northeastern OK,
through a low near LTS, then quasistationary again northwestward to
a weak low over southeastern CO.  The boundary should continue
southward across parts of KY, TN, northern MS and AR, amidst broader
northerlies extending westward from the circulation of T.S. Debby. 
A separate cold front -- related to the northern-stream perturbation
over Canada -- was drawn from southeastern MB to near a BIS-RAP-RWL
line.  By 00Z, this front should extend from western parts of
northwestern ON southwestward over northern MN, eastern SD, central
NE, and northeastern CO.  By 12Z tomorrow, the front should reach
western parts of Lake Superior and WI, then southwestward over
western IA, southeastern NE, southwestern KS, and northeastern NM. 

...Central Great Plains...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are forecast to form
this afternoon and evening -- mainly on the cold front over NE and
southeastern SD, and over higher elevations of southeastern WY and
north-central/northeastern CO behind the front.  Activity will pose
a threat for isolated large hail and severe gusts before weakening
overnight.  

Once an area of clouds and precip now over southern SD and northern
NE exits the area, afternoon destabilization should reduce
EML-related CINH ahead of the front through the afternoon, with
frontal lift expected to be strong enough to break the cap in a few
spots by late afternoon.  Surface dewpoints in the upper 50s to low
60s F (locally higher) will contribute to a prefrontal plume of
1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE that will narrow with northeastward extent
into lower antecedent theta-e.  The southern fringe of falls and a
tightening gradient of heights aloft will extend across parts of
this area from late afternoon onward as well, contributing to
favorable deep shear for some storm organization and isolated
supercell potential -- with effective-shear magnitudes generally
35-45 kt.  Stronger veering with height -- but somewhat weaker
mid/upper flow -- will characterize the post-frontal upslope regime,
with elongated, nearly straight hodographs and similar bulk-shear
values.  Well-mixed subcloud layers will support gust potential,
which may become concentrated on the mesobeta scale where any
upscale clustering and cold-pool development can occur (most
probable with activity initiated in the higher elevations). 

...T.S. Debby -- Coastal Carolinas...
As Debby gradually turns and moves northward to northwestward, only
a slow corresponding shift of the tornado potential will occur. 
Inland destabilization is expected to be minimal, owing to extensive
cloud cover and areas of precip north of center, and acting as a
northern/northwestern limiter to the threat.  Meanwhile the skeletal
to almost nonexistent core convective structure and weaker shear
will minimize potential closer to center.  This leaves a segment of
eastern NC near the sounds and Outer Banks today and tonight, as
well as perhaps a small part of the adjoining SC coastal areas
today, with potential for isolated, mainly short-lived supercells in
the middle/outer bands.  While hodographs are not forecast to be
especially large, compared to many TC-tornado events, 150-250 J/kg
effective SRH for northwestward-moving cells has been present in VWP
hodographs and 6-hourly RAOBs, and should continue.  This will
overlap favorable buoyancy within roughly 75-100 nm inland of the
beaches in NC.  If a relatively concentrated area of sustained,
multiple supercell development or potential appears for a particular
band, a smaller area of greater probabilities may be added in a
subsequent outlook.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CDT Wed Aug 07 2024

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
A trough moving across the northern Rockies into the northern Plains
will suppress the western US ridge on Thursday. Flow aloft will
shift to become more northwesterly, with monsoonal moisture shifting
southward. Isolated dry thunderstorm chances will be possible along
the fringes of the deeper monsoonal moisture across southern/central
Utah into western Colorado and western Wyoming. In this region,
precipitable water values around 0.50-0.75 inch and mainly mid-level
moisture will result in high-based convection, with potential for
new ignitions amid receptive fuels, and little precipitation. Gusty
and erratic winds will be possible near thunderstorms.

Mesoscale Discussion 1842
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0959 AM CDT Tue Aug 06 2024

Areas affected...portions of northeast Ohio into central
Pennsylvania

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 061459Z - 061630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe threat should increase through early afternoon.
Multiple rounds of storms are possible, with damaging gusts as the
main threat, though a couple of tornadoes are also possible. A WW
issuance will eventually be needed.

DISCUSSION...Multiple rounds of thunderstorms are percolating in
intensity as they traverse a pronounced west-to-east oriented
baroclinic boundary positioned from eastern OH into central PA. With
continued surface heating and the approach of a 500 mb vort max over
the Great Lakes, storms should continue to increase in coverage and
intensity into early afternoon. 40+ kts of effective bulk shear,
driven by strengthening 700-500 mb flow approaching from the west,
will support organized updrafts amid 1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE. More
discrete storms could become supercellular, posing the threat for
damaging gusts and perhaps a couple of tornadoes or instances of
large hail. It is also possible that an MCS (perhaps even a bow
echo) could develop over central PA later today, which could support
a corridor of narrow but focused damaging gusts along the baroclinic
boundary. 

A WW issuance will likely be needed in the next couple of hours to
address the increasing severe threat.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM MST Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Fabio has remained steady this morning despite its close proximity 
to Tropical Storm Emilia. Cold cloud-top temperatures associated 
with the central dense overcast area that developed overnight have 
persisted this morning. Further, subjective and objective intensity 
estimates from TAFB and UW-CIMSS continue to suggest that Fabio is 
holding its own. Based on these estimates and recent satellite 
trends, the initial intensity estimate is held steady at 55 kt.

Fabio's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward or
300/15 kt. Uncertainty remains among the track guidance solutions, 
particularly related to the interaction between Fabio and Emilia. 
The current forecast favors the ECMWF solution that Emilia will 
absorb Fabio, and the current forecast shows this merger occurring 
in about 36 hours. However, the GFS shows two cyclones that remain 
distinct and rotate around each other during the next three to four 
days.  The current forecast leans toward a merger and is similar to 
the prior advisory and better-performing consensus aids.

While Fabio remains in a favorable shear and thermodynamic 
environment, the proximity to Emilia should preclude significant 
strengthening.  The new NHC intensity forecast now shows Fabio 
remaining steady for the next 24 h before weakening slightly and 
subsequently merging into Emilia. This is close to the IVCN and 
HCCA consensus aids. However, based on the divergent solutions in 
the global models, a change in the forecast philosophy could be
required in subsequent advisories.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM PDT Tue Aug 06 2024
 
Following a burst of deep convection near the center of circulation 
overnight, Emilia has remained steady this morning. Scatterometer 
data overnight showed a well-organized circulation, and a 
combination of subjective Dvorak estimates and objective intensity 
estimates indicate that the intensity has not changed much since 
the prior advisory. Thus, the intensity is held at 55 kt for this 
advisory.
 
Emilia has begun a turn toward the west-northwest, but the 
motion remains an uncertain 300/5 kt. Emilia and Tropical 
Storm Fabio are in the midst of a complex interaction, which will 
determine the fate of both storms. The systems are forecast to 
rotate slightly around each other, prior to Emilia becoming the 
dominant storm. Of note is that the global GFS and ECMWF ensemble 
systems show different solutions, with the GFS solution keeping 
Emilia and Fabio more distinct. The current advisory leans toward 
Emilia becoming dominant, absorbing Fabio, and turning westward over 
the next several days. The current forecast is similar to the prior 
forecast and near the consensus models.
 
The interaction with Fabio makes the intensity forecast 
challenging. The current forecast favors the solution in which 
Emilia absorbs Fabio in a few days. Thus, steady intensification is 
forecast over the next 24 h, with Emilia reaching hurricane 
strength on Wednesday.  While the timing of the merger is uncertain, 
the storm is forecast to gradually weaken into a remnant low by the 
end of the forecast period as it moves over cooler ocean waters and 
into a generally less favorable environment.  Due to the 
uncertainty associated with the interaction with Tropical Storm 
Fabio, changes to Emilia's forecast could be necessary in later 
advisory packages.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 604
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
805 AM EDT Tue Aug 6 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Extreme northeastern Indiana
  Southern Lower Michigan
  Northwestern Ohio
  Lake Erie

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 805 AM until
  300 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A small cluster of thunderstorms -- including a strong
supercell that has intensified over southwestern Lower MI, should
move east-southeastward along a baroclinic zone through the
remainder of the morning.  This environment will maintain enough
vertical shear for tornado potential, as well as some potential
increase in instability.  Upscale growth into a damaging-wind-
producing bow or cluster also is possible.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 30 statute miles
north and south of a line from 15 miles southwest of Kalamazoo MI to
45 miles east of Toledo OH. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 603...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 28030.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 603
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
655 AM EDT Tue Aug 6 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeastern North Carolina
  Eastern South Carolina
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Tuesday morning and afternoon from 655 AM until
  500 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible

SUMMARY...As T.S. Debby moves slowly northeastward (per NHC
forecasts), the threat for a few tornadoes should persist and shift
across the watch area into more of eastern SC and adjoining coastal
NC.  Instability will be greatest near the coast, supporting
occasional supercells with a tornado threat.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 30 statute miles
either side of a line from 25 miles west of Charleston SC to 70
miles northeast of Myrtle Beach SC. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...This tornado watch replaces tornado
watch number 602. Watch number 602 will not be in effect after
655 AM EDT. 

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 13035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1831
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0659 PM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Areas affected...southern Minnesota

Concerning...Tornado Watch 600...

Valid 052359Z - 060100Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 600 continues.

SUMMARY...Tornado risk continues within WW600. Localized damaging
wind threat may increase in the next hour.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of supercells is currently moving
southeastward across portions of southern MN. These cells have a
history of producing tornadoes and large hail (up to 1.5 inches in
diameter). The risk for tornadoes will continue in the short term
with these cells, with MPX VAD indicating 0-3 km SRH 430 m2/s2.
These cells are also producing very heavy precipitation, with the
potential for evaporative cooling and strong outflow winds
increasing as cells evolve into a more linear mode. Isolated
damaging gusts 65-80 mph are possible.

several supercells expected to evolve from the initial thunderstorm
activity over southern Minnesota.  A tornado risk may accompany any
established and mature supercell.  The risk for large to very large
hail (1 to 2.5 inches in diameter) and severe gusts (60-70 mph) will
also increase this evening.  Upscale growth into a linear cluster is
forecast later this evening with the severe threat transitioning to
mainly a wind risk, with perhaps a lingering tornado threat.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 50 statute miles
north and south of a line from 45 miles north northwest of Spencer
IA to 45 miles north northeast of Dubuque IA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 597...WW 598...WW 599...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 29030.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 601
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 PM CDT Mon Aug 5 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Illinois
  Northwest Indiana
  Southern Wisconsin

* Effective this Monday afternoon from 550 PM until Midnight CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Isolated to scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are
forecast this evening.  A few of the stronger storms may evolve into
supercells posing a risk for large hail (1 to 1.5 inches in
diameter), severe gusts, and perhaps a tornado.  Strong to severe
multicells are forecast near the Indiana and Illinois border this
evening.  A localized risk for hail and wind may accompany these
storms.  By later this evening, other storms may develop and move
into western parts of the Watch and yield a threat for locally
damaging gusts and perhaps large hail.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles north and south of a line from 70 miles west northwest
of Rockford IL to 85 miles east southeast of Marseilles IL. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0442 PM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Valid 071200Z - 131200Z

The extended period will be characterized primarily by modest
mid-level zonal flow across the Northwest and Northern Rockies, as
well as warming and drying across much of the Western U.S. beneath a
mid-level anticyclone centered over the Great Basin. Some chances
for isolated dry thunderstorms will exist early on in the forecast
period, but predictability of thunderstorm occurrence later on in
the period will be low. Mid-level zonal flow and a shortwave trough
are expected to bring dry and windy conditions to portions of the
Northwest by D6/Saturday.

...Dry Thunder...
Monsoonal moisture will persist over the Great Basin, resulting in
chances for dry thunderstorms across eastern UT, western CO, and far
southern WY on D3/Wednesday and D4/Thursday. By D4/Thursday, modest
PWAT values of 0.6-0.75 in will overspread portions of far eastern
Idaho into southern Montana, resulting in some chances for dry
thunderstorms further north into those regions. Some modification to
these areas may be needed due to wetting rainfall in the preceding
days. Dry thunderstorm chances could persist into D6/Saturday and
D7/Sunday, but predictability remains too low at this time to
highlight any specific areas. 

...Dry/Windy...
Modest zonal flow will support some Elevated to locally Critical
fire-weather conditions across the Snake River Plain in Idaho on
D3/Wednesday. Afterwards, flow will remain generally weak until
D6/Saturday, when Euro and GFS forecasts signal an intensification
of the geopotential height gradient over Idaho owing to an
approaching shortwave trough, increasing mid-level flow. Dry and
windy conditions beneath this enhanced flow could result in Critical
fire-weather conditions, and these conditions may persist into
D7/Sunday. However, uncertainties remain in the magnitude of the
flow and resulting surface winds, so highlights have been reserved
for D6/Saturday, where there is better agreement in critical
conditions.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
200 PM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Satellite imagery shows that the low-level center of Fabio is on 
the north side of an area of strong, but loosely curved, convective 
bands.  Scatterometer and synthetic aperture radar data received 
since the last advisory indicate that the circulation is closed and 
that the maximum winds are near 35 kt in the eastern semicircle.  
This is in good agreement with satellite intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB, and it is the initial intensity for this advisory.

The initial motion is now 310/13 kt.  Fabio's motion should be 
dominated by interaction with Tropical Storm Emilia to the 
west-southwest, with Fabio expected to move northwestward and 
westward at an increased forward speed around the north side of 
Emilia for the next 36-48 h.  The new forecast track has only 
minor changes from the previous track.

Some strengthening should occur in the next 12 h or so.  After 
that, the intensity forecast is mainly based on the global model 
forecasts that Fabio will wind up being absorbed into Emilia, with 
the various model times of this absorption being between 12-36 h.  
The official forecast shows Fabio dissipating between 36-48 h in 
best agreement with the GFS model.  However, the cyclone could 
dissipate at any time before then.  Confidence in this forecast is 
increasing due to the more consistent global model solutions that 
Emilia will absorb Fabio.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  22
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
Issued by NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Carlotta continues to struggle within hostile environmental
conditions, with sea surface temperatures below 25C and significant
vertical shear. The center of the tropical cyclone is fully exposed,
with the remaining deep convection confined to an outer rainband in
its northern quadrant. The TAFB intensity estimate was 35 kt, CIMSS
ADT was 25 kt, and CIMSS AiDT was 32 kt. The initial intensity for
this advisory is a conservative 35 kt.
 
Carlotta should continue to spin down as it moves over cool sea 
surface temperatures and remains within significant vertical shear. 
If current trends continue, and persistent deep convection does not 
redevelop, post-tropical cyclone status will occur soon.
 
The initial motion for Carlotta is 280/7 kt. This general motion
should continue for the rest of today, then should turn toward the
west-southwest as Carlotta's circulation becomes increasingly
shallow. This scenario is consistent with the objective aids. The
forecast track for this advisory reflects a slight northward
adjustment from the previous advisory and is close to the dynamical
consensus.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
200 PM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Satellite imagery shows that Emilia remains a sheared cyclone this
afternoon, with the low-level center still located near the
northeastern edge of a large convective mass with cloud tops to
near -80C.  A recent ASCAT overpass showed winds of 40+ kt in the
southern semicircle, while the various subjective and objective
satellite intensity estimates remain in the 35-40 kt range.  Based
on the scatterometer data, the initial intensity is increased to  
45 kt.  The initial wind radii were adjusted based on the ASCAT 
data.
 
The latest global model runs continue to forecast that Emilia will
be the survivor in its interaction with the Tropical Storm Fabio to
the east, and the intensity forecast is based on this scenario and
the expectation of continued moderate easterly shear. The forecast
follows the trend of the intensity guidance and now forecasts a
peak intensity of 55 kt in 36 h.  After that time, although the
shear is forecast to decrease, Emilia is expected to slowly weaken
as it moves over decreasing sea surface temperatures.  The new
forecast is again an update of the previous forecast.  Confidence
in this forecast is increasing due to the more consistent model
guidance that Emilia will absorb Fabio and not the other way around.
 
The interaction with Fabio should steer Emilia southward for the
next 12 h or so.  After that, a turn toward the northwest or
north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is expected as
Emilia starts to absorb Fabio.  After Fabio dissipates in about 48
h, Emilia should generally move west-northwestward on the south
side of a low- to mid-level ridge to the north, with this general
motion expected for the remainder of the forecast period.  The new
forecast track has only minor changes from the previous track.

Tropical Depression Daniel Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
A recent ASCAT-B pass over Daniel this afternoon revealed that
Daniel barely has a closed circulation and its maximum winds
have decreased to 30 kt, making Daniel a tropical depression.
Daniel's convective organization is also lacking, but it has
produced persistent deep convection over its center for the past
several hours.
 
Little change was made to the NHC forecast. Daniel should 
weaken and wrap cyclonically around the larger and more robust 
circulation of Carlotta during the next couple of days. Global 
models indicate that Daniel could open into a trough at any time, 
Even if it maintains its circulation, its unlikely to maintain its 
organized deep convection beyond tonight. Therefore the largest 
change in the NHC forecast is to show Daniel becoming a remnant low 
tonight or early tomorrow and dissipating soon after that.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024

Valid 052000Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM SOUTHERN
MINNESOTA INTO PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST...AND OVER A SMALL PART OF THE
COASTAL SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms remain possible today and tonight from the
Upper Ohio Valley into New England, across portions of the Upper
Midwest, and from northern Florida into southeast South Carolina.

Little overall change to the outlook at 20Z.

An expansive shield of heavy rain stretches from northern FL into SC
in association with Tropical Storm Debby. Low-level shear remains
favorable to support rotation within any stronger embedded cells,
and a brief tornado or two cannot be ruled out. For more information
see mesoscale discussion 1826.

A corridor of strong instability has developed from eastern SD into
northern IL. Storms may develop soon near the SD/MN border, with
east/southeastward development along a warm front. For more
information see mesoscale discussion 1827.

..Jewell.. 08/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1115 AM CDT Mon Aug 05 2024/

...FL/GA/SC...
TS Debby continues to track slowly northeastward across northern FL.
 Widespread clouds over the eastern semi-circle will suppress
heating/destabilization through the day, although recent trends
suggest some mid-level drying beginning to wrap around the south
side of the system.  Despite weak thermodynamics, overall shear
profiles are quite strong and would support a risk of a few
tornadoes through the afternoon and night.  The threat will spread
northeastward along the SC coast through the day as well.

...OH to New England...
Fast zonal flow is present today across the Great Lakes and
northeast states today, with a 70 knot mid-level jet max tracking
from eastern ONT into New England this evening.  A corridor of
mostly clear skies and strong heating is apparent from northern OH
into NY/PA and much of New England today, where afternoon MLCAPE
values will range from 1000-1500 J/kg.  Most 12z model guidance
continues to indicate widely scattered thunderstorms will develop in
this zone, with sufficient vertical shear for a few supercell or
small bowing structures.  Mid-level lapse rates are weak, but the
stronger storms may produce locally damaging winds and perhaps hail.

...MN/IA/WI/IL...
Latest surface analysis shows a low over southeast SD, with a warm
front extending east-southeastward from the low across central IA. 
Pockets of heating and ample low-level moisture on the north side of
the warm front are expected to result in scattered thunderstorms
(possibly surface-based) by mid-late afternoon over northwest
IA/southwest MN, with storms tracking southeastward along/north of
the front.  Large CAPE values, steep mid-level lapse rates, and
substantial vertical shear profiles will promote supercell storm
structures capable of large hail, damaging winds, and a tornado or
two.

...ID/MT...
Water vapor imagery shows a plume of mid-level moisture spreading
northward across ID, ahead of a pair of minor shortwave troughs
moving across NV/OR/WA.  This should lead to scattered high-based
showers and thunderstorms this afternoon across much of ID and
western MT.  Steep low and mid-level lapse rates will promote a risk
of locally damaging winds in the stronger cells this afternoon and
evening.

Tropical Storm Emilia Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024

Satellite imagery shows that Emilia remains a sheared cyclone this 
morning, with the low-level center located near the northeastern 
edge of a large convective mass with cloud tops to near -85C.  The 
various subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
nudged upward to the 35-40 kt range, and the initial intensity is 
set at 40 kt.

The latest global model runs continue to suggest that Emilia will be 
the survivor in interaction with the newly formed Tropical Storm 
Fabio to the east, and the intensity forecast is based on this 
scenario and the expectation of continued moderate easterly shear.  
The forecast follows the trend of the intensity guidance and 
forecasts a peak intensity of 60 kt in 48 h.  After that time, 
Emilia is expected to slowly weaken as it moves over decreasing sea 
surface temperatures.  The new forecast is basically an update of 
the previous forecast.  It should be noted that this forecast is low 
confidence due to the possibility that Fabio might still end up as 
the dominant cyclone.

Interaction with Fabio should steer Emilia south-southwestward to 
southward for the next 12 h or so.  After that, a turn toward the 
northwest or north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is 
expected as Emilia start to absorb Fabio.  After Fabio dissipates in 
about 60 h, Emilia should generally move west-northwestward on the 
south side of a low- to mid-level ridge to the north.  The first 96 
h of the forecast track have been adjusted somewhat based on the GFS 
and Canadian model forecasts of the interaction between Emilia and 
Fabio.

Tropical Storm Fabio Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062024
800 AM MST Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Satellite imagery this morning indicates that the disturbance 
located well southwest of the southwestern coast of Mexico has 
continued to become better organized, and that it now has sufficient 
convection and a well-enough defined circulation to be considered a 
tropical cyclone.  With an initial intensity of 35 kt based on 
earlier scatterometer data, advisories are being initiated on 
Tropical Storm Fabio.

The initial motion is a somewhat uncertain 310/10.  Fabio's motion 
should be dominated by interaction with Tropical Storm Emilia to 
the west, with Fabio expected to move northwestward and westward at 
an increased forward speed around the north side of Emilia through 
the next 48 h.  

The intensity forecast is based on the global model forecasts 
that Fabio will wind up being absorbed into Emilia in the not 
too distant future.  Some strengthening is expected during the next 
12-24 h.  After that, the global models are forecasting that Fabio 
will dissipate as it is absorbed into Emilia by the 60 h point.  
The intensity forecast and dissipation time lean toward the GFS and 
Canadian model solutions, which keep Fabio separate from Emilia 
through about 48 h.  This forecast is low confidence due to the 
possibility that Fabio could try to absorb Emilia.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024
 
Daniel's organization continues to decrease, and it has become 
difficult to distinguish Daniel from the surrounding ITCZ/Monsoon 
Trough convection. Subjective and objective intensity estimates 
vary around 30-35 kt, so the initial intensity remains 35 kt 
for this advisory. 

It is very hard to determine how well-defined Daniel's surface 
circulation is, so its possible that the cyclone is already near 
dissipation, but this will be easier to determine after the sun has 
been up over Daniel for longer. Regardless, the system should not 
be around as a tropical cyclone for much longer as it is quickly 
moving into a more hostile environment. Some intensity models, 
including the GFS, indicate Daniel could dissipate as soon as 
this afternoon. Even if it maintains its circulation for a few 
days, all models suggest it will lose deep convection by tomorrow 
evening and become a remnant low.

Daniel has accelerated slightly toward the east-northeast, and 
should continue heading in that direction today, within low- to 
mid-level southwesterly monsoonal flow. After that, dynamical models 
continue to indicate that Daniel or its remnants will bend 
northward, and then westward, around the outer circulation of 
Carlotta. The NHC forecast continues to closely follow the consensus 
models and is very similar to the previous advisory.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  21
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 05 2024

If not for a recent small burst of convection nearly 60 n mi from 
its center, Carlotta would be devoid of organized deep convection. 
The intensity estimate remains 40 kt, close to a recent UW-CIMSS 
SATCON estimate. Deep convection may persist today, but could cease 
at just about any time due to cold waters beneath Carlotta and a 
surounding dry and stable environment. By this time tomorrow, 
Carlotta should be a post-tropical cyclone.

Carlotta's initial motion remains 280/8kt. This general motion 
should continue today as long as Carlotta maintains some deep 
convection. A slight left turn toward the west-southwest should 
begin once the last of Carlotta's convection is gone. No significant 
changes were made to the NHC track or intensity forecasts.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 596
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
555 AM EDT Mon Aug 5 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and northern Florida
  Southeastern Georgia
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Monday morning and afternoon from 555 AM until
  400 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible

SUMMARY...Per NHC forecasts, Hurricane Debby should move slowly
northeastward/inland after landfall, to near the FL/GA line during
the duration of this watch.  Associated tornado potential -- mainly
northeast through southeast of center -- should spread over the
watch area and across more of northern FL and southeastern GA
through early/mid afternoon.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 50 statute miles
east and west of a line from 50 miles east southeast of Saint
Petersburg FL to 50 miles north of Brunswick GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...This tornado watch replaces tornado
watch number 595. Watch number 595 will not be in effect after
555 AM EDT. 

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 18035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1815
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1247 PM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Areas affected...much of the Florida Peninsula and far southern
Georgia

Concerning...Tornado Watch 594...

Valid 041747Z - 041945Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 594 continues.

SUMMARY...Mini supercells within the outer bands of intensifying TC
Debby will remain capable of tornadoes this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...As of 1745 UTC, the latest NHC Aircraft recon fixed the
low-level center of TS Debby near 27.0 N, 84.3 W. As the TC
continues to deepen, low-level hodograph expansion has been noted at
most of the radar sites east/northeast of the center. A few
tornadoes are possible with miniature supercells embedded within the
spiral rain bands as they move ashore into moderate low-level SRH.
Stronger low-level mesocyclones within the most westward band have
moved offshore over the past few hours, but a new band developing to
the east has shown some stronger convective development recently. As
low-level shear continues to intensify, tornado potential should
increase, especially where low-level flow is more backed. Warmer
surface temperatures to the north of the main cloud shield may also
support more intense convection and a locally greater tornado or
damaging gust risk this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1814
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1234 PM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Areas affected...far northern New York eastward into Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041734Z - 042000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Some storms may produce localized hail, primarily at or
below severe levels, over the next several hours.

DISCUSSION...On the periphery of an upper trough over Quebec,
relatively cool midlevel temperatures extend southward into parts of
New England. Daytime heating near a surface trough and also north of
a more extensive cirrus shield is resulting in moderate
destabilization from northern NY eastward into parts of ME.

Wind profiles do not favor particularly organized storms, as winds
below 500 mb are weak. However, stronger speeds exist in the upper
levels which may aid venting somewhat.

Overall, it appears that short-lived, strong storm cores capable of
marginally severe hail will be the primary risk with these cells
over the next few hours as they travel east/southeast across the
narrow instability zone.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1233 PM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHERN FL
INTO EASTERN GA AND SOUTHERN SC...ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE UPPER
MIDWEST...AND FROM THE UPPER OH VALLEY INTO NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe thunderstorms are possible Monday into Monday night
from the Upper Ohio Valley into New England, across portions of the
Upper Midwest, and from northern Florida into southern Georgia and
southeast South Carolina.

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced westerlies is forecast to extend across the
length US/Canada border, from the Pacific Northwest through the
northern Plains/Upper Midwest and Northeast. Several shortwave
troughs will be embedded within these westerlies, the most prominent
of which is a wave that is forecast to progress quickly from central
Ontario through southern Quebec and northern ME. Another,
low-amplitude shortwave trough is expected to move through the
northern Plains, Upper Midwest, and Upper Great Lakes. 

Expansive upper ridging is expected to remain centered over the Four
Corners,  extending from the southern Great Basin vicinity through
the lower MS Valley. Tropical Cyclone Debby is expected to move
between the eastern periphery of the Four Corners ridge and
subtropical ridging over the western Atlantic, progressing across
northern FL and reaching the southeast GA/southern SC vicinity by
early Tuesday morning. 

Surface pattern early Monday is expected to feature a low over the
central SD/NE border vicinity, with a stationary front extending
eastward from this low across central IA, northern IL, and southern
Lower MI before arcing more northeastward along the St. Lawrence
Valley to another low over New Brunswick. Eastern portion of this
front is expected to progress southeastward across the Northeast
throughout the day, while the portion of the front closer to the
SD/NE surface low transitions to a warm front amid southerly
low-level flow ahead of the low.

A cold front will extend westward from the SD/NE surface low into
eastern WY, where it intersects lee troughing extending across the
northern and central High Plains. This front is expected to push
southward across the central Plains as the low progresses
eastward/southeastward through IA. 

...Northern FL into southern GA and far southern SC...
Tropical cyclone Debby is forecast to progress across northern FL
throughout the day, reaching the southeast GA/southern SC vicinity
by early Tuesday morning. Strong low-level flow attendant to this
system will support the potential for tornadoes within deeper, more
persistent updrafts. These updrafts are most likely in the areas
where dewpoints exceed 74/75 deg F. This appears most likely across
northern FL and southeast GA. However, a more westerly track would
allow this more favorable low-level moisture to penetrate inland
more of southern GA and perhaps even southern SC. 5-percent tornado
probabilities were adjusted northward to account for this
possibility.

...Northern OH Valley through the Northeast/New England...
Thunderstorm development is anticipated Monday afternoon along the
length of the cold front extending from ME into northern IN/OH.
Dewpoints ranging from the mid 60s across central ME to the low 70s
across IN/OH will support moderate buoyancy, with the strongest
buoyancy across the OH Valley where greater low-level moisture
exists. Moderate mid-level flow will extend across the region as
well, with the stronger flow and greater vertical shear expected
across New England. While there is some displacement between the
strongest shear and greatest buoyancy, there is still enough overlap
to support scattered strong to severe storms, including even some
supercells across New England. Damaging gusts will be the primary
severe hazard.

...Upper Midwest...
Late afternoon/evening thunderstorm development is expected near the
surface low and associated warm front moving across IA. The airmass
will be very unstable, supported by temperatures in the upper
80s/low 90s and dewpoints in the mid 70s. Even so, there is some
question whether true warm sector storms will initiate, given the
potential for significant mixing and warm mid-level temperatures.
Storms north of the warm front could still pose a severe risk, with
large hail and damaging gusts as the primary threats. A
surface-based, warm sector storm would have these threat as well,
but with an added potential for very large hail and potentially even
a tornado or two, given the potential for a supercellular mode.
After the initial cellular mode, a quick transition to a more
linear/forward-propagating mode is expected.  

...Northern Rockies...
A low-amplitude shortwave trough is forecast to move through the
northern periphery of the ridge across the northern Rockies Monday
afternoon. Ascent and increased mid-level moisture attendant to this
wave combined with orographic ascent and deep boundary-layer mixing
will help support afternoon/evening thunderstorms. Deep-layer
vertical shear is strong enough to some organized, more persistent
updrafts. High storm bases and steep low-level lapse rates will help
support damaging gusts with the strongest storms.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1154 AM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...Update...
Latest observational trends in satellite data, combined with recent
CAMs and other model output, suggest the most likely area for
isolated dry thunderstorm coverage will be shifted southeast from
the previous forecast across portions of central UT, southern WY,
and western CO, with a small area of additional elevated, dry
thunderstorms possible near and east/northeast of the Cascades of
OR. These areas will have relatively lower PWATs and drier boundary
layer conditions this afternoon. Further north across MT and the
rest of WY, wetting thunderstorms are anticipated within an area of
stronger mid-level ascent and deeper moisture. In addition, very few
thunderstorms are now expected to develop over ID on the backside of
an exiting vorticity maximum, and as a result, dry Thunderstorms
have been removed from the forecast there. For additional details
pertaining to the unchanged Elevated area for windy and dry
conditions this afternoon across the High Plains of WY, SD, and NE
please see the previous discussion below.

..Barnes.. 08/04/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Sun Aug 04 2024/

...Synopsis...
...Isolated Dry Thunderstorms...
A midlevel disturbance moving across the Great Basin into the
northern Rockies will bring isolated dry thunderstorm chances across
eastern Oregon into Idaho southward and eastward into Utah and
Wyoming this afternoon. In these regions, mid-level moisture will
overlap dry surface conditions with faster storm motions. With
little to no precipitation expected, dry fuels within these regions
will support potential for new ignitions. Gusty and erratic outflow
will also be possible. Better potential for wetting rainfall into
central/northern Montana precludes the need to include these areas,
though fuels in these regions are also sufficiently dry.

...Windy/Dry...
A surface low will deepen across eastern MT/WY this afternoon.
Surface winds will increase across these regions into western
Nebraska and southern South Dakota amid relative humidity reductions
to 15-20 percent. Some portions of the Nebraska Panhandle received
wetting rainfall in the last 24 hours, though heavier totals were
more sparse. Given ERCs near the 95th percentile before this light
to moderate rainfall, fuels may still be receptive to fire spread
with Elevated fire weather conditions expected.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR A FEW
TORNADOES OVER PARTS OF FLORIDA AND EXTREME SOUTHERN GEORGIA. 
DAMAGING WINDS MAY ALSO AFFECT PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST MONTANA THIS
EVENING....

...SUMMARY...
Tropical Storm Debby may produce a few tornadoes over parts of
Florida and extreme southern Georgia through early tomorrow morning
as it intensifies.  Scattered thunderstorms may produce damaging
wind gusts across parts of Montana this evening.

...FL/South GA...
Tropical Storm Debby continues to intensify off the west coast of
the FL.  Low-level wind fields are enlarging, resulting in
strengthening shear profiles across much of peninsula.  Dewpoints in
the mid-upper 70s and pockets of heating, combined with deep
tropical moisture, will result in scattered to widespread afternoon
thunderstorms.  Given the favorable wind fields, a few tornadoes are
possible.

...MT/WY...
Water vapor loop shows a well-defined mid-level shortwave trough
moving eastward across ID.  This feature and an associated mid-level
speed max will cross the northern Rockies and into southern
MT/northern WY this afternoon/evening.  A consensus of 12z model
guidance shows clusters of thunderstorms forming in this region,
tracking eastward across southern MT through the evening.  CAMs have
a consistent signal for a more organized damaging wind threat, so
have added a small SLGT to account for this scenario.

...SD/MN/IA...
A strengthening low-level jet will enhance warm advection and lift
over eastern SD/western MN this evening/tonight.  Isolated
thunderstorm development is possible in this regime, perhaps not
until after midnight.  This region will be beneath the southern
fringe of stronger west-northwest flow aloft, and in a region of
relatively steep mid-level lapse rates.  Elevated storms capable of
hail and perhaps gusty winds are possible.

...Northeast States...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected today across much of New
England and eastern NY/PA into NJ.  Surface conditions are
considerably cooler than recent days, which should weaken low-level
lapse rates and temper the overall severe threat.  Nevertheless, a
few strong storms are possible - capable of gusty wind and small
hail.

Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP032024
800 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Carlotta's deep convection has become quite limited this
morning. Subjective Dvorak and objective satellite estimates like
the UW-CIMSS ADT are all decreasing, and support an initial
intensity estimate of 55 kt. No changes of note were made to the NHC
forecast, and further weakening should continue as Carlotta moves
over SSTs that are already below 25 deg C. The SSTs will only get
colder during the next couple of days as Carlotta moves along the
forecast track. The tropical storm is forecast by most models to
lose its remaining deep convection in about 48 h, and based on
current trends this could occur even sooner. Dissipation is still
expected around mid-week.
 
The tropical storm is still moving westward to west-northwestward. 
This general motion should continue for the next day or two as 
Carlotta is steered by a deep-layer ridge centered well to its 
northeast. As the cyclone weakens further and becomes more 
vertically shallow, low-level steering will likely cause it to turn 
westward and slow down slightly in a couple of days.

Tropical Storm Daniel Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042024
800 AM PDT Sun Aug 04 2024

Daniel's convective structure continues to sputter along, with the 
coldest cloud tops organized in two regions to the northeast and 
southwest of the center, which appears to be mostly exposed this 
morning. The latest round of both subjective and objective intensity 
guidance has not changed much from overnight, and so the initial 
intensity remains 35 kt this advisory. 

It appears that the tropical storm is finally starting to track more 
north-northeastward this morning, with the estimated motion at 030/4 
kt. A somewhat faster northeastward motion is expected to begin 
later today through Monday as Daniel's motion is influenced by the 
southwesterly monsoonal flow being picked up by Carlotta passing to 
the north. The global models still show a turn north and 
northwestward as Daniel gets caught in the outer periphery  of 
Carlotta's larger circulation. The NHC track forecast is quite 
similar to the prior advisory, close to the multi-model consensus. 
 
While the vertical wind shear that was previously affecting Daniel 
is starting to subside, there is quite a bit of environmental dry 
air to the north of the storm, which will likely keep it in check, 
and only a modest amount of intensification is forecasted. After 48 
h, this dry air is expected to fully envelop the circulation, 
choking off the remaining convection, marking the storm's transition 
to a post-tropical remnant low. The low is finally forecast to open 
up into a trough by midweek.

Tropical Depression Five-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052024
800 AM MST Sun Aug 04 2024
 
Convection associated with a low located well offshore Mexico has 
steadily increased in coverage and organization since yesterday. 
Overnight ASCAT and first-light visible imagery indicate that the 
cyclone also has a well-defined, if somewhat broad, circulation. 
Subjective Dvorak classifications from TAFB and SAB were both 2.0 
at 1200 UTC, which support initiating advisories on the system as a 
30 kt depression.

The depression is located within a very convectively active 
environment over the east Pacific, deep-layer wind shear is low, and 
SSTs are plenty warm, so strengthening is expected in the short 
term. The biggest source of uncertainty for this forecast is an 
expected interaction with a larger disturbance, currently Invest 
96E, which is approaching from the east. Based on the available 
global and hurricane dynamical model forecasts, the most likely 
scenario is that 96E will be the dominant system. In that case, the 
new depression will only have a short window to strengthen before it 
is wrapped into and dissipates within the other circulation. Models 
historically handle interaction cases like this poorly, so 
confidence in the forecast is not high, despite the near universal 
agreement between the dynamical guidance on this upcoming evolution.

The NHC forecast is very close to the consensus guidance through 24 
to 36 h.  After that, the model trackers appear to be getting fooled 
by the close proximity of 96E and TD Five-E and are following the 
stronger vortex instead. The NHC forecast is based heavily on a 
broad consensus of model fields beyond 36 h and shows dissipation 
occuring by 60 h.  There is some chance that the depression could 
persist longer than forecast if the two systems remain farther 
apart, however there is not enough guidance with a trackable vortex 
to justify an explicit forecast beyond what is currently shown.

...NEW TROPICAL DEPRESSION FORMS OVER THE OPEN EASTERN PACIFIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 800 AM MST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.8N 112.9W
ABOUT 530 MI...850 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM MST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Five-E
was located near latitude 15.8 North, longitude 112.9 West. The
depression is nearly stationary, but a slow generally southward 
motion is expected to begin later today and continue into Monday. A 
sharp turn back toward the north is possible by Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Slow strengthening is expected today and the system is forecast to 
become a tropical storm tonight. The cyclone will then begin to 
interact with another larger disturbance approaching from the east, 
which is expected to cause this system to dissipate in a few days.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
