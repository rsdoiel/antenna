If you have a FIRE or Pyro system from RISCOSbits (I reviewed mine here) you may be interested in their new machine stands. The stand has a gap underneath that will fit a DVD drive underneath.

## Snow Leopard PPC: What Works, What Doesn’t

date: 2024-07-22, from: Happy Macs site

This post provides those &#8220;insights&#8221;… more like &#8220;observations&#8221;, but at any rate, a follow up on what works [&#8230;]

## Using StrongED as a scripting aid for Python programming – MUG meeting, 24th  July

date: 2024-07-21, from: RiscOS Story

There will be an out of schedule meeting held by the Midlands User Group (MUG), at which the group&#8217;s own John Rickman will discuss the use of StrongED as a scripting tool when programming in Python. MUG meetings are usually held on a Saturday afternoons, with some being held in person, and some online using Zoom. However, this meeting will instead be held on Wednesday, 24th July, at 7:30pm &#8211; presumably to get around other commitments, and possibly in the interests of encouraging attendance; a Saturday afternoon in the middle&#8230;

## WimpInfo 1.24 released

date: 2024-07-21, from: RiscOS Story

WimpInfo is a small application that was previously supplied by Quantum Software, and is now hosted here on RISCOSitory after Stuart Halliday announced he was shutting down the software house. Its purpose is to provide information about whatever is underneath the mouse pointer &#8211; information about windows, icons, menus, and so on. This can be useful to programmers when developing their applications to ensure their code is doing what they think it&#8217;s doing, and that they&#8217;ve set up those windows, icons, menus, and so on correctly. Fred Graute, of StrongED&#8230;
