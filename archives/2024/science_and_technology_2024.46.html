<h2 id="free-towns-os-an-open-source-recreation-of-fm-towns-os">Free
Towns OS: an open source recreation of FM Towns OS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I linked to a story by Misty De Meo, in which they
explored what happened to the various eccentric Japanese PC platforms.
One of the platforms mentioned was FM Towns, made by Fujitsu, which came
with its own graphical operating system from the era of Windows 3.x. I
had never heard of this one before, but it looks incredibly interesting,
with some unique UI ideas I’d love to explore, if only I could read
Japanese. Since learning Japanese is a serious life-long commitment, I
can safely say that’s not going to happen. It seems I’m not the only one
interested in FM Towns, as a new project called Free Towns OS (or
Tsugaru OS in Japanese) aims to provide an open source replacement for
the Free Towns operating system. The goal of this project is to write a
copyright-free FM Towns OS to run free games and the re-released games,
or why not a brand-new game for FM Towns. without concerns of violating
copyrights of the files included in the original Towns OS. Let’s see how
far we can go! But, so far so good. Now Tsugaru OS is capable of running
the three probably the most popular free games, Panic Ball 2, VSGP, and
Sky Duel. All playable without single file from the original Towns OS. ↫
Free Towns OS GitHub page That’s a pretty good milestone already. The
project aims to eventually also be able to run on real hardware instead
of just emulators, but further than that, it’s difficult for me to
extract more information from the descriptions since not every paragraph
has been translated to English just yet. Finding English information on
FM Towns OS in general is hard, so I’m also not entirely sure just how
much the project has already been able to recreate. I definitely hope
this effort attracts more interest, hopefully also from outside of Japan
so we can get a translated version people outside of Japan can use.</p>

finally publishes ISO for Windows on ARM</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>This option is for users that want to create a Windows 11 on Arm
virtual machine on supported hardware using an ISO file or to install
Windows 11 on Arm directly without a DVD or USB flash drive.  The ISO
file can also be used to manually create bootable installation media
(USB flash drive) to install Windows 11 on Arm, but it may be necessary
to include drivers from the device manufacturer for the installation
media to be successfully bootable. This download is a multi-edition ISO
which uses your product key to unlock the correct edition. ↫ Windows on
ARM ISO download Oddly enough, up until now, Microsoft hadn’t published
a Windows 11 on ARM ISO yet. With this new ISO, ARM users can do a fresh
install, and create Windows on ARM virtual machines. Not the biggest
news in the world, but it’s a little bit surprising it’s taken them this
long to publish this ISO file.</p>

<h2 id="massive-half-life-2-20th-anniversary-update-is-here">Massive
Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update is here</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Valve has been holding on to a special surprise for Half-Life 2 fans
to celebrate the game crossing its 20th birthday. Today, the company
shipped the 20th Anniversary Update for the iconic Gordon Freeman
adventure from 2004, combining the base experience and all episodes into
one, bringing developer commentary, Steam Workshop support, and much
more. Adding to all that, the game is completely free to claim on Steam
right now too. ↫ Pulasthi Ariyasinghe at NeoWin Valve even made a nice
web page with fun animated characters for it (they’re just video loops).
Definitely a nice surprise for those of us who’ve already played the
game a million times, and for those of us who haven’t yet for some
reason and can now claim the game for free. This update also fixes some
more bugs, adds a ton of new graphics settings, allows you to choose
between different styles for certain visual effects, aim assist for
controller users has been massively updated, and so much more. For a 20
year old game, such a free update is not something that happens very
often, so good on Valve for doing this. I can barely believe it’s been
20 years, and that we still have no conclusion or even continuation to
the story that so abruptly ended with Episode Two. I honestly doubt
we’ll ever going to see a Half-Life 3 or even an Episode Three, simply
because at this point the expectations would be so bonkers high there’s
no way Valve could meet them. On top of that, why waste time, money, and
possibly reputation and goodwill on Half-Life 3, when you can just sit
on the couch and watch the Steam gravy train roll into the station?
Because that’s a hell of a lot of gravy.</p>

intends to make Apple’s Darwin usable with a MATE desktop, future custom
desktop environment, and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember Darwin? It’s the core of Apple’s macOS, and the company has
always – sometimes intermittently – released its source code as open
source. Not much ever really happens with Darwin, and any attempts at
building a usable operating system on top of Darwin have failed. There
was OpenDarwin, which at one point could run a GNOME desktop, but in
2006 it shut itself down, stating: Over the past few years, OpenDarwin
has become a mere hosting facility for Mac OS X related projects. The
original notions of developing the Mac OS X and Darwin sources has not
panned out. Availability of sources, interaction with Apple
representatives, difficulty building and tracking sources, and a lack of
interest from the community have all contributed to this. Administering
a system to host other people’s projects is not what the remaining
OpenDarwin contributors had signed up for and have been doing this
thankless task far longer than they expected. It is time for OpenDarwin
to go dark. ↫ OpenDarwin announcement from 2006 (archived) Any other
attempts at making Darwin work as a standalone operating system were
further frustrated by the fact that Apple stopped releasing bootable
Darwin images, so Darwin never amounted to much more than Apple throwing
some code over the fence every now and then for some cheap goodwill
among the few people who still believe Apple cares about open source.
However, the dream is still alive – the idea that you could use Darwin
to build a general purpose operating system, perhaps one with some
semblance of compatibility with macOS software, is an attractive one.
Enter PureDarwin. This project has been around for a while now,
releasing an X11-capable build of Darwin somewhere in 2015, followed
long, long after that by a CLI-only build in 2020. A few days ago, the
project announced an ambitious change in direction, with a plan and
roadmap for turning PureDarwin into a general purpose operating system.
The PureDarwin project, originally created to bring Apple’s open-source
Darwin OS to more people, is heading in a fresh new direction with some
clear short-term and long-term goals. These new plans are all about
breathing new life into PureDarwin. In the short term, we’re focused on
getting some solid basics in place with graphical interfaces using MATE
Desktop and LightDM, so users can get a functional and accessible
experience sooner rather than later. Looking further down the line, the
long-term goals—shown in some early wireframes—are about creating a
fully featured, polished desktop experience that’s easy to use and
visually appealing. Plus, a new versioning system will make it clear how
PureDarwin is progressing independently from Apple’s Darwin updates,
making it easier for everyone to keep track. This refreshed direction
sets PureDarwin up to grow from its roots into a user-centered operating
system. ↫ PureDarwin announcement These plans and roadmap sound quite
well thought-out to me. I especially like that they first focus on
getting a solid MATE desktop running before shifting to building a more
custom desktop environment, as this makes it much easier – relatively
speaking – to get people up and running with Darwin. Once Darwin with
MATE is halfway usable, it can serve its job as a development platform
for the more custom desktop environment they have planned. It won’t
surprise you, by the way, that the sketches for the custom desktop
environment are very Apple-y. As part of the goals of creating a usable
MATE desktop and then a more custom desktop environment, a whole bunch
of low-level things need to be handled. All the kexts (drivers) required
for Darwin to boot need to be built, and CoreFoundation needs to be
updated, a process that was already under way. On top of that, the
project wants to focus on getting Wayland to work, make Darwin buildable
under BSD/Linux, and develop an installer. Beyond those goals, the
project has an even bigger, tentative ambition: API compatibility with
macOS. They make it very clear they’re not at all focused on this right
now, and consider it more of a pie-in-the-sky goal for the the distant
future. It’s an interesting ambition we’ve seen tried various times
before, and it surely won’t be even remotely easy to get it to a level
where it could do much more than run some command-line utilities.
Darling, a similar project to run macOS binaries on Linux in the style
of Wine, has only recently been able to run some small, very basic GUI
applications. I like all of these goals, and especially getting it to a
state where you can download a Darwin ISO running MATE should be
entirely realistic to achieve in a short timeframe. A custom desktop
environment is a lot more work of course, all depending on how much they
intend to reuse from the Linux graphics and desktop stack. Anything
beyond that, and it becomes much murkier, obviously. As always, it’s all
going to come down to just how many active and enthusiastic contributors
they can attract, and more importantly retain once the initial
excitement of this announcement wears off.</p>

id="startups-ai-tool-spams-github-repositories-with-bogus-commits-without-consent">Startup’s
“AI” tool spams GitHub repositories with bogus commits, without
consent</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Update: that was quick! GitHub banned the “AI” company’s account.
Only GitHub gets to spam AI on GitHub, thank you very much. Most of the
time, products with “AI” features just elicit sighs, especially when the
product category in question really doesn’t need to have anything to do
with “AI” in any way, shape, or form. More often than not, though, such
features are not only optional and easily ignorable, and we can always
simply choose not to buy or use said products in the first place. I
mean, over the last few days I’ve migrated my Pixel 8 Pro from stock
Google Android to GrapheneOS as the final part of my platform transition
away from big tech, and Google’s insistence on shoving “AI” into
everything certainly helped in spurring this along. But what are you
supposed to do if an “AI” product forces itself upon you? What if you
can’t run away from it? What if, one day, you open your GitHub
repository and see a bunch of useless PRs from an “AI” bot who claims to
help you fix issues, without you asking it to do so? Well, that’s what’s
happening to a bunch of GitHub users who were unpleasantly surprised to
see garbage, useless merge requests from a random startup testing out
some “AI” tool that attempts to automatically ‘fix’ open issues on
GitHub. The proposed ‘fixes’ are accompanied by a disclaimer:
Disclaimer: The commit was created by Latta AI and you should never copy
paste this code before you check the correctness of generated code.
Solution might not be complete, you should use this code as an
inspiration only. This issue was tried to solve for free by Latta AI
– https://latta.ai/ourmission If you no longer want Latta AI to attempt
solving issues on your repository, you can block this account. ↫ Example
of a public open issue with the “AI” spam Let me remind you: this tool,
called “Latta AI”, is doing all of this unprompted, without consent, and
the commits generally seem bogus and useless, too, in that they don’t
actually fix any of the issues. To make matters worse, your GitHub
repository will then automatically appear as part of its marketing –
again without any consent or permission from the owners of the GitHub
projects in question. Clicking through to the GitHub repositories listed
on the front page will reveal a lot about how developers are responding:
they’re not amused. Every link I clicked on had Latta AI’s commit and
comment marked as spam, abuse, or just outright deleted. We’re talking
public open issues here, so it’s not like developers aren’t looking for
input and possible fixes from third parties – they just want that input
and those possible fixes to come from real humans, not some jank code
generator that’s making us destroy the planet even faster. This is what
the future of “AI” really looks like. It’s going to make spam even
easier to make, even more pervasive, and even cheaper, and it’s going to
infest everything. Nothing will be safe from these monkeys on
typewriters, and considering what the spread of misinformation by
human-powered troll farms can do, I don’t think we’re remotely ready for
what “AI” is going to mean for our society. I can assure you lying about
brown people eating cats and dogs will be remembered as quaint before
this nonsense is over.</p>

<h4>
Until compatibility issues are properly addressed, it'll never stand up
to x86

<p>
<strong>Analysis</strong>  Qualcomm has set its sights on Arm-based
Windows laptops, which, in theory, offer notable advantages. The
company's Arm-powered Snapdragon processors promise exceptional battery
life that puts x86 machines to shame, fanless designs, and integrated 5G
connectivity that leave Intel and AMD looking dated. By betting on a
mobile and connected world, Qualcomm aims to position Arm-based Windows
laptops as the future.…

id="google-drastically-improves-quality-of-the-android-emulator">Google
drastically improves quality of the Android Emulator</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve consistently heard from just about anyone
involved in Android development are laments about the sorry state of the
Android Emulator included in Google’s Android Studio. It seems that
particularly its performance is not great, with people often resorting
to third-party options or real devices. Well, it seems the Android
development team at Google has taken this to heart, and has spent six
months focusing almost solely on fixing up the Android Emulator. We know
how critical the stability, reliability, and performance of the Android
Emulator is to your everyday work as an Android developer. After
listening to valuable feedback about stability, reliability, and
performance, the Android Studio team took a step back from large feature
work on the Android Emulator for six months and started an initiative
called Project Quartz. This initiative was made up of several
workstreams aimed at reducing crashes, speeding up startup time, closing
out bugs, and setting up better ways to detect and prevent issues in the
future. ↫ Neville Sicard-Gregory at the Android Developers Blog Steps
taken include moving to a newer version of Qt for the user interface of
the emulator, improving the graphics rendering system used in the
Android Emulator, and adding a whole bunch of tests to their existing
test suite. The end result is that the number of crashes in the Android
Emulator dropped by 30%, which, if bourne out out in the real world,
will have a material impact for Android developers. During the Project
Quartz effort, Google also cut the number of open issues by 44%, but
they do note only 17% of those were fixed during Project Quartz, with
the remainder being obsoleted or previously fixed issues. If you
download or update to the latest version of Android Studio, you’ll get
the new and improved Android Emulator as well.</p>

<h2 id="net-9-released">.NET 9 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, we are excited to announce the launch of .NET 9, the most
productive, modern, secure, intelligent, and performant release of .NET
yet. It’s the result of another year of effort on the part of thousands
of developers from around the world. This new release includes thousands
of performance, security, and functional improvements. You will find
sweeping enhancements across the entire .NET stack from the programming
languages, developer tools, and workloads enabling you to build with a
unified platform and easily infuse your apps with AI. ↫ .NET Team at the
.Net Blog All I know is that these are very important words, and a very
important release, for thousands and thousands of unknown developers
slaving away in obscurity, creating, maintaining, and fixing endless
amounts of corporate software very few of us ever actually get to see
very often. They toil away for meager pay in the 21st century version of
the coal mines of the 19th century, without any recognition,
appreciation, or applause. They work long hours, make their way through
the urban planning hell that is modern America, and come home to make
some gruel and drink water from lead pipes, waiting for the sweet relief
of what little sleep they manage to get, only to do it all over again
the next day. …I may have a bit of a skewed perception of reality for
most IT people. In all seriousness, .NET is a hugely popular set of
tools and frameworks, and while it’s probably not the most sexy topic in
the tech world, any new release matters to a ton of people. .NET 9.0.
This new version’s main focus seems to be performance, with over 1000
performance-related changes tot he various components that make up .NET.
In a blog post about these performance improvements, Stephen Toub
explains in great detail what some of the improvements are, and where
the benefits lie. Of course, there’s an insane amount of talk about “AI”
features in .NET 9, and apparently .NET MAUI is seeing a surge in
popularity on Android, if you believe Microsoft (“30$” increase in
“developer usage” means little when you don’t provide a baseline). .NET
MAUI is Microsoft’s cross-platform framework for building applications
for Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. Among other things, .NET MAUI 9
provides more access to platform-native features, as well as benefiting
from some of the performance improvements. There’s also a paragraph
about .NET 9 development on Windows, just in case you thought the .NET
team forgot Windows existed. With .NET 9, your Windows apps will have
access to the latest OS features and capabilities while ensuring they
are more performant and accessible than ever before. Whether you are
starting a new modern app with WinUI 3 and the Windows App SDK or
modernizing your existing WPF and WinForms applications, your Windows
apps run best on .NET 9. We have been collaborating closely with the
Windows developer community to bring features that you have been
requesting. This includes Native AOT support for WinUI 3 for smaller and
more performant apps, modern theming enhancements with Fluent UI for
WPF, and WinForms gets a boost with a new Dark Mode, modern icon APIs,
and improved asynchronous API access with Control.InvokeAsync. ↫ .NET
Team at the .Net Blog There’s way more on top of all of this, from
changes to the languages .NET uses to new releases of the various
developer tools, like Visual Studio.</p>

Steam Client stability on Linux: setenv and multithreaded
environments</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Speaking of Steam, the Linux version of Valve’s gaming platform has
just received a pretty substantial set of fixes for crashes, and
Timothee “TTimo” Besset, who works for Valve on Linux support, has
published a blog post with more details about what kind of crashes
they’ve been fixing. The Steam client update on November 5th mentions
“Fixed some miscellaneous common crashes.” in the Linux notes, which I
wanted to give a bit of background on. There’s more than one fix that
made it in under the somewhat generic header, but the one change that
made the most significant impact to Steam client stability on Linux has
been a revamping of how we are approaching
the setenv and getenv functions. One of my colleagues rightly
dubbed setenv “the worst Linux API”. It’s such a simple, common API,
available on all platforms that it was a little difficult to convince
ourselves just how bad it is. I highly encourage anyone who writes
software that will run on Linux at some point to read through
“RachelByTheBay”‘s very engaging post on the subject. ↫ Timothee “TTimo”
Besset This indeed seems to be a specific Linux problem, and due to the
variability in Linux systems – different distributions, extensive user
customisation, and so on – debugging information was more difficult to
parse than on Windows and macOS. After a lot of work grouping the debug
information to try and make sense of it all, it turned out that the two
functions in question were causing issues in threads other than those
that used them. They had to resort to several solutions, from reducing
the reliance on setenv and refactoring it with exevpe, to reducing the
reliance on getenv through caching, to introducing “an ‘environment
manager’ that pre-allocates large enough value buffers at startup for
fixed environment variable names, before any threading has started”. It
was especially this last one that had a major impact on reducing the
number of crashes with Steam on Linux. Besset does note that these
functions are still used far too often, but that at this point it’s out
of their control because that usage comes from the libraries of the
operating system, like x11, xcb, dbus, and so on. Besset also mentions
that it would be much better if this issue can be addressed in glibc,
and in the comments, a user by the name of Adhemerval reports that this
is indeed something the glibc team is working on.</p>

<h2 id="valve-ends-steams-support-for-windows-7-and-8">Valve ends
Steam’s support for Windows 7 and 8</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Steam has finally stopped working on several older Windows operating
systems, following a warning from Valve that it planned to drop support
earlier this year. With little fanfare, Windows 7 and Windows 8 gaming
on Steam is no longer possible following the most recent Steam client
update on November 5. ↫ Ben Stockton at PCGamesN It’s honestly wild that
Valve supported Windows 7 and 8 for this long for Steam in the first
place. They’ve been out of support for a long time, and at this point in
time, less than 0.3% of Steam users were using Windows 7 or 8. Investing
any resources in continuing to support them would be financially
irresponsible, while also aiding a tiny bit in allowing people to use
such unsupported, insecure systems to this day. I’m sure at least one of
you is still rocking Windows 7 or 8 as your daily driver operating
system, so I’m sorry if you don’t want to hear this, but it’s really,
really time to move on. Buying a Windows 10 or 11 license on eBay or
whatever costs a few euros at most – if you’re not eligible for one the
free upgrade programs Microsoft ran – and especially Windows 10 should
run just fine on pretty much anything Windows 7 or 8 runs on. Do note
that with Windows 10, though, you’ll be back in the same boat next
year.</p>
