Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0624 AM CST Mon Dec 16 2024

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
A progressive mid/upper-level pattern will persist, with the most
important feature being a trough now apparent in moisture-channel
imagery from a low over southeastern MB, across western MN, eastern
NE, central KS, and the TX Panhandle.  The main/northern part of
this trough is forecast to weaken and move across the Upper Great
Lakes today.  A weaker, positively tilted, basal vorticity banner
will move eastward from the TX Panhandle across much of OK today,
and more slowly moving eastward over northwest TX.  By 00Z, this
lobe should weaken and extend from the Ozarks to southern OK and the
Permian Basin, then become diffuse and perhaps dissipate overnight. 

As that occurs, a surface cold front -- analyzed at 11Z from eastern
IA across southwestern MO, central/southwestern OK and northwest TX
-- should move eastward/southeastward by 00Z to near a TOL-EVV-DYR-
LIT-DAL-6R6 line.  Overnight, the southern part of the front will
move slowly southeastward then become quasistationary, reaching a
position across northern parts of AL/MS/LA, northeast/north-central
TX and the Hill Country.  Episodic, widely scattered thunderstorms
in bands and clusters are possible near the front, becoming isolated
to widely scattered in the warm sector.

A few strong thunderstorms may develop this afternoon from the
Arklatex into the Mid-South, near time of peak diurnally driven
buoyancy.  This activity will be within the warm-advection/moisture-
transport conveyor, and along/ahead of the surface cold front.  A
narrow corridor of prefrontal MLCAPE should range from about 2000
J/kg in northeast TX, where heating and moisture will be greatest,
to around 1000 J/kg in eastern AR. However, during the surface
warming/destabilization peak window, surface flow will be veering
and remaining weak, due to the shift of the mid/upper trough and
related large-scale lift and mass response away from the area.  This
will act both to shrink hodographs and weaken frontal convergence
with time.  Given these offsetting factors, and the increasing
dominance of the unfavorable ones with time during the afternoon,
severe probabilities appear too low and conditional for an outlook
area at this time.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-12-16, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy2.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/day2fireotlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CST Mon Dec 16 2024

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
Quasi zonal mid-level flow is expected to quickly amplify as ridging
develops over the Western US D2/Tues. In the wake of a cold front
moving across the central US the day prior, surface high pressure
will quickly build over the Great Basin. The high pressure will
allow for moderate offshore winds and elevated to near-critical
fire-weather concerns over portions of southern CA.

...Southern California...
As high pressure intensifies behind the cold front across the Great
Basin and interior West, moderate offshore flow is expected to
develop D2/Tues into D3/Wed. Santa Ana winds of 15-25 mph will
overlap with low RH values of 10-20% across parts of Los Angeles and
Ventura counties for several hours. Elevated to near-critical
fire-weather conditions appear likely amid dry fuels across portions
of southern CA, particularly overnight D2/Tues into D3/Wed. Some
uncertainty remains regarding the strength of the winds and minimum
RH values in the absence of stronger upper-level support. The best
overlap of strong winds and low RH is expected late D2/Tues into
early D3/Wed morning. However, if winds trend stronger and earlier
as some guidance suggests, critical highlights may be needed sooner.
