The 20th century saw the addition of laboratory studies, and the 21st century of sophisticated imaging and genetics.</p>

## OPINION ǀ Thanks for Your Service Lt. Col. Camacho

date: 2024-07-14, updated: 2024-07-15, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is I’ve decided to lead by example, as I’ve been waiting to give Locals/Politicians a chance to THANK Lt. Col. Edward C. Camacho for his 43 years of Service first, as I just wrote an Op ed about the need for us to say THANKS more.  Lt. Col. Camacho is a REAL “Bad-A**,” for TRUE and may have been one of, if not the highest serving Chamorro to ever be in the military along with PSS’s Commissioner. But I can remember when Lt. Col. Camacho was chosen to be our DPS Commissioner, as I was sooo glad along with many others to know we had someone we could TRUST.  His genuine humility and appreciation for such an honor with teers for being appointed was something I will never forget. It is truly touching when grown men cries and it is truly a special and even a historic event when it’s a Lt. Col.  There was no doubt in the minds of many citizens that he was the RIGHT man who is made of the Right-Stuff — training/experience, integrity, respectful and humble! I’m sure the average reader would love to have Lt. Col. Camacho on their team figuratively.

## Åga population increasing through rear-and-release program

date: 2024-07-14, updated: 2024-07-15, from: Marianas Variety

(CNMI Department of Lands and Natural Resources &amp; University of Washington) — Åga enthusiasts can rejoice as the species reached an important milestone recently. The Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi), known in Chamorro as “Åga,” has been listed as an endangered species in the Marianas since 1984. Though once plentiful, the introduction of the Brown Tree Snake to Guam in the 1940’s led to their decline and listing, with the population on Luta or Rota being the last remaining of what had been a thriving species.

## Lego was my son’s world. It took me decades to see why — and to join him there

date: 2024-07-14, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Six decades after the age when most people do, I&#8217;ve become obsessed with Lego. My gateway drug was a set reminiscent of an ice cream truck. Like many parents, I was trying something new as a way to connect with one of my kids. Unlike many parents, in my case the kid in question was an adult, and I was building a set that he had designed.</p>
