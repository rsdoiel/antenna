## Using Film Tropes in Screenwriting

date: 2024-09-16, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/using-film-tropes-in-screenwriting" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Scream.png" alt="Neve Campbell in 'Scream'" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>A film trope is a thematic storytelling device that conveys an idea to the audience.&nbsp;<br><br>If a trope is utilized enough over time, avid filmgoers and critics will become aware of the device and will be able to spot it when it appears. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">the Hero’s Journey</a> is a popular story template for movies, and within this template are several common tropes: the protagonist has lost a parental figure, they initially refuse a calling, they get initiated into a new world by a mentor, and eventually they come into their own and become a hero.</p>
