<p>(BPT) - Murals aren’t just large-scale works of art — though they
function all on their own to beautify public spaces. They also serve as
powerful platforms for cultural expression and highlight the vibrancy of
their communities. According to research from nonprofit Americans for
the Arts, art in public spaces (like murals) can positively impact a
community’s economic growth and stability, attachment and cultural
identity, social cohesion and cultural understanding, and public health
and belonging. A new mural recently revealed in Knoxville, Tennessee,
aims to do just that.</p>

advancing hearing aids, in real time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, updated: 2024-10-31, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(BPT) - Hearing loss is often called a “silent epidemic” because it
can develop slowly and go unnoticed for years. According to the National
Council on Aging, more than 60 million Americans over the age of 12
experience some degree of hearing loss, and nearly one in three of them
is 65 or older. In reality, this number is higher — these are just the
ones we know about. There’s a silent legion of people who struggle to
hear the TV and understand conversations in background noise yet don’t
take the next step of getting their hearing checked. If you’re one of
these people, you’re putting yourself at increased risk for depression,
social withdrawal, and worse.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-28, updated: 2024-10-29, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE Truth is WE the People need to “get-out &amp; VOTE” even though
this is a midterm election it is still critical to our very future and
quality of life. Statistical data has proven that “the lower the voter
turnout can be equated to the very quality of government” as it is
directly tied to having an accountable government.  If WE don’t hold
those in office accountable on election day then WE have not done OUR
job, as citizens have a fiduciary DUTY to “be informed &amp; vote.” So,
if you are one who gets in the voting booth and doesn’t know WHO someone
is, it can be a good sign not to vote for them or a bad sign that you
didn’t do your homework as a voter.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-28, updated: 2024-10-29, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(AP) — In Edward Berger’s “Conclave,” the selection of the pope is no
holy affair. Instead, it’s a petty, political campaign carried out in
secrecy, where gossip flows, agendas are malleable and loyalties are
fleeting. All are there to serve God, they say. But we all know how
helpful that has been in conflicts throughout history. “Conclave” might
not have much new or interesting to say about the Catholic Church, but
it is a deliriously fun watch in the way that tense, smart thrillers
with an ensemble of great actors can be.</p>
