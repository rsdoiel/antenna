## Australia/Lord_Howe is the weirdest timezone

date: 2024-10-30, from: OS News

The standard trope when talking about timezones is to rattle off falsehoods programmers believe about them. These lists are only somewhat enlightening – it’s really hard to figure out what truth is just from the contours of falsehood. So here’s an alternative approach. I’m gonna show you some weird timezones. In fact, the&#160;weirdest&#160;timezones. They’re each about as weird as timezones are allowed to get in some way. ↫ Ulysse Carion The reason why timezones are often weird is not only things like the shape of countries dictating where the actual timezones begin and end, but also because of politics. A lot of politics. The entirety of China runs on Beijing time, even though it covers five geographical timezones. Several islands in the Pacific were forced by their colonisers to run on insanely offset timezones because it made exploiting them easier. Time in Europe is political, too &#8211; countries like The Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Spain should really be in the same time zone as the UK, but adopted UTC+1 because it aligns better with the rest of mainland Europe. Although anything is better than whatever the hell Dutch Time was. Then there is, of course, daylight savings, which is a whole pointless nightmare in and of itself that should be abolished. Daylight savings rules and exceptions alone cover a ton of the oddities and difficulties with timezones, which is reason enough to get rid of it, aside from all the other possible issues, but a proposal to abolish it in the EU has sadly stalled.

## Improving Xwayland window resizing

date: 2024-10-30, from: OS News

Speaking of Wayland, one of the most important parts of the transition is Xwayland, which makes sure legacy X applications not yet capable of running under a modern graphics stack can continue to function. Xwayland applications have had this weird visual glitch during resize operations, however, where the opposite side of the window would expand and contract while resizing. KDE developer Vlad Zahorodnii wanted to fix this, and he wrote a very detailed article explaining why, exactly, this bug happens, which takes you deep into the weeds of X and Wayland. Window resizing in X would be a glitchy mess, if it wasn&#8217;t for the X11 protocol to synchronize window repaints during interactive resize, which ensures that the window resize and the application repainting its window contents remain synchronised. This protocol is supported by Kwin and GNOME&#8217;s Mutter, so what&#8217;s the problem here? Shouldn&#8217;t everything just work? KWin supports the basic frame synchronization protocol, so there should be no visual glitches when resizing X11 windows in the Plasma Wayland session, right? At quick glance, yes, but we forget about the most important detail: Wayland compositors don’t use XCompositeNameWindowPixmap() or xcb_composite_name_window_pixmap() to grab the contents of X11 windows, instead they rely on Xwayland attaching graphics buffers to wl_surface objects, so there is no strict order between the Wayland compositor receiving an XSync request acknowledgement and graphics buffers for the new window size. ↫ Vlad Zahorodnii Basically, the goal of the fix is to make sure these steps are also synchronised when using Xwayland, and that&#8217;s exactly what Zahorodnii has achieved. This makes the resizing X windows under Xwayland look normal and without weird visual glitches, which is a massive improvement to the overall experience of using a Wayland desktop with a few stray X applications. Thanks to this fix, which was made possible with help from Wayland developers, Kwin is now one of the few compositors that correctly synchronises X windows running under Wayland. KDE has been doing an amazing job moving from X to Wayland, and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone else who has managed to make the transition quite as painless. Not only do KDE developers focus on difficult bugs like this one that many others would just shrug off as acceptable jank, they also made things like the Wayland to X11 Video Bridge, a desktop-agnostic tool to allow things like screen sharing in Teams, Discord, Slack, etc. to work properly on Wayland.

## New Raspberry Pi OS switches everyone over to Wayland

date: 2024-10-30, from: OS News

The slow rise of Wayland hasn&#8217;t really been slow anymore for years now, and today another major part of the Linux ecosystem is making the jump from X to Wayland. So we made the decision to switch. For most of this year, we have been working on porting labwc to the Raspberry Pi Desktop. This has very much been a collaborative process with the developers of both labwc and wlroots: both have helped us immensely with their support as we contribute features and optimisations needed for our desktop. After much optimisation for our hardware, we have reached the point where labwc desktops run just as fast as X on older Raspberry Pi models. Today, we make the switch with our latest desktop image: Raspberry Pi Desktop now runs Wayland by default across all models. ↫ Simon Long Raspberry Pi Desktop already used Wayland on some of the newer models, through the use of Wayfire. However, it turned out Wayfire wasn&#8217;t a good fit for the older Pi models, and Wayfire&#8217;x development direction would move it even further away from that goal, which is obviously important to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They eventually settled on using labwc instead, which can also be used on older Pi models. As such, all Pi models will now switch to using Wayland with the latest update to the operating system. This new update also brings vastly improved touchscreen support, a rewritten panel application that won&#8217;t keep removed plugins in memory, a new display configuration utility, and more.

## The OSNews 2024 fundraiser: support OSNews to keep it alive

date: 2024-10-28, from: OS News

Do you want OSNews to continue to exist? Do you like the selection of news items I manage to scrounge up almost every day? Do you want OSNews free from corporate influence, &#8220;AI&#8221;-generated nonsense, and the kind of SEO-optimised blogspam we all despise? Consider supporting OSNews financially, so I can keep running the site as an independent entity, free from the forces that make the web shittier every day. There are several ways you can support OSNews. First, you can become a Patreon. Being an OSNews Patreon means no more ads on OSNews, access to the OSNews Matrix room, and some fancy flair on your comments. The goal is to eventually have enough Patreons supporting us to make us independent even from regular ads, which means we&#8217;ll need to hit at least €1500-€2000 a month. Once we achieve that, we will turn off ads for everyone. OSNews is my job, and thus my only source of income, so we can only turn off ads once community support is high enough to do so. This is obviously a long-term goal. To help us all get there, I&#8217;ve added a brand new, even higher Patreon tier. If being a Platinum Patreon isn&#8217;t enough for you, you can now move on up and become an Antimatter Patreon for €50/month. You&#8217;ll get all the same benefits as the Platinum tier, but on top of that, you can opt to have your name permanently displayed on the frontpage in our sidebar. This tier is really specifically designed for the most hardcore supporters of OSNews, and can even be used as a bit of a marketing tool for yourself. By the way, I do not know where to go after antimatter. What&#8217;s rarer and more expensive than antimatter? Second, you can make an individual donation to OSNews through Ko-Fi. Recently, my wife, two kids, and I were all hit with, in order, bronchitis, flu, and then a minor cold. With all of us down and out, unable to work, our finances obviously took a bit of a hit. My wife works in home care for the elderly, which isn&#8217;t exactly a job with a fair wage, so any time we can&#8217;t work it hits us hard. Individual Ko-Fi donations have proven to be lifesavers. As such, I&#8217;ve set up a Ko-Fo donation target of €2500, so my wife, kids, and I can build up a bit of a buffer for emergencies. Creating such a buffer will be a huge load off our backs. Third, we have official OSNews merch! Our merch store is filled with a ton of fun products for the operating system connoisseurs among us, from the basic OSNews T-shirt and mug, to the old-school ASCII-art OSNews T-shirt and sweatshirt, and finally three unique terminal T-shirts showing the terminal of MS-DOS, BeOS, and Mac OS X. Each of the terminal shirts sport the correct colour schemes, text, and fonts. The pricing has been set up in such a way that for each product sold, we receive about $8. OSNews has always been a passion project for everyone involved, and I&#8217;d like to continue that. By making sure we&#8217;re independent, free from the forces that are destroying websites left, right, and centre, OSNews can keep doing what it&#8217;s always done: report on things nobody else covers, without the pressure to post 45 items about every new iPhone, stupid SEO blogspam nonsense about how to plug in a USB cable or whatever, or &#8220;AI&#8221;-generated drudgery. The people making that possible are all of our Patreons, Ko-Fi donors, and merch customers. You have no idea how thankful I am for each and every one of you.

## Planets Beware: NASA Unburies Danger Zones of Star Cluster

## TDE R14.1.3 released, and KDE developers hold impromptu TDE installfest at Akademy 2024

date: 2024-10-28, from: OS News

The Trinity Desktop Environment, a fork of the last release in the KDE 3.x series, has just released their latest version, R14.1.3. Despite its rather small version number change, it contains some very welcome new features. TDE started the process of integrating the XDG Desktop Portal API, which will bring a lot of welcome integration with applications from the wider ecosystem. There&#8217;s also a brand new touchpad settings module, which was something I was sorely missing when I tried out TDE a few months ago. Furthermore, there&#8217;s of course a ton of bugfixes and improvements, but also things like support for tiling windows, some new theme and colour scheme options, and a lot more. Not too long ago, when KDE&#8217;s Akademy 2024 took place, a really fun impromptu event happened. A number of KDE developers got together &#8211; I think in a restaurant or coffee place &#8211; and ended up organising an unplanned TDE installation party. Several photos floated around Mastodon of KDE developers using TDE, and after a few fun interactions between KDE and TDE developers on Mastodon, TDE developers ended up being invited to next year&#8217;s Akademy. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see if the schedules line up, but if any of this can lead to both projects benefiting from some jolly cooperation, it can only be seen as a good thing. Regardless, TDE is an excellent project with a very clear goal, and they&#8217;re making steady progress all the time. It&#8217;s not a fast-paced environment chasing the latest and greatest technologies, but instead builds upon a solid foundation, bringing it into modern world where it makes sense. If you like KDE 3.x, TDE is going to be perfect for you.

## World’s first Haiku ransomware/malware

date: 2024-10-28, from: OS News

There&#8217;s many ways to judge if an operating system has made it to the big leagues, and one of the more unpleasant ones is the availability of malware. Haiku, the increasingly capable and daily-driveable successor to BeOS, is now officially a mainstream operating system, as it just had its first piece of malware. HaikuRansomware is an experimental ransomware project designed for educational and investigative purposes. Inspired by the art of poetry and the challenge of cryptography, this malware encrypts files with a custom extension and provides a ransom note with a poetic touch. This is a proof of concept aimed to push the boundaries of how creative ransomware can be designed. ↫ HaikuRansomware&#8217;s GitHub page Now this is obviously a bit of a tongue-in-cheek, experimental kind of thing, but it&#8217;s still something quite unique to happen to Haiku. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how the ransomware is supposed to spread, but my guess would be through social engineering. With Haiku being a relatively small project, and one wherein every user runs as root &#8211; baron, in BeOS parlance &#8211; I&#8217;m sure anything run through social engineering can do some serious damage without many guardrails in place. Don&#8217;t quote me on that, though, as Haiku may have more advanced guardrails and mitigations in place than classic BeOS did. This proof-of-concept has no ill intent, and is more intended as an art project to highlight what you can do with encryption and ransomware on Haiku today, and I definitely like the art-focused approach of the author.

## What’s new in POSIX 2024 – XCU

date: 2024-10-27, from: OS News

As of the previous release of POSIX, the Austin Group gained more control over the specification, having it be more working group oriented, and they got to work making the POSIX specification more modern. POSIX 2024 is the first release that bears the fruits of this labor, and as such, the changes made to it are particularly interesting, as they will define the direction of the specification going forwards. This is what this article is about! Well, mostly. POSIX is composed of a couple of sections. Notably XBD (Base Definitions, which talk about things like what a file is, how regular expressions work, etc), XSH (System Interfaces, the C API that defines POSIX’s internals), and XCU (which defines the shell command language, and the standard utilities available for the system). There’s also XRAT, which explains the rationale of the authors, but it’s less relevant for our purposes today. XBD and XRAT are both interesting as context for XSH and XCU, but those are the real meat of the specification. This article will focus on the XCU section, in particular the utilities part of that section. If you’re more interested in the XSH section, there’s an excellent summary page by&#160;sortix’s&#160;Jonas Termansen that you can read&#160;here. ↫ im tosti The weekend isn&#8217;t over yet, so here&#8217;s some more light reading.

## The MIPS ‘ThinkPad’ and the unreleased Commodore HHC-4

date: 2024-10-27, from: OS News

Old Vintage Computing Research, by the incredibly knowledgeable Cameron Kaiser, is one of the best resources on the web about genuinely obscure retrocomputing, often diving quite deep in topics nobody else covers &#8211; or even can cover, considering how rare some of the hardware Kaiser covers is. I link to Old VCR all the time, and today I&#8217;ve got two more great articles by Kaiser for you. First, we&#8217;ve got the more well-known &#8211; relatively speaking &#8211; of the two devices covered today, and that&#8217;s the MIPS ThinkPad, officially known as the IBM WorkPad z50. This was a Windows CE 2.11 device powered by a NEC VR4120 MIPS processor, running at 131 Mhz, released in 1999. Astute readers might note the WorkPad branding, which IBM also used for several rebranded Palm Pilots. Kaiser goes into his usual great detail covering this device, with tons of photos, and I couldn&#8217;t stop reading for a second. There&#8217;s so much good information in here I have no clue what to highlight, but since OSNews has OS in the name, this section makes sense to focus on: The desktop shortcuts are pre-populated in ROM along with a whole bunch of applications. The marquee set that came on H/PC Pro machines was Microsoft Pocket Office (Pocket Word, Pocket Excel, Pocket Access and Pocket PowerPoint), Pocket Outlook (Calendar, Contacts, Inbox and Tasks) and Pocket Internet Explorer, but Microsoft also included Calculator, InkWriter (not too useful on the z50 without a touch screen), Microsoft Voice Recorder, World Clock, ActiveSync (a la Palm HotSync), PC Link (direct connect, not networked), Remote Networking, Terminal (serial port and modem), Windows Explorer and, of course, Solitaire. IBM additionally licensed and included some of bSquare&#8217;s software suite, including bFAX Pro for sending and receiving faxes with the softmodem, bPRINT for printing and bUSEFUL Backup Plus for system backups, along with a battery calibrator and a Rapid Access quick configuration tool. There is also a CMD.EXE command shell, though it too is smaller and less functional than its desktop counterpart. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research Using especially these older versions of Windows CE is a wild experience, because you can clearly tell Microsoft was trying really hard to make it look and feel like &#8216;normal&#8217; Windows, but as anyone who used Windows CE back then can attest, it was a rather poor imitation with a ton of weird limitations and design decisions borne from the limited hardware it was designed to run on. I absolutely adore the various incarnations of Windows CE and associated graphical shells it ran &#8211; especially the PocketPC days &#8211; but there&#8217;s no denying it always felt quite clunky. Moving on, the second Old VCR article I&#8217;m covering today is more difficult for me to write about, since I am too young to have any experience with the 8 bit era &#8211; save for some experience with the MSX platform as a wee child &#8211; so I have no affinity for machines like the Commodore 64 and similar machines from that era. And, well, this article just so happens to be covering something called the Commodore HHC-4. Once upon a time (and that time was Winter CES 1983), Commodore announced what was to be their one and only handheld computer, the Commodore HHC-4. It was never released and never seen again, at least not in that form. But it turns out that not only did the HHC-4 actually exist, it also wasn&#8217;t manufactured by Commodore — it was a Toshiba. Like Superman had Clark Kent, the Commodore HHC-4 had a secret identity too: the Toshiba Pasopia Mini IHC-8000, the very first portable computer Toshiba ever made. And like Clark Kent was Superman with glasses, compare the real device to the Commodore marketing photo and you can see that it&#8217;s the very same machine modulo a plastic palette swap. Of course there&#8217;s more to the story than that. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research Of course, Kaiser hunted down an IHC-8000, and details his experiences with the little handheld, calculator-like machine. It turns out it&#8217;s most likely using some unspecified in-house Toshiba architecture, running at a few hundred kHz, and it&#8217;s apparently quite sluggish. It never made it to market in Commodore livery, most likely because of its abysmal performance. The amount of work required to make this little machine more capable and competitive probably couldn&#8217;t be recouped by its intended list price, Kaiser argues.
