the fall of the Titans as UCLA softball shuts out Cal State
Fullerton</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>

“She was on fire,” said junior catcher Jayla Castro. “When she gets into
a rhythm and a mode, it’s really hard to kind of snap her out of that
and it’s so easy working with her when she gets like that.” The freshman
pitcher/outfielder mowed down eight batters as No. </p>

<p>A research team including UCLA doctoral students and professors found
that sea urchins help maintain the resilience of coral reefs despite
human activity. In the study published in February, researchers measured
algae height in Pacific coral reefs both in the presence and absence of
herbivorous sea urchins and fish, determining that even when most fish
had disappeared, a robust urchin population helped reduce algal height
and improve reef health.</p>
