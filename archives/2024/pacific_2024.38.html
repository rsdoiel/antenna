<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;KYIV, Ukraine &amp;#8212; Ukraine said Saturday that it had struck two large ammunition depots deep inside Russia overnight. It was the second such attack in less than a week as Kyiv seeks to escalate hits on Russian military bases and warehouses to try to disrupt Moscow&amp;#8217;s military logistics and slow its troops&amp;#8217; advance on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The original &amp;#8220;Matlock,&amp;#8221; which aired from 1986 to 1995, was a reimagining of the long-running &amp;#8220;Perry Mason&amp;#8221; legal drama. But instead of a hardnosed attorney at the center of its case-of-the-week format, &amp;#8220;Matlock&amp;#8221; leveraged star Andy Griffith&amp;#8217;s ability to play deceptively unthreatening, and then, in a climatic courtroom showdown, remarkably effective, even lacerating. With the new version of &amp;#8220;Matlock&amp;#8221; on CBS, it&amp;#8217;s best to go into it understanding that it&amp;#8217;s not a reboot so much as a show with a tenuous connection to the intellectual property of its title.

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;For American households, the good news is that inflation rates have largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. Perhaps most importantly, economists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture predict that gains in food price will continue to moderate. Indeed, data compiled by Adobe Inc. shows that online grocery prices fell 3.7% in August from a month earlier, the largest decline since the firm began tracking the numbers in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

ancient Appian Way</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s fitting that it was the expansion-minded ancient Romans who built Europe&amp;#8217;s first super highway &amp;#8212; they understood the value of good roads to growing an empire. And the Appian Way, begun in 312 BC, was the engineering wonder of its day. It connected Rome with Capua (near Naples), ignoring natural contours and running in a straight line for much of the way. Eventually it stretched 430 miles to Brindisi &amp;#8212; gateway to the East &amp;#8212; where Roman ships sailed for Greece and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
