## Bluesky vs Mastodon as open APIs

date: 2024-09-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>The problem with Mastodon is its protocol is underspecified, therefore interop is really hard, and ultimately the standard, if any emerges, will be decided by big tech companies and will be ridiculously complex. </p>
<p>I think Bluesky has a better chance of being a solid standard you can build on, though I find it fairly incomprehensible, but other people seem to understand it well enough, and I've been able to get it to do what I need. Kind of like Amazon's web service APIs. The designers seem smart, and are accessible (a big plus). On the other hand, I've already had apps built on their api break. </p>
<p>Neither one is in a particularly strong position. </p>
<p>Bluesky should factor their API, provide a profile, and a simple API you can adapt to in a weekend, for most common things people want to hook into. And they should commit to not breaking that profile. Their protocol has a lot of generality that gets in the way of doing things that 99% of devs need to do. </p>
<p>Of course Mastodon isn't supposed to be an API, the underlying API was supposed to be ActivityPub, but as I understand, that isn't complete, and they need the functionality now, so they've implemented a REST API for the other stuff. Makes sense, it's what I would do in this situation. On the other hand, that pretty much guarantees that a big part of this interface is going to be deprecated, meaning many developers, myself included, will just wait till we get there. </p>
<p>As I said above I fully expect Meta (ie Facebook) will drive that process, that people will choose to interop with their product over Mastodon and over ActivityPub. Names like "fediverse" get walked over and perverted by big tech companies. We will find ourselves soon talking about the Meta-fediverse and the Masto-fediverse or (somesuch). </p>
<p>I've seen countless of good, clear, solid ideas get muddied by big tech companies. This idea, the fediverse, got completely muddied before the BigCos got involved.  Still more hard work to do, and it must be working <i>together. </i>It doesn't work if people try to throw their non-existent weight around. That's basically with the big companies. </p>

They could have done what Automattic has done with WordPress. It's a private company so I don't know how much it's growing or how profitable it is, but from outside it's obviously growing and profitable. Basically, charge writers for the service, or lots of services. Little extras you can add to your site. Use it as a hook to sell domain names (huge recurring business). And open source the Medium editor, when it came out it was a breakthrough in usability, and offer it to Google to bundle with Chrome, upgrade the whole web while you're at it. With billions of windfall from the success of Twitter, why argue over nickels and dimes. That's what I always wondered about the thinking behind Medium. Ev had the ability to change the course of the industry, and make the same kind of money Google and Microsoft make. And yes, I did urge him to do <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+medium">all this</a> at the time, publicly (didn't have access to him privately, if you can believe that).

<a href="http://scripting.com/2004/09.html">September 2004</a> was the month when podcasting became a real community thing. <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/17/152838.html">Twenty years ago</a>. I did eight podcasts that month. The mail list, which Adam started, was going strong. This is the month where <a href="http://scripting.com/2013/04/07/howPodcastingGotItsName.html">podcasting got its name</a>, thanks to some brilliant creativity from Dannie Gregoire. Until then we were calling them "audio blog posts" or some variant thereof. You can see it in this <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=podcast">Google Trends</a> graph. I started a <a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">special feed</a> to echo my programs from 2004, I even got it registered in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298">Apple's podcast</a> database.  There will be two podcasts in the feed today because I missed the one from yesterday. <i>Still diggin!</i>

## SQL Injection Attack on Airport Security

date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting <a href="https://ian.sh/tsa">vulnerability</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;a special lane at airport security called Known Crewmember (KCM). KCM is a TSA program that allows pilots and flight attendants to bypass security screening, even when flying on domestic personal trips.</p>
<p>The KCM process is fairly simple: the employee uses the dedicated lane and presents their KCM barcode or provides the TSA agent their employee number and airline. <a href="https://www.apfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/KCM-Program-Changes_OCT19.pdf">Various forms of ID</a> need to be presented while the TSA agent&#8217;s laptop verifies the employment status with the airline. If successful, the employee can access the sterile area without any screening at all...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-08-22 One Page Dungeon Reviews

date: 2024-09-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-22-one-page-dungeon-reviews">2024-08-22 One Page Dungeon Reviews</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.dungeoncontest.com/">One Page Dungeon Contest</a> submissions are being read and discussed by the judges in private but if you have a submission you&rsquo;d like to get a paragraph of review and feedback on, <a href="Contact">let me know</a>. I&rsquo;m happy to write a few words on this page.</p>

<p><a href="https://malachijs.itch.io/sundial-siphon">Sundial Siphon</a>: I love the myconid picture and map; I had to read the part about the rotating map multiple times and I&rsquo;m still not sure it really contributes to the game. Sometimes doors cannot be opened, sometimes some rooms cannot be reached, but I&rsquo;d have to see it at the table. I liked the colour coding of monsters and connections. It says twice &ldquo;Takes some time to clear&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s unclear what the drawback is since there are no random encounters? Is it a quarter rotation? Reading the Siphon makes me think that after 4 phases all player characters are trapped in constructs? That seems rather harsh. The dungeon says that that players are racing against the clock but I think players wouldn&rsquo;t know that, so some sort of warning might be apt? There&rsquo;s a warning in room 4 but I feel a better warning is required, or the siphon should only affect room 5? In any case, the dungeon seems promising! 😄</p>

<p><a href="https://peninsulancestral.itch.io/epona-temple">Epona&rsquo;s Temple</a>: I love the idea of achieving a permanent blessing of Epona. The map is beautiful. I feel that the map doesn&rsquo;t make clear which of the obstacles are easy to sidestep. Can people go from 3 to 5 without crossing 4 or 8? In 4 there&rsquo;s a presence of insects but it wasn&rsquo;t clear to mean what that entails since there are no insect stats. From a logic perspective the abandoned camp is puzzling. In any case, the rewards at the end are my favourite thing. They match the premise at the entrance and the theme of the temple itself. Love that. <em>E gostei muito de ver um versão que não seja Inglesa. Muito bem feito!</em> 😄</p>

## 2024-08-29 msmtp and app armor

date: 2024-09-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-29-msmtp-and-app-armor">2024-08-29 msmtp and app armor</h1>

<p>I tried to send an email from Emacs and it didn&rsquo;t work. The error was:</p>

<pre><code>msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>

<p>I was able to reproduce the problem with the following <code>hello.txt</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>From: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
To: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
Subject: Test

This is the test.
</code></pre>

<p>And then feeding that to <code>msmtp</code> with debugging enabled (<code>-d</code>) and reading recipients from the mail (<code>-t</code>):</p>

<pre><code>msmtp -d -t &lt; hello.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Now I had more info, however:</p>

<pre><code>ignoring system configuration file /etc/msmtprc: No such file or directory
ignoring user configuration file /home/alex/.config/msmtp/config: Permission denied
falling back to default account
msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>

<p>I checked permissions, and it was 0600 for the config file.
Online, I found a reference to AppArmor.
Taking a peek at <code>/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp</code> I didn&rsquo;t see anything surprising.
But then I grew suspicious… I had in fact moved <code>~/.config/msmtp</code> to <code>~/src/home/.config/msmtp</code> (which is a Git repository) and replaced that with a symbolic link. AppArmor didn&rsquo;t like this and decided that <code>msmtp</code> was not allowed to read that other file.
Moving the directory back solved this problem.</p>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll be making occasional copies of this file into the Git repository. 😒</p>

And for some companies, the founder of a company they acquire might make the best CEO when the founder of the original company isn't available. Again Apple is a great example. Steve Jobs ultimately replaced Gil Amelio, after Apple bought NeXT.

Graham uses Steve Jobs as an example. He knew what was and wasn't an Apple product. A hired CEO would have to have that explained to him. Sculley, who Graham cites, is a perfectly nice person in my experience, had no idea how to deal with Windows. Very different from a consumer product like fizzy water. Who but Steve Jobs would have thought that an iPod was a proper product for a company that made PCs. I think he himself wanted it, and that's what made something an Apple product. It's probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the products Jobs created for them. He told <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook">Cook</a> to innovate on his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody would be able to do it. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

Another rule for whoever runs a tech company, they must themselves be a fanatical user of the company's product. They must love it the way a founder loves it. They must think the users are the smartest people in the world because they love the best product in the world. As a founder, I could not visualize the day I left the company for the last time. In hindsight I felt that was the one factor most responsible for the success of the company.

As a founder myself, I think I can tell you why founders have a central role to play as the company grows. They're the only ones who know how the company was built, and what works and what doesn't and how to keep it consistent for customers and partners, and the founder, if the company grew, is tuned into to what makes the company work, and will see opportunities that even well-intentioned managers miss. I remember when a company I was a developer for, early in my career, switched out the founder and replaced him with a professional CEO. The founder had problems managing, and could have used help imho, but -- the founder understood what the company was about, and the professional claimed to be a "market of one" and therefore didn't have an opinion about what products the company should make. That would be delegated to people he hired. Almost as if the people running a company were just modules and servers, and if you needed to grow you just bought new modules. In this case. I can write this because I don't have to get approval from anyone else. I'm sure in a company of today someone would take offense at something I wrote here. That my friends is another reason why companies have a hard time scaling. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
