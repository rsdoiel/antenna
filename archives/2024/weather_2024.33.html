Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0729 AM CDT Wed Aug 14 2024

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR EASTERN
NEBRASKA...SOUTHWEST IOWA...NORTHEAST KANSAS...AND NORTHWEST
MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms capable of all hazards are possible
late this afternoon through the evening across adjacent portions of
the mid and lower Missouri Valley.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid- to upper-level
shortwave trough over WY/CO moving east-northeast.  This upper
feature is forecast to rotate through the base of a larger-scale
trough and move into the eastern ND/northern MN vicinity by daybreak
Thursday.  In its wake, an upstream perturbation will move from
southeast OR/southern ID into NE by late tonight.  Consequently, an
upper ridge will shift eastward from the lower-mid MO Valley through
the mid MS Valley during the period.  

At the surface, weak/broad low pressure initially over the High
Plains is forecast to gradually consolidate as it shifts eastward
across the central Plains, in tandem with the advance of the upper
trough.  As this occurs, a cool front will shift southeastward
across the central Plains through the afternoon and evening. 
Overnight, further consolidation of the surface low is expected as
it moves slowly northeastward into southern Minnesota, while the
trailing front sharpens, extending from the low southwestward across
Kansas and into New Mexico by the end of the period.

...Mid to lower Missouri Valley...
Mid morning radar/IR satellite mosaic shows an MCS over northern
MO/IA with a well-developed MCV moving east-northeast over northeast
NE.  This activity will continue to weaken this morning and become
increasingly displaced from KS/NE where a renewed focus for
thunderstorm development will occur later today.  The remnant
outflow boundary will likely persist into the afternoon across
the southeastern Nebraska/northwestern Missouri/southwestern Iowa
area and modify as heating occurs to the west edge of the MCS cirrus
canopy.  Rich low-level moisture was sampled this morning on the
Topeka, KS 12 UTC raob (16.7 g/kg lowest 100-mb mean mixing ratio). 
Southerly low-level flow will aid in moistening the airmass as
insolation contributes to moderate to strong buoyancy (2000-4000
J/kg  MLCAPE) by peak heating.  

By late afternoon as low pressure and the cold front shifts
eastward into this area, the low/front and remnant outflow should
all provide low-level foci for storm initiation.  With enhanced
southerly low-level flow ahead of the advancing mid-level trough
beneath moderate (30 to 40 kt) mid-level westerlies, resulting shear
suggests that initial storms will likely be supercells capable of
producing large hail (1 to 2.5 inches in diameter).  Enlarged
hodographs along and north of the modified outflow boundary suggest
a tornado risk will probably accompany a couple of the more intense
supercells, where surface to 0.5 km flow remains relatively backed
beneath a belt of 30-40 700-mb flow.  Given modest flow above 300
mb, upscale growth into a cluster is forecast to occur relatively
quickly during the early evening with a band further consolidating
into a eastward-moving line by mid to late evening.  Coincident with
the transition to upscale growth, the tornado risk will gradually
wane and severe gusts capable of wind damage will become the primary
concern.  This activity will likely persist as a linear MCS but the
severe threat should lessen with east extent towards the MS River
late.  

...Wyoming and vicinity eastward across the northern and central
Plains...
As the upper trough -- comprised of several vorticity maxima
embedded in the broader cyclonic flow field -- shifts across the
Rockies toward/into the Plains, daytime heating beneath cooler air
at mid levels will support modest destabilization across a broad
area.  Ascent -- focused near favored higher terrain areas and near
various weak surface boundaries -- will contribute to widely
scattered thunderstorm development during the afternoon.  Moderate
mid-level westerlies will contribute to shear sufficient for a few
stronger storms -- and attendant risks for hail and locally
strong/severe wind gusts into the evening hours.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CDT Wed Aug 14 2024

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough is forecast to cross the northern
California coast early Thursday morning and deepen over western
Oregon during the afternoon hours, bringing with it multiple rounds
of isolated dry thunderstorms across central and eastern Oregon. 


...Dry Thunderstorms...
Some dry thunderstorms are expected to be ongoing at the start of 
the period Thursday morning. However, the greatest likelihood for
thunderstorms will be in the afternoon and early evening hours,
where a mix of scattered wet/dry thunderstorms are forecast across
central and eastern Oregon. Even though fuels are near or at the
90th annual percentile over much of Oregon, the mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms and relatively slow storm motions should result in at
least some wetting rainfall limiting the overall threat despite
scattered storm coverage. 

...Dry/Windy...
Surface winds are expected to remain below Elevated fire-weather
criteria, except for where diurnally and terrain-driven winds are
locally maximized. Given the localized nature of the better surface
winds, no highlights are expected at this time.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1024 AM CDT Tue Aug 13 2024

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with some adjustments made to
the isolated dry-thunderstorm risk area. This was done primarily to
account for the cessation of thunderstorm potential across parts of
northeast OR/far southwest WA as the first round of convection exits
the region and is followed by areas of wetting rainfall (per MRMS
estimates). A second round of isolated dry thunderstorms is still
anticipated this afternoon across parts of eastern OR into
west/southwest ID. See the previous discussion for additional
details.

..Moore.. 08/13/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CDT Tue Aug 13 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough and associated vorticity maximum will
move northeastward from California into eastern Oregon and
Washington. In response to the approaching trough, southerly
low-level flow will transport modified monsoonal moisture northward
into portions of eastern Oregon and into Idaho, where modest PWAT
values of 0.6-0.8 will support the occurrence of dry thunderstorms.
Some locally enhanced fire-weather conditions are possible across
portions of the Great Basin, particularly in northeastern Nevada.
However, in the absence of any large-scale pressure gradients, any
stronger winds will be diurnally/terrain-driven. 

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Two rounds of dry thunderstorms are possible across portions of
eastern Oregon and into Idaho, where some dry thunder will be
ongoing at the start of the forecast period, and another round
should develop around 21Z. Current forecast guidance places more
confidence in the later-period thunder, rather than the early-period
thunder. However, with modest PWAT values and storm motions of about
25-30 kts, wetting rainfall will be limited over fuels that are
receptive to new ignitions. 

...Dry/Windy...
Some locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible across
northeastern Nevada. While fuels guidance suggests some
receptiveness to new ignitions, and relative humidity values will
fall to 15-20%, sustained winds reaching elevated criteria will be
localized to terrain features. This will preclude any highlight
areas at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1889
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0634 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 122334Z - 130100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A supercell thunderstorm capable of damaging winds, hail,
and perhaps a tornado is tracking southward across portions of
northeast Colorado. Given the isolated nature of this storm, weather
watch issuance is not likely.

DISCUSSION...The severe weather threat associated with a
southward-moving supercell in northeast Colorado may persist for the
next 1-2 hours. The storm has exhibited signs of prolonged low-level
rotation, has produced 2.00 inch hail, and is moving into an
environment that will continue to support updraft rotation. Forecast
proximity hodographs indicate there is sufficient curvature of the
low-level flow and streamwise vorticity to support continued
low-level mesocyclone development and cycling. Both the curvature
and magnitude of the low-level hodograph is expected to increase as
the nocturnal low-level jet strengthens with the decoupling of the
boundary-layer. However, recent radar trends suggest the storm is
struggling to stay ahead of its own outflow, where temperatures are
15-20 F cooler than unmodified inflow. This supercell will likely
undergo several phases of organized low-level rotation, followed by
surging outflow, until the boundary-layer eventually stabilizes this
evening and convection becomes more elevated in nature.

Mesoscale Discussion 1888

Areas affected...North-central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 122213Z - 130015Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A potential will exist for marginally severe gusts and
hail early this evening across parts of north-central Montana. No
watch issuance is anticipated.

DISCUSSION...The latest water-vapor imagery shows a subtle shortwave
trough over the northern Rockies, embedded in southwest mid-level
flow. At the surface, a mesolow is analyzed over north-central
Montana, with upslope east-southeasterly flow located across much of
northern and eastern Montana. Isolated thunderstorms have developed
near and to the north of the low along a narrow corridor of
instability, where the RAP is estimating SBCAPE in the 1000 to 1500
J/kg range. Short-term forecast soundings in north-central Montana
early this evening have a relatively dry boundary layer, but show
steep lapse rates and moderate deep-layer shear. This may be enough
for a marginal severe threat for a few hours. Strong gusts and hail
will be possible.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL/NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MID-MISSOURI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
At least isolated severe thunderstorms may occur Wednesday across
parts of the northern/central Plains into the mid Missouri Valley.

...Synopsis...
A band of elevated thunderstorms will likely be ongoing at the
beginning of the period across a broad region of isentropic ascent
from southeast South Dakota to southern Missouri. As the low-level
jet weakens through the morning, expect the intensity of these
storms to lessen as they move east into a more stable airmass. To
the west, an unstable airmass is forecast across much of the central
and northern Plains in the vicinity of a broad surface trough. At
least weak to moderate instability is forecast with the potential
for greater instability in eastern NE/KS where higher dewpoints
(upper 60s to low 70s) are forecast.

The breakdown of the upper-level ridge will lead to height falls
across much of the central and northern Plains. Given the unstable
environment across much of the area, this weak upper-level forcing
combined with the surface trough will likely result in scattered
thunderstorms across much of the central and northern Plains
Wednesday afternoon/evening. A more focused threat may exist farther
south across eastern Kansas in Nebraska. Some enhancement of the
mid-level flow ahead of the ridge breakdown may lead to a localized
region of more favorable wind shear, co-located with the forecast
greater instability. If this occurs, particularly with the
development of a surface low as forecast by the NAM/ECMWF, a locally
greater severe weather threat may occur across this region. At this
time, uncertainty in the mesoscale features which will impact this
potential are too great to warrant higher severe weather
probabilities.

The potential for widespread critical fire weather conditions
remains low through the extended period. Long-range ensemble
guidance continues to suggest mean troughing will become established
along the West Coast with upper ridging over the southern and
central CONUS through the work week and into next weekend. This
synoptic regime will favor widespread rain/thunderstorm chances for
much of the country with the exception of NV/CA and portions of
central TX.

...D4/Thursday - Pacific Northwest...
The evolving synoptic regime will favor multiple weak upper
disturbances propagating across the northern Great Basin as an upper
low slowly amplifies off the West Coast through the work week and
into the upcoming weekend. Multiple runs from the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian
model families (and associated ensembles) have shown a consistent
signal for convection across portions of OR on D4/Thursday as one
such disturbances moves across the region. While the probability for
convection is somewhat meager (around 40% based on blended ensemble
guidance), forecast PWAT values and QPF probabilities suggest that
thunderstorms that do development may be dry and pose a fire weather
concern given antecedent dry fuels and recent lighting starts across
this region. Low (10%) risk highlights have been introduced to
address this concern.

...Great Basin...
The evolving synoptic regime will favor multiple weak upper
disturbances propagating across the northern Great Basin as an upper
low slowly amplifies off the West Coast through the work week and
into the upcoming weekend. This will support multiple days of breezy
conditions across the Great Basin - primarily across NV - where
conditions should remain dry (RH in the low teens to low 20s) within
a persistent downslope flow regime off the Sierra Nevada. Areas of
elevated fire weather conditions appear possible each day, but the
synoptic regime will favor weak low-level mass responses and modest
surface winds. 

...Texas...
Ensemble guidance continues to show a strong signal for dry
conditions and afternoon high temperatures returning into the low
100s through the upcoming weekend. These hot/dry conditions will
support drying most fuels, especially grasses across west to
northwest TX where the hottest conditions are expected. The building
upper ridge will limit the potential for widespread, strong gradient
winds, but trends forecast wind speeds and fuels will be monitored.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Valid 122000Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
COASTAL CAROLINAS...CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...EASTERN GREAT BASIN
NORTHWARD INTO PARTS OF THE NORTH-CENTRAL ROCKIES...AND NORTHERN
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today over parts of the
coastal Carolinas, central High Plains, the eastern Great Basin
northward into parts of the north-central Rockies, and northern
Montana.

...20z Update...
No changes are needed to the Day 1 Outlook.

Marginal risk for strong to severe gusts and large hail will
continue through the afternoon across the central High
Plains/Central Plains as well as the Intermountain West into the
northern High Plains. See MCD#1186 and MCD#1885 for more
information.

Additional thunderstorm development is expected across a front
portions of South Carolina this afternoon. Ahead of this boundary,
the air mass has destabilized, with around 2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and
20-30 kts of deep layer shear. Thunderstorms will be capable of
instances of strong to severe wind.

...Central High Plains/Central Plains...
Upslope flow will persist across the central High Plains, helping to
maintain moderate low-level moisture across region. Afternoon
dewpoints are expected to range from the upper 60s in the southeast
CO/northeast NM/western Panhandles vicinity to the mid to upper 50s
across eastern WY. This low-level moisture will help support
moderate buoyancy during the afternoon/evening, although some
limited capping may linger. Thunderstorms are expected to develop
across the higher terrain before then progressing eastward into the
more moist and buoyant airmass downstream. Generally moderate
deep-layer vertical shear coupled with the potential for some
remaining convective inhibition suggest the severe potential will
remain isolated, with damaging gusts and/or large hail as the
primary severe risks. 

Thunderstorms will likely persist eastward into more of the central
Plains, supported by moderate buoyancy and shear and the development
of modest low-level jet. Isolated instances of large hail are
possible, but the overall storm severity will likely be tempered by
limited instability. 

...Intermountain West into the Northern High Plains...
Morning satellite imagery depicts upper ridging centered over TX
covering much of the southern third of the CONUS and also extending
northward into MT. Several shortwave troughs are moving through the
westerlies within the northern periphery of this ridging, including
a low-amplitude shortwave currently moving into ID and
northern/central NV and another, more defined shortwave farther west
off the northern CA coast. Eastward/northeastward progression of
these waves will bring greater mid-level moisture and increased
large-scale forcing for ascent, supporting the development of
scattered to numerous thunderstorms across the region. Mid-level
flow will remain modest, but a few more organized/persistent
updrafts are possible. High cloud bases atop steep low-level lapse
rates could result in a few stronger gusts as these more persistent
storms form into clusters, particularly from northern/central UT
into far eastern ID and far western WY and northern MT.

...Coastal Carolinas...
Far southern periphery of an upper trough currently extending from
Quebec through the Upper OH Valley will glance this region today as
it progresses eastward. Modest (i.e. 20-30kt) mid-level flow will
overspread a moisture-rich airmass (i.e. PWs over 2") in place south
of a front. Scattered thunderstorms should develop along this
boundary by early afternoon then propagate toward and off the coast
by early evening. A few water-loaded downbursts capable of damaging
gusts could be noted with the strongest storms.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0732 PM CDT Sat Aug 10 2024

Valid 110100Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
INTERMOUNTAIN WEST INTO THE HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms, capable of localized severe gusts and
perhaps hail, remain possible this evening over parts of the
Intermountain West and into the High Plains.

...01z Update...

Mid-level short-wave trough is advancing east across the northern
intermountain region early this evening. This feature is beginning
to flatten the ridge over western WY and scattered convection has
responded downstream where boundary-layer heating is maximized. 00z
sounding from SLC exhibits near dry adiabatic lapse rate in the
lowest 4km, and modest deep-layer shear; although, PW values are not
particularly high with values around one inch. Latest diagnostic
data suggests pockets of MLCAPE around 500 J/kg extend from southern
MT into eastern CO where considerably more buoyancy exists,
especially across southeast CO into the northern TX Panhandle.
Several gusts have exceeded 50kt with convection late this afternoon
and this remains the primary concern for the next several hours.
After sunset, boundary-layer cooling should hinder convective gusts
as 0-3km lapse rates weaken.
