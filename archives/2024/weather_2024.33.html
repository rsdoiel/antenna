Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1129 AM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Valid 121630Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
COASTAL CAROLINAS...CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...THE EASTERN GREAT BASIN
NORTHWARD INTO PARTS OF THE NORTH-CENTRAL ROCKIES...AND NORTHERN
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today over parts of the
coastal Carolinas, central High Plains, the eastern Great Basin
northward into parts of the north-central Rockies, and northern
Montana.

...Central High Plains/Central Plains...
Upslope flow will persist across the central High Plains, helping to
maintain moderate low-level moisture across region. Afternoon
dewpoints are expected to range from the upper 60s in the southeast
CO/northeast NM/western Panhandles vicinity to the mid to upper 50s
across eastern WY. This low-level moisture will help support
moderate buoyancy during the afternoon/evening, although some
limited capping may linger. Thunderstorms are expected to develop
across the higher terrain before then progressing eastward into the
more moist and buoyant airmass downstream. Generally moderate
deep-layer vertical shear coupled with the potential for some
remaining convective inhibition suggest the severe potential will
remain isolated, with damaging gusts and/or large hail as the
primary severe risks. 

Thunderstorms will likely persist eastward into more of the central
Plains, supported by moderate buoyancy and shear and the development
of modest low-level jet. Isolated instances of large hail are
possible, but the overall storm severity will likely be tempered by
limited instability. 

...Intermountain West into the Northern High Plains...
Morning satellite imagery depicts upper ridging centered over TX
covering much of the southern third of the CONUS and also extending
northward into MT. Several shortwave troughs are moving through the
westerlies within the northern periphery of this ridging, including
a low-amplitude shortwave currently moving into ID and
northern/central NV and another, more defined shortwave farther west
off the northern CA coast. Eastward/northeastward progression of
these waves will bring greater mid-level moisture and increased
large-scale forcing for ascent, supporting the development of
scattered to numerous thunderstorms across the region. Mid-level
flow will remain modest, but a few more organized/persistent
updrafts are possible. High cloud bases atop steep low-level lapse
rates could result in a few stronger gusts as these more persistent
storms form into clusters, particularly from northern/central UT
into far eastern ID and far western WY and northern MT.

...Coastal Carolinas...
Far southern periphery of an upper trough currently extending from
Quebec through the Upper OH Valley will glance this region today as
it progresses eastward. Modest (i.e. 20-30kt) mid-level flow will
overspread a moisture-rich airmass (i.e. PWs over 2") in place south
of a front. Scattered thunderstorms should develop along this
boundary by early afternoon then propagate toward and off the coast
by early evening. A few water-loaded downbursts capable of damaging
gusts could be noted with the strongest storms.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1046 AM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR WESTERN NEVADA...

The primary forecast change for this update is an expansion of the
dry-thunderstorm risk area across portions of the Pacific Northwest
and northern Rockies. Morning soundings from BOI, OTX, and MFR all
show cooler mid-level temperatures compared to the previous 24
hours, which should support thunderstorm chances today through
tonight as lift associated with an approaching trough overspreads
the region. GOES imagery also depicts a plume of 0.4 to 0.6 inch
PWAT values across northern CA into central ID that was well sampled
by the BOI sounding, and suggests a slightly better probability for
dry thunderstorms exists through this corridor. A few
lightning-related fire starts associated with a mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms have been reported over the past 24 hours across WA
and ID, and a lack of widespread wetting rainfall has maintained dry
fuels that will support a continued fire weather concern for today
and into the early morning hours Tuesday. 

Other minor adjustments include an expansion of the Elevated risk
area into the Snake River Plain of eastern ID where ensemble
guidance has shown a consistent signal for a few hours of dry
conditions with 15-20 mph winds. See the previous discussion for
additional details.

..Moore.. 08/12/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Mon Aug 12 2024/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough within broader cyclonic flow in the Northwest
will move through central California into western Nevada today. A
surface trough in the Northwest/northern Rockies will promote dry
and breezy conditions in parts of the northern Great Basin.

...Great Basin...
Broadly elevated fire weather conditions are expected over much of
Nevada into far southern Idaho. Winds of 15-20 mph will be the most
common along with 10-20% RH during the afternoon. A small region of
northwest Nevada may experience briefly critical conditions as both
the terrain and the mid-level jet help to enhance surface winds to
20-25 mph.

...Northwest...
Forcing for ascent from the upper trough will promote isolated
thunderstorms from north-central California into central Idaho. With
the mid-level jet more focused in northern Nevada, storm motions
will not be overly fast. A mix of wet and dry thunderstorms are most
probable. Recent CAM guidance also differs on the exact degree of
coverage, but enough confidence in at least isolated activity is
present for highlights.

Valid 121300Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
COASTAL CAROLINAS...CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...THE EASTERN GREAT BASIN
NORTHWARD INTO PARTS OF THE NORTH-CENTRAL ROCKIES...AND NORTHERN
MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today over parts of the
coastal Carolinas, central High Plains, the eastern Great Basin
northward into parts of the north-central Rockies, and northern
Montana.

...Rockies/Central High Plains Region...
Water-vapor imagery this morning depicts a flattened upper
anticyclone centered over east TX/LA and a large-scale trough over
the WA/OR/northern CA coast.  A notable mid-level disturbance will
move from the eastern Pacific east-northeastward into northern NV
during the period.  Mid-level flow ahead of the western U.S.
troughing will not be strong, but a plume of seasonably moist air
from the Four Corners northward into MT will favor scattered to
numerous thunderstorms developing this afternoon into the early
evening.  Heating will steepen 0-3 km lapse rates and promote severe
gusts with the stronger outflow surges from UT northward along the
ID/WY border.  Recent model guidance also indicates widely scattered
to scattered storms developing across northern MT and moving east as
a small thunderstorm cluster.  Localized severe gusts may accompany
this activity before weakening by early to mid evening.  Farther
east over the central High Plains, the maintenance of moist/upslope
flow into the High Plains and higher terrain (i.e., CO Front Range)
will promote isolated to scattered storms developing around peak
heating and moving into the adjacent High Plains.  An isolated risk
for large hail/severe gusts will be the primary hazards with the
stronger storms.  A cluster of storms will likely develop in
response to a nocturnal intensification of a LLJ but waning
instability by late evening will limit overall storm vigor.  

...Coastal Carolinas...
Southern influence of eastern US trough will glance this region
today as a belt of 20-30kt mid-level flow overspreads a very
moisture-rich airmass (i.e., mid to upper 70s deg F surface
dewpoints) south of a front.  Scattered thunderstorms should develop
along this boundary by early afternoon then propagate toward and off
the coast by early evening.  Marginally severe gusts could be noted
with the strongest storms.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0732 PM CDT Sat Aug 10 2024

Valid 110100Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
INTERMOUNTAIN WEST INTO THE HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms, capable of localized severe gusts and
perhaps hail, remain possible this evening over parts of the
Intermountain West and into the High Plains.

...01z Update...

Mid-level short-wave trough is advancing east across the northern
intermountain region early this evening. This feature is beginning
to flatten the ridge over western WY and scattered convection has
responded downstream where boundary-layer heating is maximized. 00z
sounding from SLC exhibits near dry adiabatic lapse rate in the
lowest 4km, and modest deep-layer shear; although, PW values are not
particularly high with values around one inch. Latest diagnostic
data suggests pockets of MLCAPE around 500 J/kg extend from southern
MT into eastern CO where considerably more buoyancy exists,
especially across southeast CO into the northern TX Panhandle.
Several gusts have exceeded 50kt with convection late this afternoon
and this remains the primary concern for the next several hours.
After sunset, boundary-layer cooling should hinder convective gusts
as 0-3km lapse rates weaken.
