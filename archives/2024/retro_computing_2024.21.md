<p>Website technology is becoming increasingly complex and energy intensive, with big companies like Meta and Google leading the dance. ​Is this necessary? What does it really take to get our content online?</p>
<p>​Low←tech Magazine &amp; <a href="https://antoinejaunard.com">Antoine Jaunard</a> are teaming up to bring you a low-tech website making workshop. ​It takes place in Barcelona, at Akasha Hub, on 25 May from 3 to 6 pm.</p>
<p>​Together, we will demystify web technologies by making websites that are simple to create and modify. Websites that can be hosted anywhere, even on a DIY solar powered server.</p>
<p>The workshop will be in English or Spanish depending on you. Come as you are. And just bring your computer.</p>
