## 2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple cursors

date: 2024-06-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-13-anvil-editor-and-multiple-cursors">2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple cursors</h1>

<p>I like how the author of the <a href="https://anvil-editor.net/">Anvil Editor</a> (an <a href="http://acme.cat-v.org/">Acme</a>-like editor) explains how to use it and provides a small number of super-short videos to show it. Here‚Äôs a good way to use video in documentation! This is important because an &ldquo;ACME-like editor&rdquo; is pretty alien for people these days. It relies on three buttons your mouse. The menus are small, editable windows where you select a word with the mouse and the middle mouse button to execute it. You can create your own menus by simply writing them.</p>

<p>This is great, but alien.</p>

<p>I kept wondering how feasible it would be to add a few key bindings to allow one to use it without a mouse. Window switching, selection growing, executing, I keep thinking that it should be possible. That mandatory three button mouse has kept me away from ACME-like editors.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting a bit with adding more keyboard bindings. Since it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have a git repository, I made <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/anvil.git">my own</a> so I can keep track of the patches.</p>

<p>I plan to force-push with abandon.</p>

<p>I try to do a tiny snippet of programming in the mornings or evenings. Currently I&rsquo;m looking at my &ldquo;extending the selection&rdquo; code and how it interacts (badly) with multiple cursors. I guess I don&rsquo;t understand the attraction of multiple cursors compared to &ldquo;record a keyboard macro once and then replay it for the rest of the file, for a fixed number of times, or as long as I keep pressing a key&rdquo; (the way standard Emacs allows me to) compared to alt-clicking a number of times at just the right spot (I guess my mousing is terrible) to place the cursors and then do the necessary edits. Whenever something like this comes, I&rsquo;m editing data files or something like that so I would have to place hundreds or thousands of cursors‚Ä¶ Only one of these approaches scales. I must be missing something about multiple cursors.</p>

<p>When I asked about it on fedi, people recommended I give <code>multiple-cursors</code> for Emacs a try. I looked at the <a href="https://emacsrocks.com/e13.html">Emacs Rocks video for mc</a> and liked it. Again, this is video documentation well done, essentially a <em>demo</em>, not a manual.</p>

<p>I started using for small things (a handful of lines) where it was indeed easier to use than keyboard macros or regular expressions because of the immediate feedback and the ability to undo any damage done and still continue the operation. Nice!</p>

<p>I still ‚ô•Ô∏è Emacs!</p>

## Why Google should know my blog

date: 2024-06-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I did a search on my site for NakedJen. </p>
<p>Google thinks I meant "Naked Men."</p>
<p>This is why Google should know I have a blog and it has it indexed, and if it just looks it would know that question shows how <b>dumb</b> it is. </p>
<p>When I type my mother's name in, searching on my own blog (again) it tries to correct the spelling of her name. My own mother's name.</p>
<p>Google started out so smart then they must have lost all the smart people. Or they got stupid? I don't know. But there's so much they could do to improve their product, it would be sensible to, while they're shooting for the fences, do the small things that would give users an idea that there's <i>some</i> humanity to the product. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/13/nakedJenOrNakedMen.png"></center>NakedJen or "Naked Men."</div></p>
<p>PS: ChatGPT should also know where my blog is, and it should be constantly loading the updates. This is the freaking breakthrough. Do it. </p>

I have not been doing this in conjunction with Automattic, I'm not sure we're on the same planet re what WordPress is for. Ultimately it'll be their decision if this idea gains traction. But I keep hearing people ask for this product, and I think it's the reason Substack and Ghost have become popular.

It was a lucky thing when I designed the format for <a href="https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists">subscription lists</a> back in the 00s that it included the <i>htmlUrl</i> attribute, it makes the HTML easier to find (though the channel-level link element in the feed could play the same role). Anyway, of course I'm using a SQL database for all this, and when I was thinking about it initially I thought "no big deal" it's a variant of a SQL table I've now done a dozen times. But it was a big deal, because I've yet to come up with a way to factor this so that I have a library that knows how to make the kind of table that keeps coming up all the time, to bury the complexity and make creating a new one much simpler. Same thing with CSS and JavaScript. I know the justification for CSS is that it makes scaling from phones to desktops possible, but that would be equally possible if you provided a good object with properties that can be configured at runtime. That's how we do it on servers with a config.json file. Then you could do a much better job of factoring browser-based apps. Imagine how much smoother everything would be if these structures could be factored. This probably doesn't make sense to too many people, maybe it won't even make sense to me in a couple of years, when hopefully I've moved on to a better way of doing these things. I would love to have the time to take a crack at doing the factoring anyway, I'm sure it's possible, just not obvious how to do it. In the meantime I think there are now enough blogrolls out there to build something interesting out of them, which is why I'm taking my break from <i>The Next Product</i> to do this.

## Chrome OS switching to the Android Linux kernel and related Android subsystems

date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News

Surprisingly quietly, in the middle of Apple&#8217;s WWDC, Google&#8217;s ChromeOS team has made a rather massive announcement that seems to be staying a bit under the radar. Google is announcing today that it is replacing many of ChromeOS&#8217; current relatively standard Linux-based subsystems with the comparable subsystems from Android. To continue rolling out new Google AI features to users at a faster and even larger scale, we‚Äôll be embracing portions of the Android stack, like the Android Linux kernel and Android frameworks, as part of the foundation of ChromeOS. We already have a strong history of collaboration, with¬†Android apps available on ChromeOS¬†and the start of unifying our¬†Bluetooth stacks¬†as of ChromeOS 122. ‚Ü´ Prajakta Gudadhe and Alexander Kuscher on the Chromium blog The benefits to Google here are obvious: instead of developing and maintaining two variants of the Linux kernel and various related subsystems, they now only have to focus on one, saving money and time. It will also make it easier for both platforms to benefit from new features and bugfixes, which should benefit users of both platforms quite a bit. As mentioned in the snippet, the first major subsystem in ChromeOS to be replaced by its Android counterpart is Bluetooth. ChromeOS was using the BlueZ Bluetooth stack, the same one used by most (all?) Linux distributions today, which was initially developed by Qualcomm, but has now switched over to using Fluoride, the one from Android. According to Google, Fluoride has a number of benefits over BlueZ. It runs almost entirely in userspace, as opposed to BlueZ, where more than 50% of the code resides in the kernel. In addition, Fluoride is written in Rust, and Google claims it has a simpler architecture, making it easier to perform testing. Google also highlights that Fluoride has a far larger userbase &#8211; i.e., all Android users &#8211; which also presents a number of benefits. Google performed internal tests to measure the improvements as a result from switching ChromeOS from BlueZ to Fluoride, and the test results speak for themselves &#8211; pairing is faster, pairing fails less often, and reconnecting an already paired device fails less often. With Bluetooth being a rather problematic technology to use, any improvements to the user experience are welcome. At the end of Google&#8217;s detailed blog post about the switch to Fluoride, the company notes that it intends for the project as whole &#8211; which is called Project Floss &#8211; to be a standalone open source project, capable of running on any Linux distribution. ‚Ü´ Russ Lindsay, Abhishek Pandit-Subedi, Alain Michaud, and Loic Wei Yu Neng on the chromeOS dev website We aspire to position Project Floss as a standalone open source project that can reach beyond the walls of Google‚Äôs own operating system in a way where we can maximize the overall value and agility of the larger Bluetooth ecosystem. We also intend to support the Linux community as a whole with the goal that Floss can easily run on most Linux distributions. If Fluoride can indeed deliver tangible, measurable benefits in Bluetooth performance on Linux desktops, I have no doubt quite a few distributions will be more than willing to switch over. Bluetooth is used a lot, and if Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, and so on, can improve the Bluetooth experience by switching over, I&#8217;m pretty sure they will, or at least consider doing so.

## Arm, Qualcomm legal battle seen disrupting AI-powered PC wave

date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News

The new Windows on ARM Copilot+ PC thing, running on Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon X Elite and Pro chips, isn&#8217;t even out the door yet, and we&#8217;re already dealing with legal proceedings. But the main conversation among conference attendees was over how a¬†contract dispute¬†between Arm Holdings and Qualcomm, which work together to make the chips powering these new laptops, could abruptly halt the shipment of new PCs that industry leaders expect will make Microsoft and its partners billions of dollars. ‚Ü´ Max A. Cherney at Reuters The basic gist of the story is as follows. Qualcomm acquired a company named Nuvia, founded by former Apple processor engineers, in order to gain new technology to build its Snapdragon X Elite and Pro chips. Nuvia was planning on developing ARM chips for servers, but after the acquisition, Qualcomm changed their plans and repurposed their technology for use in laptops &#8211; the new X chips. ARM claims that Nuvia was only granted a license for server use, and not laptop use. Qualcomm, meanwhile, argued that it has a broad license to use ARM for pretty much anything, and as such, that any possible restrictions Nuvia had are irrelevant. While this all sounds like very rich corporations having a silly legal slapfight, it could have real consequences. If the legal case goes very, very wrong for Qualcomm, it could halt the sale of devices powered by the Snapdragon X chips well before they&#8217;re even shipping. I doubt it&#8217;ll get that far &#8211; it rarely does, and there&#8217;s some big names and big reputations at play here &#8211; but it does highlight the absurdity of how the ARM ecosystem works. Speaking of the ARM ecosystem, Qualcomm isn&#8217;t the only ARM chip makers dying to break into the PC market. Qualcomm currently has a weird exclusivity agreement with Microsoft where it&#8217;s the only ARM chip supplier for PCs, but that agreement is running out soon. Another player that&#8217;s ready to storm this market once that happens is MediaTek, who is also developing a chip geared towards Microsoft&#8217;s Copilot+ specifications, with a release target of 2025. Let&#8217;s hope MediaTek will be as forthcoming with Linux support as Qualcomm surprisingly has been, but I have my sincerest doubt.

## Linus Torvalds: extensible scheduler ‚Äúsched_ext‚Äù in Linux 6.11

date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News

The extensible scheduler &#8220;sched_ext&#8221; code has proven quite versatile for opening up better Linux gaming performance, more quickly prototyping new scheduler changes, Ubuntu/Canonical has been evaluating it for pursuing a more micro-kernel like design, and many other interesting approaches with it. Yet it&#8217;s remained out of tree but that is now changing with the upcoming Linux 6.11 cycle. Linus Torvalds as the benevolent dictator for life &#8220;BDFL&#8221; of the Linux kernel announced he intends to merge the sched_ext patches for Linux 6.11 even though there has been some objections by other kernel developers. Torvalds feels the sched_ext code is ready enough and provides real value to the mainline Linux kernel. It&#8217;s not worth dragging out sched_ext continuing to be out-of-tree. ‚Ü´ Michael Larabel at Phoronix I haven&#8217;t felt the need to mess around with the Linux scheduler in a long, long time &#8211; I have some vague memories of perhaps well over a decade ago where opting for a different scheduler could lead to better desktop-focused performance characteristics, but the details in my brain are so fuzzy that it may just be a fabricated or confabulated memory.

## Microsoft pulls release preview build of Windows 11 24H2 after Recall controversy

date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News

Microsoft recently announced some big changes to the Recall feature in Windows, and now it&#8217;s pulled the Release Preview version which contained Recall entirely. It&#8217;s likely not a coincidence that Microsoft also¬†quietly pulled¬†the build of the Windows 11 24H2 update that it had been testing¬†in its Release Preview channel¬†for Windows Insiders. It&#8217;s not unheard of for Microsoft to stop distributing a beta build of Windows after releasing it, but the Release Preview channel is typically the last stop for a Windows update before a wider release. ‚Ü´ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica The company doesn&#8217;t actually mention why the release was pulled, but the reason is pretty obvious if you connect the dots. I&#8217;m at least glad Microsoft is taking the complaints seriously, and while I don&#8217;t personally think Recall is a good idea, if a user gives their consent and uses it knowingly and willingly, I don&#8217;t see any problems with it.

## Celebrating failure

date: 2024-06-12, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Biographies of great people, interviews with successful entrepreneurs, and podcast episodes with famous creators. The world doesn‚Äôt lack celebrations of greatness. It should be inspiring to hear from someone successful, it should motivate you to do more, to work harder, and to strive for greatness. But like many other good things in life, too much of it can be detrimental. You can ingest only so many success stories before starting to feel bad for not being one of them. It‚Äôs partly why social media mostly sucks. It‚Äôs performative. Everyone is showing the best parts of their lives while the shitty moments are kept private, away from public eyes.</p>
<p>Failure should be shared. Trying and failing at something should be celebrated. Not because of the failure itself but because that‚Äôs the only way to achieve something worthwhile. Failing is inevitable. Everyone has to go through it and confront it one way or another. It‚Äôs part of the process and it‚Äôs something we should be more upfront and open about it. And again, it should be celebrated.</p>
<p>Does anyone make a podcast with interviews with people who didn‚Äôt have success? To people who tried hard but ultimately failed? I‚Äôd love to listen to those stories.</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

A simple <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/44dbe62f-6bac-4b08-880d-91822be0d6c7">example</a> where ChatGPT saves programmer time. MySQL has awful error messages. Rather than try to figure out what they mean, I paste the message into ChatGPT and say nothing. It tells me what the error was and even fixes it for me. I copy the result, paste it into MySQL and I'm back on the road. One can imagine where they build that into the MySQL app and I converse with it instead of the app with the awful error messages.

## wal2mongo v1.0.7 is released

date: 2024-06-12, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>HighGo Software is pleased to announce the first GitHub community release of wal2mongo v1.0.7, which can be used to replicate PostgreSQL database changes to an output format that can be directly fed into the mongo client tool to achieve logical replication between PostgreSQl and MongoDB. Wal2mongo plugin is useful for a case where PostgreSQL is used as the main raw data source to collect data from outside world but MongoDB is used internally for data analytics purposes. Manual data migration between PostgreSQL and MongoDB poses a lot of potential problem and having a logical decoding plugin like wal2mongo can help reduce the data migration complexity between the two databases.</p>
<h2>Source Code on GitHub</h2>
<p>The source code releases of wal2mongo plugin can be found <a href="https://github.com/HighgoSoftware/wal2mongo/releases/tag/v1.0.7">here</a></p>
<h2>Project Home on GitHub</h2>
<p>https://github.com/HighgoSoftware/wal2mongo </p>
<h2>About wal2mongo</h2>
<p>wal2mongo is a PostgreSQL logical decoding output plugin designed to simplify logical replication from PostgreSQL to MongoDB by formatting the output into a JSON-like format accepted by MongoDB. For detailed information on how to use it, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/HighgoSoftware/wal2mongo">here</a></p>
<p>The logical replication application project that can be used with wal2mongo to achieve a fully automatic logical replication setup with enhanced control, security and performance in mind.

<h1 id="swiftnavigation">SwiftNavigation</h1>
<p>To celebrate that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10103">RealityKit's is coming to MacOS, iOS and iPadOS</a> and is no
longer limited to VisionOS, I am releasing
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigation">SwiftNavigation</a> for
RealityKit.</p>
<p>Last year, as I was building a game for VisionPro, I wanted the 3D characters I
placed in the world to navigate the world, go from one point to another, avoid
obstacles and have those 3D characters avoid each other.</p>
<p>Almost every game engine in the world uses the C++ library
<a href="http://recastnav.com">RecastNavigation</a> library to do this - Unity, Unreal and
Godot all use it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigation">SwiftNavigation</a> was born:
Both a Swift wrapper to the underlying C++ library which leverages extensively
Swift's C++ interoperability capabilities and it directly integrates into the
RealityKit entity system.</p>
<p>This library is magical, you create a <a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/buildingmesh">navigation
mesh</a>
from the world that you capture and then you can <a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/navmeshquery">query it</a> for paths to navigate
from one point to another or you can create a <a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/navmesh/makecrowd(maxagents:agentradius:)">crowd
controller</a>
that will automatically move your objects.</p>
<p>Until I have the time to write full tutorials, your best bet is to look at the
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigationDemo">example project</a> that
uses it.</p>

## Under pressure from Russian censors, Mozilla removes anti-censorship extensions

date: 2024-06-11, from: OS News

A few days ago, I was pointed to a post on the Mozilla forums, in which developers of Firefox extensions designed to circumvent Russian censorship were surprised to find that their extensions were suddenly no longer available within Russia. The extension developers and other users in the thread were obviously not amused, and since they had received no warning or any other form of communication from Mozilla, they were left in the dark as to what was going on. I did a journalism and contacted Mozilla directly, and inquired about the situation. Within less than 24 hours Mozilla got back to me with an official statement, attributed to an unnamed Mozilla spokesperson: Following recent regulatory changes in Russia, we received persistent requests from Roskomnadzor demanding that five add-ons be removed from the Mozilla add-on store. After careful consideration, we‚Äôve temporarily restricted their availability within Russia. Recognizing the implications of these actions, we are closely evaluating our next steps while keeping in mind our local community. ‚Ü´ Mozilla spokesperson via email I and most people I talked to already suspected this was the case, and considering Russia is a totalitarian dictatorship, it&#8217;s not particularly surprising it would go after browser extensions that allow people to circumvent state censorship. Other totalitarian dictatorships like China employ similar, often far more sophisticated methods of state control and censorship, too, so it&#8217;s right in line with expectations. I would say that I&#8217;m surprised Mozilla gave in, but at the same time, it&#8217;s highly likely resisting would lead to massive fines and possible arrests of any Mozilla employees or contributors living in Russia, if any such people exist, and I can understand a non-profit like Mozilla not having the means to effectively stand up against the Russian government. That being said, Mozilla&#8217;s official statement seems to imply they&#8217;re still in the middle of their full decision-making process regarding this issue, so other options may still be on the table, and I think it&#8217;s prudent to give Mozilla some more time to deal with this situation. Regardless, this decision is affecting real people inside Russia, and I&#8217;m sure if you&#8217;re using tools like these inside a totalitarian dictatorship, you&#8217;re probably not too fond of said dictatorship. Losing access to these Firefox extensions through the official add-store will be a blow to their human rights, so let&#8217;s hope the source code and &#8216;sideloaded&#8217; versions of these extensions remain available for them to use instead.

## Apple WWDC 2024: the 13 biggest announcements

date: 2024-06-11, from: OS News

Apple‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference keynote has come to a close ‚Äî and the company had a whole lot to share. We got our first look at the AI features coming to Apple‚Äôs devices and some major updates across the company‚Äôs operating systems. If you missed out on watching the keynote live, we‚Äôve gathered all the biggest announcements that you can check out below. ‚Ü´ Emma Roth at The Verge Most of the stuff Apple announced aren&#8217;t particularly interesting &#8211; a lot of catch-up stuff that has become emblematic of companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft when it comes to their operating systems. The one thing that did stand out is Apple&#8217;s approach to offloading machine learning requests to the cloud when they are too difficult to handle on device. They&#8217;ve developed a new way of doing this, using servers with Apple&#8217;s own M chips, which is pretty cool and harkens back the days of the Xserve. In short, these server are using the same kind of techniques to encrypt and secure data on iPhones, but now to encrypt and secure the data coming in for offloaded machine learning requests. The root of trust for Private Cloud Compute is our compute node: custom-built server hardware that brings the power and security of Apple silicon to the data center, with the same hardware security technologies used in iPhone, including the¬†Secure Enclave¬†and¬†Secure Boot. We paired this hardware with a new operating system: a hardened subset of the foundations of iOS and macOS tailored to support Large Language Model (LLM) inference workloads while presenting an extremely narrow attack surface. This allows us to take advantage of iOS security technologies such as¬†Code Signing¬†and¬†sandboxing. ‚Ü´ Apple&#8217;s security research blog Apple also provided some insight into where its training data is coming from, and it claims it&#8217;s only using licensed data and &#8220;publicly available data collected by our web-crawler&#8221;. The words &#8220;licensed&#8221; and &#8220;publicly available&#8221; are doing a lot of heavy lifting here, and I&#8217;m not entirely sure what definitions of those terms Apple is using. There are enough people out there who feel every piece of data &#8211; whether under copyright, available under an open source license, or whatever &#8211; is fair, legal game for ML training, so who knows what Apple is using based on these statements alone. From Apple&#8217;s presentations yesterday, as well as any later statements, it&#8217;s also not clear when machine learning requests get offloaded in the first place. Apple states they try to run as much as possible on-device, and will offload when needed, but the conditions under which such offloading happens are nebulous and unclear, making it hard for users to know what&#8217;s going to happen when they use Apple&#8217;s new machine learning features.

## Right-margin images

<p>Then it occurred to me, I have the perfect place for these images, outside the facebookiverse, that would showcase them, and be easy to produce (I don't want to take on responsibility for big production overhead myself).</p>
<p>I have images I put in the right margin of blog posts on <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. Small little bits of creative color, that may or may not be connected to the story they are next to. And sometimes connected in non-obvious ways, intended to make you think.</p>
<p>Then NakedJen sent me a recent picture of herself that's perfect for the right margin. Seen in the right margin of this post.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/manyImages.html">page</a> where you can scroll through the collection of images I can choose from. I'd love to add more creative stuff here. And I'd love to get some of Stan Krute's genius or Brad Pettit or whoever else might be so inspired. </p>
<p>No promises about when or if they'd be used. You can post them here, as comments on this message if you like. </p>
<p>I may have to restrict this to people I follow, just letting you know, based on past experience. </p>

Their slogan might as well be Revenge. It's the one thing everyone who votes for Trump wants more than anything. They hate their lives, and are looking for someone to release their rage on. They don't know how else to do it. It doesn't have much to do with inflation or unemployment, material wealth. It's deeper than that. We're all living a lie, that if we had money we'd be happy. The sad truth is no one is happy with this arrangement. Ask a billionaire if you don't believe me. They have huge grievances which you would have thought all that wealth would have cured them of. The new Nazis have a selling proposition that works every few generations, after the memory of the previous societal explosion are gone. My parents, the last people I knew who lived through the Nazis are gone. I just have the memory of the aftermath, and it wasn't pretty. ‚ÄúAll of this has happened before, and it will all happen again.‚Äù We're at the beginning of the "happen again" moment.

## The money conundrum

date: 2024-06-11, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I wrote about my dislike of money before on this site. Money and everything related to it is by far the part I enjoy the least about my job. And it‚Äôs a non-negligible part of it considering I worked solo my entire life. What‚Äôs hard for me is this idea of attaching a monetary value to what I do. I was struggling doing it 13 years ago, when I started my career, I‚Äôm struggling with it today and I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt change anytime soon. That‚Äôs because work, for me, is not a matter of trading money for a service. It‚Äôs a human interaction. And adding money to a human interaction makes no sense.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I get why it does make sense in a practical sense. I‚Äôm not an idiot. I just don‚Äôt understand it at a more deeply personal level. What drives me is the desire to help people. This is either directly, with my job or indirectly, with the other things I do online. And when you‚Äôre driven by this desire to help others, money becomes a painful obstacle. Because I just can‚Äôt spend my time helping others and not earn a living. It‚Äôs just not an option. So I have to compromise.</p>
<p>I discussed this topic in the past with various people and one of the feedback I got is to treat work just as a way of earning enough to free more time that I can then use to help others. That‚Äôs a reasonable suggestion but I just can‚Äôt apply it to my life. I don‚Äôt know why, I can‚Äôt get into that type of mindset. I‚Äôm sure part of this is the good old impostor syndrome which I‚Äôll have to confront at some point but part is just the nature of who I am as a person.</p>
<p>This is also why I struggle with the idea of monetising my side projects. It‚Äôs why I love the ‚ÄúPay What You Want‚Äù model because it eliminates the burden of having to put a price on what I do.</p>
<p>This constant tension between money on one side and the desire to help others on the other is also why I live on the edge of constant burnout. Saying no to people is hard when you know you have the skills necessary to help them. And it‚Äôs why I always end up with way too many projects going on at the same time and find myself waking up in the middle of the night thinking about all the things that I have to do and I won‚Äôt have time to do. And it sucks. I know it‚Äôs not a healthy way of living but I have not yet learned how to do things differently.</p>
<p>Money sucks. It sucks that we constantly have to keep it in mind. It sucks that we can‚Äôt just ignore it and focus on the things that matter. Money is also weird. You‚Äôd think that the same amount of money would make the same type of impact in my life but it clearly doesn‚Äôt. Every time someone signs up for my ‚Äúone a month‚Äù membership I‚Äôm super happy. And it‚Äôs just 1$. Actually, it‚Äôs not even 1$ because after the various fees I‚Äôm left with roughly 70 cents. But those 70 cents have meaning. But 70 extra cents on a client invoice is a rounding error. I don‚Äôt even care. Hell, earning 2000$ doesn‚Äôt have the same effect from a personal standpoint as getting one extra subscriber for 1$ a month. Human psychology is fascinating.</p>
<hr />
<p>Speaking of one-a-month members, I recently tweaked my <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/supporters">supporters page</a> because I hated the idea of not having a place to acknowledge those people who were kind enough to support what I do at some point but are no longer active subscribers. Just removing them from the list didn‚Äôt feel right so I added an extra section for past members.</p>
<p>The internet would really benefit from having a native way to let people support each other. It‚Äôs great that services like <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a> exist but also part of me would love to have all these functionalities integrated at the browser level somehow. I‚Äôm sure someone is reading this and screaming ‚ÄúCrypto! Blockchain!‚Äù but I doubt that‚Äôs a solution.</p>
<p>Anyway, I‚Äôm curious to know if you have thoughts on this whole money thing so if you do, please get in touch.</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## Tuxedo showcases prototype Linux laptop with Snapdragon X Elite

date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve long been waiting for a powerful ARM laptop that can run Linux comfortably, and it seems that with Qualcomm&#8217;s new Snapdragon X Elite SoC, that&#8217;s finally going to happen. We talked earlier about how for once, Qualcomm is taking Linux support for their new laptop-focused processors very seriously, and that promise and associated effort is paying dividend. Tuxedo, a popular Linux OEM from Germany, has announced it&#8217;s working on a laptop with the Snapdragon X Elite chip, and they showed off a working prototype at Computex in Taiwan. We have been working with a first prototype for some time, which will soon be replaced by a second one. The development is still in the alpha stage, as some drivers are still missing, which will hopefully be available with the next two kernel versions. It is quite conceivable that an ARM notebook from TUXEDO will be under your Christmas tree in 2024. However, there are still too many pieces of the hardware, software and delivery capability puzzle missing to even begin to set a release date. TUXEDO for ARM will come, but we don‚Äôt yet know exactly when. ‚Ü´ Tuxedo&#8217;s website Their timeline of more Qualcomm drivers making it into the next two kernel versions lines up with Qualcomm&#8217;s own timeline, so it seems we&#8217;re mostly just waiting for them to finish their Linux drivers and add them to the kernel. This is quite exciting, and a much better option for Linux users than buying a Windows version of an X Elite or Pro laptop and hoping for the best.

## NetBSD 10 with disk encryption on UEFI, and NetBSD 10 on the Pinebook Pro

date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News

NetBSD 10 was released recently, so a lot of people are experimenting with it and writing down their thoughts. I&#8217;ve got two of those for you today, to help you in case you, too, want to install NetBSD 10 and play around with, or just use, it. First, what if you want to install NetBSD 10 on a UEFI system, but with full disk encryption in case your device gets stolen? It turns out there are countless guides for installing with full-disk encryption on MBR-based systems, but once you use UEFI &#8211; as you should be &#8211; things get a lot more complicated. The NetBSD installer is apparently rather basic, and a better solution is to drop to a shell and install NetBSD that way instead, and even then, full disk encryption with UEFI is actually not possible, as it seems the root file system &#8211; where the operating system itself resides &#8211; cannot be encrypted. The restriction is in the root file-system. It needs to be in plain-text and in a regular partition. It seems to me that rootfs in CGD or LVM is not well supported. ‚Ü´ vsis.online This seems like something the NetBSD team may need to take a look at, since full disk encryption should be an easy option to choose, even, or especially in 2024, on UEFI systems. Such encryption is easily achieved on Linux or Windows systems, and it seems odd to me that NetBSD is lagging behind a bit here. In the meantime, the linked guide will be a good jumping-off point for those of you interested in going a similar route. The second article I want to highlight concerns NetBSD 10 on the Pinebook Pro, the inexpensive ARM laptop that normally ships with Linux. It turns out there&#8217;s a NetBSD 10 image for this device, so installation is quite a bit more straightforward than the more exotic setup I mentioned earlier. It seems most of the hardware works quite well out of the box, with the inly exception being the on-board Wi-Fi, which the author addressed with a USB W-Fi dongle. Other than that, NetBSD is running well on the Pinebook Pro for the author, which is great to read since that makes this cheap device a great starting point for people interested in running NetBSD.

## Void Linux on ZFS

date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News

Last night, I ran through the&#160;ZFSBootMenu documentation guide for Void&#160;and followed it both on a VM and then on an external SATA HDD plugged through a USB case, taking some notes and getting a general idea of the process. The Void installer does not support ZFS out of the box, so the¬†Void Handbook¬†itself recommends the ZFSBootMenu documentation before¬†its own¬†(a manual chroot installation) when it comes to doing a ZFS-on-root install. This guide from ZFSBootMenu is what we‚Äôll be following throughout this post. ‚Ü´ Juno Takano There&#8217;s a ton of good stuff in this lengthy, detailed, and helpful blog post. First, it covers Void Linux, which is one of the best signifiers of good taste, classy style, and generally being a good person. Void is not necessarily underappreciated &#8211; it gets a lot of mentions in the right places &#8211; but I do feel there are a lot more people for whom Void Linux would be a perfect fit but who don&#8217;t yet know about it. So, time for a very short introduction. Void Linux is distribution with its own unique and very user-friendly package manager that&#8217;s an absolute joy to use. Unlike many other custom, more obscure package formats, the Void repositories are vast, generally some of the most up-to-date, and you&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to be asking for some piece of software that isn&#8217;t packaged. Void eschews systemd in favour of runit, and while I personally have no issues with systemd, diversity is always welcome and runit is, in line with everything else Void, easy to grasp and use. Lastly, while Void also comes in a GNU libc flavour, it feels like the &#8220;real&#8221; Void Linux is the one using musl. Second is a tool I had never heard of: ZFSBootMenu. The name is rather self-explanatory, but in slightly more detail: it&#8217;s a self-contained small Linux-based bootloader that detects any Linux kernels and initramfs images on ZFS file systems, which can then be launched using kexec. It makes running Linux on ZFS quite a bit easier, especially for systems that don&#8217;t over ZFS as an option during installation, like, in this case, Void Linux. And that&#8217;s what the linked post is actually about: setting up a root-on-ZFS Void EFI installation. It&#8217;s a great companion article for anyone trying something similar.

I don't really know who they were, they communicated through their actions, not via email or the phone.

If that partnership had flourished and developed we might now have a good alternative to the tech billionaires.

## Reverse-engineering MenuetOS 64: primary boot loader

date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News

Now that we have the MenuetOS 64 disk image file (M6414490.IMG), it is time to analyze! We will analyze the image file both statically and dynamically. Static analysis is reading and analyzing code without running it, whereas dynamic analysis is running the code and watching how it changes registers and memory during execution. Each analysis mode compliments the other; there are some things that can only be discerned through code execution, like register values or stack layout at a specific point in time during execution. Static analysis is useful for ‚Äúfilling in the blanks‚Äù when executing code to understand what the code should do next (or just did). Since MenuetOS 64 is written in Intel x64 assembly, our static analysis will consist of memory mapped disassembly in Ghidra. After reading this post, readers should understand how to launch a MenuetOS 64 virtual machine using QEMU as well as how to attach a debugger (gdb) to QEMU in order to debug while code is executing. Also, readers should understand how MenuetOS 64 begins the boot process as control of execution is passed to MenuetOS 64 code from the virtualization firmware. ‚Ü´ Nicholas Starke This is an old post &#8211; from late 2022 &#8211; but a great read nonetheless, and considering MenuetOS doesn&#8217;t change very much from year to year, it&#8217;s still mostly relevant.

## ldap2pg 6.1: Postgres 16 unprivileged, hooks and more

date: 2024-06-10, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><em>Paris, the 3 june 2024.</em></p>
<p>Dalibo provides services, training and support to its clients in France since 2005.</p>
<p>Since 2017, <a href="https://labs.dalibo.com/ldap2pg">ldap2pg</a> offers the best automatic roles and privileges synchronisation solution for PostgreSQL.
Configure PostgreSQL authentication with LDAP in <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file, then use ldap2pg to create and configure roles from your enterprise directory.</p>
<p>Today Dalibo announces the availability of ldap2pg 6.1.
This version brings support for PostgreSQL 16
and its new unprivileged administration or roles.
Numerous compatibility and configurability improvements make this a practical and stable version.
Follow the <a href="https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/">documentation to install</a> this new version.</p>


<h3>Unprivileged execution &amp; Postgres 16</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 16 introduced a major break in compatibility when it comes to delegating the administration of roles
to an unprivileged user.
This change is based on the observation that the previous implementation
offered an illusion of security
and was not consistent with the SQL standard.
Indeed, a user with the <code>CREATEROLE</code> option can de facto grant himself rights he does not have.</p>
<p>Also, ldap2pg 6.1 refuses to run without being a superuser on PostgreSQL up to version 15.
ldap2pg 6.1 can run with the <code>CREATEROLE</code> option on PostgreSQL 16,
without superuser privileges.</p>
<h3>Configurability</h3>
<p>ldap2pg 6.1 provides new configuration facilities.
You can now write the environment variables in an <code>.env</code> file alongside the <code>ldap2pg.yml</code> file
or in the ldap2pg working directory.</p>
<p>In the same way as <code>make</code> and <code>git</code> commands,
ldap2pg accepts a <code>-C</code> parameter which determines the working directory of the command.
This parameter determines the search for the <code>ldap2pg.yml</code> and <code>ldaprc</code> configuration files.</p>
<p>Finally, ldap2pg now accepts a command line argument:
the connection string to the PostgreSQL instance to be synchronised.
This connection string can be in URL format or in key=value format.</p>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>ldap2pg no longer executes the <em>whoami</em> LDAP command after connection to the LDAP directory.
This operation is an extension of the LDAP protocol and is not available everywhere.
Removing this command removes the dependency on the availability of this extension.</p>
<p>The <code>LDAPURI</code> parameter can contain several URIs separated by a space.
If the first URI fails, the LDAP client must try the second.
ldap2pg 6.1 corrects a regression in version 6.0 and restores this client-side HA implementation.</p>
<p>LDAP is a case-insensitive protocol,
only for ASCII characters.
ldap2pg 6.1 is now case insensitive for DN and attribute names.</p>
<h3>Execution hooks</h3>
<p>A very old feature request has just been implemented in ldap2pg :
the definition of an arbitrary SQL command to be executed before or after the creation of a role.
For example, to create a schema specific to a new user.
The <em>role</em> rule now accepts <code>before_create</code> and <code>after_create</code> parameters.
These requests can receive dynamic values from the LDAP search.</p>
<h3>Continue on error</h3>
<p>Some errors should not prevent synchronisation from continuing.
For example, if ldap2pg fails to drop a role still owning objects in base.
ldap2pg 6.1 tolerates up to 8 such synchronisation errors before giving up.</p>
<h3>Other changes</h3>

## What is PID 0?

date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News

The very short version: Unix PIDs do start at 0! PID 0 just isn‚Äôt shown to userspace through traditional APIs. PID 0 starts the kernel, then retires to a quiet life of helping a bit with process scheduling and power management. Also the entire web is mostly wrong about PID 0, because of one sentence on Wikipedia from 16 years ago. There‚Äôs a slightly longer short version right at the end, or you can stick with me for the extremely long middle bit! But surely you could just google what PID 0 is, right? Why am I even publishing this? ‚Ü´ David Anderson What a great read. Just great.

## Adobe terms clarified: will never own your work, or use it for AI training

date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News

Adobe Creative Cloud users opened their apps yesterday to find that they were forced to agree to new terms, which included some frightening-sounding language. It seemed to suggest Adobe was claiming rights over their work. Worse, there was no way to continue using the apps, to request support to clarify the terms, or even uninstall the apps, without agreeing to the terms. ‚Ü´ Ben Lovejoy at 9To5Mac Of course users were going to revolt. Even without the scary-sounding language, locking people out of their applications unless they agree to new terms is a terrible dark pattern, and something a lot of enterprise customers certainly aren&#8217;t going to be particularly happy about. I&#8217;ve never worked an office job, so how does stuff like this normally go? I&#8217;m assuming employees aren&#8217;t allowed to just accept new licensing terms from Adobe or whatever on their office computers? In response to the backlash, Adobe came out and said in a statement that it does not intend to claim ownership over anyone&#8217;s work, and that it&#8217;s not going to train its ML models on customers&#8217; work either. The company states that to train its Firefly ML model, it only uses content it has properly licensed for it, as well as public domain content. Assuming Adobe is telling the truth, it seems the company at least understands the concept of consent, which is good news, and a breath of fresh air compared to crooks like OpenAI or GitHub. Content used for training ML models should be properly licensed for it, and consent should be properly obtained from rightsholders, and taking Adobe at their word, it seems that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;re doing. Regardless, the backlash illustrates once again just how &#8211; rightfully &#8211; weary people are of machine learning, and how their works might be illegally appropriated to train such models.

## Wikipedia vs ChatGPT

date: 2024-06-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>I started replying to a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746">post by Tim Bray</a> in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character limit, so I moved my act over here. </i></p>
<p>ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia. </p>
<p>It often only represents a story from one point of view.</p>
<p>So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.</p>
<p>Same with the story of RSS. I'm sure you know the story they tell, but there's a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and  Motley Fool, and eventually brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you'd get the idea that the bigco's heroically fought back against what exactly it's not clear. </p>
<p>I can't contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well it's not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it on my blog (as I'm doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is. (Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)</p>
<p>Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT made a mistake like that people would be howling. I'm sure Wikipedia is filled with junk like that. Why wouldn't it be. </p>
<p>And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while other sources don't. </p>
<p>But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles. </p>
<p>ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the open web. I don't know why it's better at finding stuff, and also understanding my queries even though they're not rigorously specified, my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.</p>
<p>It's also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which of course they are being. </p>
<p>Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that's a big difference between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very impatient with them and move on. </p>
<p>Also, I'm not here to debate. I don't like online debates. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>

It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me find the big stuff. I don't know when this app came to be, but it's very helpful.  In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device that's ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems). I'm sure there's a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on the 16TB external drive, but I sure don't know how to do it nor do I want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a lot longer than this Mac's has. I desperately want to move my act to Linux and reclaim all the memory I'm using to store stuff about the Mac, which isn't really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that's my revenge, and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would make <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups">beaucoups</a> money, so I hedged. I figured at least they'd make me rich while completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen Apple keep <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> running and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as usual I ramble. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

## Review of Technical Writing for Software Developers

date: 2024-06-09, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

Just around the time I was complaining about the scarcity of books on technical writing, I got a copy of Technical Writing for Software Developers by Chris Chinchilla, a regular of the Write the Docs community. Delighted by the chance of reading a book from one of the sharpest pens in technical writing, I set aside some time to read through the nine chapters and write a review. The book taught me little I didn‚Äôt already know ‚Äì Chris and I use the same tools and methods.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I bet you could do a nice AI that would create a graph of people who are connected to other people through far more criteria than networks like LinkedIn or Facebook could. It could take into account all of those connections and others. Kind of like a current-day geneology of relationships.

## LCA software: exit the matrix

date: 2024-06-09, from: Max Halford Blog

Measuring the environmental impact of a product is done using life cycle assessment (LCA). This is a methodology that breaks down a product&rsquo;s life cycle into stages (LCI), and measures the impact of each stage on the environment (LCIA).
There are a few pieces of LCA software to choose from. The leading ones are SimaPro, GaBi, openLCA, and Umberto. These are all proprietary software, and they&rsquo;re expensive. But there&rsquo;s a free and open source alternative: Brightway.
