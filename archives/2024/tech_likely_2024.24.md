## NASA Watches Mars Light Up During Epic Solar Storm

date: 2024-06-10, from: NASA breaking news

In addition to producing auroras, a recent extreme storm provided more detail on how much radiation future astronauts could encounter on the Red Planet. Mars scientists have been anticipating epic solar storms ever since the Sun entered a period of peak activity earlier this year called solar maximum. Over the past month, NASA’s Mars rovers [&#8230;]

## Void Linux on ZFS

date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News

Last night, I ran through the&#160;ZFSBootMenu documentation guide for Void&#160;and followed it both on a VM and then on an external SATA HDD plugged through a USB case, taking some notes and getting a general idea of the process. The Void installer does not support ZFS out of the box, so the Void Handbook itself recommends the ZFSBootMenu documentation before its own (a manual chroot installation) when it comes to doing a ZFS-on-root install. This guide from ZFSBootMenu is what we’ll be following throughout this post. ↫ Juno Takano There&#8217;s a ton of good stuff in this lengthy, detailed, and helpful blog post. First, it covers Void Linux, which is one of the best signifiers of good taste, classy style, and generally being a good person. Void is not necessarily underappreciated &#8211; it gets a lot of mentions in the right places &#8211; but I do feel there are a lot more people for whom Void Linux would be a perfect fit but who don&#8217;t yet know about it. So, time for a very short introduction. Void Linux is distribution with its own unique and very user-friendly package manager that&#8217;s an absolute joy to use. Unlike many other custom, more obscure package formats, the Void repositories are vast, generally some of the most up-to-date, and you&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to be asking for some piece of software that isn&#8217;t packaged. Void eschews systemd in favour of runit, and while I personally have no issues with systemd, diversity is always welcome and runit is, in line with everything else Void, easy to grasp and use. Lastly, while Void also comes in a GNU libc flavour, it feels like the &#8220;real&#8221; Void Linux is the one using musl. Second is a tool I had never heard of: ZFSBootMenu. The name is rather self-explanatory, but in slightly more detail: it&#8217;s a self-contained small Linux-based bootloader that detects any Linux kernels and initramfs images on ZFS file systems, which can then be launched using kexec. It makes running Linux on ZFS quite a bit easier, especially for systems that don&#8217;t over ZFS as an option during installation, like, in this case, Void Linux. And that&#8217;s what the linked post is actually about: setting up a root-on-ZFS Void EFI installation. It&#8217;s a great companion article for anyone trying something similar.

And before that a few oddly empowered crazy-ass people at Netscape had an idea that bloggers had the answer, not Google. I don't really know who they were, they communicated through their actions, not via email or the phone. Same kind of thing happened with XML-RPC, except there I knew the people at Microsoft who momentarily bent the corporate rules to make something happen quickly and simply in the market.

The real story of RSS is that in a moment when the NYT had a spirit of adventure, they backed RSS and as a result news adopted a technology that was pioneered by bloggers, not the tech industry. If that partnership had flourished and developed we might now have a good alternative to the tech billionaires.

## Reverse-engineering MenuetOS 64: primary boot loader

date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News

Now that we have the MenuetOS 64 disk image file (M6414490.IMG), it is time to analyze! We will analyze the image file both statically and dynamically. Static analysis is reading and analyzing code without running it, whereas dynamic analysis is running the code and watching how it changes registers and memory during execution. Each analysis mode compliments the other; there are some things that can only be discerned through code execution, like register values or stack layout at a specific point in time during execution. Static analysis is useful for “filling in the blanks” when executing code to understand what the code should do next (or just did). Since MenuetOS 64 is written in Intel x64 assembly, our static analysis will consist of memory mapped disassembly in Ghidra. After reading this post, readers should understand how to launch a MenuetOS 64 virtual machine using QEMU as well as how to attach a debugger (gdb) to QEMU in order to debug while code is executing. Also, readers should understand how MenuetOS 64 begins the boot process as control of execution is passed to MenuetOS 64 code from the virtualization firmware. ↫ Nicholas Starke This is an old post &#8211; from late 2022 &#8211; but a great read nonetheless, and considering MenuetOS doesn&#8217;t change very much from year to year, it&#8217;s still mostly relevant.

## ldap2pg 6.1: Postgres 16 unprivileged, hooks and more

date: 2024-06-10, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><em>Paris, the 3 june 2024.</em></p>
<p>Dalibo provides services, training and support to its clients in France since 2005.</p>
<p>Since 2017, <a href="https://labs.dalibo.com/ldap2pg">ldap2pg</a> offers the best automatic roles and privileges synchronisation solution for PostgreSQL.
Configure PostgreSQL authentication with LDAP in <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file, then use ldap2pg to create and configure roles from your enterprise directory.</p>
<p>Today Dalibo announces the availability of ldap2pg 6.1.
This version brings support for PostgreSQL 16
and its new unprivileged administration or roles.
Numerous compatibility and configurability improvements make this a practical and stable version.
Follow the <a href="https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/">documentation to install</a> this new version.</p>


<h3>Unprivileged execution &amp; Postgres 16</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 16 introduced a major break in compatibility when it comes to delegating the administration of roles
to an unprivileged user.
This change is based on the observation that the previous implementation
offered an illusion of security
and was not consistent with the SQL standard.
Indeed, a user with the <code>CREATEROLE</code> option can de facto grant himself rights he does not have.</p>
<p>Also, ldap2pg 6.1 refuses to run without being a superuser on PostgreSQL up to version 15.
ldap2pg 6.1 can run with the <code>CREATEROLE</code> option on PostgreSQL 16,
without superuser privileges.</p>
<h3>Configurability</h3>
<p>ldap2pg 6.1 provides new configuration facilities.
You can now write the environment variables in an <code>.env</code> file alongside the <code>ldap2pg.yml</code> file
or in the ldap2pg working directory.</p>
<p>In the same way as <code>make</code> and <code>git</code> commands,
ldap2pg accepts a <code>-C</code> parameter which determines the working directory of the command.
This parameter determines the search for the <code>ldap2pg.yml</code> and <code>ldaprc</code> configuration files.</p>
<p>Finally, ldap2pg now accepts a command line argument:
the connection string to the PostgreSQL instance to be synchronised.
This connection string can be in URL format or in key=value format.</p>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>ldap2pg no longer executes the <em>whoami</em> LDAP command after connection to the LDAP directory.
This operation is an extension of the LDAP protocol and is not available everywhere.
Removing this command removes the dependency on the availability of this extension.</p>
<p>The <code>LDAPURI</code> parameter can contain several URIs separated by a space.
If the first URI fails, the LDAP client must try the second.
ldap2pg 6.1 corrects a regression in version 6.0 and restores this client-side HA implementation.</p>
<p>LDAP is a case-insensitive protocol,
only for ASCII characters.
ldap2pg 6.1 is now case insensitive for DN and attribute names.</p>
<h3>Execution hooks</h3>
<p>A very old feature request has just been implemented in ldap2pg :
the definition of an arbitrary SQL command to be executed before or after the creation of a role.
For example, to create a schema specific to a new user.
The <em>role</em> rule now accepts <code>before_create</code> and <code>after_create</code> parameters.
These requests can receive dynamic values from the LDAP search.</p>
<h3>Continue on error</h3>
<p>Some errors should not prevent synchronisation from continuing.
For example, if ldap2pg fails to drop a role still owning objects in base.
ldap2pg 6.1 tolerates up to 8 such synchronisation errors before giving up.</p>
<h3>Other changes</h3>
<p>See more changes, features and fixes in <a href="https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog/#ldap2pg-61">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>Documentation, procedures and community support can be found at the following addresses:</p>

## What is PID 0?

date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News

The very short version: Unix PIDs do start at 0! PID 0 just isn’t shown to userspace through traditional APIs. PID 0 starts the kernel, then retires to a quiet life of helping a bit with process scheduling and power management. Also the entire web is mostly wrong about PID 0, because of one sentence on Wikipedia from 16 years ago. There’s a slightly longer short version right at the end, or you can stick with me for the extremely long middle bit! But surely you could just google what PID 0 is, right? Why am I even publishing this? ↫ David Anderson What a great read. Just great.

## Adobe terms clarified: will never own your work, or use it for AI training

date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News

Adobe Creative Cloud users opened their apps yesterday to find that they were forced to agree to new terms, which included some frightening-sounding language. It seemed to suggest Adobe was claiming rights over their work. Worse, there was no way to continue using the apps, to request support to clarify the terms, or even uninstall the apps, without agreeing to the terms. ↫ Ben Lovejoy at 9To5Mac Of course users were going to revolt. Even without the scary-sounding language, locking people out of their applications unless they agree to new terms is a terrible dark pattern, and something a lot of enterprise customers certainly aren&#8217;t going to be particularly happy about. I&#8217;ve never worked an office job, so how does stuff like this normally go? I&#8217;m assuming employees aren&#8217;t allowed to just accept new licensing terms from Adobe or whatever on their office computers? In response to the backlash, Adobe came out and said in a statement that it does not intend to claim ownership over anyone&#8217;s work, and that it&#8217;s not going to train its ML models on customers&#8217; work either. The company states that to train its Firefly ML model, it only uses content it has properly licensed for it, as well as public domain content. Assuming Adobe is telling the truth, it seems the company at least understands the concept of consent, which is good news, and a breath of fresh air compared to crooks like OpenAI or GitHub. Content used for training ML models should be properly licensed for it, and consent should be properly obtained from rightsholders, and taking Adobe at their word, it seems that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;re doing. Regardless, the backlash illustrates once again just how &#8211; rightfully &#8211; weary people are of machine learning, and how their works might be illegally appropriated to train such models.

<p><i>I started replying to a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746">post by Tim Bray</a> in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character limit, so I moved my act over here. </i></p>
<p>ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia. </p>
<p>It often only represents a story from one point of view.</p>
<p>So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.</p>
<p>Same with the story of RSS. I'm sure you know the story they tell, but there's a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and  Motley Fool, and eventually brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you'd get the idea that the bigco's heroically fought back against what exactly it's not clear. </p>
<p>I can't contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well it's not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it on my blog (as I'm doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is. (Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)</p>
<p>Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT made a mistake like that people would be howling. I'm sure Wikipedia is filled with junk like that. Why wouldn't it be. </p>
<p>And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while other sources don't. </p>
<p>But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles. </p>
<p>ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the open web. I don't know why it's better at finding stuff, and also understanding my queries even though they're not rigorously specified, my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.</p>
<p>It's also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which of course they are being. </p>
<p>Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that's a big difference between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very impatient with them and move on. </p>
<p>Also, I'm not here to debate. I don't like online debates. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/01/mrFrog.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I have a Mac Mini that keeps running out of space on its internal drive. It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me find the big stuff. I don't know when this app came to be, but it's very helpful.  In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device that's ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems). I'm sure there's a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on the 16TB external drive, but I sure don't know how to do it nor do I want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a lot longer than this Mac's has. I desperately want to move my act to Linux and reclaim all the memory I'm using to store stuff about the Mac, which isn't really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that's my revenge, and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would make <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups">beaucoups</a> money, so I hedged. I figured at least they'd make me rich while completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen Apple keep <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> running and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as usual I ramble. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

How the Brannock Device—a measuring tool you’ve definitely seen but didn’t know the name of—made it a lot easier to figure out our shoe size.

## Review of Technical Writing for Software Developers

date: 2024-06-09, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

Just around the time I was complaining about the scarcity of books on technical writing, I got a copy of Technical Writing for Software Developers by Chris Chinchilla, a regular of the Write the Docs community. Delighted by the chance of reading a book from one of the sharpest pens in technical writing, I set aside some time to read through the nine chapters and write a review. The book taught me little I didn’t already know – Chris and I use the same tools and methods.

I bet you could do a nice AI that would create a graph of people who are connected to other people through far more criteria than networks like LinkedIn or Facebook could. It could take into account all of those connections and others. Kind of like a current-day geneology of relationships.

<p>This morning I had to cook my French toast in canola oil instead of butter because I forgot we were out of the latter until I was already too far in to back out. It actually came out better than I expected but I&rsquo;m still disappointed 😢</p>

## LCA software: exit the matrix

date: 2024-06-09, from: Max Halford Blog

Measuring the environmental impact of a product is done using life cycle assessment (LCA). This is a methodology that breaks down a product&rsquo;s life cycle into stages (LCI), and measures the impact of each stage on the environment (LCIA).
There are a few pieces of LCA software to choose from. The leading ones are SimaPro, GaBi, openLCA, and Umberto. These are all proprietary software, and they&rsquo;re expensive. But there&rsquo;s a free and open source alternative: Brightway.
