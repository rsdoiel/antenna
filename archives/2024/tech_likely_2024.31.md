Here's a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/29/twowaysofsupport.png">perfect illustration</a> how ChatGPT can improve customer relations. I bought an iPhone that I now don't need, and it's arriving today via FedEx. I wanted to know whether I should just refuse delivery, or accept it and then return it. Obviously it's easier for me to refuse. I asked ChatGPT and it gave me a detailed reply. Apple's chatbot saw it as a "technical" question and wasn't prepared to help. Sales support is one of those applications where cost is totally justified. A human helper would cost a lot more I imagine than a LLM chat system. I tried calling 1-800-CALL-APPLE and talked to a human who was very nice, but couldn't find anything in her manual about refusing delivery.

## Thoughts on politics and communities

date: 2024-07-29, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Kev has written about the topic of <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/politics-and-communities">politics and communities</a> on his blog and it was related to his recently announced <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/introducing-500-social">500.social</a> project. In his post, he mentioned blog posts written by <a href="https://baty.net">Jack</a> and <a href="https://nice-marmot.net">Dave</a>. If you’re interested in the full discussion go read the various blog posts, they’re all relatively short.</p>
<p>I’m not interested in commenting on the opinions expressed in those blog posts but I am interested in the source of the discussion, and that was a bullet list item in the 500.social <a href="https://about.500.social/#expectations">“Member expectations” section</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Posts about politics and religion should be avoided, if you strongly feel the urge to post about these topics, please put them behind a Content Warning Member expectations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years ago, during the COVID era, the 37signals company got into hot water online because they announced in an internal communication that they were going to ban “societal and political discussions” on their internal work chat. <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5">The announcement is online</a> if you’re interested in reading it.</p>
<p>People online reacted in all sorts of ways to that news and many, many opinion pieces got published. I remember talking about it with a few people privately and had some interesting conversations around that topic. As you can see, years later, positions on topics such as politics and religion are still controversial in the context of online spaces.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the issue is not with politics, religion or any other topic. The problem is a mixture of expectations and the tools we use. In his post, Dave wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is a "public square" anymore, where we ought to be able to try to hash those things out, it seems to me that it's in those "small social networks," unless they're intended to be bespoke bubbles where it's all just happy talk and we never have difficult conversations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t disagree that small communities are the space where those conversations can happen which is why I think no topic should be banned or be off limits. At the same time though, I do think that having conversations means something very different than posting a reactionary tweet to comment on a piece of news. That’s why people like Kev end up with rules against politics and religion. Because if you dig deeper, people don’t want to have a conversation on social media. They want to vent.</p>
<p>I think social media platforms, like Mastodon, are not designed to have conversations. You can have them on there, sure, but the experience is going to be sub-par. Social media is designed to be reactionary and generating reactions is different than having a conversation. What would Mastodon look like if everyone was forced to post at least 500 words? What would Mastodon look like if you could only post once an hour? The reason why some people, like Kev, end up with rules like that is because social media is an imperfect tool. I don’t have a no politics rule attached to my email address. People can write to me and talk about whatever they want. If they write about something I don’t care about I can simply ignore that topic and don’t engage in conversation which is exactly what happens in real life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What prompted me to consider joining 500.social was recalling the feeling I had when we learned that Biden had dropped out of the race. That's the sort of event that evokes an immediate, emotional response because of its significance to a broad range of people, presumably my "community."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the perfect example of why I think social media is a flawed tool. Can you imagine doing the same in the phone era? Can you imagine reading a piece of news and start calling hundreds, potentially thousands of people simply to share what you think about some news? And can you imagine doing that with people who don’t even live in your country and couldn’t care less about that specific news? Now can you imagine if everyone was doing the same for the news that evoked a strong reaction to them? You’d quickly put your phone on airplane mode because there are only so many random opinions on news you can bear to listen to. I can have a 3 hours discussion about politics, I can’t listen 3 hours of soundbites.</p>
<p>The problem with social media and politics is that way too many people are interested in sharing what they think about social media but very few are interested in having actual, real discussions. Because blasting out a tweet takes 10 seconds while having an actual conversation might take hours and span days.</p>
<p>I’d love to know what you think about this whole situation though. Do you think some topics should be banned on social platforms? If you have opinions get in touch or even better write a blog post!</p>                <hr>

## NASA, JAXA Bounce Laser Beam Between Moon’s Surface and Lunar Orbit

date: 2024-07-29, from: NASA breaking news

NASA’s LRO (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) has twice transmitted a laser pulse to a cookie-sized retroreflector aboard JAXA’s (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) SLIM lander on the Moon and received a return signal. As LRO passed 44 miles above SLIM (Smart Lander for Investigating Moon) during two successive orbits on May 24, 2024, it pinged the lander […]

## Microsoft’s CrowdStrike post-mortem

date: 2024-07-29, from: OS News

Microsoft has published a post-mortem of the CrowdStrike incident, and goes into great depths to describe where, exactly, the error lies, and how it could lead to such massive problems. I can&#8217;t comment anything insightful on the technical details and code they show to illustrate all of this &#8211; I&#8217;ll leave that discussion up to you &#8211; but Microsoft also spends considerable amount of time explaining why security vendors are choosing to use kernel-mode drivers. Microsoft lists three major reasons why security vendors opt for using kernel modules, and none of them will come as a great surprise to OSNews readers: kernel drivers provide more visibility into the system than a userspace tool would, there are performance benefits, and they&#8217;re more resistant to tampering. The downsides are legion, too, of course, as any crash or similar issue in kernel mode has far-reaching consequences. The goal, then, according to Microsoft, is to balance the need for greater insight, performance, and tamper resistance with stability. And while the company doesn&#8217;t say it directly, this is clearly where CrowdStrike failed &#8211; and failed hard. While you would want a security tool like CrowdStrike to perform as little as possible in kernelspace, and conversely as much as possible in userspace, that&#8217;s not what CrowdStrike did. They are running a lot of stuff in kernelspace that really shouldn&#8217;t be there, such as the update mechanism and related tools. In total, CrowdStrike loads four kernel drivers, and much of their functionality can be run in userspace instead. It is possible today for security tools to balance security and reliability. For example, security vendors can use minimal sensors that run in kernel mode for data collection and enforcement limiting exposure to availability issues. The remainder of the key product functionality includes managing updates, parsing content, and other operations can occur isolated within user mode where recoverability is possible. This demonstrates the best practice of minimizing kernel usage while still maintaining a robust security posture and strong visibility. Windows provides several user mode protection approaches for anti-tampering, like Virtualization-based security (VBS) Enclaves and Protected Processes that vendors can use to protect their key security processes. Windows also provides ETW events and user-mode interfaces like Antimalware Scan Interface for event visibility. These robust mechanisms can be used to reduce the amount of kernel code needed to create a security solution, which balances security and robustness. ↫ David Weston, Vice President, Enterprise and OS Security at Microsoft In what is surely an unprecedented event, I agree with the CrowdStrike criticism bubbling under the surface of this post-mortem by Microsoft. Everything seems to point towards CrowdStrike stuffing way more things in kernelspace than is needed, and as such creating a far larger surface for things to go catastrophically wrong than needed. While Microsoft obviously isn&#8217;t going to openly and publicly throw CrowdStrike under the bus, it&#8217;s very clear what they&#8217;re hinting at here, and this is about as close to a public flogging we&#8217;re going to get. Microsoft&#8217;s post-portem further details a ton of work Microsoft has recently done, is doing, and will soon be doing to further strenghthen Windows&#8217; security, to lessen the need for kernelspace security drivers even more, including adding support for Rust to the Windows kernel, which should also aid in mitigating some common problems present in other, older programming languages (while not being a silver bullet either, of course).

## 2024-07-27 Tired of programming

date: 2024-07-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-27-tired-of-programming">2024-07-27 Tired of programming</h1>

<p>My summer break has begun, and I am tired.</p>

<p>I wanted to work on some sort of editor.
I contributed some lines to Anvil, an Acme-inspired editor, and then I figured I should go back to text editing because writing acceptable GUI editing is just sooo much effort. So now I’m trying to use ed again…
I&rsquo;m experimenting with using <code>rlwrap</code> around <code>ed</code> and it&rsquo;s not so bad if you&rsquo;re just writing, like writing an email.
But really writing, organizing, moving things around… it really doesn&rsquo;t work all that well.
I had imagined a sort of conversational UI – which I guess ed has? – if ed is your grumpiest of companions! – and I guess I was looking at my Oddmu site generator and Markdown file server and thinking: what sort of editor would I need to maintain this?
What sort of minimal SVG editing capabilities would be nice to have? That was my starting point.
Then I dropped the graphics because writing that seemed like a pain.
Then I started thinking about the GUI components: using fonts with Harfbuzz, Unicode support, hyphenation (per language), spell-checking (per language), and on and on.
It&rsquo;s too much.</p>

<p>But where does that leave me? Adding a few features to ed?
Am I in fact reinventing vi, badly?</p>

<p><a href="2024-06-01-editor">2024-06-01 Fonts are important</a>,
<a href="2024-06-13-anvil">2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple cursors</a>,
<a href="2024-07-24-ed">2024-07-24 My ed, wondering</a></p>

<p>I wanted to work on a local Gridmapper variant, written in Common Lisp.
I already have a working prototype in Common Lisp and I already have a Javascript web application in production.
This is a single file, a stand-alone SVG+Javascript web application. It works online and offline.
Thus, my entire tinkering with CL right now has as its goal to produce a native application that would work without a browser.</p>

<p>Whenever I start working on native GUI stuff, like working with SDL2 or Cairo or similar libraries, my eyes start bleeding.
Vanilla JS and the browser really is a pretty nice virtual machine available to many of us.
Having spent a day trying to get SDL2, SDL2 gfx and Cairo sorted out for this Common Lisp app I&rsquo;m looking at really makes me want to drop it all for another two years and focus on JavaScript instead.
It can&rsquo;t be that bad! Javascript gives me the DOM and SVG and all that, practically for free…</p>

<p>And three different bindings Common Lisp bindings for SDL2 in various states of neglect is draining.
Switching from one to the other is tricky since the first one had many idiomatic helpers functions that the other is lacking.
But the first one is lacking a gfx port.
Then again, I guess I can add circle drawing using lines.</p>

<p>Everything takes so long. So damn long.</p>

<p><a href="2022-07-20_Gridmapper_CL">2022-07-20 Gridmapper CL 5</a>, <a href="2024-07-24-gridmapper-local">2024-07-24 Gridmapper Local</a></p>

<p>A while ago I started collecting links with quotes instead of relying on browser bookmarks or third parties. I remember at one point my bookmarks were just HTML files generated by the browser. Good times! And there was Delicious, a service now defunct, I guess. So now I keep <a href="Bookmarks">bookmarks on this site</a>. It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>I wondered whether I should write a tool that monitors those pages, and when new items get added, a feed is updated.
Just a little program… it doesn&rsquo;t seem hard. So I gave it try.  I like documentation first, these days so I began with a man page for it. Good, good. Then I though that perhaps I should use the same Markdown parser as Oddmu uses.
So I needed to write this tool in Go. How hard can it be?
It&rsquo;s a bit harder than writing it in Perl.
Oh, and I needed to parse the RSS file, too.
Or use SQLite to store data.
It keeps getting harder.</p>

<p>Well, I spent some time on it and now I&rsquo;m tired again.
This too, takes too long!</p>

<p>I feel defeated. Am I too impatient?</p>

<p>I should read a book.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-07-27</strong>. In an attempt to overcome my sadness, I decided to spice up my shell life…</p>

<pre><code># hipster shell
alias ls='echo Using exa instead;exa'
alias du='echo Using dust instead;dust'
alias top='echo Using htop instead;htop'
alias find='echo Using fd instead;fd'
alias grep='echo Using rg instead;rg'
alias files='echo Using yazi instead;yazi'
alias cal='echo Using khal instead;khal'
alias screenshot='grimshot'
alias copy='wl-copy'
alias paste='wl-paste'
</code></pre>

<p>I set up <code>khal</code> and <code>khard</code> which required me to set up <code>vdirsyncer</code> to sync the remote calendars (and contacts) to local copies. This is also good for backup, I guess.</p>

<p>Let me know if you know of other such tools.</p>

<p><strong>2024-07-29</strong>. I overcame my block and wrote the bookmarks-to-feed program in Perl: <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bookmark-feed.git">bookmark-feed</a>. 🔖 🤝 <img loading="lazy" src="/pics/rss.svg" alt="RSS" /></p>

<p>I installed a daily cron job:</p>

<pre><code>47  23  *  *   *     /usr/bin/nice /home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/bookmark-feed /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*_Bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*-bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/bookmarks.rss
</code></pre>

<p>The readable variant is this: <code>bookmark-feed markdown-files… feed-file</code>.
The files it looks at once a day are my <a href="Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>.
The feed it generates is <a href="/wiki/bookmarks.rss">bookmarks.rss</a>.
The database it uses is <a href="/wiki/bookmarks.db">bookmarks.db</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do expiration from the database but uses only the last 40 items for the feed.</p>

<p>When populating the database, all I had was the timestamp of the Markdown pages, so the existing bookmarks are all relatively unsorted – they are sorted by the timestamp of the most recent addition to the whole category, which pretty weird.</p>

## Guadalcanal: 4

As I noted in my previous post, the peculiar nature of the Guadalcanal campaign creates a kind of narrative frame — the arrival by sea, the fighting, the departure by sea — that any account of the campaign is bound by.

## NotMyFault: Microsoft’s tool to create BSoDs

date: 2024-07-28, from: OS News

Blue screens of death are not exactly in short supply on Windows machines lately, but what if you really want to cause your own kernel panic or complete system crash, just because you love that shade of crashy blue? Well, there&#8217;s a tool for that called NotMyFault, developed by Mark Russinovich as part of Sysinternals. NotMyFault is a tool that you can use to crash, hang, and cause kernel memory leaks on your Windows system. It’s useful for learning how to identify and diagnose device driver and hardware problems, and you can also use it to generate blue screen dump files on misbehaving systems. The download file includes 32-bit and 64-bit versions, as well as a command-line version that works on Nano Server. Chapter 7 in Windows Internals uses NotMyFault to demonstrate pool leak troubleshooting and Chapter 14 uses it for crash analysis examples. ↫ Mark Russinovich Using this tool, you can select exactly what kind of crash you want to cause, and after clicking the Crash button, your Windows computer will do exactly as it&#8217;s told and crash with a lovely blue screen of death. It comes in both a GUI and CLI version, and the latter also works on minimal Windows installations that don&#8217;t have the Windows shell installed. A tool like this may seem odd, but it can be particularly useful in situations where you&#8217;re trying to troubleshoot an issue, and to learn how to properly diagnose crashes. Or, you know, you can use it to create a panic at your workplace.

## Managarm: microkernel-based OS with fully asynchronous I/O

date: 2024-07-28, from: OS News

Ah, another microkernel-based hobby operating system. The more, the merrier &#8211; and I mean this, without a hint of sarcasm. There&#8217;s definitely been a small resurgence in activity lately when it comes to small hobby and teaching operating systems, some of which are exploring some truly new ideas, and I&#8217;m definitely here for it. Today we have managarm. Some notable properties of managarm are: (i) managarm is based on a microkernel while common Desktop operating systems like Linux and Windows use monolithic kernels, (ii) managarm uses a completely asynchronous API for I/O and (iii) despite those internal differences, managarm provides good compatibility with Linux at the user space level. ↫ managarm GitHub page It&#8217;s a 64bit operating system with SMP support, an ACPI implementation, networking, USB3 support, and, as the quoted blurb details, a lot of support for Linux and POSIX. It can already run Weston, kmscon, and other things like Bash, the GNU Coreutils, and more. While not explicitly mentioned, I assume the best platform to run managarm on are most likely virtualisation tools, and there&#8217;s a detailed handbook to help you along during building and using this new operating system.

Now it isn't even one of the services I use that I can post to with my writing tool (those are Bluesky, Mastodon, WordPress). None of them are anything like the aggregator of people that Twitter was, and I can't even reach it from my writing tool. I really want to solve this problem, but I absolutely can't do this on my own. No time, patience, and it's not my job to do all that coding. As observed the other day, my time should be spent on writing tools for the web and directly related products. This is the kind of project that should be handled as an open source thing.

Barath Raghavan and Bruce Schneier: The [CrowdStrike] catastrophe is yet another reminder of how brittle global internet infrastructure is. […] This brittleness is a result of market incentives. In enterprise computing — as opposed to personal computing — a company that provides computing infrastructure to enterprise networks is incentivized to be as integral as possible, [&#8230;]

Why the single version of the cassette didn’t feel as worthy of a purchase as, say, a 45. Or, perhaps, even a digital download.
