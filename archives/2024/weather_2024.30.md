Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CDT Fri Jul 26 2024

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN PLAINS...GREAT BASIN...AND SOUTHWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms may occur today across the northern
Plains, Great Basin, and parts of the Southwest.

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest...
A prominent upper-level trough will continue eastward today over the
northern Canadian Prairies, with peripheral height falls and a
strengthening of southwesterly winds aloft across the Dakotas and
northern Minnesota. This will largely overlie an eastward-shifting
front, that will be oriented northeast-southwestward across eastern
North Dakota and roughly bisect South Dakota by late afternoon.

Beneath a plume of very warm and capping elevated mixed-layer air,
which will continue to advect northeastward across the northern
Great Plains through the day, a seasonably moist boundary layer will
support a narrow corridor of strong buoyancy across the Red River
Valley vicinity by late afternoon, where forcing for ascent should
support isolated to widely scattered thunderstorm development by
early evening. In the presence of at least 30-40 kt deep-layer
shear, a couple of supercells appear possible to the south of the
international border, especially across northwest Minnesota, and
perhaps as far southwest as areas near/west of Grand Forks and
Fargo.

Additional severe storms may also develop near/behind the front
across western/central South Dakota and far eastern Wyoming into
western Nebraska.

...Arizona...
Cloud cover and outflows will abate across central/southern Arizona
early today after a couple of relatively active thunderstorm days.
This will be as the upper ridge over the Southwest further weakens
and shifts southward. While thunderstorms are expected to
develop/increase over the Rim this afternoon, and modestly stronger
north-northeasterly steering flow may remain across far southeast
Arizona, a less-active scenario seems likely as far as storms
reaching the desert floor. While some strong/severe-caliber winds
could occur, any such potential should remain relatively localized
with a diminished overall severe risk from prior days.

...Great Basin...
In the wake of a shortwave trough, storm coverage/intensity are not
expected to be as active as Thursday, but moderate diurnal
destabilization is expected especially across western/northern Utah,
with isolated/widely scattered thunderstorm development expected
this afternoon. A few of these storms could produce
strong/severe-caliber downbursts. A secondary round, and perhaps
somewhat greater coverage of storms, may occur tonight across Nevada
into western/northern Utah, influenced by the eastward transition of
the mid-level shortwave trough over northern California.

## Tropical Storm Bud Forecast Discussion Number 8

Tropical Storm Bud Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022024
200 AM PDT Fri Jul 26 2024
 
Bud is currently only generating isolated patches of deep 
convection to the south and southwest of the center.  The various 
subjective and objective satellite intensity estimates have 
continued to decrease and are now in the 30-40 kt range.  Using 
these data, the initial intensity is lowered to a somewhat 
uncertain 35 kt.

The initial motion is now 285/9 kt.  Bud is on the south side of a 
low- to mid-level subtropical ridge, and this feature should steer 
the cyclone generally westward today.  After that, Bud or its 
remnants should turn west-southwestward in the low-level trade wind 
flow.  The guidance again has nudged to the north of the previous 
guidance, and the new forecast track is thus also nudged northward.

While it is possible there could be one more convective flare-up 
this morning, all of the guidance indicates that Bud should 
continue to weaken due to moving over cooler sea surface 
temperatures and into a more stable air mass.  Based on this, the 
new intensity forecast calls for Bud to weaken to a depression 
later today and degenerate to a remnant low pressure area by 24 h.  
The remnant low is forecast to dissipated between 60-72 h based on 
the global model guidance.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Fri Jul 26 2024

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
As a mid-level trough progresses eastward from California into the
northern Great Basin on Saturday, isolated dry thunderstorms are
expected across portions of eastern Idaho, southwestern Montana,
western Wyoming, and portions of far northern Utah. This trough is
also expected to bring dry and windy conditions to much of southern
Nevada into southwestern Utah. 

...Dry Thunder...
An approaching trough from California is expected to bring chances
for isolated dry thunderstorms to portions of Idaho, Montana,
Wyoming, and Utah. Recent wetting rainfall could potentially limit
some lightning ignitions, but pockets of receptive fuels still
remain across much of the highlight area. Dry boundary-layer
profiles will support gusty thunderstorm outflow that could
contribute to wildfire spread with any lightning based ignitions. 

...Southern Great Basin...
Relative humidity of 5-10% and wind speeds of 25-30 MPH are expected
across southern Nevada into southwestern Utah, exceeding the
meteorological criteria for critical conditions. However, there is
uncertainty in the receptiveness of fuels to wildfire spread due to
recent significant wetting rainfall, precluding the inclusion of
critical highlights at this time.

## Tropical Storm Bud Forecast Discussion Number 5

Tropical Storm Bud Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022024
800 AM PDT Thu Jul 25 2024

Since the time of the special advisory issued earlier this morning, 
the organization of Bud on satellite imagery has not changed much.  
The moderate easterly shear that had been affecting the cyclone 
appears to have diminished slightly.  This has allowed the 
low-level center to be located underneath the central convective 
area.  The latest subjective intensity estimate from TAFB is 45 kt, 
while some of the University of Wisconsin-CIMSS objective estimates 
have also been around 45 kt.  Given the 49-kt surface observation 
from Isla Clarion at 0930 UTC this morning, the initial intensity is 
held at 50 kt for this advisory.

There have not been any significant changes to the general synoptic 
steering pattern.  A low- to mid-level ridge located to the north 
of Bud will steer the cyclone generally westward at a similar 
forward speed for the next 24 h.  As the cyclone weakens and 
becomes shallower, it should turn towards the west-southwest and 
decelerate.  The guidance has shifted notably north and faster with 
this cycle.  The new NHC track forecast is adjusted about midway 
between the previous NHC forecast and the latest consensus track 
aids.

As for the intensity forecast, Bud should be traversing sea-surface 
temperatures of around 26.5-27C over the next day or two, which is 
slightly cooler than the 28C waters that Bud is over currently.  
The vertical wind shear should be relatively low over the next 
couple of days.  Bud will be gradually moving into a slightly drier 
airmass.  The latest dynamical and hurricane intensity models weaken 
Bud more quickly than the statistical intensity guidance, and the 
NHC forecast splits the difference and is close to the intensity 
consensus.  This new NHC intensity forecast is higher than the 
previous one and keeps Bud a tropical storm a bit longer.  Given 
that the global models show Bud becoming a remnant low rather 
quickly despite relatively favorable environmental conditions, the 
intensity forecast confidence is a bit lower than average during the 
first 48 h of the forecast.  After that time, confidence is higher 
that the cyclone will be significantly weakening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1704
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0531 PM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Areas affected...Southern Arizona

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 559...

Valid 242231Z - 250000Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 559
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across WW 559, primarily for
severe wind gusts from thunderstorm outflow.

DISCUSSION...The severe thunderstorm threat continues for WW 559
across southern Arizona, where daytime heating has resulted in
surface temperatures rising into the 110s F. With surface dewpoints
in the lower-to-mid 60s F, MLCAPE values of 1000-1500 J/kg across
southwest portions of the watch area will continue to support
thunderstorm development in the short term. Proximity sounding
profiles show deeply mixed boundary layers with large saturation
deficits, and very-weak to weak deep layer shear, supporting the
threat for severe wind gusts from thunderstorm outflow. 

The greatest short-term threat for severe wind gusts is currently
confined to southern portions of the watch, where buoyancy is
maximized and thunderstorms are ongoing. This threat will continue
as storms move southwest towards the Mexican border, but should
diminish after dark.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 559
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
200 PM MST Wed Jul 24 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and southern Arizona

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 200 PM
  until 900 PM MST.

* Primary threats include...
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Clusters of thunderstorms will form over the Rim and
spread southwestward to the lower deserts through late evening.  The
storm environment will favor strong downdrafts capable of producing
occasional damaging/severe outflow gusts of 60-70 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west southwest
of Phoenix AZ to 65 miles east northeast of Tucson AZ. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
03020.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 PM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Valid 261200Z - 011200Z

Fire weather concerns will focus in parts of the Great Basin and
northern Rockies late this week into the weekend. Thereafter, fire
weather concerns will become more localized given an amplifying
upper ridge in part of the western/central U.S. and a benign surface
pattern where fuels remain driest.

...Wind/RH Concerns...
While the main shortwave trough will exit Montana into the Canadian
Prairie, some moderately strong mid-level winds will linger across
Montana and Idaho. Farther south, the compact tropical disturbance
will move into the Great Basin. A few locations may see elevated
fire weather on Friday. The highest confidence is in Northeast
California into adjacent Nevada/Oregon as well as the Snake River
Plain and parts of northwest Montana.

On Saturday, the shortwave trough in the Great Basin will be losing
amplitude, but a enhanced mid-level winds will remain in the
southern Basin. Strong surface winds are possible during the
afternoon. Some area fuels will have been impacted by several days
of convection. However, latest ERC data suggest there are still dry
enough fuels to support fire spread. When coupled with the recent
lightning activity, some potential for holdover fires to increase in
activity is possible with the stronger winds/low RH expected.

For Sunday and beyond, the upper-level pattern will feature a
building ridge centered along the Divide. Dry conditions are
probable in many places within the West, but winds will generally be
lighter outside of terrain/mesoscale-enhanced areas. Predictability
of critical fire weather is too low for any highlights.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
With the approach of the weak disturbance, a few drier thunderstorms
are possible in parts of central/northern Nevada on Friday. These
storms will generally occur over areas that have had fuel
receptiveness decrease recently. Thunderstorm activity will shift
into eastern Idaho into western Wyoming on Saturday and possibly
Sunday. Fuels are drier in these areas, but moisture may be too
limited and storm coverage is somewhat in question this far in
advance.

With some very broad troughing over the Northwest, some isolated
thunderstorms could occur over some of the terrain features.
Coverage is likely too low for highlights and fuels may moderate
somewhat due to the cooler conditions under the influence of the
upper trough.

## Tropical Storm Bud Forecast Discussion Number 1

Tropical Storm Bud Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP022024
200 PM MST Wed Jul 24 2024
 
Satellite imagery indicates that the disturbance located several 
hundred miles south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja 
California peninsula has become much better organized over the past 
12 hours or so.  The latest subjective Dvorak intensity estimate 
from TAFB is T-2.0/30 kt, and a pair of recent ASCAT passes shows 
a well-defined cyclone with 35-kt winds.  Based on the ASCAT data 
and the improvement in convective organization observed on GOES-18 
satellite images, advisories are being initiated on Tropical Storm 
Bud.

Bud is currently moving to the west-northwest at 14 kt.  A mid-level 
ridge to the north of Bud will cause a gradual turn to the west over 
the next day.  On Friday, with Bud likely weakening, the cyclone 
should turn to the southwest and decelerate, following the low-level 
flow.

Bud is currently in an environment that appears favorable in terms 
of warm SSTs and a moderately moist environment, but there appears 
to be some easterly shear affecting the cyclone.  Therefore, no 
change in strength is expected during the next day or so,
although some slight intensification cannot be ruled out.  Beyond 
36 h, the cyclone should begin traversing decreasing sea surface 
temperatures, and move into an environment of drier air and 
increasing vertical wind shear.  Therefore, gradual weakening is 
forecast during that time.  The intensity forecast is near 
the middle of the guidance envelope and calls for the cyclone to 
become a remnant low on Friday, and dissipate on Saturday.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Valid 242000Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR
WESTERN/CENTRAL NY INTO NORTHWESTERN PA...AND SOUTHERN ARIZONA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms may produce damaging wind gusts
across western/central New York and vicinity, the northern Rockies,
and across southern Arizona this afternoon/evening.

...20z Update...
The current D1 Outlook remains on track with no changes needed with
this update. 

Several clusters of thunderstorms are ongoing along a cold front
extending from the Great Lakes region northeastward into portions of
New York. In this region, daytime heating has yielded around
1000-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE with 30-40 kts of deep layer shear. In this
regime, some more organized cells have produced wind damage across
portions of New York and Pennsylvania. The threat for strong to
severe gusts will continue through the afternoon and evening,
shifting eastward with the front.

Farther west, two areas of potential continue with a Marginal Risk
across the Northern Rockies and a Slight Risk across southern
Arizona. Within these regions, damaging wind will be possible with
thunderstorm activity this afternoon. See MCD #1701 for more
information on the threat across southern Arizona.

..Thornton/Thompson.. 07/24/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024/

...Western/central NY and northwest PA this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel trough will progress eastward from the upper Great Lakes
toward NY as an associated surface cold front likewise moves
eastward into western NY and southeastward into OH/northwest PA
through this evening.  Surface heating is underway in a corridor
ahead of the cold front from northern OH into western NY where
boundary-layer dewpoints are in the mid-upper 60s with surface
temperatures warming into the lower 80s, and a band of convection
has already developed from Lake Erie to western Lake Ontario.  These
storms may persist into the afternoon while spreading eastward, with
additional development possible along convective outflow, a
pre-frontal confluence zone and/or local lake breeze boundaries. 
Midlevel lapse rates will remain modest (roughly 6.5 C/km), but the
low-level moisture/warming temperatures will drive MLCAPE in the
1000-1500 J/kg range.  Deep-layer vertical shear/hodograph length
will be on the lower margins for organized clusters/cells per local
VWPs now sampling 30-40 kt midlevel flow, while steepening low-level
lapse rates will support the potential for occasional wind damage
with strong thunderstorm outflow in the 50-60 mph range.

...Southern AZ this afternoon/evening...
Strong surface heating is underway near and south of the Rim, and
late afternoon temperatures will peak near or above 110 F across the
lower deserts into southern AZ.  Moisture will be sufficient for
thunderstorm development this afternoon along the Rim and the
mountains in southeast AZ, while northeasterly midlevel flow of
15-20 kt will steer outflows southwestward toward the lower deserts.
 MLCAPE will increase to the 1000-1500 J/kg with deep inverted-V
profiles favoring strong downdrafts and outflow winds of 60-75 mph
capable of producing wind damage and substantial blowing dust.  The
relatively greater severe threat will be with the stronger/deeper
convection driven by outflow mergers.

...Northern Rockies area this afternoon/evening...
A plume of mainly midlevel moisture with PW values of 0.75-1 inch
(per BOI and LKN 12z soundings) will persist around the northern
periphery of a midlevel high over the Great Basin, and southeast of
a midlevel trough approaching WA.  High-based thunderstorms are
expected in a few loosely organized clusters within this plume,
where deep inverted-V profiles will support the potential for a few
strong-severe outflow gusts 50-65 mph.

...Mid-Atlantic into NC this afternoon...
Modest surface heating within small cloud breaks and boundary-layer
dewpoints of 72-74 F will contribute MLCAPE approaching 1500 J/kg to
the east of the Blue Ridge, though midlevel lapse rates will remain
poor.  Still, the southern extent of 30-40 kt midlevel flow will
support a low-end wind damage threat with the stronger storm
clusters this afternoon.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0953 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The ongoing forecast remains on track. No changes were made. 

... Northern Rockies ...

Several hours of gusty winds will promote elevated-to-critical fire
weather conditions in and around the Cascade Gaps. A categorical
upgrade to Critical was contemplated with this forecast, but the
spatial extent of the area potentially achieving critical thresholds
is too small and the duration too short to attempt to highlight.
That said, the combination of wind, relative humidity, along with
the potential for new fire starts associated with isolated dry
thunderstorms, may result in an active fire weather day.

Elsewhere, no changes were made to the ongoing forecast.

..Marsh.. 07/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough over the Northwest will remain in place west of
a weakening upper ridge centered across the northern Rockies.
Stronger flow aloft will gradually overspread the Northwest and
northern Rockies through the week. Isolated dry thunderstorms and
gusty downslope winds will promote elevated fire-weather potential
today and tonight.

...Northwest and northern Rockies...
Lingering mid-level moisture ahead of the consolidating Pacific
trough will again support the risk for thunderstorms across the
Northwest and northern Rockies this afternoon and evening. While
weaker than previous days, subtle ascent and diurnal heating over
the terrain should allow for isolated storms to develop across parts
of the northern Great Basin and Northwest by early afternoon. Low
precipitation efficiency, owing to PWATs under 1 inch, and low
surface RH will support the risk for lightning with little to no
wetting rainfall. With area fuels still receptive to ignitions,
IsoDryT probabilities have been maintained.

West/southwest flow aloft is forecast to increase over the northern
Rockies and Cascade Gaps ahead of the trough. This may promote
several hours of gusty downslope winds across parts of eastern ID
and western MT. Model guidance shows surface winds of 15-25 mph
overlapping with RH values below 25%. This, along with the increase
in lightning and numerous ongoing fires, will support the potential
for elevated fire-weather conditions this afternoon.
