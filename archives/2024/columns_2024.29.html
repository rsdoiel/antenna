“We are excited to invite you to the 2024 One Page Dungeon Contest. We
are accepting submissions starting now and to the end of July. The
contest challenge is to create an intriguing and fun dungeon to play… on
only one page. We would love to see you get involved.” –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I submitted an entry for the One Page Dungeon Contest. Since I would
like the dungeons to be close to the prep I do for my own games so that
I feel like I belong to a community of referees that spends a similar
amount of time for their adventures I took some of my (German) prep
notes, cleaned them up and added some text boxes using Inskape and
decided against spending time on polishing it up.
</p>
<p>
At the time, my players had a hard time getting past the gate.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-08-22_Hammond_verfolgt_den_Orkzug">2023-08-22
Hammond verfolgt den Orkzug</a> is when a player tracked a group of orcs
as they reinforced the existing orc lair

<li>
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-09-20_Das_Endes_des_Balrogs">2023-09-20
Das Endes des Balrogs</a> was the first attempt at taking the lair in
which they faced the fire demon and hell hounds
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-09-26_Der_Kampf_auf_den_Galerien_von_Grosshammer">2023-09-26
Der Kampf auf den Galerien von Grosshammer</a>, this is where they found
a back entrance
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Result:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/pdfs/Orc_Halls_by_Alex_Schroeder_1.pdf">Orc Halls by Alex
Schroeder</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At the time I had a second 10-headed hydra, too…
</p>
<p>
The boss orcs had 3, 5 and 7 hit dice.
</p>
<p>
And later, when the players had killed all the orcs, a bunch of goblins
led by one Eye Poker resettled the halls.
</p>
<p>
These are the stats I would use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>orcs</strong> HD 1 AC 6 1d6 F1 MV 12 ML 8 XP 100</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Grishg</strong> HD 3 AC 6 1d6 F3 MV 12 ML 8 XP 300; with
<em>gauntlets of max strength</em> granting +3; under the influence of
the demon
</li>
<li>
<strong>Shagdog</strong> HD 5 AC 6 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 8 XP 500; lightning
bolt 1×/day for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; very loyal to Maufimbul
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ashuak</strong> HD 5 AC 3 1d6 F5 MV 6 ML 9 XP 500; willing to
buy freedom and leave
</li>
<li>
<strong>Maufimbul</strong> HD 7 AC 3 1d6 F7 MV 6 ML 9 XP 700; wielding
<em>Fur Hunter</em> +1/+3 vs. mammals; traditionalist spear dancer
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>boars</strong> HD 3+1 AC 6 1d8 F1 MV 15 ML 9 XP 300
</li>
<li>
<strong>hell hounds</strong> HD 5 AC 4 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; fire
2/6 for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; see invisible (that pack of hell
hounds is also the random encounter)
</li>
<li>
<strong>small pyrohydra</strong> HD 5 (40hp, 8hp per head) AC 5 1d10 per
head F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; regrowing heads (unless cauterized with fire
or ice, up to 7 more heads may grow, one per round, each with 8 hp);
fire breath 3×/day: deal as much damage as it has hit-points left, save
vs. breath for half; poisonous blood: when cutting off a head in melee,
save vs. poison or die; immune to fire and poison
</li>
<li>
<strong>fire demon</strong> HD 9+1 AC 4 1d6/2d6 F20 MV 12 ML 11; flying;
aura of fire 1d6 (everybody within 10 ft); when the first attack with
the flaming whip hits, the second attack with the flaming sword is at
+4; only harmed by magic and magical weapons; immune to fire (the
flaming whip and the flaming sword are two magic items that can be taken
from the demon)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Clearly, the pyrohydra is the worst if you fight it without multiple
lightning bolts or the like.
</p>
<p>
As for intelligent monsters, I figured that it would be possible to
somehow sneak in and overhear orcs talk about the four bosses. If
somebody wanted to, the power dynamic could be exploited. As it turned
out, though, my players tried to force the front gate with sleep spells,
alerted the guards, which brought on the fire demon and all the hell
hounds. The enemies were destroyed but the party had to retreat. Next
time, the party found the outlook, sent up a ranger with dark vision and
a magic item that could charm humanoids. He killed the four orc guards,
climbed down the netting into the cavern, found the way to the shooting
gallery, started killing all the orcs and that was the signal the others
needed to begin the race down the the long stairs. At the bottom, the
orcs had cajoled a ten-headed pyrohydra into the Merchant Hall but it
died in the first round after being hit by lightning bolts and other
spells.
</p>
<p>
The treasure map to the Cistern of Sulphur does not contain any new
monsters or traps; it’s not a new lair or dungeon. It’s part of the
treasure gained here so all it takes is a one day trip up the mountains
to that sulphur cavern. The only risk involved is random encounters.

<p>BTW, Al Sharpton should write the defining op-ed in the NYT, not
George Clooney, who is very pretty, and a great choice to cast in movies
like Up In The Air or Michael Clayton, but we don’t know <i>anything</i>
about his political judgement. He hasn’t done anything to tell us who he
is in that dimension. To the extent that we do know anything about him:
1. He’s a jokester. 2. He has a brilliant and beautiful wife. 3. He has
a huge villa in Italy which he keeps very private. That’s about it. He’s
rich. We have nothing in common. He should run for office and get in the
mix. The fact that the NYT chose him, that says something about them,
other than they don’t care what people think, or they think we’re really
shallow and will fall for bullshit like George Clooney who says he loves
Biden. We didn’t even know he knew Joe Biden! Why should Clooney have
more of a say in this than I do? Tell me what Nancy Pelosi thinks, or Al
Sharpton (I know I said that before). Or give Michael Moore a shot. He
has a lot more skin in the game than Clooney. I’d love to read an op-ed
by David Frum. Liz Cheney! I would be interested in her opinion on
this.</p>

<p>Government should roll out new initiatives with the same skill as
Apple rolls out new products. Not the same as Steve Jobs, that’s asking
too much. But with focus and showmanship, and a livestream, and fanbois
and Al Sharpton in place of John Gruber. Focus our attention on each
product (ie climate change, social security, Ukraine, etc), so the ideas
don’t get missed, and we can network in support of the initiative. This
is all part of the idea of having a <i>democratic.party</i> website that
we call call home for our political organizing. None of this pissing in
the wind we do on twitter-like systems. Form buddy groups of people we
organize with, based on locality or common interests. Organize the
people as well as the billionaires are organized. This is what political
parties should be in 2024 for crying out loud. We’re missing the point
of the mess in our politics. It’s all a mess because it needs to be
organized and it’s not. Maybe I should take everything else off my blog
now so I can use what little attention I have been able to gather here
to focus on this idea. <i>We. Need. To. Organize.</i></p>

We should hire an intern at some J-school to keep track of all of my
tweets, write them down, then translate each into a rule for what a news
organization should do instead of not do. Flip the sense of the rule in
other words.
</p>
<p>
Then we feed those rules to an AI.
</p>
<p>
Then we flow in the news stories of the day from various sites through
the same AI for translation. Yes I know they’d complain
<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/vociferous">vociferously</a>,
but which ones you use don’t matter because the AI algorithm will
translate whatever they are to Dave Winer tense.
</p>
<p>
Then of course publish them to another site called The News That Helps
Us All Stay Sane.

2024-07-02 The importance of moderation
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a> recently wrote
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/usenet">Usenet had to die</a>,
arguing that Usenet was wasteful, everybody carrying a copy of everybody
else, including spam and binaries. I agree with all the points made. The
idea that there is one global network of groups, with everybody carrying
all the groups and everybody being allowed to post led to the downfall
of Usenet.
</p>
<p>
Having recently hooked my laptop and server server to a handful of other
servers using UUCP, NNCP and NNTP for file copies, mail and news, I just
want to emphasize that the same technology can be used to build a
different net.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UUCP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Calling systems can be required to
have a username and password.
</li>
<li>
NNTP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Systems can be known peers based on
IP numbers and users can be required to authenticate themselves.
</li>
<li>
Servers don’t have to mirror all the groups. Systems can be selective in
what they accept and in what they pass on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The spam problem arises when two systems “trust” each other and peer
messages but one of the systems doesn’t act on abuse and moderation
reports. Perhaps Usenet generated too much of a workload for system
administrators so they stopped following up on those reports. Perhaps
some servers had become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
I think we have the exact same problems with fedi. Some instances seem
too big to defederate from.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn’t work. If my posts end up on
an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me, the post
shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the other users
that I don’t like can comment and those comments are sent back to me. I
can block them all individually or block the large instance including my
small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are not
to blame for the downfall of Usenet. It was the lack of moderation that
killed Usenet. It was the ease of setting up web forums and being able
to moderate them that made Usenet irrelevant. In the end, to all these
people federation was not as important as moderation.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to drop the groups that were overrun with
people that needed moderation. This is a problem on all platforms with
groups, e.g. Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to create new groups for people in their
niches. At least nobody seems to be making that mistake again. IRC,
Reddit, Discord – they all demonstrated that ad-hoc group formation and
self-moderation was viable.
</p>
<p>
This is why I think moderation, group forming and selectivity of
federation are the most important quality of a platform.
</p>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.

Ah, that’s not a super new post, it’s from September 2023. I dug it out
again since we were talking about Illuminant, which seems awesome. It
uses hashtags only as post keywords and instead, if I understand things
correctly, relies on FEP-1b12 to provide group support.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s not quite the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s a bad thing that I’ve being hesitant to defederate from m.soc
even though I get more spam from it over Fedi than I’ve been getting
from email fro the past several years.
</p>
<p>
But I’m still only getting individual posts from m.soc or any other
server. (Which is also why hashtags don’t work the way people think.)
</p>
<p>
On Usenet, the typical behavior would be to carry the whole thing.
Currently, I get dozens of spam messages from m.soc. If I were to mirror
the whole thing (which is possible with AP relays, and is what would be
necessary for hashtags to work like channels, me mirroring the entirety
of all the non-banned servers), I’d have to deal with thousands of
messages. My server would croak.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A problem. But again something that was way worse with usenet because on
there, not only would I mirror or moderate abusive replies to me. I had
to mirror abusive replies to <em>everybody</em>.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I’m, for the most part, glad that the servers-that-can-comment
aren’t allowlisted, that it works like email, that I can get comments
from anyone. The downside of that is having to ban ban ban like crazy,
but if it didn’t work like that I’m not sure it even would be federated.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

my small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A problem. But on Usenet, <em>every</em> instance was too big to ban
since every instance was expected to carry everything.
</p>
<p>
Individual blocks is one way around it. That’s why I, a small instance
op, while I’ve banned many small mainly-abuse instances, my need to ban
the big sloppily moderated silos like m.soc or threads is a li’l lower
since I don’t have hundreds of users to protect, which a midsize
instance would have. I can absolutely see why midsize “safe space”
instances would ban m.soc for example.
</p>
<p>
Also I “silence” every instance since I don’t have a “whole known
network” tab.
</p>
<p>
Killfiles was a user-level way to mute users on newsgroups. So there was
<em>some</em> mitigation, but Fedi additionally has several other
moderation tools like instance bans or silencing.
</p>
<p>
More fundamentally: ActivityPub is about sending individual posts.
Usenet was about mirroring entire servers. Those two are not the same.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The context that I wrote that Usenet post last September was to rant
about hashtags. (A topic that I’m gonna return to every now and then
until the group/tag situation gets a li’l better, which might require
new UX affordances or perhaps only education.)
</p>
<p>
That problem, summarized:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Servers can only show you the posts that it has already stumbled over,
through following or commenting
</li>
<li>
So when you browse a hashtag, you only see a very small subset of those
posts
</li>
<li>
Which is fine for organizing a handful of persons posts, like “I wanna
see all of Marie’s <code>#tidying</code> posts” or “I wanna go back and
take a look at all of my already-followed-friends
<code>#mosstodon</code> posts” or even for filtering out stuff. I.e.
it’s OK as a tool for <em>subsets</em> and <em>intersection</em>
</li>
<li>
It’s a disaster for <em>union</em>, for discovery, for “emulating
channels” which people are used to from Tumblr and Twitter, which worked
there since those are centralized
</li>
<li>
For hashtags to work the way people expect them to, servers would have
to mirror all posts. Like on Usenet.
</li>
<li>
There was an effort in that direction early on, with the “relay” system.
</li>
<li>
But small servers would croak. <strong>That’s</strong> the problem. It’d
be an environmental waste heap.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And that’s absolutely a protocol level problem!
</p>
<p>
A protocol level problem that Usenet had even without hashtags. (Well,
there was one hashtag: Kibo.)
</p>
<p>
I’ve said a couple of times that servers mirror each other and for the
sticklers in the audience I’ve got to add that not literally
<em>every</em> server carried <em>every</em> group. For example, some
didn’t carry Anarchists Lunatics Terrorists a.k.a. the <code>alt</code>
hierarchy. But that’s the fundamental intended flow. Group mirroring.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Usenet_servers_and_clients.svg" alt="Usenet
architecture" />
</p>
<p>
So in that way, Usenet is unlike mailing lists, where individual
messages are sent to individual users. FEP-1b12 group servers on Fedi
(like PieFed and MBin) are awesome because they get the best of both
worlds of the “only send the relevant posts” nature of mailing lists,
and the “we’re hosting this post anyway so we only need to store it once
in the SQL” nature of Usenet. As long as one user on a Lemmy server is
subscribed to <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="garderning">@garderning</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="foo.bar">@foo.bar</span></code>, like an email user might be
subscribed to a mailing list, it might-as-well display a copy of that
group since it’s getting those messages anyway. It’s not perfect and
we’re still paying a hefty “decentralization tax”, but it’s more robust
than mail and news.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet. It was the ease of
setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made Usenet
irrelevant.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Naw, Usenet kept puttering along after that, for a while, until the cost
(and legal danger) of mirroring huge binaries archives which was the
nail of nails. And that was a protocol level issue.
</p>
<p>
Fedi absolutely has a moderation problem. That is being addressed
although it seems to me that there are still unsolved problems.<br>
Usenet had a much bigger moderation problem and much of the reason for
that was on the protocol level. We have instances and instance bans to
help moderate clusters of users where each instance op helps moderate
the users on their instance. Moderation is happening on a user level
which makes much more sense than on a group level. (Someone can be a
saint on <code>alt.suicide.holiday</code> but a jerk on
<code>alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</code> for example.)
</p>
<p>
But Usenet also has a scalability problem. Resource use. Better
moderation wouldn’t be nearly enough to fix that.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Email can’t moderate their users since email isn’t supposed to be
world-readable. (With exceptions like mailing lists; we can ban someone
who sends abusive messages to those.) But even so, instance banning is
very common on email.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Last time I talked about this I got the world’s most stubborn reply guy
on my neck who (since he was on a huge instance) could use hashtags to
find at least some amount of interesting posts and was resistant to
change. Since I mentioned scalability issues and how my server would
croak if it were to try to mirror even <em>one</em> of the big
instances, he started going on and on about “scalability is only for
capitalists”.
</p>
<p>
Yet another case of Smolnet Wishful Thinking Syndrome. The kind of
thinking that hates Eternal September more than anything but keeps
designing protocols that lead to more Eternal Septembers since they’re
about everyone-seeing-everyone and then they resort to technical
gatekeeping or even bullying to keep people out. Not into it.
</p>
<p>
My criticism of Usenet’s protocol here has nothing to do with capitalist
scaling, which is about “throwing computers at it”. Sure, that’d be one
solution to the protocol problems inherent to Usenet and
relay-laden-ActivityPub.
</p>
<p>
Real Smolnet scaling is about designing protocols that are about
connecting people to people (and to topic groups or other communities),
and in a non-wasteful, mottainai way create small overlapping villages
instead of one big shout-loud-and-go-viral channel.
</p>
<p>
There are two kinds of protocols. Those where everyone must see
everything (like Antenna and CAPCOM, and Twitter), and those where
that’s not the case (like ActivityPub and email).
</p>
<p>
Here are three network layouts:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://ellen.idiomdrottning.org/baran_networks.png" alt="Baran networks" />
</p>
<p>
First we have a centralized network. One hub server and then every
client is a spoke connected to that center core. The most efficient way
to organize an “everyone-must-see-everything” protocol, but vulnerable
to disasters like meteor strikes, nuclear explosions, billionaire
takeovers, or earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
Then we have a decentralized network. Several hubs connected to each
other, mirroring each other. Usenet worked like that. The hubs need to
be just as beefy as the ones in a centralized network. This has some
advantages like redundancy and robustnesss, and it’s more politically
appealing to the anarchists that built the internet. (Not sure why since
there’s still two tiers and a mod group that rules everything for
everyone.) It can be wasteful. It can handle
everyone-must-see-everything protocols. It can also really shine when
everyone <em>doesn’t</em> need to see everything, like IRC which is
super efficient. IRC is a brilliant protocol design that, like a mailing
list, only sends the messages to a server that that server needs.
</p>
<p>
Finally we have a distributed network. No hubs. It looks more like a
mesh where every machine is connected to only a handful of “nearby”
machines. This type of network is an absolute disaster for the
everyone-must-see-everything scenario! Redundant to the point of
wastefulness. That’s a future we must fight tooth and nail! And that’s
exactly where the relay-centered version of ActivityPub was headed, and
that’s what would be “needed” for hashtags-as-groups-and-discovery to
“work”.
</p>
<p>
Here’s where we the grassroots federalized ancom degrowth community need
to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves because even though
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/energy-is-undercosted" title="Energy is undercosted">energy
and e-waste is underpriced</a>, a capitalist for-profit silo company
would never in a million years set up a system like this because it’s
too wasteful ever for them, while we’re liable to do so since each
instance op only sees their <em>own</em> costs, not the cost for the
network as a whole. The megacorps are OK with centralization because for
them, the power consolidation in the first two network types is a
positive, while for us it’s a huge negative so we’re drawn to the third
type, so we need to be really careful and really responsible here.
</p>
<p>
But as bad as this layout is for everyone-must-see-everything, it’s
really awesome for protocols where everyone <em>doesn’t</em> need to see
everything. It’s economical, robust, cozy. ActivityPub (without the
relentless mirroring) is a good fit here. I can follow a handful of
users and be connected to their instances and only their posts are sent
to my instance, I don’t mirror the entire server. It’s actually pretty
awesome! It’s good for moderation too because I only need to moderate my
“neighborhood”. Yeah, a “neighborhood” is the perfect analogy for this;
neighborhoods that can and overlap but are still small and managed. A
system set up like that can remain smol and cozy even as it invites
everyone on Earth. It’s great. ActivityPub is awesome.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-08</strong>. I got a reply from
<a href="https://koldfront.dk/">Adam Sjøgren</a> regarding Sandra’s
comment on hashtag use in
<a href="https://illuminant.asjo.org/">Illuminant</a>.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
⁂
</div>
<p>
ActivityPub hashtags are translated to Keywords: and vice versa in
Illuminant. So far I haven’t had the need to use hashtags/keywords for
more than showing/writing them in Keywords: - I did have a plan to have
groups like fediverse.keyword.music, fediverse.keyword.askfedi etc. etc.
but I haven’t implemented it.
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry to say that I do not know what FEP-1b12 is, so I don’t think
Illuminant implements any of the group support defined in that.
</p>
<p>
Since Illuminant is very much driven by what I personally want and feel
like implementing/have the energy to implement, it has a kind of skewed
subset of what I guess is expected from a fediverse server/user
interface by most…
</p>
<p>
While it is fun for me to hear somebody call Illuminant awesome, I must
say that I’m pretty sure there is only one person in the universe who
actually runs it. Being proven wrong would be awesome, though.

<p>Friends, I want to ask you, candidly: How are you doing? The last two
weeks — beginning with the Biden-Trump debate when Biden looked and
sounded even older than his years and Trump lied even more than usual,
followed by the Democrats’ public agonizing over whether Biden should
drop out, and then Saturday’s attempted assassination of Trump at a
rally in Pennsylvania — have been harrowing.</p>

<p>Shortly after 6:00 yesterday evening at a Trump rally in Butler,
Pennsylvania, a shooter on the roof of a building about 400 feet from
the stage appears to have shot eight bullets at the former president and
into the crowd. Trump appeared to flinch and reach for his right ear as
Secret Service agents crouched over the former president. When the
agents got word the shooter was “down,” they lifted Trump to move him
out. He asked to get his shoes and then to put them on.</p>

2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux
</h1>
<p>
On the last day, we decided to go for a walk nearby instead of getting
on the train immediately. We took the train to Yvonand and turned
towards the hills, spending most of our time in the forest. This is
<a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/route-129">route
129</a>.
</p>
<p>
When leaving the fields around Yvonand and entering the woods, the
autobahn arches high above. If only it were a fantastic train and not a
triumph for car culture.
</p>
<p>

This bridge marks the beginning of the way up, if I remember.

<p>

Once you leave the forest, you’re on the plateau above. We ate lunch at
the Hotel de Ville in Chavannes-le-Chêne.

And here’s a weird one from the night before: Apparently the square in

station bathroom trying to keep drug addicts away.

Somewhat creepy.

<p>
BTW, I’m intermittently locked out of my
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa">Threads</a>
account.
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png">They
say</a> it has to do with automated stuff they don’t explain. I don’t
have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried
changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network,
it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no
energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don’t see me over
there, this is why.
</p>
<p>
How I found out about Trump’s assassination. By accident, I was watching
CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few
minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to
season 6 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty">Line of
Duty</a>, which isn’t very great. I couldn’t focus on the show. I got my
iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting
that <i>he</i> hadn’t been killed, and somehow I knew that “he” was
Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump
asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his
fist, looking right into the camera. He’s 100 percent television actor.
Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn’t
cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed
killing him. He’s thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my
first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies
about being a victim, really is a victim, and we’ll never hear the end
of it. And it didn’t take long before a random Republican asshole was
saying this was Biden’s fault for saying Trump would end democracy,
which he has said he will, promised to do, and <i>we saw him try to do
it</i> on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the
temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides.
It didn’t take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate.
This was Biden’s fault they all agree. Occam’s Razor says this is over.
We aren’t going to vote in November. The deal is done because the
journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I’ve
yet to hear another explanation from them.
</p>
<p>
If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph,
they’d nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That’s how our
journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the
dictator. This is what it’s like after that happened. People inside big
companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize.
Now their malaise becomes ours.
</p>
<p>
BTW, if Biden steps aside don’t expect the Repubs won’t sue saying it’s
illegal, so guess what – not only don’t you get Biden, you don’t even
get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with
just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for
appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the
arguments already written.

<p>Friends, My first thought on hearing about the attempted shooting of
Donald Trump at a rally today in Pennsylvania was “I hope to god he’s
okay.” I thought this for the usual reasons we human beings hope that
