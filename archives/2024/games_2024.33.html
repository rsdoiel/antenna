<p>Who do you get to investigate a murder at the most secure superhero
stronghold in the world, and when every member of the Justice League is

<p>date: 2024-08-15, updated: 2024-08-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Elusive Samurai is a story about a samurai in hiding — but the series
itself is so flashy, I can’t help but marvel at every frame. The new
anime from CloverWorks is based on the life of Hōjō Tokiyuki, a
real-life historical figure who was heir to Japan’s shogunate in the
1300s. The story follows the […]</p>

<p>Last week, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), who’s currently running for vice
president on a ticket with former President Donald J. Trump, confirmed
for Semafor that once upon a time ago he played Magic: The Gathering. He

<p>I’m not supposed to speak to the four-person cast of The Crush House,

<p>As if 2022’s (totally not true) anal beads cheating scandal wasn’t

<p>William Gibson’s 1984 novel Neuromancer is a foundational work that

<p>Amazon’s latest trailer for the second season of The Lord of the
