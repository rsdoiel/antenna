<p>Fans and filmmakers have been feuding over what Wolverine’s costume
should look like in live action since the first X-Men movie ditched his
bumblebee-colored comics costume in favor of black leather, then
lampshaded the change with some only-for-fans character snark. (X-Men

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 5 Season 4 is called “Absolute Doom,” and as one

<p>Elusive Samurai is a story about a samurai in hiding — but the series
itself is so flashy, I can’t help but marvel at every frame. The new
anime from CloverWorks is based on the life of Hōjō Tokiyuki, a
real-life historical figure who was heir to Japan’s shogunate in the

<p>date: 2024-08-13, updated: 2024-08-14, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Elite Dangerous, the spacefaring game from Frontier Developments, has
had quite a few updates this year. The latest adds a new starship called
the Lakon Type-8 to the roster, only the second to be added to the game

<p>Learning how to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons can be a tough task, even
as each edition helps simplify and streamline the rules. Doing it
without a friend can be a tough feat, what with all the origins,
abilities, and, well, feats to choose from. If only we could all have
someone like Deborah Ann Woll […]</p>

<p>Even as Resident Evil has risen from the dead, Capcom’s other zombie
franchise, Dead Rising, has been in a state of decay since 2016. But a
new version of the original Dead Rising promises to breathe new life
into the series — and might indicate that Capcom is ready to take its
sillier zombie brand seriously again. […]</p>
