<p>Summary: In my first post covering the install of Snow Leopard on a
PPC Mac, I mentioned that I would follow up with more insights into
issues with this unsupported configuration, and workarounds that I had
found. This post provides those “insights”… more like “observations”,
but at any rate, a follow up on what works […]</p>

The circular economy – the newest magical word in the sustainable
development vocabulary – promises economic growth without environmental
destruction or waste. However, growth makes a circular economy
impossible, even if we recycle all raw materials and all recycling is
100% efficient. No technology can change that because it’s not a
technological problem. In addition, many modern products are too complex
to recycle.
</p>
<p>
In this series of articles, LOW←TECH MAGAZINE explores how the
circularity of various technologies like bicycles, solar panels, and
wind turbines evolves. Placing the recycling of resources in a
historical context makes clear that we are not moving toward a circular
economy but rather increasingly away from it.

July</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>There will be an out of schedule meeting held by the Midlands User
Group (MUG), at which the group’s own John Rickman will discuss the use
of StrongED as a scripting tool when programming in Python. MUG meetings
are usually held on a Saturday afternoons, with some being held in
person, and some online using Zoom. However, this meeting will instead
be held on Wednesday, 24th July, at 7:30pm – presumably to get around
other commitments, and possibly in the interests of encouraging
attendance; a Saturday afternoon in the middle…</p>

<p>WimpInfo is a small application that was previously supplied by
Quantum Software, and is now hosted here on RISCOSitory after Stuart
Halliday announced he was shutting down the software house. Its purpose
is to provide information about whatever is underneath the mouse pointer
– information about windows, icons, menus, and so on. This can be useful
to programmers when developing their applications to ensure their code
is doing what they think it’s doing, and that they’ve set up those
windows, icons, menus, and so on correctly. Fred Graute, of
StrongED…</p>
