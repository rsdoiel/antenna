Money from the Heritage Auction has gone out to the charities and to the individual artists (still a couple to track down). I have a dream of making things like this more normal in the comics world.

**@Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky** (date: 2024-06-04, from: Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky)

I used to write a couple of short stories a year for anthologies or magazines. And at the end of the decade I'd have a new short story collection. Some of the best things I've written are in those books.
