## Molecular characterization of vaginal microbiota using a new 22-species qRT-PCR test to achieve a relative-abundance and species-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis

date: 2024-06-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundNumerous bacteria are involved in the etiology of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Yet, current tests only focus on a select few. We therefore designed a new test targeting 22 BV-relevant species.MethodsUsing 946 stored vaginal samples, a new qPCR test that quantitatively identifies 22 bacterial species was designed. The distribution and relative abundance of each species, α- and β-diversities, correlation, and species co-existence were determined per sample. A diagnostic index was modeled from the data, trained, and tested to classify samples into BV-positive, BV-negative, or transitional BV.ResultsThe qPCR test identified all 22 targeted species with 95 – 100% sensitivity and specificity within 8 hours (from sample reception). Across most samples, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Gardnerella vaginalis, Fannyhessea (Atopobium) vaginae, Prevotella bivia, and Megasphaera sp. type 1 were relatively abundant. BVAB-1 was more abundant and distributed than BVAB-2 and BVAB-3. No Mycoplasma genitalium was found. The inter-sample similarity was very low, and correlations existed between key species, which were used to model, train, and test a diagnostic index: MDL-BV index. The MDL-BV index, using both species and relative abundance markers, classified samples into three vaginal microbiome states. Testing this index on our samples, 491 were BV-positive, 318 were BV-negative, and 137 were transitional BV. Although important differences in BV status were observed between different age groups, races, and pregnancy status, they were statistically insignificant.ConclusionUsing a diverse and large number of vaginal samples from different races and age groups, including pregnant women, the new qRT-PCR test and MDL-BV index efficiently diagnosed BV within 8 hours (from sample reception), using 22 BV-associated species.

## Interpretation of the effects of rumen acidosis on the gut microbiota and serum metabolites in calves based on 16S rDNA sequencing and non-target metabolomics

date: 2024-06-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionRumen acidosis is one of the most common diseases in beef cattle. It severely affects the normal development of calves and poses a significant threat to the farming industry. However, the influence of rumen acidosis on the gut microbiota and serum metabolites of calves is currently unclear.ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to investigate the changes in the gut microbiota and serum metabolites in calves after rumen acidosis and analyse the correlation.MethodsEight calves were selected as the rumen acidosis group, and eight health calves were selected as the healthy group. The faecal gut microbiota and serum metabolites of calves were detected respectively using 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing and non-target metabolomics. The correlation between gut microbiota and serum metabolites was analyzed by Spearman correlation analysis.ResultsDifferential analysis of the diversity and composition of gut microbiota between eight male healthy (Health) and eight male rumen acidosis (Disease) calves revealed that rumen acidosis increased the abundance of the gut microbiota in calves. At the phylum level, compared to the Healthy group, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria in the Disease group significantly decreased (P<0.05), while the relative abundance of Desulfobacterota significantly increased in the Disease group (P<0.05). At the genus level, compared to the Disease group, the relative abundance of Alloprevotella, Muribaculaceae, Succinivibrio, Prevotella, Agathobacter and Parabacteroides significantly increased in the Healthy group (P<0.05), while the relative abundance of Christensenellaceae_R-7 and Monoglobus significantly decreased in the Healthy group (P<0.05). Differential analysis results showed the Healthy group had 23 genera with higher abundance, while the Disease group had 47 genera with higher abundance. Serum metabolomics results revealed the differential metabolites associated with rumen acidosis, including nicotinamide, niacin, L-glutamic acid and carnosine, were mainly enriched in the nicotinate and nicotinamide pathway and the histidine pathway.ConclusionThe occurrence of rumen acidosis can induce changes in the gut microbiota of calves, with a significant increase of the Christensenellaceae_R-7 genus and a significant decrease of Prevotella and Succinivibrio genera. In addition, the occurrence of rumen acidosis can also induce changes in serum metabolites including niacin, niacinamide, L-glutamine, and carnosine, which may serve as the diagnostic biomarkers of rumen acidosis of calves.

## Metabolomic changes in Cryptocaryon irritans from Larimichthys crocea after exposure to copper plate

date: 2024-06-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Cryptocaryon irritans is a highly detrimental parasite in mariculture, causing significant economic losses to the aquaculture industry of Larimichthys crocea. In recent years, copper and copper alloy materials have been used to kill parasites. In this study, the effect of copper plates on the tomont period of C. irritans was explored. The findings indicated that copper plates effectively eradicated tomonts, resulting in a hatching rate of 0. The metabolomic analysis revealed that a total of 2,663 differentially expressed metabolites (1,032 up-regulated and 1,631 down-regulated) were screened in the positive ion mode, and 2,199 differentially expressed metabolites (840 up-regulated and 1,359 down-regulated) were screened in the negative ion mode. L-arginine and L-aspartic acid could be used as potential biomarkers. Copper plate treatment affected 25 metabolic pathways in the tomont, most notably influencing histidine metabolism, retinol metabolism, the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, as well as arginine and proline metabolism. It was shown that high concentrations of copper ions caused a certain degree of disruption to the metabolome of tomonts in C. irritans, thereby impacting their metabolic processes. Consequently, this disturbance ultimately leads to the rapid demise of tomonts upon exposure to copper plates. The metabolomic changes observed in this study elucidate the lethal impact of copper on C. irritans tomonts, providing valuable reference data for the prevention and control of C. irritans in aquaculture.

## Exploring the role of endogenous retroviruses in seasonal reproductive cycles: a case study of the ERV-V envelope gene in mink

date: 2024-06-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionEndogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which originated from exogenous retroviral infections of germline cells millions of years ago and were inherited by subsequent generations as per Mendelian inheritance patterns, predominantly comprise non-protein-coding sequences due to the accumulation of mutations, insertions, deletions, and truncations. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed that ERVs play a crucial role in diverse biological processes by encoding various proteins.MethodsIn this study, we successfully identified an ERV envelope (env) gene in a mink species. A phylogenetic tree of mink ERV-V env and reference sequences was constructed using Bayesian methods and maximum-likelihood inference.ResultsPhylogenetic analyses indicated a significant degree of sequence conservation and positive selection within the env-surface open reading frame. Additionally, qRT-PCR revealed diverse patterns of mink ERV-V env expression in various tissues. The expression of mink ERV-V env gene in testicular tissue strongly correlated with the seasonal reproductive cycles of minks.DiscussionOur study suggests that the ERV-V env gene in mink may have been repurposed for host functions.

## Discovery and characterization of BRBV-sheep virus in nasal swabs from domestic sheep in China

date: 2024-06-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe escalating occurrence of infectious disease outbreaks in humans and animals necessitates innovative, effective, and integrated research to better comprehend their transmission and dynamics. Viral infection in livestock has led to profound economic losses globally. Pneumonia is the prevalent cause of death in sheep. However, very few studies exist regarding virus-related pathogens in sheep. Metagenomics sequencing technologies in livestock research hold significant potential to elucidate these contingencies and enhance our understanding.MethodsTherefore, this study aims to characterize respiratory viromes in paired nasal swabs from Inner Mongolian feedlot sheep in China using metaviromic sequencing. Through deep sequencing, de novo assembly, and similarity searches using translated protein sequences, several previously uncharacterized and known viruses were identified in this study.ResultsAmong these discoveries, a novel Bovine Rhinitis B Virus (BRBV) (BRBV-sheep) strain was serendipitously detected in the nasal swabs of domestic sheep (Ovis aries). To facilitate further molecular epidemiological studies, the entire genome of BRBV-sheep was also determined. Owing to the unique sequence characteristics and phylogenetic position of BRBV-sheep, genetically distinct lineages of BRBV in sheep may exist. A TaqMan-based qRT-PCR assay targeting the 3D polymerase gene was developed and used to screen 592 clinical sheep specimens. The results showed that 44.59% of the samples (264/592) were positive. These findings suggest that BRBV sheep are widespread among Inner Mongolian herds.ConclusionThis discovery marks the initial identification of BRBV in sheep within Inner Mongolia, China. These findings contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology and genetic evolution of BRBV. Recognizing the presence of BRBV in sheep informs strategies for disease management and surveillance and the potential development of targeted interventions to control its spread.

## Adaptation of SIVmac to baboon primary cells results in complete absence of in vivo baboon infectivity

date: 2024-06-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

While simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection is non-pathogenic in naturally infected African nonhuman primate hosts, experimental or accidental infection in rhesus macaques often leads to AIDS. Baboons, widely distributed throughout Africa, do not naturally harbor SIV, and experimental infection of baboons with SIVmac results in transient low-level viral replication. Elucidation of mechanisms of natural immunity in baboons could uncover new targets of antiviral intervention. We tested the hypothesis that an SIVmac adapted to replicate in baboon primary cells will gain the capacity to establish chronic infections in vivo. Here, we generated SIVmac variants in baboon cells through serial passage in PBMC from different donors (SIVbn-PBMC s1), in PBMC from the same donors (SIVbn-PBMC s2), or in isolated CD4 cells from the same donors used for series 2 (SIVbn-CD4). While SIVbn-PBMC s1 and SIVbn-CD4 demonstrated increased replication capacity, SIVbn-PBMC s2 did not. Pharmacological blockade of CCR5 revealed SIVbn-PBMC s1 could more efficiently use available CCR5 than SIVmac, a trait we hypothesize arose to circumvent receptor occupation by chemokines. Sequencing analysis showed that all three viruses accumulated different types of mutations, and that more non-synonymous mutations became fixed in SIVbn-PBMC s1 than SIVbn-PBMC s2 and SIVbn-CD4, supporting the notion of stronger fitness pressure in PBMC from different genetic backgrounds. Testing the individual contribution of several newly fixed SIV mutations suggested that is the additive effect of these mutations in SIVbn-PBMC s1 that contributed to its enhanced fitness, as recombinant single mutant viruses showed no difference in replication capacity over the parental SIVmac239 strain. The replicative capacity of SIVbn-PBMC passage 4 (P4) s1 was tested in vivo by infecting baboons intravenously with SIVbn-PBMC P4 s1 or SIVmac251. While animals infected with SIVmac251 showed the known pattern of transient low-level viremia, animals infected with SIVbn-PBMC P4 s1 had undetectable viremia or viral DNA in lymphoid tissue. These studies suggest that adaptation of SIV to grow in baboon primary cells results in mutations that confer increased replicative capacity in the artificial environment of cell culture but make the virus unable to avoid the restrictive factors generated by a complex multicellular organism.

## Distribution and spread of tigecycline resistance gene tet(X4) in Escherichia coli from different sources

date: 2024-06-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Tigecycline serves as a last-resort antimicrobial agent against severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Tet(X) and its numerous variants encoding flavin-dependent monooxygenase can confer resistance to tigecycline, with tet(X4) being the most prevalent variant. This study aims to investigate the prevalence and characterize tigecycline resistance gene tet(X) in E. coli isolates from various origins in Yangzhou, China, to provide insights into tet(X) dissemination in this region. In 2022, we tested the presence of tet(X) in 618 E. coli isolates collected from diverse sources, including patients, pig-related samples, chicken-related samples, and vegetables in Yangzhou, China. The antimicrobial susceptibility of tet(X)-positive E. coli isolates was conducted using the agar dilution method or the broth microdilution method. Whole genome sequencing was performed on tet(X)-positive strains using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms. Four isolates from pig or pork samples carried tet(X4) and exhibited resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents, including tigecycline. They were classified as ST542, ST10, ST761, and ST48, respectively. The tet(X4) gene was located on IncFIA8-IncHI1/ST17 (n=2), IncFIA18-IncFIB(K)-IncX1 (n=1), and IncX1 (n=1) plasmids, respectively. These tet(X4)-carrying plasmids exhibited high similarity to other tet(X4)-bearing plasmids with the same incompatible types found in diverse sources in China. They shared related genetic environments of tet(X4) associated with ISCR2, as observed in the first identified tet(X4)-bearing plasmid p47EC. In conclusion, although a low prevalence (0.65%) of tet(X) in E. coli strains was observed in this study, the horizontal transfer of tet(X4) among E. coli isolates mediated by pandemic plasmids and the mobile element ISCR2 raises great concerns. Thus, heightened surveillance and immediate action are imperative to curb this clinically significant resistance gene and preserve the efficacy of tigecycline.

## Impact of HIV-1 genetic diversity on disease progression: a prospective cohort study in Guangxi

date: 2024-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The high proportion of AIDS cases and mortality rates in Guangxi underscores the urgency to investigate the influence of HIV-1 genetic diversity on disease progression in this region. Newly diagnosed HIV-1 patients were enrolled from January 2016 to December 2021, and the follow-up work and detection of CD4+T lymphocytes were carried out every six months until December 2022. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the factors affecting pre-treatment CD4+T lymphocyte counts, while local weighted regression models (LOESS) and generalized estimating equation models (GEE) were conducted to assess factors influencing CD4+T Lymphocyte Recovery. Cox regression analysis was utilized to examine the impact of subtypes on survival risk. Additionally, HIV-1 env sequences were utilized for predicting CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors. The study encompassed 1867 individuals with pol sequences and 281 with env sequences. Our findings indicate that age over 30, divorced/widowed, peasant, heterosexual infection, CRF01_AE, long-term infection, and Pre-treatment Viral load >10000 copies/ml were factors associated with higher risk for pre-treatment CD4+T lymphocyte decline. Specifically, male gender, age over 30, heterosexual infection (HETs), long-term infection, CRF01_AE, and Pre-treatment CD4 T cell counts below 350/µL were identified as risk factors impeding CD4+T lymphocyte recovery. Pre-treatment CD4+T lymphocyte counts and recovery in individuals infected with CRF01_AE were lower compared to CRF07_BC and CRF55_01B. Additionally, CRF01_AE and CRF08_BC subtypes exhibited higher mortality rates than CRF07_BC, CRF55_01B, and other subtypes. Notably, CRF01_AE demonstrated the highest percentage of CXCR4 affinity ratios. This research unveils the intricate influence of HIV-1 gene diversity on CD4+T lymphocyte dynamics and clinical outcomes. It highlights the multifaceted nature of HIV infection in Guangxi, providing novel insights into subtype-specific disease progression among HIV-infected individuals in this region.

## A rapid and ultra-sensitive dual readout platform for Klebsiella pneumoniae detection based on RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a

date: 2024-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) was the primary pathogen of hospital-acquired infection, but the current detection method could not rapidly and conveniently identify Kp. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) was a fast and convenient isothermal amplification technology, and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system could rapidly amplify the signal of RPA and improve its limit of detection (LOD). In this study, we designed three pairs of RPA primers for the rcsA gene of Kp, amplified the RPA signal through single-strand DNA reporter cleavage by CRISPR/Cas12a, and finally analyzed the cleavage signal using fluorescence detection (FD) and lateral flow test strips (LFTS). Our results indicated that the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a platform could specifically identify Kp from eleven common clinical pathogens. The LOD of FD and LFTS were 1 fg/μL and 10 fg/μL, respectively. In clinical sample testing, the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a platform was consistent with the culture method and qPCR method, and its sensitivity and specificity were 100% (16/16) and 100% (9/9), respectively. With the advantages of detection speed, simplicity, and accuracy, the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a platform was expected to be a convenient tool for the early clinical detection of Kp.

## The relationship between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and constipation in children – a comprehensive review

date: 2024-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is characterized by an increase in the bacterial population of the small intestine due to an imbalance between the amount of bacteria and the intestinal barrier. Pediatric SIBO presents with a wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild gastrointestinal complaints to malabsorption or malnutrition. Breath tests are commonly used as noninvasive diagnostic tools for SIBO, but a standardized methodology is currently unavailable. Intestinal flora produces methane which slows intestinal transit and increases the contractile activity of small intestine. Emerging literature suggests a correlation between overgrowth of methanogenic bacteria in the intestines and constipation. Treatment of SIBO involves administration of antibacterial therapy in addition to management of underlying conditions and optimal dietary adjustments. However, research on antibiotic treatment for pediatric patients with constipation and SIBO is limited and has yielded conflicting results. In the current review, we summarize the state-of-the-art of the field and discuss previous treatment attempts and currently used regimens for SIBO patients with constipation, with a focus on pediatric populations.

## TurboID-mediated proximity labeling technologies to identify virus co-receptors

date: 2024-06-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Virus receptors determine the tissue tropism of viruses and have a certain relationship with the clinical outcomes caused by viral infection, which is of great importance for the identification of virus receptors to understand the infection mechanism of viruses and to develop entry inhibitor. Proximity labeling (PL) is a new technique for studying protein-protein interactions, but it has not yet been applied to the identification of virus receptors or co-receptors. Here, we attempt to identify co-receptor of SARS-CoV-2 by employing TurboID-catalyzed PL. The membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was employed as a bait and conjugated to TurboID, and a A549 cell line with stable expression of ACE2-TurboID was constructed. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus were incubated with ACE2-TurboID stably expressed cell lines in the presence of biotin and ATP, which could initiate the catalytic activity of TurboID and tag adjacent endogenous proteins with biotin. Subsequently, the biotinylated proteins were harvested and identified by mass spectrometry. We identified a membrane protein, AXL, that has been functionally shown to mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. Our data suggest that PL could be used to identify co-receptors for virus entry.

## Epidemiological, virological and clinical characterization of a Dengue/Zika outbreak in the Caribbean region of Costa Rica 2017–2018

date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The increase in incidence and geographical expansion of viruses transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes, such as dengue (DENV) and zika (ZIKV) in the Americas, represents a burden for healthcare systems in tropical and subtropical regions. These and other under-detected arboviruses co-circulate in Costa Rica, adding additional complexity to their management due to their shared epidemiological behavior and similarity of symptoms in early stages. Since diagnostics of febrile illness is mostly based on clinical symptoms alone, we gathered acute-phase serum and urine from 399 samples of acute dengue-like cases from two healthcare facilities of Costa Rica, during an outbreak of arboviruses from July 2017 to May 2018, and tested them using molecular and serological methods. The analyses showed that of the clinically presumptive arbovirus cases that were reported, only 39.4% (n=153) of the samples were confirmed positive by RT-PCR to be DENV (DENV (10.3%), CHIKV (0.2%), ZIKV (27.3%), or mixed infections (1.5%). RT-PCR for other alphaviruses and flaviviruses, and PCR for Leptospira sp were negative. Furthermore, to assess flavivirus positivity in post-acute patients, the negative sera were tested against Dengue-IgM. 20% of sera were found positive, confounding even more the definitive number of cases, and emphasizing the need of several distinct diagnostic tools for accurate diagnostics. Molecular characterization of the prM and E genes from isolated viruses revealed that the American/Asian genotype of DENV-2 and the Asian lineage of ZIKV were circulating during this outbreak. Two different clades of DENV-2 American/Asian genotype were identified to co-circulate in the same region and a difference in the platelet and leukocyte count was noted between people infected with each clade, suggesting a putative distinct virulence. Our study sheds light on the necessity for healthcare strategies in managing arbovirus outbreaks, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive molecular and serological diagnostic approaches, as well as molecular characterization. This approach aids in enhancing our understanding of the clinical and epidemiological aspects of arboviral diseases during outbreaks. Our research highlights the need to strengthen training programs for health professionals and the need to increase research-based on laboratory evidence for diagnostic accuracy, guidance, development and implementation of public health interventions and epidemiological surveillance.

## Recent advances in gene-editing approaches for tackling antibiotic resistance threats: a review

date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Antibiotic resistance, a known global health challenge, involves the flow of bacteria and their genes among animals, humans, and their surrounding environment. It occurs when bacteria evolve and become less responsive to the drugs designated to kill them, making infections harder to treat. Despite several obstacles preventing the spread of genes and bacteria, pathogens regularly acquire novel resistance factors from other species, which reduces their ability to prevent and treat such bacterial infections. This issue requires coordinated efforts in healthcare, research, and public awareness to address its impact on human health worldwide. This review outlines how recent advances in gene editing technology, especially CRISPR/Cas9, unveil a breakthrough in combating antibiotic resistance. Our focus will remain on the relationship between CRISPR/cas9 and its impact on antibiotic resistance and its related infections. Moreover, the prospects of this new advanced research and the challenges of adopting these technologies against infections will be outlined by exploring its different derivatives and discussing their advantages and limitations over others, thereby providing a corresponding reference for the control and prevention of the spread of antibiotic resistance.

## A novel web-based risk calculator for predicting surgical site infection in HIV-positive facture patients: a multicenter cohort study in China

date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSurgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication in HIV-positive fracture patients undergoing surgery, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Accurate prediction of SSI risk can help guide clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes. However, there is a lack of user-friendly, Web-based calculator for predicting SSI risk in this patient population.ObjectiveThis study aimed to develop and validate a novel web-based risk calculator for predicting SSI in HIV-positive fracture patients undergoing surgery in China.MethodA multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from HIV-positive fracture patients who underwent surgery in three tertiary hospitals in China between May 2011 and September 2023. We used patients from Beijing Ditan Hospital as the training cohort and patients from Chengdu Public Health and Changsha First Hospital as the external validation cohort. Univariate, multivariate logistic regression analyses and SVM-RFE were performed to identify independent risk factors for SSIs. A web-based calculator was developed using the identified risk factors and validated using an external validation cohort. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsA total of 338 HIV-positive patients were included in the study, with 216 patients in the training cohort and 122 patients in the validation cohort. The overall SSI incidence was 10.7%. The web-based risk calculator (https://sydtliubo.shinyapps.io/DynNom_for_SSI/) incorporated six risk factors: HBV/HCV co-infection, HIV RNA load, CD4+ T-cell count, Neu and Lym level. The nomogram demonstrated good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.890 in the training cohort and 0.853 in the validation cohort. The calibration plot showed good agreement between predicted and observed SSI probabilities. The DCA indicated that the nomogram had clinical utility across a wide range of threshold probabilities.ConclusionOur study developed and validated a novel web-based risk calculator for predicting SSI risk in HIV-positive fracture patients undergoing surgery in China. The nomogram demonstrated good discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility, and can serve as a valuable tool for risk stratification and clinical decision-making in this patient population. Future studies should focus on integrating this nomogram into hospital information systems for real-time risk assessment and management.

## Cutting-edge research frontiers in oral cavity vaccines for respiratory diseases: a roadmap for scientific advancement

date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Intramuscular vaccines present limitations in eliciting robust mucosal immunity and preventing respiratory pathogens transmission. Sublingual vaccine administration offers promising advantages, including interconnected mucosal protection. Despite these advantages, only a few clinical trials have explored sublingual vaccines, underscoring the necessity of optimizing next-generation vaccine formulas. Critical research priorities include understanding vector behavior in the oral environment, understanding their interactions with mucosal immunity and developing formulations enabling sustained mucosal contact to facilitate efficient transduction. Consequently, tonsil organoids, as representative human mucosal models, could offer critical insights into sublingual immunization. Thus, a multi-disciplinary approach integrating pharmacological, immunological, and manufacturing considerations is pivotal for sublingual vaccines in targeting pathogen-aggravated prevalent respiratory diseases including asthma, COPD and lung cancer, as well as the antimicrobial resistance crisis.

## The Trypanosoma cruzi pleiotropic protein P21 orchestrates the intracellular retention and in-vivo parasitism control of virulent Y strain parasites

date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

P21 is a protein secreted by all forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) with recognized biological activities determined in studies using the recombinant form of the protein. In our recent study, we found that the ablation of P21 gene decreased Y strain axenic epimastigotes multiplication and increased intracellular replication of amastigotes in HeLa cells infected with metacyclic trypomastigotes. In the present study, we investigated the effect of P21 in vitro using C2C12 cell lines infected with tissue culture-derived trypomastigotes (TCT) of wild-type and P21 knockout (TcP21−/−) Y strain, and in vivo using an experimental model of T. cruzi infection in BALB/c mice. Our in-vitro results showed a significant decrease in the host cell invasion rate by TcP21−/− parasites as measured by Giemsa staining and cell count in bright light microscope. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that TcP21−/− parasites multiplied intracellularly to a higher extent than the scrambled parasites at 72h post-infection. In addition, we observed a higher egress of TcP21−/− trypomastigotes from C2C12 cells at 144h and 168h post-infection. Mice infected with Y strain TcP21−/− trypomastigotes displayed higher systemic parasitemia, heart tissue parasite burden, and several histopathological alterations in heart tissues compared to control animals infected with scrambled parasites. Therewith, we propose that P21 is important in the host–pathogen interaction during invasion, cell multiplication, and egress, and may be part of the mechanism that controls parasitism and promotes chronic infection without patent systemic parasitemia.

## Encapsulation protocol for fecal microbiota transplantation

date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionClostridioides difficile infections (CDI) continue to pose a challenge for clinicians. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment option in CDI. Furthermore, recent and ongoing studies suggest potential benefits of FMT in other diseases as well.MethodsWe would like to present a novel protocol for encapsulation of lyophilized fecal material. Our method provides with better compliance as well as improved flexibility, storage and safety.ResultsFMT was conducted in 28 patients with an overall success rate of 82,14% using apsules containing lyophilized stool. 16 of patients were given capsules with lessened bacteria counts. The success rate in this group was 93,75%.DiscussionThe results highlight the still unanswered questions about the mechanism of action and contribute to a wider use of FMT in the clinical praxis and in research.

## Serum C-reactive protein to albumin ratio as a potential risk indicator of pneumonia caused by Chlamydia psittaci: a multicenter retrospective study

date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe aim of the study was to describe psittacosis pneumonia and to assess the predictive value of the C-reactive protein/albumin ratio in psittacosis pneumonia for severity.MethodsData on psittacosis pneumonia cases diagnosed using metagenomic sequencing were collected from three hospitals in Shanghai, China from Oct. 2019 to Oct. 2022. Serum levels of C-reactive protein and albumin were measured and the C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) was calculated. Spearman’s correlation analysis, ordered logistic regression analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were conducted to examine the correlation and predictive ability of the three indicators on the severity of the disease.ResultsA total of 27 patients with psittacosis pneumonia were enrolled, with an average age of 62 years and 70.4% being male. 44.4% of patients had a clear history of contact with poultry or birds. The predominant symptom was fever (100%). Patients treated in the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) had a higher likelihood of experiencing wheezing (88.9% versus 33.3%, P=0.013) and chest tightness (88.9% vs. 33.3%, P=0.013) than those in the general ward (Non-RICU). The proportion of patients with pleural effusion was significantly higher in the RICU compared to the Non-RICU (88.9% vs. 38.9%, P=0.019). The RICU group had a significantly higher CAR than the Non-RICU group (9.41 vs. 4.05, P=0.017). This result was accompanied by higher intubation and ventilator support (33.3% vs. 0.0%, P=0.029), higher PCT and CRP levels and lower albumin and PaCO2 levels in the RICU than in the Non-RICU. Logistic regression analysis indicated that CAR (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.07–2.06, P=0.017) was risk factor for prolonged hospitalization (> 14 days).DiscussionElevated serum CAR levels were found to be associated with a greater risk of severe psittacosis pneumonia. Consequently, it may serve as an uncomplicated and useful diagnostic tool for clinicians to promptly and precisely ascertain the severity of psittacosis pneumonia, ultimately aiding them in devising the most optimal therapeutic plan.

## Pinnipeds and avian influenza: a global timeline and review of research on the impact of highly pathogenic avian influenza on pinniped populations with particular reference to the endangered Caspian seal (Pusa caspica)

date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

This study reviews chronologically the international scientific and health management literature and resources relating to impacts of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses on pinnipeds in order to reinforce strategies for the conservation of the endangered Caspian seal (Pusa caspica), currently under threat from the HPAI H5N1 subtype transmitted from infected avifauna which share its haul-out habitats. Many cases of mass pinniped deaths globally have occurred from HPAI spill-overs, and are attributed to infected sympatric aquatic avifauna. As the seasonal migrations of Caspian seals provide occasions for contact with viruses from infected migratory aquatic birds in many locations around the Caspian Sea, this poses a great challenge to seal conservation. These are thus critical locations for the surveillance of highly pathogenic influenza A viruses, whose future reassortments may present a pandemic threat to humans.

## Research progress on the mechanism of exosome-mediated virus infection

date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Exosomes are extracelluar vesicles that facilitate intercellular communication and are pivotal in post-transcriptional regulation within cellular gene regulatory networks, impacting pathogen dynamics. These vesicles serve as crucial regulators of immune responses, mediating cellular interactions and enabling the introduction of viral pathogenic regions into host cells. Exosomes released from virus-infected cells harbor diverse microRNAs (miRNAs), which can be transferred to recipient cells, thereby modulating virus infection. This transfer is a critical element in the molecular interplay mediated by exosomes. Additionally, the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) within exosomes plays a vital role in virus infection, with ESCRT components binding to viral proteins to facilitate virus budding. This review elucidates the roles of exosomes and their constituents in the invasion of host cells by viruses, aiming to shed new light on the regulation of viral transmission via exosomes.

## Assessment of performance and comparison of three commercial HDV RNA detection assays: implications for diagnosis and treatment monitoring

date: 2024-06-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesPrecise HDV-RNA detection and quantification are pivotal for diagnosis and monitoring of response to newly approved treatment. We evaluate the performance of three HDV RNA detection and quantification assays.MethodsHepatitis Delta RT-PCR system kit, EurobioPlex HDV assay, and RoboGene HDV RNA Quantification kit 2.0 were used for testing 151 HBsAg-positive samples, 90 HDV-RNA negative and 61 HDV-RNA positive. We also evaluated serial dilutions of the WHO international standard for HDV, PEI 7657/12. All HDV-RNA positive samples were genotyped using a next-generation sequencing strategy.ResultsQualitative results indicated a 100% concordance between tests. Quantitative results correlated well, r2 = 0.703 (Vircell-vs-Eurobio), r2 = 0.833 (Vircell-vs-RoboGene), r2 = 0.835 (Robogene-vs-Eurobio). Bias index was 2.083 (Vircell-vs-Eurobio), -1.283 (Vircell-vs-RoboGene), and -3.36 (Robogene-vs-Eurobio). Using the WHO IS, Vircell overestimated the viral load by 0.98 log IU/mL, Eurobio by 1.46 log IU/mL, and RoboGene underestimated it by 0.98 log IU/mL. Fifty-nine samples were successfully genotyped (Genotype 1, n=52; Genotype 5, n=7; Genotype 6, n=1), with similar results for correlation and bias.ConclusionThis study underscores the necessity of using reliable HDV-RNA detection and quantification assays, as evidenced by the high concordance rates in qualitative detection and the observed variability in quantitative results. These findings highlight the importance of consistent assay use in clinical practice to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment monitoring of HDV infection.

## Miconazole induces aneuploidy-mediated tolerance in Candida albicans that is dependent on Hsp90 and calcineurin

date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Antifungal resistance and antifungal tolerance are two distinct terms that describe different cellular responses to drugs. Antifungal resistance describes the ability of a fungus to grow above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a drug. Antifungal tolerance describes the ability of drug susceptible strains to grow slowly at inhibitory drug concentrations. Recent studies indicate antifungal resistance and tolerance have distinct evolutionary trajectories. Superficial candidiasis bothers millions of people yearly. Miconazole has been used for topical treatment of yeast infections for over 40 years. Yet, fungal resistance to miconazole remains relatively low. Here we found different clinical isolates of Candida albicans had different profile of tolerance to miconazole, and the tolerance was modulated by physiological factors including temperature and medium composition. Exposure of non-tolerant strains with different genetic backgrounds to miconazole mainly induced development of tolerance, not resistance, and the tolerance was mainly due to whole chromosomal or segmental amplification of chromosome R. The efflux gene CDR1 was required for maintenance of tolerance in wild type strains but not required for gain of aneuploidy-mediated tolerance. Heat shock protein Hsp90 and calcineurin were essential for maintenance as well as gain of tolerance. Our study indicates development of aneuploidy-mediated tolerance, not resistance, is the predominant mechanism of rapid adaptation to miconazole in C. albicans, and the clinical relevance of tolerance deserves further investigations.

## Implications of silver nanoparticles for H. pylori infection: modulation of CagA function and signaling

date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundHelicobacter pylori infection poses a significant health burden worldwide, and its virulence factor CagA plays a pivotal role in its pathogenesis.MethodsIn this study, the interaction between H. pylori-infected AGS cells and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was investigated, with a focus on the modulation of CagA-mediated responses, investigated by western blotting. Both, the dose-dependent efficacy against H. pylori (growth curves, CFU assay) and the impact of the nanoparticles on AGS cells (MTT assay) were elucidated.ResultsAGS cells infected with H. pylori displayed dramatic morphological changes, characterized by elongation and a migratory phenotype, attributed to CagA activity. Preincubation of H. pylori with AgNPs affected these morphological changes in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting a correlation between AgNPs concentration and CagA function.ConclusionOur study highlights the nuanced interplay between host-pathogen interactions and the therapeutic potential of AgNPs in combating H. pylori infection and offers valuable insights into the multifaceted dynamics of CagA mediated responses.

## Comparative analysis of intestinal microbiota composition between free-ranged captive yak populations in Nimu County

date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The intestinal microbiota assumes a pivotal role in modulating host metabolism, immune responses, overall health, and additional physiological dimensions. The structural and functional characteristics of the intestinal microbiota may cause alterations within the host’s body to a certain extent. The composition of the gut microbiota is associated with environmental factors, dietary habits, and other pertinent conditions. The investigation into the gut microbiota of yaks remained relatively underexplored. An examination of yak gut microbiota holds promise in elucidating the complex relationship between microbial communities and the adaptive responses of the host to its environment. In this study, yak were selected from two distinct environmental conditions: those raised in sheds (NS, n=6) and grazed in Nimu County (NF, n=6). Fecal samples were collected from the yaks and subsequently processed for analysis through 16S rDNA and ITS sequencing methodologies. The results revealed that different feeding styles result in significant differences in the Alpha diversity of fungi in the gut of yaks, while the gut microbiota of captive yaks was relatively conserved. In addition, significant differences appeared in the abundance of microorganisms in different taxa, phylum Verrucomicrobiota was significantly enriched in group NF while Firmicutes was higher in group NS. At the genus level, Akkermansia, Paenibacillus, Roseburia, Dorea, UCG_012, Anaerovorax and Marvinbryantia were enriched in group NF while Desemzia, Olsenella, Kocuria, Ornithinimicrobium and Parvibacter were higher in group NS (P<0.05 or P<0.01). There was a significant difference in the function of gut microbiota between the two groups. The observed variations are likely influenced by differences in feeding methods and environmental conditions both inside and outside the pen. The findings of this investigation offer prospective insights into enhancing the yak breeding and expansion of the yak industry.

## Reconstitution of human microglia and resident T cells in the brain of humanized DRAGA mice

date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Humanized mouse models are valuable tools for investigating the human immune system in response to infection and injury. We have previously described the human immune system (HIS)-DRAGA mice (HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2RgKO.NOD) generated by infusion of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched, human hematopoietic stem cells from umbilical cord blood. By reconstituting human cells, the HIS-DRAGA mouse model has been utilized as a “surrogate in vivo human model” for infectious diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Influenza, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), scrub typhus, and malaria. This humanized mouse model bypasses ethical concerns about the use of fetal tissues for the humanization of laboratory animals. Here in, we demonstrate the presence of human microglia and T cells in the brain of HIS-DRAGA mice. Microglia are brain-resident macrophages that play pivotal roles against pathogens and cerebral damage, whereas the brain-resident T cells provide surveillance and defense against infections. Our findings suggest that the HIS-DRAGA mouse model offers unique advantages for studying the functions of human microglia and T cells in the brain during infections, degenerative disorders, tumors, and trauma, as well as for testing therapeutics in these pathological conditions.

## Development and validation of a prediction model for mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients

date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundEarly prediction of prognosis may help early treatment measures to reduce mortality in critically ill coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. The study aimed to develop a mortality prediction model for critically ill COVID-19 patients.MethodsThis retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of critically ill COVID-19 patients in an intensive care unit between April and June 2022. Propensity matching scores were used to reduce the effect of confounding factors. A predictive model was built using logistic regression analysis and visualized using a nomogram. Calibration and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to estimate the accuracy and predictive value of the model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to examine the value of the model for clinical interventions.ResultsIn total, 137 critically ill COVID-19 patients were enrolled; 84 survived, and 53 died. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, and myoglobin levels were independent prognostic factors. We constructed logistic regression prediction models using the seven least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression-selected variables (hematocrit, red blood cell distribution width-standard deviation, procalcitonin, AST, creatinine, potassium, and myoglobin; Model 1) and three independent factor variables (Model 2). The calibration curves suggested that the actual predictions of the two models were similar to the ideal predictions. The ROC curve indicated that both models had good predictive power, and Model 1 had better predictive power than Model 2. The DCA results suggested that the model intervention was beneficial to patients and patients benefited more from Model 1 than from Model 2.ConclusionThe predictive model constructed using characteristic variables screened using LASSO regression can accurately predict the prognosis of critically ill COVID-19 patients. This model can assist clinicians in implementing early interventions. External validation by prospective large-sample studies is required.

## Clinical characteristics, viral dynamics, and antibody response of monkeypox virus infections among men with and without HIV infection in Guangzhou, China

date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMonkeypox virus (MPXV) is spreading globally and nearly half of the infected people were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the effects of HIV infection on the outcomes of MPXV infection is urgently needed. This study aimed to explore the clinical features, viral dynamics, and antibody response to MPXV infections in men who had sex with men (MSM) with and without HIV co-infection.Design or methodsMPXV-infected patients diagnosed by PCR were recruited in this study and were divided into MPXV and MPXV + HIV groups based on whether they were co-infected with HIV. Clinical data and samples were collected during of the hospital stay and follow up interviews. The symptoms and signs, laboratory examinations, viral shedding in various body fluids or swabs, antibody dynamics were tracked and compared between the two groups.ResultsA total of 41 MPXV patients were recruited through June 2023 to September 2023 in Guangzhou. The MPXV group and MPXV + HIV group comprised 20 and 21 MSM, respectively. Patients in the two groups exhibited similar clinical characteristics except for pruritus and eschar, both were significantly fewer in MPXV + HIV group than in MPXV only group. Among the 355 clinical samples collected, MPXV DNA was detected in 100% of scabs, 97.4% of skin swabs, and 92.3% of exudate swabs from lesions, while the positive rate was 87.5% from oropharyngeal swabs, 59% from saliva, 51.3% from anal swabs, 50% from feces, 30.6% from urine samples, 37.5% of semen, and 28.2% from sera. Dynamics analysis revealed that viral DNA was undetectable in most patients 20 days after symptom onset. IgM and IgG antibodies to MPXV were detected in all patients with 3–5 days earlier in the MPXV group than in the MPXV + HIV group.ConclusionThis cohort analysis based on a large outbreak among MSM in Guangzhou indicated no obvious differences in clinical symptoms, viral DNA data, but antibody responses were 3–5 days later in mpox patients with HIV infection.

## Phylogenetic and mutational analysis of H10N3 avian influenza A virus in China: potential threats to human health

date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

In recent years, the avian influenza virus has emerged as a significant threat to both human and public health. This study focuses on a patient infected with the H10N3 subtype of avian influenza virus, admitted to the Third People’s Hospital of Kunming City on March 6, 2024. Metagenomic RNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis were conducted on the patient’s sputum, confirming the H10N3 infection. The patient presented severe pneumonia symptoms such as fever, expectoration, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough. Phylogenetic analysis of the Haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the virus showed that the virus was most closely related to a case of human infection with the H10N3 subtype of avian influenza virus found in Zhejiang Province, China. Analysis of amino acid mutation sites identified four mutations potentially hazardous to human health. Consequently, this underscores the importance of continuous and vigilant monitoring of the dynamics surrounding the H10N3 subtype of avian influenza virus, utilizing advanced genomic surveillance techniques.

## The osmoregulated metabolism of trehalose contributes to production of type 1 fimbriae and bladder colonization by extraintestinal Escherichia coli strain BEN2908

date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

In Escherichia coli, the disaccharide trehalose can be metabolized as a carbon source or be accumulated as an osmoprotectant under osmotic stress. In hypertonic environments, E. coli accumulates trehalose in the cell by synthesis from glucose mediated by the cytosolic enzymes OtsA and OtsB. Trehalose in the periplasm can be hydrolyzed into glucose by the periplasmic trehalase TreA. We have previously shown that a treA mutant of extraintestinal E. coli strain BEN2908 displayed increased resistance to osmotic stress by 0.6 M urea, and reduced production of type 1 fimbriae, reduced invasion of avian fibroblasts, and decreased bladder colonization in a murine model of urinary tract infection. Since loss of TreA likely results in higher periplasmic trehalose concentrations, we wondered if deletion of otsA and otsB genes, which would lead to decreased internal trehalose concentrations, would reduce resistance to stress by 0.6 M urea and promote type 1 fimbriae production. The BEN2908ΔotsBA mutant was sensitive to osmotic stress by urea, but displayed an even more pronounced reduction in production of type 1 fimbriae, with the consequent reduction in adhesion/invasion of avian fibroblasts and reduced bladder colonization in the murine urinary tract. The BEN2908ΔtreAotsBA mutant also showed a reduction in production of type 1 fimbriae, but in contrast to the ΔotsBA mutant, resisted better than the wild type in the presence of urea. We hypothesize that, in BEN2908, resistance to stress by urea would depend on the levels of periplasmic trehalose, but type 1 fimbriae production would be influenced by the levels of cytosolic trehalose.
