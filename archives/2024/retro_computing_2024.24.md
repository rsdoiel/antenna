## Haskell for the Impatient: Algebraic effects

date: 2024-06-14, from: James Hobson blog

This is the second post in the Haskell for the Impatient series. The required knowledge is:
Monads Haskell data types GADTs I&rsquo;m going to try a different writing style this time. A kind of Q&amp;A between you and me. Hopefully it&rsquo;s a bit less dry.
Why am I here? You are here to learn about algebraic effects!
So why am I handcuffed to a radiator? In my short experiance as a haskell educator, this seems to have been a necessary pre-requisite to learning about algebraic effects.

## Haskell for the Impatient: F-Algebras

date: 2024-06-14, from: James Hobson blog

F-Algebras This is the first blog post in the Haskell for the Impatient series. The required knowledge is:
Haskell Data Types Folds Functors (It&rsquo;s what the F stands for!) Motivations When I talk about folds, I am not referring to Foldable, I am referring to natural folds. This is when you take a data structure, e.g. a list, and you replace the constructors of that list with something else. An example of a natural fold is foldr.

## Haskell for the Impatient

date: 2024-06-13, from: James Hobson blog

Haskell for the Impatient Learning haskell is a strange journey. You will probably start with some textbook, such as &lsquo;Learn you a Haskell&rsquo;, which will take you from no knowledge, right up to enough to write programs&hellip; badly; you obviously should learn more. Real World Haskell gets you a bit further (although it&rsquo;s quite outdated) but stops pretty soon as well. At this point there is no obvious path of where to go next.
