## Fluted Cabinets Are In Style – Here’s How You Can Do It Yourself

date: 2024-09-26, from: Family Handyman Blog

<p>When we built our kitchen, we were on a very limited budget. But one aspect I was adamant about was not having those cookie-cutter cabinets found at every big box store. The problem was, those are the most affordable and easiest to find. So, one option we considered was to buy them anyway, then turn them into fluted cabinets — and that's an idea that happens to be trending with a lot of others now, too.</p>
<p>"Fluted cabinetry is popular lately because it's a great way to add style and pizzazz to your kitchen," says Josh Rudin, owner of <a href="https://www.asaprestoration247.com/service-areas/water-damage-restoration-mesa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASAP Restoration</a>. "One of the speculations as to why is because their design is more intricate and, therefore, a bit more expensive upfront. This can make them a display option to one-up neighbors and friends, but many people also choose this design for its unique look."</p>
<p>But you don't have to spend a fortune to get that characteristic look. Chances are, many of the cabinets around your home are pretty easy to DIY into something more interesting and textured, like fluting. Here's how.</p>
<h2>What Are Fluted Cabinets?</h2>
<p>Fluted cabinets have smooth, rounded grooves on the cabinet faces. They tend to run vertically and are usually pressed or routed in. They can also be made by adding half-round on top of an existing cabinet door.</p>
<p>People often choose fluted cabinets because of their soft, wave-like Mid-Century Modern look, which is also reminiscent of Greek or Roman architecture.</p>
<p>"They are becoming more popular because people are putting more value into personalizing their homes and steering away from more conventional-looking spaces," says Drew Mansur, director of <a href="https://tilecloud.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TileCloud</a>. "These cabinets will add an artisanal touch to the room while still maintaining a sense of modernity."</p>
<h2>How to DIY Fluted Cabinets</h2>
<p>There are several ways to go about making fluted cabinets. "If you have some DIY experience, this job won't be too hard," says Mansur. " The important part is to make sure you don't rush, and to give yourself time to get the best results."</p>
