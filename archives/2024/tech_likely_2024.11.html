so funny, the editor of Wordle on a
<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/1000-wordles-later/">podcast</a> on
Friday, 1000th puzzle day, said there are some puzzles that you might
not solve in six moves not because of skill rather because of luck. I
was pretty sure when I took my second guess, but that’s just when the
cursing started. By the third guess I thought she’s screwing with us! I
should not have listened to the podcast.</p>

A month ago, Lana Novikova
<a href="https://twitter.com/_Unsolved_/status/1758039399684542664">asked
me</a> to imagine the future of software documentation. What will
software technical writing look like in, say, 2049, when our profession
will be a century old? Will we be writing markup in git repositories or
use ÜberDITA in space? Will our job still exist? I’ve put my futurist
hat on to picture the shape of our profession 25 years from now. Buckle
up!

<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>People in the United Kingdom who use RISC OS have plenty of
opportunities to meet up with fellow users, with a number of user groups
holding meetings on a regular basis, and a small number of main events –
the shows, such as Wakefield and London. But what of our European
friends? It’s possible for them to join some of the user group meetings
when they’re held online and at a suitable time, as many are, but while
doing so is an opportunity not to be missed where possible it’s…</p>

Ladybird with tools from Google Project Zero</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>While Ladybird does an okay job with well-formed web content, I
thought it would be useful to throw some security research tools at it
and see what kind of issues it might reveal. So today we’ll be using
“Domato”, a DOM fuzzer from Google Project Zero, to stress test Ladybird
and fix some issues found along the way. The way this works is that
Domato generates randomized web pages with lots of mostly-valid but
strange HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I then load these pages into a debug
build of Ladybird and observe what happens. ↫ Andreas Kling I have high
hopes for Ladybird.</p>

<p>What will happen to your computer gear when you’re no longer with us?
Rather than a guest speaker, the next RISC OS User Group of London
(ROUGOL) meeting – which will take place on 18th March (tomorrow) – will
take the form of an open discussion, with Bernard Boase chairing the
meeting. Inspired by a discussion on the Stardot forum entitled‘What

<h2 id="wal-g-3.0.0-released">WAL-G 3.0.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
WAL-G team is happy to announce the release of WAL-G 3.0.0
</p>
<p>
WAL-G is a tool for archival database restoration for PostgreSQL,
GreenplumDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, etcd and several other databases.
</p>
<h2>
Noteworthy Changes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Every database engine can now benefit from failover storage. This
technique can save the day if one of the storage systems goes down.
However, do not forget to monitor them anyway.
</li>
<li>
For Postgres, we have a WAL archiving daemon available. Its primary
purpose is to improve the efficiency of parallel archiving.
</li>
<li>
Additionally, WAL-G supports the partial restoration of a cluster. If
you have large, unnecessary tables, you can exclude them from the
restoration process, the Postgres will skip over the WAL records for
these tables. See
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/PostgreSQL.md#partial-restore-experimental">docs</a>
for details.
</li>
<li>
Greenplum’s PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) is undergoing its maturation
process. Partial restore is supported in a similar way to Postgres. We
now have tools to verify the integrity of AOfiles in storage without
actually restoring backups.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
WAL-G v3.0.0 is available for download on our
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases">GitHub releases
page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Have a nice day!
