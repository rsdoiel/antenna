Mesoscale Discussion 1650
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0933 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Western/central NY into northern PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161433Z - 161630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe-thunderstorm threat will increase through the
morning, with a threat of damaging winds, isolated hail, and
possibly a tornado. Watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...A well-defined MCV is moving across parts of southern
Ontario this morning, with storms already increasing in coverage and
intensity in the vicinity of Lake Ontario. Diurnal
heating/destabilization downstream of the MCV will support more
widespread thunderstorm development across western NY and perhaps
northern PA later this morning. Rather substantial enhancement to
low/midlevel flow related to the MCV (which is already noted on KPBZ
and KBUF VWPs) will support organized convection, in the presence of
MLCAPE increasing into the 1000-2000 J/kg range. 

While eventual clustering and potential MCS development is expected,
a couple of supercells will also be possible, both with initial
development, and also embedded in any upscale growth that occurs
later in convective evolution. Scattered damaging wind and localized
gusts of 60-70 mph will be possible by late morning into the
afternoon, along with some potential for isolated hail and a tornado
or two with any persistent supercells. Watch issuance is likely by
late morning in order to address these threats.

Mesoscale Discussion 1649
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0845 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Extreme northeast KS into parts of MO and southwest
IL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 545...

Valid 161345Z - 161515Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 545
continues.

SUMMARY...Some threat for damaging/severe gusts may continue through
the morning. Additional watch issuance is possible.

DISCUSSION...One thunderstorm cluster with a history of producing
severe gusts is currently near Kansas City, with another potentially
severe storm cluster over north-central MO. Other less-organized
convection is ongoing from southeast MO into southwest IL. Evolution
of the ongoing convection through the morning remains uncertain,
with a pocket of diurnal heating potential in advance of the
north-central MO cluster, and some heating/destabilization also
expected south of the storms across southeast MO/southwest IL. 

MUCAPE in excess of 1500 J/kg and marginally supportive deep-layer
shear could continue to support some organized severe-wind potential
through the morning, especially in advance of the north-central MO
cluster. Downstream watch issuance into parts of eastern MO is
possible, depending on short-term convective trends. Some severe
threat could also eventually evolve out of the southeast
MO/southwest IL convection.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0757 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
CENTRAL/NORTHERN NEW YORK AND SOUTHERN VERMONT...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ELSEWHERE OVER
MUCH OF THE NORTHEAST...AS WELL AS PARTS OF:  CENTRAL
PLAINS...SOUTH-CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...OZARKS...AND LOWER
MISSOURI/OHIO VALLEY REGIONS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible from the central Plains
to the Northeast.  Greatest severe-thunderstorm threats within that
are over parts of the central Plains and upper Ohio Valley to parts
of the northern Mid-Atlantic and western New England.

...Synopsis...
The mid/upper-level pattern will feature an amplifying large-scale
ridge over much of western North America, though the anchoring high
over the Four Corners is expected to weaken somewhat in terms of
absolute height value.  Downstream, a belt of mostly cyclonic flow
will extend from the northern Plains and Upper Midwest across the
Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and Northeast.  A synoptic-scale trough --
accompanying a cyclone now over northwestern ON -- is forecast to
move southeastward, reaching north-central ON north of Lake Superior
and northern MN by 00Z.  By 12Z tomorrow, the trough (with
intermittently closed 500-mb low) should extend from James Bay
across Upper MI to southeastern MN/northwestern IA.

Farther downstream, an MCV was apparent in composited radar imagery,
moving into southwestern ON from southeastern Lower MI.  This
feature, and the accompanying shortwave trough/vorticity lobe, are
expected to progress to the western NY/western Lake Ontario region
by 18Z, then east-northeastward over northern NY and northern New
England through the rest of the period.  Another MCV appears over
west-central KS from an ongoing cluster of convection and precip
extending over the lower Missouri Valley region, though its
intensity and track still are rather uncertain.

At the surface, the 11Z chart showed a cold front from near the neck
of ON southwestward across southern WI to northeastern KS, parts of
the OK Panhandle, and northeastern NM.  The front was diffused in
several places by outflow from recent or ongoing convective
processes.  By 00Z, the front should reach southwestern QC,
northwestern OH, southern IL, southern MO, and northern OK, becoming
quasistationary over the northern TX Panhandle and northeastern NM. 
The front should move into the St. Lawrence Valley and Lower Great
Lakes by 12Z.  Aided by convective outflow, the western part of the
front should continue southward across much of OK and parts of
northwest TX tonight, while decelerating in most other areas.

...Northeast...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop as soon as the late
morning hours into midday across western NY, while earlier activity
over southern ON also moves toward the same region.  Convection
should move generally eastward across the outlook area through the
afternoon, evolving upscale into a forward-propagating complex aided
by strengthening of the midlevel winds ahead of the MCV.  The main
threat will be a swath of damaging, at least sporadically severe
gusts.  A more conditional risk exists southward into the northern
VA/Chesapeake Bay/northern Delmarva region, where coverage may be
more isolated to widely scattered, but also with damaging wind
common in any sustained thunderstorms.

The mesoalpha-scale environment will be characterized by stronger
deep-layer forcing and mass response (to the approaching MCV) in
northern areas, and greater low-level theta-e and diurnal-heating-
driven destabilization to the south.  Lower-elevation surface
dewpoints should range from the mid 60s F in the north to low/mid
70s in the southeastern areas, with peak/preconvective MLCAPE
increasing to the 1000-1500 J/kg range -- locally near 2000 J/kg in
southeastern areas.  Well-mixed subcloud layers will help to promote
continued downward momentum transfer from the region of enhanced
midlevel flow.  Given enough cold-pool aggregation/organization, a
rear-inflow jet may develop to aid further in organizing the
complex.  Meanwhile, to the south, the wind threat should be more
spotty, with a mix of discrete and clustered multicell convection
involved.

...Central/Southern Plains...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop this
afternoon mainly north of the synoptic front -- and potentially in
two main areas:
1.  Central/northern NE near a surface trough, with residual
moisture and diurnal heating providing favorable instability amidst
northwest flow and favorable deep shear.  Weak large-scale scent,
preceding a subtle northwest-flow shortwave trough, should help to
maintain favorably steep lapse rates and minimal inhibition for
afternoon convective initiation.  Although low-level winds should
remain weak, deep shear will be strong enough to support a blend of
multicell and supercell modes, with severe gusts and hail each
possible, before activity weakens late this evening.
2.  An initial upslope-flow regime over southeastern CO, spreading
into parts of western southwestern KS and the OK/TX Panhandles with
time this evening.  The associated easterly component of near-
surface winds will enable favorable storm-relative winds in the
inflow layer, convergence along convectively generated boundaries,
and moist advection into the region.  A hot, deeply mixed subcloud
layer should foster severe-gust potential as activity moves/builds
eastward to near the KS/OK border through this evening.

...Lower Missouri/Ohio Valleys...
Ongoing clusters of strong-severe thunderstorms will continue to
pose a threat for damaging gusts and occasional large hail as they
move eastward across parts of northeastern KS and northern MO this
morning.  See SPC Severe Thunderstorm Watches 544 and 545, and
related mesoscale discussions, for near-term details.  Some of this
regime may extend into northern parts of the modifying outflow air
this afternoon as part of the next process discussed below.

Farther south and east, the threat has increased for scattered to
numerous thunderstorms to form this afternoon, offering a relatively
dense concentration of potential for severe gusts and occasional
large hail.  Activity should be focused along and near a combination
of an outflow boundary from previous MCS activity (stalling, then
retreating northward over the lower Ohio Valley to eastern MO) and
the frontal zone (northern Ozarks region).  By mid/late afternoon,
strong heating and rich low-level moisture (surface dewpoints
commonly in the low-mid 70s F) will combine to minimize MLCINH, in
and near the eastern part of a field of relatively steep midlevel
lapse rates covering much of the Great Plains.  MLCAPE from 2500-
3500 J/kg should be common.  Even with such high dewpoints, heating
will be strong enough to foster well-mixed subcloud layers in
support of severe-gust potential.  Also favoring the wind threat
will be potential for aggregation of smaller-scale clusters into
cold pools with forward propagation and forced ascent.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CDT Mon Jul 15 2024

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
Dry thunderstorms will continue to pose a fire weather concern
across parts of the Great Basin and Pacific Northwest on Tuesday.
The gradual breakdown of the Four Corners ridge will not only
continue to promote thunderstorm chances, but will also mute surface
pressure-gradient winds across the region. A gradual moistening
trend noted in recent upper-air and satellite observations is
forecast to continue into Tuesday across the Great Basin and central
Rockies with PWAT values above 0.75 inch becoming more common.
Recent forecast soundings and ensemble QPF solutions suggest that
moistening will be greatest from AZ/NM into CO, WY, and perhaps
parts of ID. Areas west of this axis will continue to see PWAT
values around or below 0.75 inch and the potential for dry
thunderstorms. In the absence of wetting rainfall over the next 24
hours, fuels across this region should remain receptive as
thunderstorms initiate Tuesday afternoon. In addition to the
potential for new fire starts from dry lightning, outflow winds from
decaying thunderstorms will continue to pose a localized fire
weather concern for ongoing fires across the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 1615
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0315 PM CDT Sun Jul 14 2024

Areas affected...Parts of IA...northern IL...southern WI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 142015Z - 142145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe storm development is expected later this
afternoon into the evening. Eventual watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...Rather strong heating/destabilization is underway
across much of IA this afternoon, while recovery in the wake of
morning convection/outflow is ongoing across northern IL. Meanwhile,
the remnant MCV from last night's severe MCS over the Dakotas is
currently moving across northern IA. As MLCINH continues to erode
across northern/eastern IA and MLCAPE increases above 3000 J/kg, the
MCV may aid in scattered thunderstorm development later this
afternoon. Midlevel flow is not particularly strong across the
region, but sufficient to support effective shear of 25-35 kt and
potential for some storm organization. 

Initial discrete development could evolve into a supercell or two,
with a threat of hail, locally damaging wind, and possibly a
tornado. In conjunction with the MCV, a persistent 20-30 kt
southwesterly low-level jet could encourage relatively quick
clustering and upscale growth, with some potential for an MCS to
develop and move eastward across northern IL and southern WI this
evening, with a continued severe-wind threat.  

Farther northwest, in the wake of the MCV, cumulus is deepening
along a weak surface boundary across northwest IA. While this area
is in the immediate wake of the MCV, strong buoyancy and sufficient
deep-layer shear would support severe-thunderstorm potential in this
area as well, if storms can mature. 

While favored timing and area remain somewhat uncertain, watch
issuance will become increasingly likely if storm initiation appears
imminent across the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 1614
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0206 PM CDT Sun Jul 14 2024

Areas affected...Southern IN into western OH

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 532...

Valid 141906Z - 142030Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 532
continues.

SUMMARY...A threat for at least isolated damaging wind is expected
to continue through late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A loosely organized MCS continues to move
east-southeastward across parts of southern IN into western OH this
afternoon. Recent measured gusts have generally been in the 30-45 kt
range, though some wind damage was reported earlier across northern
IN. Generally weak low/midlevel flow may continue to limit
organization potential through the afternoon. However, the
downstream thermodynamic environment remains favorable for
damaging-wind potential, with MLCAPE in excess of 1500 J/kg and
steepening low-level lapse rates, and some threat for at least
isolated damaging wind is expected to continue through late
afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Sun Jul 14 2024

Valid 142000Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
NORTHERN PLAINS AND THE MIDWEST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are still expected from the northern
Plains into the Upper Midwest and Ohio Valley this afternoon through
tonight.

...20Z Update...
The primary changes made to this outlook were to adjust severe
probabilities in the northern Plains to account for both the latest
guidance consensus, and reflect recent trends in observations and
re-analysis. Visible satellite and surface observations indicate a
northwest-to-southeast oriented baroclinic boundary draped over
extreme northeast MT/northwestern ND, down to central and eastern
SD, extending to the MN border. Though MLCINH remains over the warm
sector, and additional airmass modification is needed for
appreciable airmass recovery after earlier storms, several hours of
surface heating remain. Furthermore, this boundary may serve as a
focal point for deep-moist convection to initiate and anchor on
later this evening. Latest guidance consensus suggests that
supercell structures with mainly a hail threat will materialize
closer to the U.S./Canada by around 00Z (perhaps before).
Thereafter, upscale growth into an MCS is possible along the
baroclinic boundary. Should this occur, steep mid-level lapse rates,
along with adequate vertical wind shear may promote a corridor of
severe gusts, and a 75+ mph gust or two is possible, hence the
addition of a hatched area within the Northern Plains Category
2/Slight Risk.

The Slight Risk in the Midwest was also expanded a bit westward in
IA to account for potential westward convective initiation. This
convection may also form into an MCS and traverse the same areas
impacted by an earlier MCS, hence why changes were not made farther
east despite some convective overturning noted. Otherwise, the
forecast remains on track across the west of the CONUS.

..Squitieri.. 07/14/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1117 AM CDT Sun Jul 14 2024/

...Synopsis...
West-northwesterly flow aloft is in place today across the northern
Plains and Midwest, with several small-scale features noted in
satellite imagery embedded in the flow.  This will result in
multiple MCSs from MT into the upper OH valley during this period.

...IN/OH this afternoon...
A linear MCS is currently ongoing over portions of northwest IN and
northeast IL.  Strong heating ahead of the system across much of
IN/OH, combined with surface dewpoints near 70F will yield a
corridor of moderate CAPE, likely aiding intensification of storms. 
Given 20-25 knots of mid-level flow and relatively steep mid-level
lapse rates, a few strong to severe storms are possible through the
afternoon.  Please refer to MCD #1612 for further details.

...Eastern IA/Southern WI/Northern IL/Northern IN...
Strong heating is occurring in wake of aforementioned MCS across
parts of eastern IA/southern WI/northern IL, where ample low-level
moisture remains.  A well-defined remnant MCV from the overnight
severe MCS over SD is currently over northern IA, and will track
into the destabilizing air mass.  A consensus of morning CAM
solutions suggest that thunderstorms will develop ahead of the MCV
and track toward northern IL/IN this evening.  Damaging winds and
some hail would be the main threats.

...Northeast MT/Dakotas/Western MN...
Water vapor imagery shows a strong upper trough digging
southeastward across southern AB.  Large scale lift ahead of this
system will lead to scattered thunderstorm development by early
evening across portions of northeast MT and western ND.  Model
solutions remain diverse in the details of how this convective
scenario unfolds.  However, it appears likely that one or more
clusters of strong/severe storms will track across ND and into
northeast SD/western MN during the night.  Large hail and damaging
winds will be possible with these storms.

...Mid Atlantic...
Widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms are expected today from
parts of eastern VA northeastward into eastern PA and NJ.  Winds
through the low/mid troposphere are rather weak and lapse rates are
poor.  Nevertheless, ample low-level moisture and rather high PWAT
values may result in gusty winds near the strongest storms.

...AZ...
Clear skies early today combined with dewpoints in the mid 60s will
yield a hot and moderately unstable air mass this afternoon with
MLCAPE values of 1000-1500 J/kg.  Thunderstorms are expected to form
over the higher terrain of western NM/eastern AZ and along the rim
later today, with sufficient easterly mid-level flow to aid
propagation off the mountains.  Locally damaging wind gusts may
accompany these storms.

Day 2 Convective Outlook

1230 PM CDT Sun Jul 14 2024

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF
THE MIDWEST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are likely from the Upper Midwest
into the Mid Mississippi Valley and Upper Great Lakes region
tomorrow (Monday). A focused corridor of damaging winds is possible.
Isolated severe thunderstorms are also possible across the central
Plains as well as south-central/southeast Arizona.

...Synopsis...
A complex severe weather scenario is possible across portions of the
Midwest tomorrow (Monday). Upper ridging will prevail across the
western CONUS as broad cyclonic flow remains in place, centered over
the Upper MS Valley. Multiple mid-level impulses will pivot around
the cyclonic flow from the Midwest into the Northeast, with a
surface lee trough and associated cold front poised to sweep
southeastward into the Midwest and OH Valley regions. Multiple
areas/rounds of thunderstorm development are expected from the
Midwest to the Northeast, with preceding storms exhibiting potential
influence on the evolution of subsequent convective complexes.
Nonetheless, the latest high-resolution guidance consensus, general
synoptic pattern, and regional climatology, all suggest that at
least one focused round of organized severe thunderstorms should
occur across the Midwest at some point from the late morning to late
afternoon hours, perhaps accompanied by a focused corridor of strong
to severe wind gusts. Meanwhile, surface high pressure will dominate
the Intermountain west, with monsoonal mid-level moisture pivoting
around the upper ridge, fostering multiple areas of high-based
strong to isolated severe thunderstorms from the Desert Southwest to
the central High Plains.

...Midwest into the OH Valley...
Multiple convective scenarios may unfold across portions of the
Midwest tomorrow, including the possibility of a focused corridor or
of severe gusts produced by a bow-echo MCS. By late morning/early
afternoon, a pronounced mid-level impulse will quickly traverse the
region, overspreading a generally west-to-east oriented surface
baroclinic zone. Along this boundary, upper 70s F surface dewpoints
will be in place, that in tandem with surface heating, will boost
MLCAPE to at least 3500-4500 J/kg. Given strong mid-level westerly
flow accompanying the impulse, appreciable low-level shear and
modest deep-layer shear is expected, characterized by enlarged and
curved low-level hodographs, but short hodographs aloft. This
environment climatologically favors the development of a progressive
bow-echo capable of producing a focused corridor of severe gusts
(perhaps exceeding 75 mph in spots). Furthermore, some HREF members
also depict possible bow echo development. However, there are some
uncertainties regarding how the bow echo could form, with some
members showing a bow echo approaching from MN/IA from Day 1
convection, or from new convective development over central IA.
Since multiple rounds of preceding convection may also influence the
position of the baroclinic zone and associated gradient of strong to
extreme buoyancy, there is some uncertainty as to exactly where a
bow echo would materialize and track.

A Category 3/Enhanced risk has been introduced in the general region
where a bow echo may form, and these highlights may need some
adjustments during the Day 1 Outlook to account for baroclinic zone
placement, or impacts from preceding convection. 5 percent tornado
probabilities have also been added where a bow echo would most
likely reach mature stage, where line-end and
leading-line/system-scale mesovortices may foster leading-line QLCS
tornado potential. However, even in the event that a bow echo does
not materialize, a surface cold front will approach the Midwest
tomorrow, contributing to linear convective initiation amid
strong/extreme buoyancy, where severe gusts will still be of
concern.

...Portions of the Northeast...
The first in a series of mid-level impulses traversing the cyclonic
flow aloft will approach the northern Appalachians by late
morning/early afternoon, contributing to increasing thunderstorm
coverage during the day. Surface dewpoints exceeding 70 F in several
areas, along with modest mid-level lapse rates (perhaps approaching
7 C/km in spots), will result in widespread 1500-2500 J/kg MLCAPE.
Stronger flow aloft will likely remain west into the OH Valley
though, so vertical shear should be modest at best (i.e. bulk
effective shear values around 25 kts). Pulse cellular and occasional
multicell complexes are possible, accompanied by mainly a damaging
gust threat. Storms should gradually weaken around or after sunset.

...Portions of the Central High Plains...
Upslope low-level flow by late afternoon/early evening, in tandem
with peak afternoon heating, will encourage at least scattered
thunderstorm development along the lee of the Rocky Mountains. 30-40
kts of westerly 500 mb flow pivoting around the north side an
anticyclone will assist in thunderstorms quickly moving into the
central High Plains. Here, thunderstorms will be preceded by a well
mixed boundary layer extending up to 700 mb. Surface to 500 mb lapse
rates should be in the 8.5-9.5 C/km range, which favors deep-layer
convective mixing and associated potential for severe gusts. A
Category 2/Slight Risk has been added to portions of the central
High Plains where thunderstorm clustering is expected to be greatest
(based on the latest high-resolution guidance consensus), and where
cold-pool mergers are most likely to occur.

...Portions of southern into central Arizona...
Thunderstorms are expected to develop along the Mogollon Rim by
afternoon peak heating in central AZ. Easterly mid-level flow
pivoting around the south side of an anticyclone may assist the
storms in moving off of the higher terrain, amid a well-mixed
boundary layer. Surface temperatures approaching 100 F ahead of the
storms, beneath the monsoonal mid-level moisture, will support
MLCAPE exceeding 1000 J/kg in spots. Modest elongation of the
hodographs may result in effective bulk shear values approaching 30
kts, which may support sustained multicellular clusters by late
afternoon into early evening, accompanied by an isolated severe gust
threat.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CDT Sun Jul 14 2024/

...Synopsis...
Widely scattered dry thunderstorms will continue to pose a fire
weather risk across much of the West for today amid continued
warm/dry conditions with widespread receptive fuels. Thunderstorm
activity has been fairly widespread across the Great Basin and parts
of the Pacific Northwest/northern Rockies over the past 24 hours.
GOES IR/fire temperature imagery reveals multiple hot spots that
have emerged during this period, possibly as a result of lightning
strikes. MRMS rainfall estimates suggests that wetting rainfall was
largely confined to the central Sierra Nevada and lower CO River
Valley with little accumulation further north into the Great Basin. 

A similar scenario is anticipated for today across a broad swath of
the West. 00 UTC soundings continued to sample adequate mid-level
moisture and sufficiently steep lapse rates to support weak
convection, and GOES PWAT imagery suggests 0.5-0.9 inch PWAT values
have spread east from the Great Basin into the central Rockies.
While some low-level cooling/moistening from yesterday's convection
is noted in surface temperature and RH trends, conditions in the
lowest few kilometers should remain sufficiently dry to limit
rainfall amounts. Thunderstorm coverage is expected to remain
isolated to widely scattered with the exception of parts of the
Sierra Nevada and lower CO River Valley where higher PWATS will
favor a mix of wet/dry storms. Given the antecedent dry fuels and
ongoing fires, dry lightning and strong outflow winds will continue
to pose a fire weather concern. 

...Columbia Basin...
A lee trough east of the Cascades is forecast to deepen this
afternoon, which will result in strengthening downslope/gap winds
into the Columbia Basin and through the Columbia Gorge. Ensemble
guidance continues to show reasonably high probability for 15-20 mph
winds with RH falling into the single digits to low teens. Elevated
conditions are expected, and a few locations may see a couple hours
of critical conditions with winds closer to 20 mph. Recent fire
activity in the region indicates that fuels are receptive and should
support the fire weather threat. 

...Eastern Oregon into southern Idaho...
Recent model solutions have shifted the stronger mid-level flow
northward away from the northern Great Basin. This trend appears to
be supported by upper-air observations and analyses over the past
6-12 hours. Consequently, the potential for mixing down stronger
flow to the surface appears to be reduced compared to previous
forecasts. This trend is reflected in recent ensemble guidance with
lower probability for sustained elevated conditions. The previous
Elevated risk area has been removed given this trend, but areas of
transient elevated wind/RH conditions will remain possible.

...Southern Montana to eastern Wyoming...
Patchy elevated fire weather conditions are likely this afternoon
from south-central MT into eastern WY. A deepening surface low along
the northern High Plains should support 15-20 mph downslope winds
with RH values falling into the teens to low 20s. While the synoptic
pattern favors a fire weather concern, deterministic solutions show
considerable spread in the strengthen of winds and coverage/duration
of elevated conditions - possibly due to the potential for
convection by mid-afternoon. Likewise, only a modest signal is noted
in ensemble guidance. However, given active wildfires in this region
over the past 24 hours (mostly across southern MT), trends will be
monitored for the need for highlights in future forecast updates.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 141630Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS TO THE OHIO VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are expected from the northern Plains
into the Upper Midwest and Ohio Valley.

...Synopsis...
West-northwesterly flow aloft is in place today across the northern
Plains and Midwest, with several small-scale features noted in
satellite imagery embedded in the flow.  This will result in
multiple MCSs from MT into the upper OH valley during this period.

...IN/OH this afternoon...
A linear MCS is currently ongoing over portions of northwest IN and
northeast IL.  Strong heating ahead of the system across much of
IN/OH, combined with surface dewpoints near 70F will yield a
corridor of moderate CAPE, likely aiding intensification of storms. 
Given 20-25 knots of mid-level flow and relatively steep mid-level
lapse rates, a few strong to severe storms are possible through the
afternoon.  Please refer to MCD #1612 for further details.

...Eastern IA/Southern WI/Northern IL/Northern IN...
Strong heating is occurring in wake of aforementioned MCS across
parts of eastern IA/southern WI/northern IL, where ample low-level
moisture remains.  A well-defined remnant MCV from the overnight
severe MCS over SD is currently over northern IA, and will track
into the destabilizing air mass.  A consensus of morning CAM
solutions suggest that thunderstorms will develop ahead of the MCV
and track toward northern IL/IN this evening.  Damaging winds and
some hail would be the main threats.

...Northeast MT/Dakotas/Western MN...
Water vapor imagery shows a strong upper trough digging
southeastward across southern AB.  Large scale lift ahead of this
system will lead to scattered thunderstorm development by early
evening across portions of northeast MT and western ND.  Model
solutions remain diverse in the details of how this convective
scenario unfolds.  However, it appears likely that one or more
clusters of strong/severe storms will track across ND and into
northeast SD/western MN during the night.  Large hail and damaging
winds will be possible with these storms.

...Mid Atlantic...
Widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms are expected today from
parts of eastern VA northeastward into eastern PA and NJ.  Winds
through the low/mid troposphere are rather weak and lapse rates are
poor.  Nevertheless, ample low-level moisture and rather high PWAT
values may result in gusty winds near the strongest storms.

...AZ...
Clear skies early today combined with dewpoints in the mid 60s will
yield a hot and moderately unstable air mass this afternoon with
MLCAPE values of 1000-1500 J/kg.  Thunderstorms are expected to form
over the higher terrain of western NM/eastern AZ and along the rim
later today, with sufficient easterly mid-level flow to aid
propagation off the mountains.  Locally damaging wind gusts may
accompany these storms.
