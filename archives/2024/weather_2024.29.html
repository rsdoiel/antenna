Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Thu Jul 18 2024

Valid 181300Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF NORTH
CAROLINA AND EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
The greatest concentration of damaging gusts today should be over
portions of North Carolina and extreme southeastern Virginia.

...Synopsis...
The upper-air pattern will remain dominated by mean ridging over the
West (from AZ-AB and northward to the Arctic) and troughing in the
East.  The large-scale ridge will be anchored by a high slowly
retrograding westward from the Four Corners toward the southern
Great Basin.  Just upstream from the ridge, a strong shortwave
trough was apparent over the ID Panhandle and adjoining parts of BC.
This feature should move slowly eastward through the mean ridge
today, reaching northwestern MT and southern AB by 00Z, then turning
southeastward over central MT tonight.

A strong cyclone over northern tip of QC will dig southward over
northern QC through the period, with little movement to the mean
trough extending southwestward across the lower/mid Mississippi
Valley.  Within the associated cyclonic flow, a positively tilted
synoptic-scale trough -- evident in moisture-channel imagery from
central/southwestern QC across the neck of ON to Lower MI and IN --
should pivot eastward and become more positively tilted as the
northern part accelerates.  By the end of the period, the trailing
part of this trough should extend across eastern New England to NJ. 
A subtle, positively tilted perturbation -- now over eastern parts
of KY/TN -- should move east-northeastward to eastern VA and
northeastern NC today.

In between the longwave trough and ridge, northwesterly to northerly
flow aloft will prevail across the Great Plains, with small/low-
amplitude shortwaves and vorticity lobes exiting the mean-ridge
position over the northern Rockies.  Difluent upper-level flow will
extend across most of the Plains States, but should be especially
prominent from the central High Plains southeastward to the TX Gulf
Coast.

Surface analysis at 11Z showed a cold front from southeastern QC
across the Hudson Valley to central/western VA, middle TN, central
AR, north-central TX, the TX Permian Basin, and central NM.  This
boundary should move slowly southeastward and southward across the
Atlantic and Gulf Coast States today, reaching near a line from
ORF-SPA-MGM-PIB-SAT by 00Z.  The segment of the front from south TX
to AL should stall overnight, while the remainder drifts east-
southeastward.  A lee trough was drawn from southeastern MT across
eastern WY/CO/NM just est of the mountains, and should remain near
its present position through the day.

...NC/VA and vicinity...
Thunderstorms may develop from midday through this afternoon in the
higher terrain of western NC and southwestern VA, as well as weak
surface troughing to the east, and the front on the north side of
the outlook.  While at least isolated damaging gusts and large hail
will be possible over a broad area from the high-terrain genesis
zone to the Tidewater and northern SC, the greatest concentration
and organization of convection (and potential for damaging to severe
gusts) should be over portions of central/eastern NC south of the
front, and perhaps extreme southeastern VA near the NC border along
the front.

Activity will be aided by weak large-scale ascent preceding the
southern Appalachians shortwave trough, acting in concert with
string diurnal heating to steepen low/middle level lapse rates.  A
deep summertime troposphere and rich low-level moisture (dewpoints
commonly in the 70s over and east of the Piedmont) will further
contribute to favorable buoyancy, with peak MLCAPE reaching the
2000-3000 J/kg range over the "slight risk" area of greatest
unconditional severe probabilities.  25-35-kt westerly to
west-southwesterly flow aloft should encourage storm motion into
that optimal moisture/CAPE, with upscale aggregation possible into
forward-propagating clusters or a squall line.  That would maximize
damaging-wind potential until activity moves offshore this evening.

...Central/southern High Plains...
Another afternoon of scattered to widely scattered thunderstorm
development is likely near the lee trough, and over higher terrain
near the eastern rim of the Rockies.  Additional foci may include
parts of the Cheyenne/Palmer/Raton Mesa ridges, and an
outflow/differential heating boundary from ongoing/non-severe
convection over the TX Panhandle/northeastern NM region. 
Thunderstorms should move mainly to the south, with some
southeastward or even southwestward tracks (for rightward-deviant
cells) possible.  Isolated severe gusts and large hail will be
possible, with small-scale clustering potentially increasing severe
probabilities locally.

From the lee trough eastward, low-level flow will be weak, but with
a predominant easterly surface component, helping to maximize both
low-level lift and (through strong veering with height) deep shear. 
Effective-shear magnitudes of 35-45 kt and somewhat long, nearly
straight low-level hodographs are progged east of the lee trough,
supporting the potential for a blend of multicell and supercell
modes.  However, modest mid/upper winds are forecast, keeping storm
motion slow outside of areas where cold pool aggregate and
accelerate storm-translation vectors well past those suggested by
ambient winds.  The corridor of riches low-level moisture will cover
about the eastern half of the outlook, within which peak/
preconvective MLCAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg will be possible.  However,
MLCINH also will increase with eastward extent, with time this
evening, and with lower surface elevation.  As such, activity should
become weaker and more isolated tonight.

...Portions of MT...
Widely scattered to scattered, high-based thunderstorms are expected
to develop this afternoon over higher terrain of west-central MT, as
three processes overlap:
1.  Preceding the shortwave trough, large-scale DCVA/ascent/cooling
aloft over spreads the area;
2.  Diurnal heating preferentially erodes low-level MLCINH over
higher elevations, and builds deep/well-mixed subcloud layers with
40s to low 50s F surface dewpoints, beneath around 300-700 J/kg
MLCAPE;
3.  Modest low-level convergence continues near a lee trough just
east of the mountains, with weak closed-low development possible at
the surface over north-central MT.

As this activity shifts eastward, isolated severe gusts may occur. 
Aggregating outflows may permit an arc of strong/locally severe
outflow to organize, with convection along or behind the leading
edge.  Lack of more robust moisture/buoyancy should limit the
overall threat, and contribute to enough stabilization of the
foregoing boundary layer to weaken the activity during the evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0121 AM CDT Thu Jul 18 2024

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will continue to slowly expand west and north
over the western CONUS Friday. Hot and mostly dry conditions will
persist under the influence of this feature, where only very
localized wetting rains have occurred through the past week or so.
Shallow mid to upper-level monsoonal moisture is still expected over
the Great Basin atop a well-mixed boundary layer, where PWAT values
will be even lower than the previous day's. Isolated dry
thunderstorms are expected to develop above increasingly receptive
fuels Friday afternoon, via orographic ascent, and continue into the
early evening. Very little wetting rainfall is expected to accompany
this elevated convection.

Mesoscale Discussion 1657
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Southeast CO...northeast NM...southwest KS...TX/OK
Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 162049Z - 162245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in the severe-wind and isolated hail threat
is possible through late afternoon into early evening.

DISCUSSION...Convection developing near the higher terrain of
south-central CO into northeast NM has gradually intensified this
afternoon, with a recent measured gust of 51 kt at Colorado Springs.
Farther east, storms are beginning to develop across parts of
southeast CO into the Raton Mesa vicinity. Low-level moisture is
generally rather modest across the region, but strong heating has
resulted in MLCAPE increasing to 500-1000 J/kg, with some further
increase possible into late afternoon. Modest northwesterly midlevel
flow along the periphery of an upper ridge over the southern Rockies
is supporting effective shear of 25-35 kt, which may support
occasional storm organization.

Initial discrete storms will continue to pose a threat of isolated
severe gusts and possibly some hail. With time, increasingly
prominent outflow within the initially hot and well-mixed
environment will support development of one or more loosely
organized clusters, which would move southeastward with some
increase in the severe-wind threat into parts of the
central/southern High Plains. Watch issuance is possible over parts
of the region, if a more organized severe threat appears imminent.

Mesoscale Discussion 1656
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Central and Eastern New York into Vermont

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 546...547...

Valid 162000Z - 162130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 546, 547
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe weather threat continues for WW 547, with
measured wind gusts of 65+ MPH and a few tornadoes possible.

DISCUSSION...The severe weather threat continues for Central and
Eastern New York this afternoon, as an ongoing linear convective
complex moves across the highlight area. Measured wind gusts of 65+
MPH have already been observed, in addition to tornadoes. This
convective activity is expected to persist over the next few hours
as it moves eastward into Vermont.

There is a localized corridor of enhanced tornado potential in the
center of the convective line, where low-level convective
organization and rotation is concentrated in a favorable environment
of STP > 1. Multiple embedded circulations have been observed
already, and will likely persist in the storm term.

Mesoscale Discussion 1655
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Central NE into parts of north-central KS and
south-central SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 161940Z - 162145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe storms may develop by late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus is deepening this afternoon across parts of
south-central NE, with some building cumulus also noted into
northwest NE and extreme south-central SD. The building cumulus is
ongoing within a region of relatively rich low-level moisture, with
diurnal heating supporting MLCAPE of near/above 1500 J/kg and
weakening MLCINH. In the absence of stronger large-scale ascent,
details regarding storm coverage and timing of more robust storm
development remain uncertain. However, storm initiation is underway
across south-central NE, with at least isolated development possible
farther north, within a zone of modest low-level confluence near a
weak surface low across central NE. 

Low-level flow is weak, but modest midlevel west-northwesterlies are
supporting effective shear of 30-40 kt, and it is possible that a
couple of supercells and/or stronger storm clusters could develop by
late afternoon into the early evening. Midlevel lapse rates are
generally rather weak, but some hail threat could accompany any
sustained supercells, along with a threat of localized severe gusts.
Watch issuance is possible for parts of the area later this
afternoon, if development of multiple severe storms appears
imminent.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Valid 162000Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF
EASTERN NEW YORK INTO SOUTHERN VERMONT...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
CENTRAL/EASTERN NEBRASKA...SOUTHEAST COLORADO INTO NORTHWEST
OKLAHOMA...SOUTHERN MISSOURI INTO WESTERN KENTUCKY...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible from the central Plains
to the Northeast.  Greatest severe-thunderstorm threats within that
are over parts of the central Plains and upper Ohio Valley to parts
of the northern Mid-Atlantic and western New England.

...20Z Update...
Severe probabilities have been adjusted behind ongoing convection
and the mid-level shortwave in parts of New York and Pennsylvania.
Elsewhere, the outlook remains mostly on track with only minor
adjustments based on current observations and expected convective
evolution.

..Wendt.. 07/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024/

...Northeast States...
A well-defined shortwave trough and embedded MCV from last night's
severe MCS is tracking into western NY.  Strong heating of a moist
air mass ahead of this system will result in intensification of
thunderstorms early this afternoon, with storms tracking eastward
across NY/northern PA into New England this evening.  Damaging winds
(potentially widespread) will be the main concern with these storms,
although hail and a tornado or two are also possible.  Have expanded
the SLGT risk to the MA/NH coast, given favorable westerly surface
winds and morning CAM solutions suggesting that MCS may persist that
far.

South of the main upper feature, a hot and humid air mass is present
from central PA and NJ southward.  Widely scattered afternoon
thunderstorms will develop in this area, despite rather weak
forcing.  Sufficient winds aloft will promote a few organized storm
clusters, capable of damaging wind gusts.

...CO/KS/OK/TX...
Full sunshine will lead to very deep boundary-layer mixing and
scattered high-based showers/thunderstorms along the Colorado Front
Range this afternoon.  This activity will be capable of locally
gusty/damaging winds.  As the convection spread east-southeastward
into a progressively more moist air mass, intensification and
organization of storms into an MCS is expected.  This system will
track into southwest KS and northwest OK this evening, with a
continued risk of locally damaging wind gusts.

...Central NE...
A surface cold front is sagging southward across SD/NE today. 
Thunderstorms are expected to intensify along this front over
central NE late this afternoon or early evening.  Activity will
track southward for a few hours, posing a risk of damaging wind
gusts.

...Mid MS Valley...
A large and persistent area of thunderstorms has been affecting
portions of MO/IL all morning, resulting in a very large cloud
shield.  This will significantly impact heating/destabilization
later today.  Therefore, have adjusted the SLGT region to the areas
along and south of the cloud shield, where strong heating is still
possible.  12z CAM solutions suggest storms will build southward
from this MCS across southern MO/western KY and into parts of AR/TN
later today, with some risk of damaging winds.

1220 PM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE NORTHERN
MID-ATLANTIC INTO PARTS OF SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible from the
Carolinas into New England on Wednesday, with a corridor of greater
coverage from northeast Virginia into the Hudson Valley and adjacent
southern Vermont/western Massachusetts. Isolated strong to severe
thunderstorms are possible across the central High Plains as well.

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is expected to shift eastward, with some
southward digging into the northern Mid-Atlantic states on
Wednesday. In the West, an upper-level ridge is expected to amplify
somewhat roughly over the Divide. A shortwave trough will slide
northward through the Northwest during the period along the western
flank of the upper ridge. At the surface, a cold front will be
situated from the southern Plains into the Ohio Valley. A surface
trough will deepen near the Blue Ridge during the afternoon.

...Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast...
Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are expected to develop
along/ahead of the cold front and surface trough during the
afternoon. While mid-level lapse rates will be rather weak, strong
heating will support 2000-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE, particularly east of
the Blue Ridge. Enhanced mid-level winds with the approaching trough
should support at least modest storm organization. Shear will be
slightly greater within the northern Mid-Atlantic into parts of
southern New England. Buoyancy will decrease with northward extent,
however. The expectation is for a few clusters/linear segments, and
perhaps a marginal supercell or two, to pose a risk of primarily
damaging winds. Warm temperatures aloft should keep large hail
potential low.

...High Plains...
Upslope flow behind the cold front will push low-level moisture up
against the terrain. Dewpoints in the mid/upper 40s F are generally
expected by the afternoon, though some low 50s F are possible
especially farther to the east. Modest northwesterly flow aloft on
the western flank of the upper trough will support from 25 kts of
effective shear near the Raton to around 35 kts in eastern Wyoming
and the Nebraska Panhandle. Given the modest shear and relatively
dry boundary layer, storms are expected to be outflow dominant with
an attendant risk for severe winds. Some large hail threat could
occur within the first hour or two of storm initiation.

...ArkLaTex Vicinity...
An MCV from convection within parts of the Front Range on Tuesday
evening is expected to be over Oklahoma at the beginning of the
period. Heating ahead of this feature appears likely to support
scattered storms from parts of North Texas into the ArkLaTex. While
strong wind gusts are possible, the disorganized wind profile is not
expected to support and organized severe threat.

..Thornton.. 07/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0133 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024/

...Synopsis...
Another afternoon of dry thunderstorms is expected later today
across parts of the Great Basin and Pacific Northwest. Regional 00
UTC soundings continue to show a gradual moistening trend across
much of the West that has been noted over the past 48 hours. This
comes amid several days of widely scattered thunderstorms and a
steady influx of mid-level monsoonal moisture evident in advected
PWAT satellite imagery. Consequently, thermodynamic conditions
appear to favor a mixture of wet and dry thunderstorms across the
eastern Great Basin, Southwest, and central Rockies this afternoon.
To the west on the periphery of the better moisture (where PWATs are
generally around 0.75 inch), dry thunderstorms will be more probable
as lift associated with a weak upper low overspreads the West
Coast/western Great Basin. Recent analyses continue to suggest that
fuels are receptive to lightning starts, and gusty outflow winds may
impact ongoing fires across the region.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING ACROSS PORTIONS OF NEW YORK AND VERMONT...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ELSEWHERE OVER
MUCH OF THE NORTHEAST...AS WELL AS PARTS OF:  CENTRAL
PLAINS...SOUTH-CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...OZARKS...AND LOWER
MISSOURI/OHIO VALLEY REGIONS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible from the central Plains
to the Northeast.  Greatest severe-thunderstorm threats within that
are over parts of the central Plains and upper Ohio Valley to parts
of the northern Mid-Atlantic and western New England.

...Northeast States...
A well-defined shortwave trough and embedded MCV from last night's
severe MCS is tracking into western NY.  Strong heating of a moist
air mass ahead of this system will result in intensification of
thunderstorms early this afternoon, with storms tracking eastward
across NY/northern PA into New England this evening.  Damaging winds
(potentially widespread) will be the main concern with these storms,
although hail and a tornado or two are also possible.  Have expanded
the SLGT risk to the MA/NH coast, given favorable westerly surface
winds and morning CAM solutions suggesting that MCS may persist that
far.

South of the main upper feature, a hot and humid air mass is present
from central PA and NJ southward.  Widely scattered afternoon
thunderstorms will develop in this area, despite rather weak
forcing.  Sufficient winds aloft will promote a few organized storm
clusters, capable of damaging wind gusts.

...CO/KS/OK/TX...
Full sunshine will lead to very deep boundary-layer mixing and
scattered high-based showers/thunderstorms along the Colorado Front
Range this afternoon.  This activity will be capable of locally
gusty/damaging winds.  As the convection spread east-southeastward
into a progressively more moist air mass, intensification and
organization of storms into an MCS is expected.  This system will
track into southwest KS and northwest OK this evening, with a
continued risk of locally damaging wind gusts.

...Central NE...
A surface cold front is sagging southward across SD/NE today. 
Thunderstorms are expected to intensify along this front over
central NE late this afternoon or early evening.  Activity will
track southward for a few hours, posing a risk of damaging wind
gusts.

...Mid MS Valley...
A large and persistent area of thunderstorms has been affecting
portions of MO/IL all morning, resulting in a very large cloud
shield.  This will significantly impact heating/destabilization
later today.  Therefore, have adjusted the SLGT region to the areas
along and south of the cloud shield, where strong heating is still
possible.  12z CAM solutions suggest storms will build southward
from this MCS across southern MO/western KY and into parts of AR/TN
later today, with some risk of damaging winds.

Mesoscale Discussion 1650
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0933 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Western/central NY into northern PA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161433Z - 161630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe-thunderstorm threat will increase through the
morning, with a threat of damaging winds, isolated hail, and
possibly a tornado. Watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...A well-defined MCV is moving across parts of southern
Ontario this morning, with storms already increasing in coverage and
intensity in the vicinity of Lake Ontario. Diurnal
heating/destabilization downstream of the MCV will support more
widespread thunderstorm development across western NY and perhaps
northern PA later this morning. Rather substantial enhancement to
low/midlevel flow related to the MCV (which is already noted on KPBZ
and KBUF VWPs) will support organized convection, in the presence of
MLCAPE increasing into the 1000-2000 J/kg range. 

While eventual clustering and potential MCS development is expected,
a couple of supercells will also be possible, both with initial
development, and also embedded in any upscale growth that occurs
later in convective evolution. Scattered damaging wind and localized
gusts of 60-70 mph will be possible by late morning into the
afternoon, along with some potential for isolated hail and a tornado
or two with any persistent supercells. Watch issuance is likely by
late morning in order to address these threats.

Mesoscale Discussion 1649
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0845 AM CDT Tue Jul 16 2024

Areas affected...Extreme northeast KS into parts of MO and southwest
IL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 545...

Valid 161345Z - 161515Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 545
continues.

SUMMARY...Some threat for damaging/severe gusts may continue through
the morning. Additional watch issuance is possible.

DISCUSSION...One thunderstorm cluster with a history of producing
severe gusts is currently near Kansas City, with another potentially
severe storm cluster over north-central MO. Other less-organized
convection is ongoing from southeast MO into southwest IL. Evolution
of the ongoing convection through the morning remains uncertain,
with a pocket of diurnal heating potential in advance of the
north-central MO cluster, and some heating/destabilization also
expected south of the storms across southeast MO/southwest IL. 

MUCAPE in excess of 1500 J/kg and marginally supportive deep-layer
shear could continue to support some organized severe-wind potential
through the morning, especially in advance of the north-central MO
cluster. Downstream watch issuance into parts of eastern MO is
possible, depending on short-term convective trends. Some severe
threat could also eventually evolve out of the southeast
MO/southwest IL convection.

Mesoscale Discussion 1615
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0315 PM CDT Sun Jul 14 2024

Areas affected...Parts of IA...northern IL...southern WI

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 142015Z - 142145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe storm development is expected later this
afternoon into the evening. Eventual watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...Rather strong heating/destabilization is underway
across much of IA this afternoon, while recovery in the wake of
morning convection/outflow is ongoing across northern IL. Meanwhile,
the remnant MCV from last night's severe MCS over the Dakotas is
currently moving across northern IA. As MLCINH continues to erode
across northern/eastern IA and MLCAPE increases above 3000 J/kg, the
MCV may aid in scattered thunderstorm development later this
afternoon. Midlevel flow is not particularly strong across the
region, but sufficient to support effective shear of 25-35 kt and
potential for some storm organization. 

Initial discrete development could evolve into a supercell or two,
with a threat of hail, locally damaging wind, and possibly a
tornado. In conjunction with the MCV, a persistent 20-30 kt
southwesterly low-level jet could encourage relatively quick
clustering and upscale growth, with some potential for an MCS to
develop and move eastward across northern IL and southern WI this
evening, with a continued severe-wind threat.  

Farther northwest, in the wake of the MCV, cumulus is deepening
along a weak surface boundary across northwest IA. While this area
is in the immediate wake of the MCV, strong buoyancy and sufficient
deep-layer shear would support severe-thunderstorm potential in this
area as well, if storms can mature. 

While favored timing and area remain somewhat uncertain, watch
issuance will become increasingly likely if storm initiation appears
imminent across the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 1614
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0206 PM CDT Sun Jul 14 2024

Areas affected...Southern IN into western OH

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 532...

Valid 141906Z - 142030Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 532
continues.

SUMMARY...A threat for at least isolated damaging wind is expected
to continue through late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A loosely organized MCS continues to move
east-southeastward across parts of southern IN into western OH this
afternoon. Recent measured gusts have generally been in the 30-45 kt
range, though some wind damage was reported earlier across northern
IN. Generally weak low/midlevel flow may continue to limit
organization potential through the afternoon. However, the
downstream thermodynamic environment remains favorable for
damaging-wind potential, with MLCAPE in excess of 1500 J/kg and
steepening low-level lapse rates, and some threat for at least
isolated damaging wind is expected to continue through late
afternoon.
