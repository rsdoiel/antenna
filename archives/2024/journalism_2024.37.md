## An AI chatbot helped Americans who believe in conspiracy theories “exit the rabbit hole”

date: 2024-09-13, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The uncle who believes 9/11 never happened. The next-door neighbor who thinks Biden stole the 2020 election. The Nieman Lab editor who&#8217;s been known to wonder if aliens really do exist and the U.S. government is covering them up. You probably don&#8217;t want to talk to these people and convince them that they are wrong....

Last year, Rachel Antell was working on her latest documentary. An archival producer, Antell’s credits include the Academy Award-nominated Crip Camp and the CNN Film Chowchilla.

## Mobile newsrooms help drive citizen journalism in North Macedonia and beyond

date: 2024-09-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The lakeside location, historic churches, and pretty cobbled streets of Ohrid in North Macedonia draw hundreds of thousands of tourists each year. But the city’s status as a UNESCO-protected gem has not defended it from rampant overdevelopment and corruption. When notorious local politician and businessman Nefi Useini began to illegally build a pizzeria near an...

## The California Google deal could leave out news startups and the smallest publishers

date: 2024-09-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Last month, Google and California struck a groundbreaking, controversial deal to funnel almost $250 million into the state’s journalism over five years (while shoehorning in&#8230;an AI accelerator), sidestepping a more sweeping effort to force Google and Meta to pay news publishers. The closed-door deal has been covered, pragmatically praised, and excoriated here and elsewhere. But...

## With an expansion on the way, Ken Doctor’s Lookout thinks it has some answers to the local news crisis

date: 2024-09-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

It&#8217;s been a big year for Lookout, the local news company founded by longtime Nieman Lab columnist and news industry analyst Ken Doctor. In May, its first newsroom, Lookout Santa Cruz on the California coast, won an obscure little bauble called the Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting.

## The old Recode Media podcast is returning to a familiar home

date: 2024-09-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

There have been few digital news outlets with a more complicated brand history than what used to be Recode. First came All Things Digital, a technology site born within The Wall Street Journal in 2007. Six years later, its two most prominent faces — Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg — left the Journal to start...

## Big tech is painting itself as journalism’s savior. We should tread carefully.

date: 2024-09-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

We&#8217;ve long been warned about the looming demise of traditional journalism in the face of digital disruption. But some tech giants, once the very disruptors themselves, have been positioning themselves as journalism&#8217;s saviors. Programs such as the Google News Initiative promise not only to keep journalism alive, but by enabling innovation, to also help it...

date: 2024-09-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

A couple of weeks ago, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, already one of the healthiest metro newspapers in the country, announced a thorough “reboot,&#8221; including a re-branding as the Minnesota Star Tribune. Late last month, I spoke with Steve Grove, the paper’s CEO and publisher since April of last year, about the thinking behind the moves. Grove is...
