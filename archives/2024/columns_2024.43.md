## Journalism dies in darkness

date: 2024-10-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/09/12/hippieHarrisSign.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The Washington Post <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/25/nx-s1-5165353/washington-post-presidential-endorsement-trump-harris">announcing</a> it wouldn’t endorse a candidate for president is the first glimpse we’ve had of how news publishing in the US has been devastated by fear of fascism. This must go back at least as far as the 2016 election and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_email_controversy">Hillary’s emails</a>. The editorial people broke the wall, deciding to give the readers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement-president/">the first glimpse</a> we’ve gotten into the inner conflicts of one two most influential news orgs in the country.
</p>
<p>Until now this was the one story they would never report on. Truly a milestone. And now that the window is open, open it further. Report on how a major news org holds back stories that would be of intense interest to the people, if only the news orgs did their jobs. This is where the "public editors" never went, and should have gone.

## Online ordering hours

It doesn&#8217;t happen often, but whenever I come across an online business that doesn&#8217;t take orders 24/7/365, it gives them a bump up in my opinion. Resisting the demands of constant growth and &#8216;convenience?&#8217; Giving your employees a break? I love it.

## Let's bust some new norms

date: 2024-10-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Why hasn’t the NY Times run a story that takes Trump at face value and explains to voters what it would be like to live in that United States? It should have been updated and run every time Trump ups the ante.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/post/DBjMQCDsZdy">An example</a>. Trump says Americans who criticize the Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade should be imprisoned:  “These people should be put in jail for the way they talk about our judges and justices.” </p>
<p>A news story on this subject should include calls to all the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx">justices</a> on the Supreme Court to ask if they agree or disagree. It's time to bust some new norms. They are above reproach, traditionally, but they decided that the president can do whatever he wants, break any law without penalty. Are they concerned that perhaps they might be imprisoned if they make a decision that Trump doesn't like? Let's learn from them, how they think American citizens should feel about this. After all they are American citizens too, aren't they? If we can be jailed, or worse, for our speech, why not them? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>Of course if they refuse to answer, which they probably will, that should be part of the story. No deference allowed, by the journalists. Simple factual statements. </p>
<p>We've relied too much on the Democrats to stick their necks out, when in fact all our necks are on the line here. So if you have something to say about this, now is the time to do it. In a couple of weeks it might be too late. </p>

## Watermark for LLM-Generated Text

date: 2024-10-25, updated: 2024-10-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Researchers at Google <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03462-7">have</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08025-4">developed</a> a watermark for LLM-generated text. The basics are pretty obvious: the LLM chooses between tokens partly based on a cryptographic key, and someone with knowledge of the key can detect those choices. What makes this hard is (1) how much text is required for the watermark to work, and (2) how robust the watermark is to post-generation editing. Google&#8217;s version looks pretty good: it&#8217;s detectable in text as small as 200 tokens.</p>

Trump&#8217;s threat to use the military on &#8220;the enemy within,&#8221; along with the recent statements of General John Kelly and other members of Trump&#8217;s administration who say he is a fascist, have fed growing concern that Trump&#8217;s reelection could spark a deadly conflict between MAGA Republicans and those they perceive as their enemies.

## 2024-10-24 Executing commands via NNCP

date: 2024-10-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-10-24-executing-commands-via-nncp">2024-10-24 Executing commands via NNCP</h1>

<p>In a network of connected nodes where you all exchanged public keys, it is possible to do file requests. For this to work, the node with the files needs to specify the directory with the files and the node wanting the files needs to use the <code>nncp-freq</code> command to do a file request.</p>

<p>But what file to request? One solution is for one side create a file listing all the other files and make this filename known to friends. Then run a job to recreate the file on a regular basis.</p>

<p>But you know me. It sounds like CO₂ for the CO₂ god.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the node that has the files, granting its neighbour melanobomus access to the files in <code>/home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki</code> and offering to execute <code>ls -BR</code> for that directory and sending it back as a file called <code>files.txt</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    melanobomus: {
      exec: {
        rsmtp:  [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;, &quot;-bS&quot;]
        ls: [&quot;/bin/sh&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;ls --ignore-backups --recursive /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki | nncp-file - $NNCP_SENDER:files.txt&quot;]
      }
      freq: {

CosmOS represents a fundamental rethinking of operating systems for the AI era. While the AI Pin faced harsh criticism at launch, it served &#8230;

## Are Automatic License Plate Scanners Constitutional?

date: 2024-10-23, updated: 2024-10-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>An advocacy groups is <a href="https://www.404media.co/lawsuit-argues-warrantless-use-of-flock-surveillance-cameras-is-unconstitutional/">filing</a> a Fourth Amendment challenge against automatic license plate readers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The City of Norfolk, Virginia, has installed a network of cameras that make it functionally impossible for people to drive anywhere without having their movements tracked, photographed, and stored in an AI-assisted database that enables the warrantless surveillance of their every move. This civil rights lawsuit seeks to end this dragnet surveillance program,&#8221; the <a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024.10.21-1-Complaint.pdf">lawsuit notes</a>. &#8220;In Norfolk, no one can escape the government&#8217;s 172 unblinking eyes,&#8221; it continues, referring to the 172 Flock cameras currently operational in Norfolk. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures and has been ruled in many cases to protect against warrantless government surveillance, and the lawsuit specifically says Norfolk&#8217;s installation violates that.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

I think it's probably too late, anyway. Journalism should have reported, constantly, that the house is on fire. And nothing else. Biden's age didn't enter into it you fools. The much bigger story was and is that Hitler wants to be president, and this time he has a plan. It was true then and it's true now. The next question is what will Biden do if Trump wins. It was tough watching Obama greet Trump at the White House in 2016. I can't see Biden doing that. I wonder what ideas they're workshopping in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_Room">actual</a> Situation Room.

On CNN, one of the worst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanewashing">sanewashing</a> sources for our would-be despot. I can't imagine what happened there. Or maybe I can. Is it possible that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery">owners</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN">CNN</a> who might have gotten an education and possibly studied a little history from teachers who remembered WW II, and understood that Trump's lines are straight from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>, and maybe perhaps possibly maybe with only two weeks to go before the election started envisioning themselves and family on trains to American death camps. After all CNN ran some perceivably negative stuff about Trump, and who knows maybe President Trump won't be so discerning and might just have all media people euthanized. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXygknVeLGE">It could happen</a>. Maybe visions of their own mortality caught up with them and they decided to let Blitzer do what he can to douse the flames. Oddly the same thing seems to have happened at the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/18/164631.html">NY Times</a> and the Atlantic, and Trump's former <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html">Chief of Staff</a> has gone <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/23/g-s1-29490/trump-john-kelly-fascist-dictator">on the record</a> now, with audio, explaining what we all know is waiting for us if the US actually goes down the path it appears we quite possibly are going down.

## 2024-10-22 Preparing Chinese tea for beginners

date: 2024-10-23, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-10-22-preparing-chinese-tea-for-beginners">2024-10-22 Preparing Chinese tea for beginners</h1>

<p>This is a continuation of <a href="2021-07-12_Preparing_Japanese_green_tea_for_beginners">2021-07-12 Preparing Japanese green tea for beginners</a>. This page is about the Chinese and Taiwanese tea I often drink: loose leaf oolong tea and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu%27er_tea">pu&rsquo;er tea</a> (fermented tea) in a brick (round disks about as big as two hands next to each other). That would be tea costing around CHF 30/50g or CHF 220/375g.</p>

<p>The rule I use is simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>boil water</li>
<li>wet the tea leaves for a few seconds and throw the water away (&ldquo;washing&rdquo; the leaves)</li>
<li>pour more hot water onto the leaves and let it steep for 1 minute</li>
<li>drink it</li>
</ol>

<p>Repeat the 1 min steep as often as you want.</p>

<p>I usually try to do this at least three times. I often find that the fourth time around the flavour is much reduced and I will stop. In addition to that, by the time I have drunk three cups of tea I’m usually in a different mood and no longer into tea.</p>

<p>If the tea is good, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you forget it while it is steeping. It doesn&rsquo;t turn into the kind of bitterness that zombifies your tongue. It&rsquo;s just bitter but still tasty.</p>

<p>Sometimes I forget the empty pot or cup and resume the steeping hours later. In this time, bacteria haven&rsquo;t eaten away the leaves. There is no mould growing on the leaves. Just pour that hot water, let it steep for a minute and keep drinking tea!</p>

<p>Sometimes I know that the tea is very mild and I&rsquo;ll let it steep for 2 minutes the second time around and 3 minutes the third time around. No problem at all. Tea is flexible. Good tea remains good tea. It tastes a little different but it always tastes good.</p>

## What about Ghost?

date: 2024-10-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><b>Bob Sassone writes via email</b>:</p>
<p>You said on your blog that you can't imagine moving from WordPress because "there isn't anything else out there that's offering something new for the writers." What about Ghost? </p>
<p>Bob's site is <a href="https://www.bobsassone.com/">bobsassone.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>My response</b>:</p>
<p>Sorry it wasn't clear -- but as far as I know, Ghost isn't built on WordPress. It's a completely different product. </p>
<p>My writing app runs on WordPress. So you can use it with your existing wordpress.com sites.</p>
<p>It's a browser-based JavaScript app that hooks into WordPress via the wpidentity package I wrote.</p>
<p>And the codebase I've built will support lots of editors built using WordPress as the backend. </p>

## The million-plus Americans Trump killed

It wasn't worded carefully enough, I should've had a lawyer review it. Yes, a lot of them died during Biden's tenure too. But I don't think of it that way. I think of the big con-job Trump pulled, first denying there was a virus, then saying it would be done by Easter, then telling people not to wear masks, then ridiculing Biden because he was isolating during the campaign, and of course injecting bleach and all the other <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7685699/">bullshit</a>. Then the mofo got Covid, and our doctors saved his life, and he never said geez I was wrong about this, it's a killer, and btw thanks for saving my life. So yes this was yet another mess a Democrat had to clean up left by his Republican predecessor. Recall the economic collapse Bush left for Obama. And btw, I used to vote Republican, so don't tell me I'm biased. There are a lot of lawyers out there who think a turn of a word can exonerate the depravity and incompetence of Trump. Hopefully he's the worst the Repubs have to throw at us, but who knows what they will come up with. And for crying out loud, if you haven't voted yet, save us from concentration camps and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-where-rnc-delegates-stand-on-immigration">mass deportation</a>. One million Americans dead is far too many, let's not try to top that. Thanks.  </p>

## The Problem with Podcasts

date: 2024-10-22, from: Om Malik blog

Why does every podcast have a&#160;six-minute&#160;lead of proverbial throat-clearing,&#160;self-promotion, and&#160;advertising?&#160;I can understand that mega podcasts like Joe Rogan’s have to deal with this — advertisers are throwing money at people like him and Tim&#160;Ferriss.&#160; The problem is more acute&#160;with&#160;relatively smaller podcasts. I listen to&#160;many&#160;“intellectually curious” podcasts that focus on subjects such as science, history,&#160;design, and &#8230;

## Hammers

date: 2024-10-22, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I bet if you were someone who could make a hammer that would have been a good stable job for years, centuries even. Almost everyone needs a hammer at some point in their life.</p>
<p>“Hey, where’d you get that hammer?”<br />
“Oh, you gotta talk to Bartholomew.”</p>
<p>Then some guy, Greg, would see how busy the hammersmith is making hammers one at-a-time and say, “I’m going to make hammers one hundred at a time!” He’d pay Bartholomew not to make him one hammer, but to make a mold that could make one hundred hammers at a time. Greg has rich parents, he can afford this sort of risky business venture. One hundred hammers for the price of ten, that’s profit.</p>
<p>After the hammer mold, Bartholomew would still get paid. No one actually likes pouring molten iron and hammering, but Bartholomew doesn’t mind. He’s making less money per hammer, but he’s also producing more hammers with a lot less effort, so it nets out okay. The job is less interesting – making hammers and nothing else – but he didn’t like being a salesman and dealing with wayward customer requests anyways. There’s lots of money in churning out hammers this way, it’s more efficient and people like Greg love selling them and making money. Bartholomew buys himself a new ox cart.</p>
<p>Then some other guy, Jeff, seeing all those hammers and all that money, would say “I’m going to make a machine that makes a million hammers a day.” Jeff knows a regional lord who is friends with the king and has big treasure chests. He’d hire Bartholomew and his hammersmith friends to build a giant complex machine with whistles and gauges and a furnace that makes ten hammers a second.  A million hammers a day for the price of a thousand hammers, <em>now that’s profit!</em></p>
<p>The profit charts are going up. Hammers are about as cheap as possible to mass produce… except now Bartholomew and his hammersmith friends are starting to catch the ire of bookkeepers. They’re starting to look expensive compared to the penny hammers that sell for $10. They fire Bartholomew. He’s given three months of pay, which is nice, but in exchange he has to sign a contract saying he’ll never make another hammer machine again in his life. Hopefully Bartholomew squirreled away enough money to retire with dignity, otherwise what’s an old hammersmith do when there’s no more hammers to make?</p>

## I'm sticking with WordPress

date: 2024-10-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'm continuing to develop on WordPress. I see the opportunity regardless of what else is going on. </p>
<p>I could be wrong, I have been before. I kept using Twitter for identity after Musk took over, even though as time went by it was increasingly obvious that developers weren't part of his plan. I've been there before, with Apple, after Jobs came back. We had a great developer community for the web on the Mac, better than anything on Windows or Unix, and the management before Jobs, Heidi Roizen advising Gil Amelio, seemed to value our contribution, even if we weren't prospering. But there was a moment when Jobs introduced the open source equivalent of some of our products -- and that basically spelled the end of our little adventure, since Apple was putting the spotlight on them and not us.</p>
<p>But it doesn't always go that way. I kept investing in the Mac in 1985, a very bad year for Apple, and in 1986 we had a huge hit, and because we were almost alone in sticking it out, we were rewarded with booming sales. Of course it mattered that MORE was a lovely product. But if no one looks, it doesn't matter how lovely it is! </p>
<p>Anyway, the WordPress world is huge. Far bigger than the blogosphere in the 90s and 00s. Maybe somehow the trouble with WordPress will mean that people who see WordPress as a writing platform will all leave now, or stop considering new ways of writing. But honestly I don't think that's very likely. I have a few sites at wordpress.com that are archives, that I pay for, that I will continue to pay for. My father's memorial site, for example. Things would have to get incomprehensibly bad for me to consider moving it and where exactly would I move it?</p>
<p>But on the other hand, there isn't anything else out there that's offering something new for the writers. I think I'm pretty much alone working in this area. And maybe people need some good news? </p>
<p>My new product is a medium size writing tool. Less than a full word processor and more than a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text box</a>. I think there are a lot of WordPress users who will like it. And I think there's a chance they might notice it. So I'm going all the way with this one. I may lose the bet, but wtf, let's give it a try.</p>

<p>Every fucking second‽</p>

<p>Now, a decision needs to be made:</p>

<ul>
<li>I could ban all the requests this bot makes by banning the specific user agent string.</li>
<li>I could ban the networks that host this bot on the premise that they&rsquo;ll probably also host other harmful bots.</li>
</ul>

<p>Guess which option I&rsquo;m taking?</p>

<p>Remember: <a href="2023-10-04-search">2023-10-04 Search engines, the deal is off!</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For a while it seemed that we all benefited from search engines – authors and readers both. These days, you’ll find that search results are full of garbage sites. Big sites with the most flatulent of pages explaining in great detail why the thing you’re looking for is important and how to do it, clearly optimized for an ad company and not for a reader. Big sites that have a gazillion answers are preferred over small and individual sites. Perhaps that’s easier. Perhaps it allows them to diffuse responsibility for the garbage, I don’t know. The effect is, in any case, that there is no benefit to search engines for small site authors, either. I was unable to find my own pages on the search engines. If you you are a small site owner and you think you can find your own pages on Google and Bing, I suspect that’s because they track you. Try it on a different computer, anonymously. Perhaps you won’t find yourself, either.</p>

<p>In any case, if I can’t get anything in return, both as a reader and as an author, I feel that the deal is off. Why let them feed on my words for free? Nay, at a cost, since they are keeping my website busy, producing CO₂ and heating the planet for no benefit at all.</p>

<p>Better to block them all.</p>

## Where web components shine

date: 2024-10-21, from: Dave Rupert blog

<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/cavern.jpg" alt="vintage illustration of three explorers in a cave holding torches to light their way" width="1000" height="734"/>
<p>In this job <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/04/thoughts-on-cosmotechnics/">we need to think a lot about the tools we choose and why</a>, so I cataloged all the places where web components (for me) feel like “the right tool for the job”. Your list may be different and I’d love to read it. And because I don’t want this to be 100% propaganda, I’ll also cover some of the not-so-great parts of web components as well.</p>
<h2>The good parts</h2>
<p>Here’s an incomplete list of situations where I think web components are a good choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>For leaf nodes - <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2023/08/23/use-web-components-for-what-theyre-good-at/">Web components are great at leaf nodes</a>.</li>
<li>For presentational components that wrap other components - The <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> element is fantastic for this, but you could write a basic CSS class instead. The first rule of web components is: <em>Not everything needs to be a web component.</em></li>
<li>For building a design system - <a href="https://nordhealth.design/">They do this too.</a></li>
<li>For progressively enhancing regular ass HTML - <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/11/01/blinded-by-the-light-dom/">Super good at this.</a></li>
<li>When you want to View Source - Most folks don’t care about this anymore but debugging <code>my-button</code> is a lot easier than <code>div.spf50</code> and you don’t have to rely on sourcemaps.</li>
<li>When you want to make a site without build tools - <a href="https://open-wc.org/guides/developing-components/going-buildless/">Build tooling is typically not the starting point</a> for most web component projects.</li>
<li>When building a one-off project - In the same vein as “buildless” components, eliminating dependencies decreases maintenance burdens over the long haul when you have to come back to the project weeks, months, or years later.</li>
<li>For prototyping - More buildless talk, but if you need to get up and going fast, web components zoom.</li>
<li>When you need to keep a low-memory profile - I think you’ll find <a href="https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2024/table_chrome_129.0.6668.58.html">on average your performance floor is much lower with web components</a>, which makes them blazingly fast.</li>
<li>When you need style encapsulation - imho, web components are a little <em>too</em> good at this but good to know <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2021/08/15/does-shadow-dom-improve-style-performance/">Shadow DOM style application is also blazingly fast</a>.</li>
<li>When you want small, atomic template updates - Some  (not all) web component libraries use an html tagged template literal which gives you JSX-like template authoring without a transformer or compiler. <a href="https://youtu.be/Io6JjgckHbg?si=gQ1REfZSsMIPnFxw&amp;t=383">Tagged template literals are also blazingly fast with atomic updates</a> over full component re-renders.</li>
<li>When your components need to exist across different tech stacks - If your company lets departments pick their own tech stack or your company acquires other companies and you need a bit of UI consistency between projects, web components are a great choice.</li>
<li>When you’re demoing an accessibility pattern, animation, or CSS-Trick - Why not package it in a web component so people can pick it up and drop it into their project? These puppies are hyper-distributable.</li>
<li>When you make a third-party embed widget - If you need <a href="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/spicy-iframes.png">a spicy <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></a>, web components do that and the style encapsulation of the Shadow DOM would probably make your life easier with less code.</li>
<li>When you want to build big applications - You can build <a href="https://web.dev/articles/ps-on-the-web">Photoshop with web components</a>. Companies build apps with web components every day. And they use Shadow DOM.</li>
<li>When you have designers who can code - Most designers don’t have an appetite or ability to spin up a whole dev environment, but you might be able to convince some to write HTML in a CodePen. If your designer is cool with spinning up a local dev environment, pay them more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The not-so great parts</h2>
<p>No technology is perfect so here are some of the rough edges of web components, where people commonly have trouble, or where I’ve found them to not be the best abstraction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadow DOM - I think everyone’s first encounter with the Shadow DOM ends in catastrophe. It can be confusing and even smart people I know have beef with it. I can say that the more you work with it the more intuitive it becomes, but Shadow DOM does have some gotcha moments that can be frustrating.</li>
<li>SSR - <a href="https://www.spicyweb.dev/web-components-ssr-node/">You can SSR web components</a> using Declarative Shadow DOM, but there’s not a lot of literature out there which leads me to believe it’s either kludgy, too library-specific, or both. If this is a non-starter for you, check out <a href="https://enhance.dev/">Enhance</a> which does this out of the box.</li>
<li>Pages - You can use a web component as your page-level abstraction and leverage some kind of <a href="https://github.com/vaadin/router">web component-based router</a>… but you’re probably better off keeping it simple and using server generated HTML as your page-level abstraction.</li>
<li>Accessibility - There’s been some long standing issues with Cross-Root ARIA (e.g. associating a label in the document with an input inside a shadow root). Workarounds exist but the good news is that <a href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/reference-target-explainer.md"><code>referencetarget</code></a> is rolling out in Chromium and solves this problem. Hopefully other browsers pick it up soon.</li>
<li>Making a compiler for your JS framework - This is another post entirely, but I can say that over the last couple weeks I’ve had about three years worth of Community Group discussions. Hopefully some ombudsman-ship and progress can happen here.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, your mileage may vary. Ultimately the technologies you choose probably come down to <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/link/why-were-breaking-up-with-css-in-js/">what’s cool at the time</a>, <a href="https://alexsexton.com/blog/2014/11/the-monty-hall-rewrite">what people <em>think</em> solves their problems</a>, and what your team and decision makers feel comfortable with at the time. That said, in the year 2024 of our <small>LORD</small>, despite the apparent limitations I do think these are scenarios where web components are a great fit.</p>

That’s not what they’re doing. Some of the people working there have good hearts and mean well, but Meta is a huge company, competing with other huge companies, and the goals of the Fediverse do not show up in their roadmap.

I got a notice that Threads had deleted one of my posts because they said it violated their rules. They thought I was claiming to have written something I had not written. I didn't keep the notice (it popped up when I signed on). I shrugged it off when I got it, but then realized that we are very far away from the web. It has been turned into Disneyland where the cops are algorithms and they err on the side of stopping innocent things. I was just passing on a <a href="https://rohan.ga/blog/early-internet/">link to someone else's blog</a>, something I thought an informed person would want to know about (that's the idea behind every link I share). We really do need to dig our way out of this hole, again. This is of course no better than Twitter or Facebook. Not a place to get work done.

It's amazing that the million-plus Americans who died from Covid during Trump's tenure aren't even mentioned as a campaign issue. Maybe people don't want to be reminded of those dark days.

## The Mets came to play

date: 2024-10-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/18/grimace.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Last night the Mets were eliminated by the Dodgers playing in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>And I don't know about you but I'm really happy with how the season turned out. I didn't think the Mets would make it through any of the hurdles, making the playoffs, and beating the Brewers and Phillies. That was amazing. And the energy of this team, their humor and inventiveness, professionalism and perseverance. The Mets of 2024 were a great team, and they give us something to look forward to in 2025. </p>
<p>People say Mets pitchers walked too many Dodgers, but the walks were a result of discipline on the part of the Dodgers hitters. Most pitchers throw a lot of crap, and the hitters swing at it. The Dodgers are more discerning. If the Mets pitchers had thrown strikes they would have hit home runs. It's another way of saying that the Dodgers, no matter how much we despise them, this year at least, were the better team.</p>
<p>And there is a silver lining. I wasn't sure I wanted the Mets to beat the Dodgers once we knew the team from the "other" league was going to be the Jankees. Last time the Mets played them in the World Series, they beat us in Shea Stadium and as a result we had to tear it down and start over. I don't think any of us wanted that, or even to risk having to tear down Citi Field. I don't like to be reminded that the Jankees even exist, much less be forced to watch them play. And honestly between the Dodgers and the other NY team, I want them <i>both</i> to lose. Is there any way to arrange that? I don't even want to know. </p>
<p>Anyway thanks to the Mets for being such a wonderful team, a constant inspiration. So onward. Next year. And now..</p>

## AI and the SEC Whistleblower Program

date: 2024-10-21, updated: 2024-10-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Tax farming is the practice of licensing tax collection to private contractors. Used heavily in ancient Rome, it’s largely <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/social-science-history/article/abs/perils-of-privatization/ED0CC74ECD0C79B068BB3CE233932B04">fallen out of practice</a> because of the obvious <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/11909/chapter-abstract/161083634">conflict of interest</a> between the state and the contractor. Because tax farmers are primarily interested in short-term revenue, they have no problem abusing taxpayers and making things worse for them in the long term. Today, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is engaged in a modern-day version of tax farming. And the potential for abuse will grow when the farmers start using artificial intelligence...</p>

## MNT Pocket Reform update

date: 2024-10-21, from: Jirka's blog

I got my Pocket for my (another) bussines trip. Before the trip I tried to  fix  some stuff.  The  first  was the  keyboard  layout.  I had  to reinstall my system in August (my  fault: I run the Debian unstable and ignored the warning about bug related  to kernel modules) and from that point the original  "EurKey" layout. No big loss as  the only important symbol was  missing (the tilde). Anyway,  I have fixed it  by replacing the "us" by the  "eur" in the $(HOME)/.config/sway/config.d/input file. Anyway, configuration of 2 layouts and  usual way to configure keys for shifting them (xkb_options) haven't work for me for same reasons.

I did a <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/10/20/warningMuskCouldPushTrumpOverTheTop.html">podcast</a> this morning about the reality of Musk owning Twitter, which is now completely settling in. He might have enough influence on the election to push Trump over. He wins even if Trump loses, he gets a moon mission project to boot up a Musk Party. It's coming for sure, either way. Probably will pick up what's left over after Trump, who clearly is losing it, and even if he's president, someone else will be pulling the strings. I can't imagine the billionaire will let JD Vance do it. And by "billionaire" I mean Musk.

I guess we're in a very small minority. We can use a much better twitter-like system than the people who use mobile devices to tweet. I'm one of the desktop people. So I want <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. Mobile people either don't care or don't want it. So it stands to reason we need a different user interface. We can use the same network, we just need a different UI for editing. Since the twitter-like systems already carry links to stories written by people on desktops, there's room in their pipes for our writing too. And it can work more efficiently if the stories are part of the message as opposed to living off-site. Think of it as a web of writing. A writer's web that also carries short messages.

It's possible the Dodgers let the Mets win as I <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/18.html#a144749">begged</a> them to yesterday, but it's also possible the Mets just <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/live/dodgers-vs-mets-new-york-bats-come-alive-in-game-5-sending-series-back-to-los-angeles-201027428.html">crushed</a> the Dodgers, but either way, the Mets are still in it. The series is now 3-2, and returns to Los Angeles tomorrow. So we don't have to tear down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field">Citi Field</a> after all. If the Dodgers win it'll be in their own stadium. The Mets were magnificent! Absolutely inspiring. A three-run home run by Alonso started things off. Everyone got on base. Doubles and triples. It wasn't without the concern that our wonderful and lovable Mets would do the usual Mets thing and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, but they held out. The final score was 12-6. We're still in it. Lets go Mets!
