Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 PM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS
OF FAR NORTHERN NEBRASKA...EXTREME NORTHWEST IOWA...EASTERN SOUTH
DAKOTA...SOUTHERN/CENTRAL MINNESOTA...AND FAR WESTERN WISCONSIN...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected to evolve within a zone extending from
the northern/central High Plains eastward to Wisconsin Monday
afternoon into the nighttime hours. Large to very large hail, and
swaths of severe, potentially damaging, gusts are expected,
especially across South Dakota into Minnesota.  A few severe storms
producing strong gusts and hail are also expected across southern
New England.

...South Dakota into MN/WI and vicinity...

An upper shortwave trough will develop east/northeast from the
Intermountain West to the Dakotas on Monday. This will flatten the
upper ridge over the Upper Midwest and a belt of enhanced
southwesterly mid/upper flow (50-60 kt at 500 mb) will overspread
the region. By late afternoon, 700 mb flow is expected to increase
to around 40-50 kt. Vertical wind profiles, and effective shear
magnitudes increasing to greater than 40 kt, will support supercell
thunderstorms. 

At the surface, a cold front will extend from northern MN
southwestward into western SD during the morning. The front will
develop southeast through the day and into the evening, becoming
positioned from western WI/IA to the NE/KS border by Tuesday
morning. Ahead of the front, a very moist airmass (upper 60s to mid
70s F dewpoints) will be in place across portions of MN/WI/IA and
eastern SD, while a dryslot will be oriented over NE nosing into far
southeast SD/western IA. With increasing ascent through the day, and
persistent low-level warm advection, MLCIN should gradually erode.
MLCAPE values across warm/moist sector are forecast as high as
3000-5000 J/kg, decreasing with southwest extent into the drier
airmass. Steep midlevel lapse rates will within the strong to
extremely unstable airmass will support robust updrafts, and initial
supercell thunderstorms are expected to develop along the cold front
from SD into MN. Large to very large (isolated stones greater than 2
inches diameter) will be possible. While damaging gusts will also be
possible with cellular activity, one or more bowing segments/MCSs
are expected to develop into the evening hours as convection shifts
northeast across eastern SD/MN and eventually WI. As this occurs,
potential for severe/damaging wind swaths will increase and a few
gusts greater than 65 kt/75 mph are possible. Tornado potential is a
bit more uncertain, but would likely be locally increased near and
east of the surface low where low-level flow will remain more
southeasterly. This will enhance low-level SRH and frontal
convergence and a few tornadoes are possible with either supercells
or within mesovortex formation along bowing segments.

...Northern/Central High Plains...

Within the drier boundary-layer across southeast MT/eastern WY
southward into eastern CO/western KS/western NE, scattered
thunderstorms are expected to develop as the main upper trough
overspreads the area during the afternoon. High-based thunderstorms 
amid steep low-level lapse rates will pose a risk for
strong/isolated severe outflow winds. Isolated large hail also is
possible, mainly from eastern WY into western SD/NE.

...New England and portions of the Upper OH Valley/Mid-Atlantic...

Modestly enhanced deep-layer northwesterly flow on the back side of
an upper trough will overspread the region. Pockets of 60 F
dewpoints and cool temperatures aloft will support modest
destabilization during the afternoon and thunderstorm bands/clusters
are expected. Locally strong gusts will be possible with the
activity. Isolated large hail also may be possible, especially over
southern New England where forecast hodographs show more favorable
vertical shear and elongated/straight hodographs.

changes were needed with this update.

..Weinman.. 08/25/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level trough is forecast to shift from the Northern
Rockies into the Northern Plains Day 2/Monday. As this occurs,
enhanced deep-layer flow is forecast to overspread portions of
Wyoming near the base of the aforementioned trough, which will
promote dry and breezy conditions. While locally elevated fire
weather conditions are probable -- mainly during the afternoon with
boundary-layer mixing -- fire weather conditions appear too
spotty/brief to introduce an Elevated area at this time.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1156 AM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

Based on the latest observational data and high-resolution guidance,
an Elevated area was added over portions of southwest/central Utah
with this update. Here, breezy southwesterly surface winds
(sustained 20-25 mph) will overlap 15-20 percent RH ahead of a cold
front this afternoon. Despite slightly cooler temperatures and
higher RH than previous days, the breezy/gusty winds amid a couple
ongoing fire incidents warrant the highlights. Elsewhere, the
previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Weinman.. 08/25/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level trough is forecast to gradually shift from the
Northern Great Basin into the Northern Rockies through tonight.
Ascent associated with the trough should foster isolated to widely
scattered thunderstorms this afternoon/evening across portions of
Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, and Nevada. While a mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms is expected, fast-moving thunderstorms atop receptive
fuels may promote new ignitions, especially along the periphery of
any heavier thunderstorm precipitation cores. In addition, gusty and
erratic outflow winds are possible with the strongest storms. Please
see the SPC Day 1 Convective Outlook for more information on the
nearby severe thunderstorm risk across portions of Wyoming.

Day 1 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1138 AM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Valid 251630Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN PLAINS/UPPER MIDWEST AND CENTRAL ROCKIES...

CORRECTED FOR NDFD THUNDER

...SUMMARY...
Severe wind gusts and hail are most probable today over parts of the
Four Corners to southwestern Wyoming, and this evening over portions
of the eastern Dakotas and western Minnesota.

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop along/ahead of the
cold front and near a South Dakota surface wave, primarily this
evening after 00Z/7pm CDT, although enough moistening and heating
may occur for isolated late-afternoon development. Some supercells
and bowing lines/clusters are expected, with large hail and severe
wind gusts possible.

Intensifying thunderstorm development should occur as the front
encounters what is left of a diurnally well-heated and
still-unstable boundary-layer airmass. Forecast soundings indicate
the moist layer should deepen through the day beneath strong capping
and steep mid-level lapse rates, MLCAPE in the 3000-4000 J/kg range
possible. This will occur with gradually strengthening
west-southwesterly winds aloft with 30-45 kt effective shear.

Additional severe storms may occur late this afternoon into evening
within an evolving post-frontal environment across northeast Wyoming
into northwest South Dakota/southwest North Dakota, with moderate
buoyancy and very long/straight hodographs potentially supporting
storms capable of hail and possibly severe-caliber wind gusts.

...Central/southern Rockies...
Scattered thunderstorms are ongoing early today across eastern Utah
and western Colorado in advance of an upper-level trough centered
over Nevada. A greater coverage and intensity of storms should occur
into the afternoon as the boundary layer further warms/destabilizes.
Relatively strong mid/high-level southwesterlies will support ample
deep-layer/effective shear, with supercells and bowing clusters
possible in a corridor spanning portions of the Four Corners area to
northern Colorado/southwest Wyoming. Elongated and semi-straight
hodographs will support large-hail potential aside from a broader
regional risk for severe-caliber wind gusts.

...South-central High Plains...
Scattered slow-moving thunderstorms are expected this afternoon
particularly across eastern Colorado and northeast New Mexico.
Hot/well-mixed boundary layers within the pre-convective environment
will support the possibility of strong to locally severe-caliber
wind gusts through late afternoon until around sunset.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251627Z - 251830Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying renewed thunderstorm development is possible
across much of eastern Utah by 1-2 PM MDT.  Widely scattered
stronger storms may pose a risk for severe hail and wind while
spreading northeastward and eastward through late afternoon.  While
it is still not yet certain that a severe weather watch will be
needed, trends are being monitored for this possibility.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of a seasonably vigorous short wave trough
slowly progressing east-northeastward through the Great Basin, a
narrow band of large-scale ascent continues to gradually spread east
of the Wasatch.  This is in the wake of initial low-level warm
advection driven convection now spreading spreading northeastward
through the Colorado and adjacent Wyoming Rockies, with insolation
across a relatively moist boundary layer over much of eastern Utah
contributing to increasing destabilization.

Through 18-20Z, models suggest that mixed-layer CAPE may increase to
500-1000 J/kg, coincident with further strengthening of south to
southwesterly mid/upper wind fields (including 30-70+ kt in the
700-300 mb layer).  As new thunderstorm development begins to
initiate, it appears that this regime will become potentially
conducive to evolution of isolated supercells.  In addition to
posing a risk for large hail, stronger storms may become capable of
producing locally severe wind gusts, particularly as they spread
across the more strongly heated and deeply mixed lower elevations
through late afternoon.

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
500 AM HST Sun Aug 25 2024

Over the last 6 hours, Gilma's eye has continued to be present on 
most of the infrared and proxy vis images. However, the eye has 
become a bit more cloud-filled, and the convection over the 
southwestern eyewall is slightly less robust. Although the CI 
numbers from TAFB and SAB are still T-6.0/115 kt, the respective 
Final T numbers are lower than that. Recent UW-CIMSS objective 
intensity estimates range from 84 to 113 kt. Based on a blend of the 
subjective and objective intensity estimates, the initial intensity 
is nudged down slightly to 110 kt for this advisory.

Gilma is currently moving very near the 26C isotherm and is located 
in an environment of low vertical wind shear. The middle troposphere 
is fairly dry in the environment surrounding Gilma, but the cyclone 
has been able to prevent the dry air from entraining into the center 
enough to significantly disrupt the hurricane. The environmental 
conditions are not forecast to become more conducive for 
strengthening. Westerly vertical wind shear is forecast to increase 
slightly by late tonight or early Monday. SSTs should decrease 
slightly along the path of Gilma by late Monday or Monday night. 
Based on these factors, only slow weakening is forecast for the next 
24 h followed by more steady weakening after that. The confidence in 
the intensity forecast seems slightly below average in the 
short-term while Gilma straddles the 26C SST isotherm and remains in 
relatively low shear. In the 24 to 96 h time frame, Gilma should be 
weakening, but the rate at which it weakens is a bit uncertain. By 
day 4, vertical wind shear increases to moderate to strong, making 
it likely that Gilma should be significantly weaker in the 4- to 
5-day time frame. Gilma is forecast to lose its convection and 
become a remnant low by day 5. The NHC intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous one, perhaps showing a slightly slower rate of 
weakening in the 36-72 h period, closer to the latest intensity 
consensus guidance.

Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 275/8 kt. A 
strengthening mid-tropospheric subtropical ridge situated to the 
north of the hurricane should steer Gilma on a westward to 
west-northwestward track through the forecast period. The official 
forecast is nearly unchanged from the previous advisory and is close 
to a blend of the TVCE and GFEX.

Hurricane Hone Discussion Number  13
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Hone is passing by around 40 nautical miles south of South Point on 
the Big Island of Hawaii this morning, where it is within radar 
range. Combined radar, and data from an Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft mission earlier this morning, support 
raising the initial intensity of Hone to 75 knots, keeping it a 
Category 1 Hurricane. Despite recent subjective Dvorak estimates 
suggesting a slightly lower intensity, the satellite presentation 
has evolved markedly overnight, with cold cloud tops near -75 C 
reinforcing the radar and aircraft-based intensities. The initial 
intensity is raised to 75 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion of Hone is set at 280/07. This westward 
trajectory is expected to persist over the coming days, influenced 
by a subtropical ridge to the north. However, as Hone remains near 
the Big Island through the early morning hours today, the 
mountainous terrain could influence local steering currents, 
potentially leading to localized and short-term deviations in the 
storm's motion and intensity. As we move into the early to mid 
portion of the week, Hone is projected to encounter increasing 
vertical wind shear, which is expected to weaken the storm and make 
it more shallow. This change in conditions will allow the low-level 
trade wind flow to steer the system toward the west-southwest. The 
official forecast track remains nearly identical to the previous 
advisory and is closely aligned with the tightly clustered consensus 
guidance.
 
Environmental conditions affecting Hone will remain steady over the 
next 12 to 24 h, with sea surface temperatures between 26 C and 27 
C, light to moderate vertical wind shear, and sufficient mid-level 
moisture. This supports maintaining a steady trend in intensity 
through the morning hours today. Although sea surface temperatures 
are forecast to rise to around 27 C tonight and beyond as Hone 
continues westward, increasing vertical wind shear will translate to 
a gradual weakening trend later today through the middle of the 
week. The intensity forecast closely follows dynamical consensus 
guidance.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm conditions will continue on the Big Island through 
the morning hours. Winds are expected to be strongest downslope of 
higher terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
2. Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 6 to 12
inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the Big
Island, with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall totals of 2
to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller islands,
mainly windward.
 
3. Swells generated by Hone will continue today as this system 
continues westward. Expect dangerous conditions with 
life-threatening surf and rip currents.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
FOUR CORNERS TO SOUTHWESTERN WYOMING...AND OVER PORTIONS OF WESTERN
MINNESOTA AND THE EASTERN DAKOTAS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe gusts and hail are most probable today over parts of the Four
Corners to southwestern Wyoming, and this evening over portions of
western Minnesota and the eastern Dakotas.

...Synopsis...
A seasonally well-amplified mid/upper-level pattern will persist
over the CONUS, but with some important changes due to the
progression of embedded synoptic- to subsynoptic-scale features.  An
intermittently closed cyclone now over north-central NV will eject
slowly northeastward to southeastern ID through the period, while
devolving to an open-wave trough.  By 12Z tomorrow, the full trough
should extend from the MT Rockies southward through the remnant
low's vorticity max, then southwestward to southern NV.

Meanwhile, a broad anticyclone -- initially centered over northern
OK/southern KS -- will move northeastward, with the 500-mb high over
central MO by 12Z, and ridging north-northeastward across Lake
Superior.  The northward component of this shift should occur partly
in response to a well-defined low/trough in the subtropical
easterlies, now evident over the north-central to southwestern Gulf.
This feature should move ashore on the lower/middle TX Coast around
the end of the period.  Northeast of the high, a strong shortwave
trough now over northwestern QC will dig south-southeastward through
tonight, reaching the St. Lawrence Valley and approaching northern
NY by 12Z.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a persistent, very slowly
frontolytic, quasistationary boundary from just offshore of the
Carolinas to the north-central Gulf Coast, becoming a diffuse warm
front over astern parts of TX/OK.  Rich low-level moisture has
returned northward near this boundary in OK/AR and farther north
across parts of the central/northern Plains.  A low was drawn north
of MIB, with cold front southwestward across the northwestern corner
area of SD, into north-central WY.  By 00Z, the front should reach
from near the MN/ND/MB border confluence across the eastern Dakotas,
parts of north-central/southwestern NE and near CYS.  The front
should proceed overnight to a 12Z position from northeastern MN to
the FSD/SUX vicinity, central NE and eastern CO.

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop along/ahead of the
cold front -- predominantly after 00Z, though enough moistening/
heating may occur for isolated late-afternoon development. 
Supercells and bowing lines/clusters will be possible, offering
large hail and severe gusts.

Activity should occur as the front encounters what is left of a
diurnally well-heated and still-unstable boundary-layer airmass,
with only minimal diabatic cooling, due to the presence of rich
moisture near the surface,  Surface dewpoints already are commonly
in the 70s F in a swath of the warm sector with 11Z axis from
north-central ND south-southeastward across eastern portions of
SD/NE/KS and the Arklatex region.  Forecast soundings indicate the
moist layer should deepen through the day beneath strong capping,
and steep midlevel lapse rates.  With a deep troposphere still
present over this area, atop the favorably unstable boundary layer,
MLCAPE in the 3000-4000 J/kg range will be possible.  This will be
collocated with slowly strengthening flow aloft, such that 30-45-kt
effective-shear magnitudes will be possible from late afternoon
through the evening.

...Central/southern Rockies and vicinity, south-central Plains...
Scattered showers and thunderstorms, with at least isolated
strong-severe gust potential, should become common by this afternoon
in a vast, roughly triangular area in and near the outlook, from
western NM and eastern AZ to parts of southeastern MT and southern
KS.  Within that area, the greatest potential for severe should be
on the western fringes, with supercells and bowing clusters possible
in a corridor spanning portions of the Four Corners area to
southwestern WY.  In that region, the greatest diurnal
destabilization will overlap the most favorable deep-layer lapse
rates, and strengthening vertical shear ahead of the progressive
western trough.

Mid/upper-level moisture-channel imagery, available GPS PW data, and
surface analysis show a persistent plume of deep-layer monsoonal
moisture, maintaining some continuity from the ITCZ well south of
mainland MX, across parts of west-central MX and Chihuahua, to NM,
CO, WY and western NE.  Enough low-level moisture (PW above 1 inch
in some areas) to support organized convective potential extends
farther westward over the Four Corners area, especially into
northeastern AZ, eastern UT and western CO.  Forecast soundings in
that corridor show favorable deep shear for supercells, with
effective-shear magnitudes in the 40-55-kt range, and elongated,
rather straight low/middle-level hodographs favoring a large-hail
threat, in addition to the broader severe-gust potential.

Farther east, much of the higher terrain across the "marginal" area
will reach convective temperature relatively early in the
diurnal-heating cycle, with little CINH, resulting in abundant
development, slowing the pace of additional destabilization.  Still,
isolated strong/briefly severe gusts may occur, especially where
north-northeastward moving clusters of convection encounter pockets
of well-mixed boundary layer suitable for intense downdrafts. 
Farther east onto the High Plains, more-favorable heating/mixing
will occur, but with weak shear nearer to the mid/upper high.
