Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 221300Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
The greatest threat for severe gusts and hail appears to be over
parts of the central High Plains this afternoon and evening.

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified pattern in mid/upper levels will persist through
the period, but with some weakening noted for both mean troughing
near the East Coast, and a central CONUS ridge extending northward
from a high over west TX.  Southwest flow over the Intermountain
West will strengthen and back somewhat in response to slow
southeastward movement of an intense cyclone -- now centered west of
the northern OR Coast --- while a strong shortwave trough pivots
through its southern semicircle and onshore the northern CA coast by
the end of the period.

Farther east, on the periphery of that southwest flow, a shortwave
trough (with some incorporation of a Sonoran MCV from 24 hours
earlier) was apparent in moisture-channel imagery over northern AZ
and southern UT.  This perturbation should eject northeastward over
western CO by 00Z, then into the central Plains overnight, perhaps
with some further convective-vorticity reinforcement then.  To the
north, closely spaced shortwave troughs now over south-central SK
and parts of ND/southeastern SK should pivot eastward across the
rest of ND, northern MN and southern/central MB through the period.

At the surface, a quasistationary frontal zone from northern FL
across the northern Gulf Coast, east/north TX and the TX Panhandle
should remain near that position through the period, with the
richest low-level moisture remaining to its south.  However, gradual
moisture return of more incompletely modified (yet still
convectively sufficient) character is apparent up the High Plains
from the Panhandles across western NE to the central Dakotas.  This
is east of a lee trough over eastern parts of WY/CO, and a weak cold
front analyzed from north-central ND to western SD.  The latter
front should proceed eastward across the Dakotas and into
northwestern MN through this evening.

...Central High Plains...
Highly variable thunderstorm coverage is expected over this region,
with the greatest density in the 15%/"slight" area, where upscale
evolution of increasingly outflow-driven thunderstorm clusters
should support severe-gust potential this afternoon into evening. 
The primary foci for formation of eventually severe activity should
be the northern Raton Mesa region, Front Range/Sangre de Cristo,
and/or Palmer Divide, with some contribution from the lee trough as
well.

Though far south and east of the stronger flow aloft, sufficient
veering of wind with height is expected to result in effective-shear
magnitude in the 30-40-kt range, indicating potential for some
organized convection.  The boundary layer will remain well-heated/
mixed and deep, with very steep lapse rates, even as moisture/
buoyancy increase eastward.  With surface dewpoints in the mid 50s
to mid 60s F, peak/preconvective MLCAPE should reach 1500-2000 J/kg
(locally higher) in a corridor near and just east of the longitude
of the CO/KS line.  This will foster pulses of strong to isolated
severe gusts in initially discrete to semi-discrete activity atop a
drier boundary layer, becoming better-organized with potential
cold-pool aggregation eastward toward east-central/northeastern CO
and adjoining portions of KS/NE into the higher CAPE.  While
specific shape, size, and track(s) of this clustering still depend
on mesoscale details, enough consensus/confidence is now apparent in
the general area of greatest severe-wind potential to ratchet up
unconditional probabilities a level.  With MLCINH increasing
eastward from about the KS/CO border longitude and nocturnal
near-surface cooling, the severe threat should weaken eastward from
northwestern KS and southwestern NE tonight.

...Eastern Great Basin and vicinity...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are possible this
afternoon into early evening, offering strong to isolated severe
gusts and marginally severe hail.  After the shortwave trough and
related precip now over parts of this region shifts northeastward,
most of the day should remain for diabatic heating/destabilization
of the higher terrain across the region, with airmass recovery
furthered by warm/theta-e advection from the south.  In concert with
available monsoonal moisture, a roughly meridional plume of
essentially uninhibited MLCAPE in the 500-1500 J/kg range should
develop.  This will be superimposed under the southeastern rim of
stronger upper flow related to the West Coast troughing/cyclone. 
The result should be strengthening cloud-layer shear and some
potential for storm organization, as activity moves generally
northeastward over well-mixed boundary layers.

...Upper Midwest...
A large area of clouds and precip -- with widely scattered embedded
thunderstorms -- should proceed eastward today across the remainder
of eastern ND and parts of northern MN near the international
border.  Though the associated lead perturbation now over ND should
be past the area before this afternoon, cyclonic flow aloft should
continue in response to the stronger perturbation farther north,
moving into MB.  As such, little if any hindrance to convective
potential is expected from large-scale subsidence, while the
low-level airmass destabilizes diabatically from surface heating
behind the morning activity.  Isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms may develop along/ahead of the cold front, within a
narrow plume of 1000-2000 J/kg MLCAPE supported by 60s F surface
dewpoints.  Modest low/middle-level flow is expected, through enough
veering with height should develop to support effective-shear
magnitudes locally near 35 kt.  The strongest cells may produce
marginally severe hail or gusts, before convection weakens this
evening.

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
200 AM PDT Thu Aug 22 2024

Gilma has continued to intensify while exhibiting a well-defined 
eye on geostationary satellite imagery, and convective cloud tops 
colder than -70 deg C are evident around the eyewall.   The cloud 
pattern is fairly symmetric in appearance, and upper-level outflow 
is well defined over all quadrants of the circulation.  The current 
intensity estimate is raised to 100 kt based on a subjective Dvorak 
classification from TAFB and various objective estimates from 
UW-CIMSS.  This makes Gilma the first major hurricane of the 2024 
east Pacific season.

Center fixes show a fairly slow forward speed toward the 
west-northwest, with an initial motion estimate of 290/5 kt.  A 
mid-tropospheric trough near the California coast has broken down 
the subtropical ridge to the north of Gilma, resulting in a weaker 
than normal steering current.  Over the next several days, the ridge 
is expected to build back rather slowly, resulting in only a gradual 
increase in the tropical cyclone's forward speed over the forecast 
period.  The official track forecast is about the same as the one 
from the previous NHC advisory, and is near the southern side of the 
model suite.

Some additional strengthening is expected, since the system has a 
well-defined inner core and is in an environment of low shear while 
situated over warm waters.  The short-term intensity forecast 
reflects current trends and is in line with much of the regional 
dynamical hurricane model guidance.  In the next day or two, the 
SSTs below Gilma are expected to gradually decrease.  Later in the 
forecast period, the cyclone will be moving into a drier and more 
stable air mass.  These factors should cause slow weakening, and the 
official intensity forecast is similar to the previous one.  
Overall, the NHC intensity forecast is on the high end of the model 
guidance.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEVADA INTO
WESTERN UTAH AND SOUTHERN IDAHO...

...Synopsis...
A deepening mid-level trough will progress across the Interior West
as upper ridging continues across the Plains to the Eastern Seaboard
tomorrow (Friday). Strong mid-level flow aloft and associated upper
support, amid a deep, dry boundary layer, will foster Elevated to
Critical conditions across the Great Basin, with sustained
southwesterly surface winds approaching 25 mph in spots, and RH
dipping into the 15-20 percent range. Furthermore, upper support
amid adequate buoyancy will promote the development of both wet and
dry thunderstorms across portions of the Pacific Northwest (mainly
central into eastern Oregon). Given receptive fuels in the area,
isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have been added.

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 AM PDT Wed Aug 21 2024
 
This morning, Gilma's structure on satellite has continued to 
improve, with infrared satellite depicting a banding type eye 
appearing intermittently as convection attempts to wrap around the 
estimated center. In addition, we received a 0933 UTC AMSR2 
microwave pass which showed a developing eyewall on both the 89-GHz 
and 37-GHz channels, though with some vertical tilt. The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were both 
T4.5/77-kt, which also matches the latest ADT estimate. Thus, 
Gilma's initial intensity will be raised to 75 kt for this 
advisory. 

Gilma appears to be moving just north of due west, but slower than 
earlier, estimated at 280/6 kt. Over the next few days, a large 
subtropical ridge poleward of the hurricane should continue to steer 
it generally westward to west-northwestward. However, this ridge 
becomes positioned a little farther northwest with time as a subtle 
weakness north of the storm forms, resulting in a 
slower-than-typical forward motion for this part of the Eastern 
Pacific basin. The latest track guidance this cycle is notably 
slower and more equatorward than the previous cycle, and the NHC 
track was shifted in that direction, but not quite as far as the 
reliable track consensus guidance TVCE and HCCA. As mentioned in the 
previous discussion, if these southward trends continue, further 
southward adjustments may be necessary.  

With the improvement of Gilma's inner core structure this morning, 
the hurricane may be poised to intensify more over the next day or 
two. This scenario is shown by the recent hurricane-regional model 
guidance, which shows more intensification than the prior cycle. 
Given the reduction in vertical wind shear noted in the recent SHIPS 
guidance and as Gilma remains over 27-28 C sea-surface temperatures 
for the next 48 h, the NHC intensity forecast now shows 
intensification into a Category 3 hurricane over this time period. 
This intensity forecast is higher than the previous one, but is in 
good agreement with the latest HCCA consensus aid. However there 
remain some hurricane-regional models that show even more 
intensification (e.g., HAFS-A). After 48 h, sea-surface temperatures 
begin to gradually decrease, and slow weakening is expected to begin 
thereafter, though less than the previous advisory due to the 
further south track over warmer ocean waters.

Mesoscale Discussion 1964
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0311 PM CDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Areas affected...southwest into central MT

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 202011Z - 202215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms could produce
strong/damaging gusts and isolated hail into early evening across
parts of southeast into central Montana. Area is being monitored for
possible severe thunderstorm watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
over the higher terrain of southwest Montana. This area has quickly
warmed into the 80s F as earlier cloud cover has shifted northeast.
Additional convection is expected to develop further east near the
Beartooth/Absarokas over the next couple of hours. Collectively this
convection will spread northeast into this evening.

Modest instability, mainly supported by steep midlevel lapse
rates/cool temps aloft, and effective shear magnitudes greater than
35 kt will support organized/robust updrafts. Forecast hodographs
along with regional VWP data also indicate shear favorable for
supercells. Given high-based storms and steepening low-level lapse
rates, strong/damaging gusts are possible with this activity as it
becomes better organized with time and northeastward extent into the
high Plains. A few instances of hail up to 1.25 inch diameter is
also possible. A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed this
afternoon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 641
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
240 PM MDT Tue Aug 20 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest and Central Montana

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 240 PM until
  1000 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will develop over the mountains of southwest
Montana this afternoon and spread quickly eastward across the watch
area through the evening.  Damaging wind gusts are the main threat
with the strongest storms.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles north and south of a line from 20 miles north of
Dillon MT to 125 miles east northeast of Lewistown MT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
25030.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
200 PM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024
 
Gilma has become much better organized throughout the day.  The
center is now embedded in the thunderstorm activity, and the
associated deep convection has been expanding and has a less sheared
appearance.  The Dvorak estimates have increased and are between 45
and 55 kt at 18Z.  Over the past hour or two, a pair of ASCAT passes
showed reliable winds in the 50-55 kt range.  Based on the ASCAT
data and the improving satellite appearance, the initial intensity
is increased to 60 kt.
 
Gilma is moving westward or 280 degrees at 10 kt.  A high pressure
ridge situated to the north of the storm should cause it to continue
westward to west-northwestward at about the same speed for another
day or so.  However, after that time, a decrease in forward speed
and a slight turn to the right are expected as the ridge weakens and
is replaced by a broad trough.  The NHC track forecast has again
been nudged to the south, toward the latest consensus aids.
 
The improving cloud pattern suggests that the vertical wind shear
around Gilma is lessening.  In addition, the storm is forecast to
remain over warm waters and in a relatively moist airmass for a few
days.  Therefore, continued steady strengthening is predicted, and
Gilma is expected to become a hurricane tonight or early Wednesday
with additional strengthening anticipated through Thursday.  By the
end of the week, however, the cyclone is expected to track over
cooler waters and into a more stable airmass, which should induce a
weakening trend.  The NHC intensity forecast is nudged upward from
the previous one and near the high end of the model guidance.
 
The initial 34- and 50-kt wind radii have been updated using the
aforementioned ASCAT data.

Valid 202000Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
CENTRAL MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm winds and large hail are possible today, mainly
over parts of Montana.

...Montana and the High Plains...
The previous forecast remains on track with only minor modifications
made to the Marginal risk/wind probabilities across southwest MT to
account for developing convection within a deeply-mixed environment.
See the previous discussion for additional details regarding the
severe risk across Montana, and MCD #1963 for recent convective
trends regarding CO/NM.

...South Carolina Coast...
A targeted Marginal risk was considered for the immediate SC coast
where convection is developing along a sea breeze boundary. The
thermodynamic and kinematic environment along the coast appears
conducive for a few strong, to perhaps severe, storms. However,
longevity of initial cells appears limited based on regional radar
imagery, and recent high-res guidance suggests any threat will
remain very localized to mainly coastal counties. Given these
concerns, risk highlights were withheld.

..Moore.. 08/20/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1108 AM CDT Tue Aug 20 2024/

...MT...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a progressive shortwave trough and
associated mid/upper level speed max rotating across NV/ID.  Lift
associated with this system will overspread the mountains of
ID/southwest MT this afternoon, where increasing mid-level moisture
and strong heating will lead to scattered thunderstorm development.
As these storms move off the higher terrain, they will encounter a
deeply mixed and marginally unstable air mass.  Steep low-level
lapse rates and favorably strong westerly mid-level winds will favor
damaging wind gusts or perhaps hail with the more intense clusters
of storms.  Activity will spread into eastern MT during the evening
and slowly weaken as diurnal cooling ensues.

...CO/NM...
A persistent upper ridge remains over NM, with several weak
perturbations rotating around the top of the ridge across UT/CO. 
Widely scattered high-based thunderstorms are expected to develop
across central/southern CO later this afternoon and spread slowly
eastward into the Plains.  A few of the storms may produce gusty
winds or hail.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms with hail and a few marginally severe gusts will be
possible on Thursday across parts of the central and northern
Plains.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
On Thursday, an upper high will be situated over the central and
southern Plains with the ridge extending northward into the upper
Great Lakes. A slow-moving upper low will remain over New England,
while a larger-scale upper trough develops along the Pacific Coast.

At the surface, a trough will extend from the Dakotas into the
southern High Plains, providing weak convergence. High pressure will
remain over much of the East, resulting in only a narrow plume of
60s F dewpoints in the vicinity of the surface trough.

Remnant storms will likely exist early in the day over ND, and they
may persist into northern MN during the day. Southerly 850 mb winds
around 30-40 kt will maintain theta-e advection into the region,
supporting mainly non-severe storms as instability will weaken to
the east.

Later in the day, heating near the wind shift, where modest
instability will develop. Widely scattered storms should result, as
far southwest as eastern CO where shear will be weak. Storms over
the northern plains may be impacted by the passage of the early day
wave, suggesting sparse storm coverage. However, favorable time of
day may yield locally severe gust along with hail, as instability is
maximized.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1227 PM CDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN
MONTANA INTO WESTERN NORTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms, some with severe hail and damaging gusts 
are expected to develop on Wednesday over parts of far eastern
Montana and western North Dakota.

...Synopsis...
On Wednesday, an upper high will be centered over NM with a ridge
extending north across the Plains. Meanwhile, a positive-tilt upper
trough from MT to the Great Basin will move eastward, resulting in
gradually lowering heights across the northern Rockies and Plains. 
To the east, a deep upper low will move very slowly from NY into
northern New England. Generally cool air aloft will extend south
across much of the East, where winds aloft will remain weak.

At the surface, high pressure will be centered over the upper Great
Lakes, with generally dry and stable conditions over much of the MS
and OH Valleys and extending eastward to the Mid Atlantic. A plume
of 60s F dewpoints will remain west of the surface high and ahead of
a developing trough from eastern MT southward across the High
Plains. 

As various embedded disturbances round the upper ridge and move
across MT, WY, and the Dakotas, scattered strong and a few severe
storms are anticipated as cooling aloft and increasing flow interact
with the instability plume.

...Northern Rockies/Plains...
Scattered storms will develop over the higher terrain of southwest
MT by 20Z, and spread northeastward into central MT. Gusty winds
will be likely with this activity, but marginal hail will also be
possible as deep-layer shear will be strong and the storms will
encounter increasing moisture with eastward extent. 

By late afternoon and into the evening, some upscale growth is
possible along outflow surges, with indications of a cluster or MCS
developing over far eastern MT after 02Z. Damaging wind and hail
would be likely with this activity, as it interacts with low 60s F
dewpoints and southeast low-level winds/inflow. 

Farther south, additional widely spaced storm clusters are expected
from eastern WY into CO. While these regions will be closer to the
upper ridge and thus have less shear, ample lapse rates and
instability will still favor severe gusts and hail locally, with
storms generally dwindling by 06Z from central SD into western KS.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 AM PDT Tue Aug 20 2024

Deep convection has increased significantly over the past several 
hours, but the center is located near the northeastern edge of the 
thunderstorms.  This asymmetric structure is due to 15-20 kt of 
northeasterly vertical wind shear.  The objective and subjective 
Dvorak estimates range from 35 to 55 kt, and based on that data, 
the initial intensity is held at 45 kt.  However, this estimate 
could be a little conservative based on recent satellite trends.

Gilma's motion has been somewhat erratic, but smoothing through the 
wobbles yields an initial motion estimate of 285/10 kt.  A high 
pressure ridge situated to the north of the storm should cause that 
motion to continue for another day or so.  However, after that 
time, a decrease in forward speed is expected as the ridge weakens 
and is replaced by a broad trough.  The models have trended south 
this cycle, and the NHC track forecast has been nudged in that 
direction.

The ongoing northeasterly vertical wind shear is expected to 
decrease and become fairly low during the next few days.  This more 
conducive upper-level wind pattern combined with warm SSTs and high 
moisture should allow Gilma to steadily strengthen through the rest 
of the week.  Gilma is forecast to reach hurricane strength by 
Wednesday night and could reach its peak intensity a day later.  By 
the end of the week, the cyclone is expected to track over cooler 
waters and into a more stable airmass, which should induce a 
weakening trend.  The NHC intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous one.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0457 PM CDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

Omega blocking over the central CONUS is forecast to remain through
the majority of the extended forecast period. On the western flank
of the block, mid-level troughing will persist over parts of the
West Coast into next weekend. Enhanced flow aloft, with several
embedded shortwave troughs will support periodic dry and breezy
conditions over parts of the Northwest and Great Basin. Toward the
end of the week, a strong upper low will move south along the coast
supporting an increase in thunderstorm potential, along with
continued dry and breezy conditions over the Great Basin. Elevated
to potentially critical fire-weather conditions are possible.

...Northwest and Great Basin...
Moderate southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to remain in place
over the western US through much of the week. With stronger flow
aloft overspreading a warm and dry air mass across parts of the
southern Northwest and Great Basin, dry and windy conditions are
possible through midweek. Elevated to critical fire-weather
conditions are possible over parts of NV, UT and into southern OR/ID
through D5/Friday. Confidence in stronger sustained winds
overlapping critical RH and dry fuels is somewhat limited currently,
though the approach of the upper low/trough is expected to support
potentially higher gusts over much of the Southwest D4/Thursday and
into the weekend.

Increasing monsoon moisture is also expected over parts of the
Western US beginning D4/Thursday. Medium-range guidance shows a
plume of 0.6 to 0.8 inch PWATs moving into the Pacific Northwest
ahead of the upper low. Some dry lightning will be possible with
isolated to widely scattered storms through D6/Saturday. Confidence
is highest that dry thunder probabilities could be needed over parts
of northern and central OR through the end of the work week.
However, the exact storm coverage and overlap with the best fuels
remains uncertain.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
200 PM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

ASCAT data valid at 1644 UTC showed that Gilma has strengthened 
slightly and its wind field has grown a little. While the tropical 
storm is still sheared, maximum winds measured by the ASCAT were 
between 40 and 45 kt, which after accounting for undersampling 
supports an intensity around 50 kt. An average of the most recent 
Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB also yields 50 kt, so that is the 
intensity estimate for this advisory. The maximum extent of 34 kt 
winds is estimated to be around 70 n mi based on the ASCAT data, 
mostly to the southwest in the deep convection.

Although the track forecast spread in the model guidance remains 
unusually high, not much change was made to the NHC forecast, except 
to show a slightly faster forward motion in 24-48 h. Otherwise, 
Gilma is still expected to slow down and turn west-northwestward 
within the next day as the ridge currently steering the storm is 
gradually eroded by a deep-layer trough off the U.S. west coast. 
There is still quite a bit of difference between the models in the 
forward speed of Gilma, so the NHC forecast closely follows the 
consensus throughout the forecast. 

Only small adjustments were made to the intensity forecast. Gilma 
should remain sheared for another day or so, limiting the potential 
for strengthening during that period.  After that, the shear should 
decrease and Gilma should strengthen.  Most models continue to 
indicate that Gilma will approach hurricane strength later this 
week. The NHC intensity forecast remains very close to the various 
intensity consensus aids.

Tropical Storm Gilma Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
800 AM PDT Mon Aug 19 2024

Recent AMSR and SSMIS imagery indicate that Gilma's center is 
located near the northeast edge of its deep convection, with little 
deep convection present in its northeast quadrant. This is due, at 
least in part, to upper-level easterly winds that are causing some 
shear across the cyclone. A consensus of objective and subjective 
intensity estimates from SAB, TAFB, and UW-CIMSS support an initial 
intensity of 45 kt for this advisory, which also agree well with 
earlier ASCAT data.

The aforementioned wind shear is expected to persist for at least 
another day or two, which should limit the potential for 
strengthening. After around 36 h, global models indicate the shear 
will begin to decrease, which should allow for more strengthening. 
The exact timing of this strengthening is still highly uncertain, 
with several global models suggesting it could begin near the 36 h 
mark, while the HWRF indicates it won't begin to strengthen until 
closer to 60 h. Regardless, there is a good chance that Gilma will 
become a hurricane at some point before the end of the week. No 
significant changes were made to the intensity forecast, which 
follows the HCCA and IVCN intensity models. 

The track forecast is also largely unchanged from the previous NHC 
advisory. Gilma is currently moving west near 12 kt. A ridge 
extending westward from the southwest United States should keep 
Gilma on a similar heading today. After that, the tropical storm 
may interact with another disturbance to its west, while a trough 
off the U.S. west coast will begin to erode the ridge slightly. All 
models indicate that Gilma will generally slow down and turn 
west-northwestward in response to these steering changes, but there 
is unusually high spread in the guidance on the exact track the 
cyclone will take. The NHC track forecast follows the consensus 
aids, but confidence in the specifics of the forecast is lower than 
normal due to the high model spread.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1232 AM CDT Sun Aug 18 2024

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE MIDDLE
ATLANTIC TO THE DEEP SOUTH...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered wind damage will be possible from the Mid-Atlantic States
to the Deep South from mid-afternoon to early evening on Sunday.

...Middle Atlantic to Deep South...

Great Lakes/OH Valley upper trough will shift east today with a
19/00z position forecast along the spine of the Appalachians. Modest
500mb flow should extend within the base of the trough into the
Middle Atlantic. This flow regime will aid the organizational
potential of convection that evolves ahead of the primary synoptic
front. Latest model guidance suggests a weak surface low may develop
over northern VA/MD by late afternoon and this feature should track
into NJ during the overnight hours. While deep-layer flow is not
forecast to be exceptionally strong, 0-6km bulk shear will exceed
30kt within a warm-advection zone. Forecast soundings favor storm
rotation and a few supercells may ultimately evolve across this
region. In addition to damaging wind threat, some risk for hail and
perhaps a brief tornado can be expected.

Trailing front across the Deep South will not be particularly
convergent as it surges into GA-AL-MS. Pre-frontal boundary layer
will be adequately buoyant for robust updrafts and any storms that
evolve ahead of the wind shift will do so within an environment that
favors some organization. Convection will propagate southeast toward
the Gulf Coast as northwesterly flow deepens with trough passage.

...Rockies/Central Plains...

Water-vapor imagery depicts a well-defined short-wave trough topping
the Rockies ridge over western WY at this time. This feature will
track southeast across the central Plains this afternoon as a 500mb
speed max translates into the lower MO Valley. LLJ will respond to
this feature which should contribute to an extensive zone of
elevated convection early in the period. This activity will
propagate southeast along a sharp corridor of warm advection into
eastern KS, then into the lower MS Valley during the overnight
hours. Have increased severe probabilities to account for this
evolution. Primary concern is damaging winds.

...Interior West...

Isolated strong/locally severe thunderstorms will once again develop
across western UT and track north-northeast along the
western/northern periphery of the dominant anticyclone. Gusty winds
are possible with this diurnally enhanced activity.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0745 PM CDT Sat Aug 17 2024

Valid 180100Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ALONG/JUST EAST OF
THE WASHINGTON/OREGON CASCADES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will spread across portions of
southwest Washington this evening. Hail/wind remain possible.
Isolated damaging gusts are also expected with convection across
portions of the southern Appalachians into the Ohio Valley.

...01z Update...

Notable short-wave trough is currently ejecting north across
northern CA into western OR. Water-vapor imagery also suggests a
lead disturbance may be associated with a fairly extensive cluster
of deep convection as it advances across northern OR into southwest
WA. Surface temperatures are holding in the lower 90s across lower
elevations of southern WA east of the Cascades. Latest diagnostic
data suggests a narrow corridor of higher instability extends
along/just east of the Cascades. While convection should
spread/develop north along the higher terrain, northeasterly
low-level flow should contribute to robust updrafts capable of
generating hail/wind.

Northwesterly flow is deepening across the southern Appalachians
early this evening as the upper trough progresses steadily east. A
broken band of organized convection is propagating southeast across
northwestern SC/northern GA through an axis of instability
characterized by 1500 MLCAPE. This activity may produce locally
damaging gusts for the next few hours, but otherwise will gradually
decrease in intensity as boundary layer cools this evening.

More isolated convection is observed across KY into the upper OH
Valley. This activity will also gradually wane in intensity as the
evening progresses and low-level lapse rates weaken. Until then, a
few gusts may be noted.
