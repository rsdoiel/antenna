efficacy of phage Henu10 with antibiotics against Shigella dysenteriae
with insight into phage resistance and fitness trade-offs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe irrational use of antibiotics has facilitated the
emergence of multidrug- resistant Shigella spp., undermining the
effectiveness of the currently available antibiotics. Consequently,
there is an urgent need to explore new approaches, with phage therapy
emerging as a promising alternative.MethodsIn this study, we isolated a
phage targeting Shigella dysenteriae from sewage samples using DLA
methold, designated Henu10. The morphology, biological characteristics,
genomic composition, and phylogenetic relationships of Henu10 were
thoroughly characterized. To investigate the trade-off relationship
between phage resistance and bacterial fitness, phage Henu10-resistant
strains R6 and R11 were identified using continuous passage and
bidirectional validation methods.ResultsPhage-resistant strains R6 and
R11 exhibited impaired adsorption, increased sensitivity to temperature
and pH stress, heightened susceptibility to certain antibiotics (such as
ciprofloxacin and kanamycin), reduced biofilm-forming capacity, and
diminished colonization ability in vivo compared to the wild-type
strain.DiscussionThese results indicate that phage Henu10 may
effectively control the pathogenic bacteria associated with S.
dysenteriae, representing a promising new therapeutic option for
treating S. dysenteriae infections.</p>

the mechanisms causing murepavadin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa:
lipopolysaccharide alterations and its consequences</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMurepavadin is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) in clinical
development that selectively targets Pseudomonas aeruginosa LptD and
whose resistance profile remains unknown. We aimed to explore genomic
modifications and consequences underlying murepavadin and/or colistin
susceptibility.MethodsTo define genomic mechanisms underlying
resistance, we performed two approaches: 1) a genome-wide association
study (GWAS) in a P. aeruginosa clinical collection (n=496), considering
&gt;0.25 mg/L as tentative cut-off of murepavadin acquired resistance;
2) a paired genomic comparison in a subset of 5 isolates and their
isogenic murepavadin-resistant mutants obtained in vitro. Lipid-A
composition, immunogenicity and cathelicidin and indolicidin effects on
bacterial growth were also tested in this last subset of isolates.
Murepavadin MICs were determined in ΔlpxL1 and ΔlpxL2 knock-out mutants
obtained from a auxotroph PAO1 derivative.ResultsGWAS revealed a
missense variant (A→G p.Thr260Ala in the hisJ gene) associated with
murepavadin resistance although both resistant and susceptible strains
harbored it (21% and 12% respectively, OR=1.92, p=0.012 in χ² test).
Among the isolate subset, murepavadin-resistant mutants with deletions
in lpxL1 and lpxL2 genes showed lower abundance of hexa-acylated lipid-A
(m/z 1616, 1632). 4-aminoarabinose addition was found only in
colistin-resistant isolates but not in the other ones, irrespective of
murepavadin susceptibility. Accordingly, ΔlpxL1 and ΔlpxL2 mutants
exhibited higher murepavadin MICs than parental PAO1 auxotroph strain (2
and 4 vs 0.5 mg/L respectively). Lipopolysaccharide from
murepavadin-resistant mutants triggered lower inflammatory responses in
human monocytes. Those with lpxL mutations and hexa-acylated lipid-A
loss also exhibited greater growth reduction when exposed to
host-derived AMPs cathelicidin and indolicidin.DiscussionHigh
murepavadin-resistance seems to be linked to lpxL1 and lpxL2 mutations
and lower hexa-acylated lipid-A, corresponding to lower inflammatory
induction and higher susceptibility to host-derived AMPs. Although GWAS
identified one variant associated with the murepavadin-resistant
phenotype, data revealed that there was no unique single genetic event
underlying this phenotype. Our study provides insight into the
mechanisms underlying murepavadin susceptibility.</p>

of KPC contributes to ceftazidime-avibactam heteroresistance in clinical
isolates of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ceftazidime–avibactam (CZA) is one of the effective antibiotics used
for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP)
infections, but its resistance rate has increased recently. Previous
studies have focused on the mechanisms of CZA resistance, while its
heteroresistance in CRKP remains poorly understood. This study aimed to
investigate the characteristics and mechanisms of CZA heteroresistance
in CRKP isolates. A total of 311 CRKP clinical strains were collected in
China from 2020 to 2022. The MICs of CZA and other antibiotics against
K. pneumoniae were determined by broth microdilution method. The
occurrence of CZA heteroresistance in CRKP was evaluated with population
analysis profiling (PAP) and their characteristics were detected by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The underlying mechanism of CZA
heteroresistance in CRKP strains was investigated by molecular
sequencing, whole genome sequencing (WGS), quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR), and in vitro functional experiments. Strategies for
preventing the emergence of CZA heteroresistance and alternative
treatment options for strains exhibiting CZA heteroresistance were
further explored. Thirty-four (12.4%) CZA-susceptible CRKP isolates were
found to exhibit heteroresistance to CZA. All heteroresistant strains
belonged to KPC-2 (97.1%) or KPC-3 (2.9%). The dominant multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) was ST11 (64.7%) and the prevalent capsular
serotypes were KL47 (38.2%) and KL64 (32.4%). Imipenem-relebactam and
meropenem-vaborbactam still exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity
against the resistant subpopulations of CZA heteroresistant strains. No
significant mutations were found in KPC, OmpK35/36, PBP2/3, and LamB in
resistant subpopulations. The relative expression and copy number of
blaKPC were significantly upregulated in 47.1% and 35.3% of the
resistant subpopulations compared with their parental strains,
respectively. Silencing blaKPC expression significantly decreased the
CZA MIC in resistant subpopulations with high blaKPC expression and
hindered the emergence of CZA heteroresistance in their parental
strains. Moreover, increasing the avibactam concentration to 8 or 16
mg/L or combining CZA with 0.5 × MIC tigecycline significantly
suppressed the formation of CZA heteroresistance (P&lt;0.05). In
conclusion, we identified the occurrence of CZA heteroresistance in CRKP
in China, which was attributed to the overexpression of KPC. Increasing
the concentration of avibactam or combining CZA with tigecycline could
effectively prevent the development of CZA heteroresistance in CRKP
isolates. Besides, imipenem-relebactam and meropenem-vaborbactam may
serve as alternative therapeutic options when clinical isolates with CZA
heteroresistance are detected.</p>

of indigenous non-Saccharomyces yeast strains on the physicochemical and
sensory properties of wine fermentation: a promising approach to
enhancing wine quality</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>This study explores the potential of indigenous non-Saccharomyces
yeasts isolated from Vitis vinifera L. grape skins to improve the
quality of regional wines by enhancing their physicochemical and sensory
characteristics. Five promising yeast strains were identified at
different stages of fermentation: Hanseniaspora opuntiae (J1Y-T1), H.
guilliermondii (Y5P-T5), H. uvarum (JF3-T1N), Pichia kudriavzevii
(Y8P-T8), and Starmerella bacillaris (WMP4-T4). Among these, H. uvarum
and S. bacillaris were particularly noteworthy due to their superior
alcohol production, achieving levels of 8.16 ± 0.05% and 8.04 ± 0.04%
(v/v), respectively, and demonstrating higher alcohol tolerance even in
later fermentation stages. Hanseniaspora uvarum also showed exceptional
resilience, with a half-life of 3.34 ± 0.03 days and a Km value of
1.0200 ± 0.0100 mol L⁻¹, achieving the highest biomass even in the later
stages of fermentation. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography analysis
revealed that while tartaric acid levels remained constant, malic acid
content decreased, and acetic acid was produced by all strains.
Solid-Phase Microextraction-Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry
identified ethyl acetate as the dominant volatile compound, with H.
uvarum producing the highest concentration (43.411 ± 1.602%),
contributing to a fruitier aroma and flavor. The combined attributes of
H. uvarum higher alcohol content, enhanced fruity notes, improved
clarity, lower acetic acid (0.52 ± 0.03 g L⁻¹), and significant residual
sugar (162.37 ± 2.48 g L⁻¹) make it a promising candidate for improving
the overall quality of regional wines. Incorporating H. uvarum into
mixed starter cultures with specific Saccharomyces strains could further
optimize the wine fermentation process.</p>

proteins of human coronaviruses: what makes them different?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Following COVID-19 outbreak with its unprecedented effect on the
entire world, the interest to the coronaviruses increased. The causative
agent of the COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus – 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is one of seven coronaviruses that is pathogenic to humans.
Others include SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and
HCoV-229E. The viruses differ in their pathogenicity. SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are capable to spread rapidly and cause
epidemic, while HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E cause mild
respiratory disease. The difference in the viral behavior is due to
structural and functional differences. All seven human coronaviruses
possess four structural proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and
nucleocapsid. Spike protein with its receptor binding domain is crucial
for the entry to the host cell, where different receptors on the host
cell are recruited by different viruses. Envelope protein plays
important role in viral assembly, and following cellular entry,
contributes to immune response. Membrane protein is an abundant viral
protein, contributing to the assembly and pathogenicity of the virus.
Nucleocapsid protein encompasses the viral RNA into ribonucleocapsid,
playing important role in viral replication. The present review provides
detailed summary of structural and functional characteristics of
structural proteins from seven human coronaviruses, and could serve as a
practical reference when pathogenic human coronaviruses are compared,
and novel treatments are proposed.</p>

butyricum, a future star in sepsis treatment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome of multiorgan
failure caused by dysregulation of the host response to infection and is
a major cause of death in critically ill patients. In recent years, with
the continuous development of sequencing technology, the intestinal
microecology of this disease has been increasingly studied. The gut
microbiota plays a host-protective role mainly through the maintenance
of normal immune function and the intestinal barrier. Recent evidence
suggests that intestinal flora dysbiosis plays a crucial role in sepsis.
Clostridium butyricum (C. butyricum), which has been used as a probiotic
in poultry feed since its discovery, has been found to play a potential
protective role in intestinal infections, inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), colorectal cancer, and other diseases in recent studies. In this
review, we continue to focus on the important role and mechanism of C.
butyricum as a probiotic in human diseases, especially intestinal
diseases. Additionally, we evaluate the research progress of C.
butyricum in treatment of sepsis to identify more therapeutic targets
for the clinical treatment of sepsis.</p>

Leishmania mexicana clones secrete populations of extracellular vesicles
with unique protein profile and variable infectious capability</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The study of extracellular vesicles has become an incredibly
important field of study, but the inherent heterogeneity of these
vesicles continues to make their study challenging. The genetic
variability and well-documented protocols for the growth and vesicle
isolation from Leishmania parasites provide a unique opportunity to
compare the heterogeneity of different populations secreted by
Leishmania clones. Leishmania mexicana was cultured on solid SDM agar
plates and 8 clonal colonies were selected. The EVs collected from the
liquid cultures of these 8 clones were assessed by NTA, TEM, and
proteomic analysis. We found that all 8 clonal L. mexicana cultures were
visually indistinguishable from each other and had similar growth rate,
and these physical similarities extended to their EVs. However,
proteomic analysis reveals that the EVs collected have unique protein
profiles compared to each other and EVs isolated from a heterogeneous
liquid culture of L. mexicana. We selected 3 clonal EVs for further
mouse infection experiments and found that EVs from CL7 L. mexicana
consistently caused reduced footpad swelling in C57BL6 mice footpads
compared to EVs from CL1, CL8, and heterogenous L. mexicana. This trend
was not observed when infecting Balb/C mice and C57BL6 with the
parasites alone, with only CL1 L. mexicana causing significantly
increased infection in Balb/c mice. Our results together show that EVs
isolated from different clonal colonies of L. mexicana have distinct
differences in protein cargo which can lead to varying outcomes on
Leishmania infection. Further evaluation will be needed to determine the
underlying mechanisms behind this and verify that differences observed
in infectivity are directly caused by variations between our L. mexicana
clones, especially genetic sequencing and immunoblotting to validate our
results.</p>

accelerated bone mass loss in mice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesTo investigate the effect of gut microbiota from
postmenopausal osteoporosis patients on bone mass in mice.MethodsFecal
samples were collected from postmenopausal women with normal bone mass
(Con, n=5) and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (Op, n=5).
Microbial composition was identified by shallow shotgun sequencing. Then
fecal samples were transplanted into pseudo-sterile mice previously
treated with antibiotics for 4 weeks. These mice were categorized into
two groups: the Vehicle group (n=7) received fecal samples from
individuals with normal bone mass, and the FMT group (n=7) received
fecal samples from individuals with osteoporosis. After 8 weeks, bone
mass, intestinal microbial composition, intestinal permeability and
inflammation were assessed, followed by a correlation
analysis.ResultsThe bone mass was significantly reduced in the FMT
group. Microbiota sequencing showed that Shannon index (p &lt; 0.05) and
Simpson index (p &lt; 0.05) were significantly increased in Op groups,
and β diversity showed significant differences. the recipient mice were
similar. linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis of
mice showed that Halobiforma, Enterorhabdus, Alistipes, and
Butyricimonas were significantly enriched in the FMT group.
Lachnospiraceae and Oscillibacter were significantly enriched in the
Vehicle group. H&amp;E staining of intestinal tissues showed obvious
intestinal mucosal injury in mice. Intestinal immunohistochemistry
showed that the expression of Claudin and ZO-1 in the intestinal tissue
of the FMT group mice was decreased. The FITC-Dextran (FD-4) absorption
rate and serum soluble CD14 (sCD14) content were increased in FMT mice.
Correlation analysis showed that these dominant genera were
significantly associated with bone metabolism and intestinal
permeability, and were associated with the enrichment of specific
enzymes. Serum and bone tissue inflammatory cytokines detection showed
that the expression of TNF-α and IL-17A in the FMT group were
significantly increased.ConclusionOverall, our findings suggested gut
microbiota from postmenopausal osteoporosis patients accelerate bone
mass loss in mice. Aberrant gut microbiota might play a causal role in
the process of bone mass loss mediated by inflammation after the
destruction of the intestinal barrier.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundZhuanggu Shubi ointment (ZGSBG) has good efficacy in
postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), but the mechanism of efficacy
involving gut microecology has not been elucidated.ObjectiveThis study
investigated the mechanism of ZGSBG in regulating gut microecology in
PMO.MethodsThe bilateral ovarian denervation method was used to
construct a rat model of PMO and was administered ZGSBG. Behavior, bone
transformation, gut microbiota, intestinal mucosal barrier, and
intestinal inflammatory-related indexes were detected.ResultsAfter ZGSBG
intervention, bone R-hydroxy glutamic acid protein and procollagen type
I N-terminal propeptides were significantly upregulated, while
C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen and tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase-5b were significantly downregulated. Pathological analysis
demonstrated an improvement in femoral and colonic structures. The
expressions of zonula occludens-1, occludin, claudin-1, and secretory
immunoglobulin A in the colonic tissues were significantly elevated,
while the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β,
interleukin-6, and lipopolysaccharides were reduced. Moreover,
characteristic bacteria Muribaculaceae and Prevotella were significantly
enriched. Furthermore, Muribaculaceae and Prevotella have a positive
correlation with intestinal mucosal barrier function and a negative
correlation with intestinal inflammatory responses.ConclusionZGSBG
promoted bone formation, inhibited bone resorption, regulated gut
microbiota, repaired intestinal mucosal barrier damage, and inhibited
intestinal inflammatory responses in PMO rats. Muribaculaceae and
Prevotella might play positive roles in ZGSBG treatment of intestinal
mucosal barrier injury and inflammatory reactions in PMO.</p>

of a genomic cluster related to hypersecretion of intestinal mucus and
mucinolytic activity of atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli
(aEPEC)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains are subdivided into
typical (tEPEC) and atypical (aEPEC) according to the presence or
absence of a virulence-associated plasmid called pEAF. Our research
group has previously demonstrated that two aEPEC strains, 0421-1 and
3991-1, induce an increase in mucus production in a rabbit ileal loop
model in vivo. This phenomenon was not observed with a tEPEC prototype
strain. Few studies on aEPEC strains evaluating their capacity to induce
intestinal mucus hypersecretion were done. This study aimed to
investigate aEPEC strains regarding their genotypic and phenotypic
characteristics, their ability to alter mucus production in an in vivo
intestinal infection model, and their potential mucinolytic activity. To
investigate the relationship between strains 0421-1 and 3991-1 and 11
other aEPEC strains, their serotypes, sequence types (ST), and virulence
factors (VF), several sequencing and genomic analyses were carried out.
The study also involved researching the reproduction of mucus
hypersecretion in rabbits in vivo. We found that the two mucus-inducing
strains and two other strains (1582-4 and 2531-13) shared the same
phylogroup (A), ST (378), serotype (O101/O162:H33), and intimin subtype
(ι2), were phylogenetically related, and induced mucus hypersecretion in
vivo. A wide diversity of VFs was found among the strains, confirming
their genomic heterogeneity. However, among the genes studied, no unique
virulence factor or gene set was identified exclusively in the
mucus-inducing strains, suggesting the multifactorial nature of this
phenomenon. The two strains (1582-4 and 2531-13) closely related to the
two aEPEC strains that induced mucus production in vivo also induced the
phenomenon. The investigation of the mucinolytic activity revealed that
all aEPEC strains used mucins as their carbon sources. Ten of the 13
aEPEC strains could cross a mucin layer, and only four adhered better to
agar containing mucin than to agar without mucin. The present study
paves the way for subsequent investigations into the molecular
mechanisms regarding cellular interactions and responses, as well as the
correlation between virulence factors and the induction of mucus
production/expression during aEPEC infections.</p>

the most widespread infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Helminths are known to modulate host immune responses and consequently
impact the severity and outcomes of unrelated diseases, including
allergies, autoimmune conditions, and infectious diseases. In this way,
helminths may modulate essential immune responses against HSV-2 during
co-infection and may alter susceptibility to and pathology of HSV-2.
However, the epidemiology of STH/HSV-2 co-infections is understudied,
and whether helminths influence the host immune response to HSV-2 is not
well understood. In this perspective piece, we briefly examine the
current knowledge on helminth immune modulation of important pathogens
that are endemic to SSA, arguing that it is important to explore HSV-2
and helminth co-infections to elucidate potential interactions between
HSV-2 and helminths. This is particularly relevant in SSA, where both
pathogens are highly prevalent.</p>

challenges in periprosthetic joint infections: a focus on rare pathogens
and their clinical implications</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThe study aimed to evaluate differences in clinical
characteristics and treatment outcomes of periprosthetic joint infection
(PJI) attributed to rare versus common pathogens.MethodsData on PJI
patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty at our center from April
2013 to December 2022 were retrospectively collected. Among the 219
enrolled patients, we compared 32 cases of PJI caused by rare pathogens
with 187 controls of PJI caused by common pathogens, analyzing
demographic information, clinical characteristics, and treatment
outcomes.ResultsIn demographic data, the Charlson comorbidity index and
preoperative invasive procedures were identified as risk factors for
rare pathogen PJI. Clinically, the rare pathogen cohort exhibited a
significantly higher rate of sinus tract formation compared to those
with common bacteria PJI. In terms of laboratory findings, the mean
serum C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly lower in the rare
pathogen group. This cohort also had a significantly lower culture
positivity rate and a higher rate of polymicrobial co-infections. The
median hospital stay was statistically longer for rare pathogen PJI
cases than for those with common bacteria PJI. Furthermore, the rare
pathogen group required longer antibiotic treatments and had higher
rates of antibiotic-related adverse events, although reinfection rates
did not significantly differ.ConclusionPJI caused by rare pathogens
exhibits distinct clinical presentations. With advances in diagnostic
techniques such as metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS),
optimized culture methods, and an interdisciplinary approach
facilitating early targeted treatment, rare pathogen PJIs may achieve
outcomes comparable to those of typical cases.</p>

testing diagnosis of African swine fever virus by targeting multiple
genes with enzymatic recombinase amplification and CRISPR/Cas12a
System</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection is causing devastating
outbreaks globally; pig farming has suffered severe economic losses due
to the ASFV. Currently, strict biosecurity control measures can mitigate
the incidence of ASF. Rapid, cost-effective, and sensitive detection of
ASFV can significantly reduce disease transmission and mortality.
CRISPR/Cas-associated proteins can detect polymorphisms with high
specificity and sensitivity, making them ideal for detecting pathogens.
In this study, based on CRISPR/Cas12a integrated with enzymatic
recombinase amplification (ERA) technology, a CRISPR/Cas12a detection
system capable of identifying ASFV E183L, K205R, and C962R gene
sequences has been developed. The ERA-CRISPR/Cas12a detection system
detected ASFV precisely without cross-reactivity with other porcine
pathogen templates and with a sensitivity detection limit of 10 copies
per reaction; it takes 60 minutes to complete the detection process. In
combination with this integrated ERA pre-amplification and Cas12a/crRNA
cutting assay, it provides a rapid, straightforward, sensitive, and
specific method for ASFV detection in the field.</p>

parvum infection alters the intestinal mucosa transcriptome in neonatal
calves: impacts on epithelial barriers and transcellular transport
systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) is the most prevalent
enteric protozoan parasite causing infectious diarrhea in neonatal
calves worldwide with a direct negative impact on their health and
welfare. This study utilized next-generation sequencing (NGS) to deepen
our understanding of intestinal epithelial barriers and transport
mechanisms in the pathophysiology of infectious diarrhea in neonatal
calves, which could potentially unveil novel solutions for
treatment.MethodsAt day 1 of life, male Holstein-Friesian calves were
either orally infected (n = 5) or not (control group, n = 5) with C.
parvum oocysts (in-house strain LE-01-Cp-15). On day 8 after infection,
calves were slaughtered and jejunum mucosa samples were taken. The RNA
was extracted from collected samples and subjected to sequencing.
Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between the infected and CTRL
groups were assessed using DESeq2 at a false discovery rate &lt; 0.05
and used for gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis in
Cytoscape (v3.9.1).Results and discussionTo study the pathophysiology of
infectious diarrhea on intestinal permeability, 459 genes related to
epithelial cell barrier integrity and paracellular and transmembrane
transport systems were selected from 12,908 identified genes in mucus.
Among, there were 61 increased and 109 decreased gene transcripts
belonged to adhesion molecules (e.g. ADGRD1 and VCAM1), ATP-binding
cassette (ABC, e.g. ABCC2 and ABCD1) and solute carrier (SLC,
e.g. SLC28A2 and SLC38A3) transporters, and ion channels (e.g. KCNJ15).
Our results suggest deregulation of cellular junctions and thus a
possibly increased intestinal permeability, whereas deregulation of ABC
and SLC transporters and ion channels may influence the
absorption/secretion of amino acids, carbohydrates, fats, and organic
compounds, as well as acid-based balance and osmotic hemostasis. Besides
pathogen-induced gene expression alterations, part of the DEG may have
been triggered or consequently affected by inflammatory mechanisms. The
study provided a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of
infectious diarrhea in neonatal calves and the host-pathogen
interactions at the transcript level. For further studies with a
particular focus on the transport system, these results could lead to a
new approach to elucidating pathophysiological regulatory
mechanisms.</p>

study in Wuhan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a critical concern in pediatric
onco-hematological patients undergoing chemotherapy or hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT), leading to a major impact on
morbidity, long-term hospitalization, and mortality. We retrospectively
analyzed 202 BSIs in 145 patients, consisting of 128 with hematological
malignancies, one with a solid tumor, and 16 with non-malignant
hematological diseases. We collected data on patient demographics,
clinical characteristics, pathogen distribution, and antimicrobial
pathogen susceptibility. Gram-positive infections were the most frequent
at (58.4%), followed by gram-negative (41%), and fungal infections
(0.5%). Particularly, the majority of these infections occurred during
the induction phase of chemotherapy, where 94 (46.5%) BSI episodes were
recorded, predominantly in neutropenic patients (88.3%). The
consolidation phase experienced lower BSIs (11.8%); among these patients
(54.1%) were non-neutropenic. BSIs observed in (23.7%) of patients in
the maintenance phase, with a higher proportion (66.6%) being
neutropenic. Among the 7 patients who underwent HSCT, BSIs occurred in
(4.9%) cases, mainly (70%) due to neutropenia. The most prevalent
pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (19.8%), Staphylococcus
hominis (16.3%), and Escherichia coli (8.4%). The study highlights the
critical need for vigilant monitoring and customized infection
management strategies to enhance patient outcomes across chemotherapy
phases and HSCT.</p>

Microbiology</p>
<p>Infectious diseases are the leading cause of death in infants and
children under 5 years of age. In utero exposure to viruses can lead to
spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, congenital abnormalities or other
developmental defects, often resulting in lifelong health sequalae. The
underlying biological mechanisms are difficult to study in humans due to
ethical concerns and limited sample access. Nonhuman primates (NHP) are
closely related to humans, and pregnancy and immune ontogeny in infants
are very similar to humans. Therefore, NHP are a highly relevant model
for understanding fetal and postnatal virus-host interactions and to
define immune mechanisms associated with increased morbidity and
mortality in infants. We will discuss NHP models of viruses causing
congenital infections, respiratory diseases in early life, and HIV.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains the most common cause of congenital
defects worldwide. Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease, yet measles
cases are resurging. Zika is an example of an emerging arbovirus with
devastating consequences for the developing fetus and the surviving
infant. Among the respiratory viruses, we will discuss influenza and
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We will
finish with HIV as an example of a lifelong infection without a cure or
vaccine. The review will highlight (i) the impact of viral infections on
fetal and infant immune development, (ii) how differences in infant and
adult immune responses to infection alter disease outcome, and emphasize
the invaluable contribution of pediatric NHP infection models to the
design of effective treatment and prevention strategies, including
vaccines, for human infants.</p>

Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in porcine wound infection
model</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe colonization of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) acquired in
nosocomial infections may develop acute and chronic infections such as
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the nose. As a
commensal microorganism with the ability to form a biofilm, SA can dwell
on the skin, nostrils, throat, perineum, and axillae of healthy humans.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an unstable gas with various molecular functions
and has antimicrobial properties which are converted into many potential
treatments.MethodsMethicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA
BAA1686 isolated from nasal infection was used in a porcine wound
infection model. Deep partial-thickness wounds (10mm x 7mm x 0.5mm) were
made on three animals using a specialized electrokeratome. All wounds
were inoculated and then covered with polyurethane film dressings for
biofilm formation. After 48 hours, three wounds were recovered from each
animal for baseline enumeration. The remaining wounds were randomly
assigned to six treatment groups and treated once daily. The treatment
groups are as follows: NO topical ointments concentrations of 0.3, 0.9
and 1.8%, Vehicle Ointment, Mupirocin 2%, and Untreated Control.
Microbiological recoveries were conducted on day 4 and day 7.ResultsThe
greatest efficacy observed from the NO formulations against MRSA BAA1686
was the 1.8% concentration. This agent was able to reduce more than 99%
of bacterial counts when compared to Baseline, Vehicle Ointment, and
Untreated Control wounds on both assessment days. Mupirocin 2% was the
overall best treatment against MRSA BAA1686 on both assessment days,
with a significant reduction (p ≤ 0.05) of 4.70 ± 0.13 Log CFU/mL from
day 4 to day 7.ConclusionsOverall, the positive control Mupirocin 2% was
the most effective in eliminating MRSA BAA1686 throughout the study.
This experiment demonstrated a downward trend from the highest
concentration of NO topical ointment formulations to the lowest
concentrations on both assessment days (0.3% - 1.8%). Out of all NO
topical ointments, the highest concentration (1.8%) was the most
effective with the potential to be an alternative treatment against a
MRSA nasal strain biofilm.</p>

study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) limit the susceptibility of
bacteria to antimicrobials, representing a problem of high importance.
Current research on the presence of ARGs in microorganisms focuses
mainly on humans, livestock, hospitals, or wastewater. However, the
spectrum of ARGs in the dust resistome in workplaces and households has
gone relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to analyze resistome
in indoor dust samples from participants’ workplaces (a pediatric
hospital, a maternity hospital, and a research center) and households
and compare two different approaches to the ARGs analysis;
high-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) and whole metagenome shotgun
sequencing (WMGS). In total, 143 ARGs were detected using HT-qPCR, with
ARGs associated with the macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B
(MLSB) phenotype being the most abundant, followed by MDR (multi-drug
resistance) genes, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides. A
higher overall relative quantity of ARGs was observed in indoor dust
samples from workplaces than from households, with the pediatric
hospital being associated with the highest relative quantity of ARGs.
WMGS analysis revealed 36 ARGs, of which five were detected by both
HT-qPCR and WMGS techniques. Accordingly, the efficacy of the WMGS
approach to detect ARGs was lower than that of HT-qPCR. In summary, our
pilot data revealed that indoor dust in buildings where people spend
most of their time (workplaces, households) can be a significant source
of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which may potentially pose a
health risk to both humans and animals.</p>

eradicate carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae colonization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe use of beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus spp. is a
potential innovative approach to fight antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most concerning multi drug-resistant
(MDR) pathogens, and its ability to colonize the human gut is considered
to be the main reason for recurrent infections in critically ill
patients.MethodsIn this study, Lactobacillus gasseri 1A-TV, already
described for its probiotic activity, was characterized at the genomic
level. Moreover, its cell-free supernatant (CFS) was tested for
antimicrobial activity against extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)- and
carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae clinical
isolates.ResultsWhole-genome sequencing showed that the L. gasseri 1A-TV
genome was of 2,018,898 bp in size with 34.9% GC content, containing
1,937 putative protein coding sequences, 55 tRNA, and 4 rRNA detected by
RAST and classified in 20 functional groups by Cluster of Orthologous
Genes (COG). BAGEL4 (BActeriocin GEnome minimal tooL) and the antiSMASH
7.0 pipeline identified two bacteriocin biosynthetic gene clusters
(BBGCs), namely, BBGC1 that comprises two class IIc bacteriocins
including gassericin A-like bacteriocin, and BBGC2 carrying the class
III bacteriocin helveticin J. Strikingly, 1A-TV CFS inhibited the growth
of all K. pneumoniae isolates only after 8 h of incubation, showing a
bactericidal effect at 24 h and interfering, even at lower
concentrations, with the biofilm production of biofilm-producer strains
independently of a bactericidal effect. NMR analysis of CFS identified
and quantified several metabolites involved in carbohydrate metabolism
and amino acid metabolism, and organic acids like ethanol, lactate,
acetate, and succinate. Finally, in vitro assays of 1A-TV showed
significant co-aggregation effects against carbapenem-resistant K.
pneumoniae, namely, strains 1, 2, 3, and 7.ConclusionsOur findings
highlight the antimicrobial activity of 1A-TV as a probiotic candidate
or its CFS as a natural bioproduct active against MDR K. pneumoniae
strains, underlining the importance of novel therapeutic strategies for
prevention and control of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing K.

<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionBacteriome alterations have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the
relationship between SLE and the urinary microbiome remains
underexplored. This study aimed to characterize the urinary microbiome
of SLE patients using 16S rRNA sequencing and to investigate its
correlations with clinical parameters through integrative
analyses.MethodsUrine sediment samples were collected from individuals
with SLE and lupus nephritis (LN) (n = 20), SLE without LN (n = 22), and
healthy controls (HCs) (n = 23). DNA was extracted and subjected to 16S
rRNA sequencing to profile the urinary microbiome. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the
diagnostic efficacy of urinary microbiota, while Spearman’s correlation
analysis was employed to identify links between specific microbial taxa
and clinical parameters. Functional predictions of bacterial roles were
performed using Picrust2.ResultsThe urinary microbiota diagnostic model
exhibited excellent performance in distinguishing SLE patients from HCs.
Spearman’s analysis revealed significant correlations between the
urinary microbiome and clinical parameters. Specifically, Sphingomonas
and Lachnospiraceae genera showed positive correlations with vitamin D
levels, cylinderuria, and proteinuria, while Pedobacter, Aquabacterium,
Delftia, and Achromobacter displayed negative correlations with
proteinuria and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Functional
predictions indicated that the urinary microbiome might influence immune
regulation through modulation of signaling pathways and metabolic
processes.DiscussionOur study is the first to reveal dysbiosis in the
urinary microbiome of patients with SLE. Certain bacterial taxa in the
urinary microbiome were identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers
for SLE. Furthermore, the functional implications of these bacterial
communities suggest their involvement in immune modulation, highlighting
the potential for further investigation into their roles in SLE
pathogenesis and diagnosis.</p>

<p>IntroductionStreptococcus pneumoniae is a prevalent and virulent
global pathogen, with colonization being considered a precondition for
pneumococcal disease. Understanding colonization is critical for gaining
insights into transmission dynamics and developing effective
interventions. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of
nasopharyngeal colonization and serotype distribution in the Sicilian
population.MethodsObservational study randomly selecting samples
belonging to Sicilian individuals whose nasopharyngeal swabs were
collected between February 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022. Pneumococcal
colonization was determined using PCR for the pneumococcal autolysin
(LytA) gene, and positive samples were serotyped.ResultsThe study sample
consisted of 1,196 individuals, with 17.4% testing positive for the LytA
gene. Pneumococcal colonization rates fell from birth to 24 years, with
a peak in 0-4-year-olds (aOR=6.9; p&lt;0.001). Colonization was higher
in colder months, particularly in December (aOR=2.9, p&lt;0.05) and
February (aOR=4, p&lt;0.05). Serotypes 22F and 24ABF exhibited strong
colonization and an invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) risk, whereas
serotypes 4, 6AB, 9VA, and 13 had high colonization but a low IPD risk.
Serotypes 3 and 8 exhibited considerable IPD risk but low
colonization.ConclusionOur findings provide insights into pneumococcal
colonization mechanisms, influencing serotype prevalence, colonization
risk variables, and serotype comparisons for colonization and

characterization and tissue tropism variations of two porcine delta
coronavirus strains isolated in China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) is a member of the Delta
coronavirus genus, which can lead to diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality
in piglets. First detected in Hong Kong in 2012, PDCoV has since spread
globally. In January 2024, two strains, CHN-ANHZ-2024 and CHN-JSSQ-2024,
were isolated from diarrheal piglets in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces.
Immunofluorescence assays, electron microscopy, and genome sequencing
were performed. Genome analysis revealed that both PDCoV strains
belonged to the Chinese lineage, exhibiting amino acid mutations in the
S1 region compared to other strains within the lineage. Amino acid
mutation at position 530L is uniquely associated with the Thai strain.
Notably, CHN-JSSQ-2024 was identified as a recombinant strain of DH1 and
CHN-AHHN-2024, with the recombination occurring in the S2 subunit.
CHN-ANHZ-2024 caused severe diarrhea with an 80% mortality rate, whereas
CHN-JSSQ-2024 resulted in mild diarrhea without mortality. Viral load
analysis showed CHN-ANHZ-2024 primarily infecting the brain and kidneys,
while CHN-JSSQ-2024 targeted the lungs, revealing notable differences in
tissue tropism. We designed the RNA scope Probe-PDCoV-N to visualize
viral RNA in the positively detected organs, viral RNA was detected in
the brain, cerebellum, kidneys, and lungs of the infected piglets. This
study highlights significant differences in the pathogenicity and organ
tropism of two PDCoV strains. The CHN-ANHZ-2024 strain caused severe
diarrhea and high mortality in piglets, while the CHN-JSSQ-2024 strain
exhibited much milder symptoms. Additionally, the study elucidated
notable differences in organ tropism between the strains, offering
valuable insights into the epidemiological characteristics and
pathogenic mechanisms of PDCoV. These findings provide a foundation for
the development of targeted prevention and treatment strategies tailored
to specific strains in the future.</p>

significant clinical entity due to marked changes in the gut microbiota
and their metabolic products, often described as the body’s “second
genome.” These changes in intestinal IRI lead to profound alterations in
the gut microbiota and their metabolic outputs, impacting not only the
pathology of intestinal IRI itself but also influencing the function of
other organs through various mechanisms. Notable among these are brain,
liver, and kidney injuries, with acute lung injury being especially
significant. This review seeks to explore in depth the roles and
mechanisms of the gut microbiota and their metabolic products in the
progression of acute lung injury initiated by intestinal IRI, aiming to
provide a theoretical basis and directions for future research into the
treatment of related conditions.</p>
