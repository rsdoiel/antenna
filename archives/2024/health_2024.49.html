carriage in a large Sicilian sample population: impact on the current
epidemiological scenario and implications for future vaccination
strategies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionStreptococcus pneumoniae is a prevalent and virulent
global pathogen, with colonization being considered a precondition for
pneumococcal disease. Understanding colonization is critical for gaining
insights into transmission dynamics and developing effective
interventions. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of
nasopharyngeal colonization and serotype distribution in the Sicilian
population.MethodsObservational study randomly selecting samples
belonging to Sicilian individuals whose nasopharyngeal swabs were
collected between February 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022. Pneumococcal
colonization was determined using PCR for the pneumococcal autolysin
(LytA) gene, and positive samples were serotyped.ResultsThe study sample
consisted of 1,196 individuals, with 17.4% testing positive for the LytA
gene. Pneumococcal colonization rates fell from birth to 24 years, with
a peak in 0-4-year-olds (aOR=6.9; p&lt;0.001). Colonization was higher
in colder months, particularly in December (aOR=2.9, p&lt;0.05) and
February (aOR=4, p&lt;0.05). Serotypes 22F and 24ABF exhibited strong
colonization and an invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) risk, whereas
serotypes 4, 6AB, 9VA, and 13 had high colonization but a low IPD risk.
Serotypes 3 and 8 exhibited considerable IPD risk but low
colonization.ConclusionOur findings provide insights into pneumococcal
colonization mechanisms, influencing serotype prevalence, colonization
risk variables, and serotype comparisons for colonization and
pathogenicity propensity.</p>

characterization and tissue tropism variations of two porcine delta
coronavirus strains isolated in China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) is a member of the Delta
coronavirus genus, which can lead to diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality
in piglets. First detected in Hong Kong in 2012, PDCoV has since spread
globally. In January 2024, two strains, CHN-ANHZ-2024 and CHN-JSSQ-2024,
were isolated from diarrheal piglets in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces.
Immunofluorescence assays, electron microscopy, and genome sequencing
were performed. Genome analysis revealed that both PDCoV strains
belonged to the Chinese lineage, exhibiting amino acid mutations in the
S1 region compared to other strains within the lineage. Amino acid
mutation at position 530L is uniquely associated with the Thai strain.
Notably, CHN-JSSQ-2024 was identified as a recombinant strain of DH1 and
CHN-AHHN-2024, with the recombination occurring in the S2 subunit.
CHN-ANHZ-2024 caused severe diarrhea with an 80% mortality rate, whereas
CHN-JSSQ-2024 resulted in mild diarrhea without mortality. Viral load
analysis showed CHN-ANHZ-2024 primarily infecting the brain and kidneys,
while CHN-JSSQ-2024 targeted the lungs, revealing notable differences in
tissue tropism. We designed the RNA scope Probe-PDCoV-N to visualize
viral RNA in the positively detected organs, viral RNA was detected in
the brain, cerebellum, kidneys, and lungs of the infected piglets. This
study highlights significant differences in the pathogenicity and organ
tropism of two PDCoV strains. The CHN-ANHZ-2024 strain caused severe
diarrhea and high mortality in piglets, while the CHN-JSSQ-2024 strain
exhibited much milder symptoms. Additionally, the study elucidated
notable differences in organ tropism between the strains, offering
valuable insights into the epidemiological characteristics and
pathogenic mechanisms of PDCoV. These findings provide a foundation for
the development of targeted prevention and treatment strategies tailored
to specific strains in the future.</p>

the impact of gut microbiota and metabolic products on acute lung injury
following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury: harmful or
helpful?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common and clinically
significant form of tissue damage encountered in medical practice. This
pathological process has been thoroughly investigated across a variety
of clinical settings, including, but not limited to, sepsis, organ
transplantation, shock, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemia, and
stroke. Intestinal IRI, in particular, is increasingly recognized as a
significant clinical entity due to marked changes in the gut microbiota
and their metabolic products, often described as the body’s “second
genome.” These changes in intestinal IRI lead to profound alterations in
the gut microbiota and their metabolic outputs, impacting not only the
pathology of intestinal IRI itself but also influencing the function of
other organs through various mechanisms. Notable among these are brain,
liver, and kidney injuries, with acute lung injury being especially
significant. This review seeks to explore in depth the roles and
mechanisms of the gut microbiota and their metabolic products in the
progression of acute lung injury initiated by intestinal IRI, aiming to
provide a theoretical basis and directions for future research into the
treatment of related conditions.</p>
