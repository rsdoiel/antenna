Chatbots: To Cite Or Not To Cite? (Part I)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>
<p>

via citation instead? Is it appropriate to cite chatbots as information
sources?

Administrators Want OA Policy Removed from REF 2029. I Have an Even
Better Idea.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>

access by shifting the responsibility for enforcement to funding
agencies. But that doesn’t lower costs at all; it only shifts them. To
truly lower costs, stop trying to make open access mandatory.
