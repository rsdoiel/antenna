One advantage of <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues?q=is%3Aissue+">using GitHub</a> for questions tied into a blog is that you get a great archive of all the questions you asked and how people answered or contributed, going back to <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/1">2016</a>.

GitHub has a better model for text with comments, supports full Markdown the way it was meant to work. I have an instance of Masto that I can use that supports Markdown but they do an <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/16/thisIsNotALegitWayToDisplayALink.png">unacceptable</a> rendering of links. <a href="https://social.masto.land/@dave/112971999302900967">Example post</a>. I want a simple, widely accepted easy place to comment, on the social web, not Discourse or GitHub, that isn't controlled by one vendor (so ActivityPub for now is probably the best approach) and supports plain old Markdown without any weird embellishments. I don't work in the Mastodon world, I'm already committed to the projects I'm doing. But we could really use something nice, designed to plug into blogs. This is a good use-case, and it's pretty close.

## New Windows IPv6 Zero-Click Vulnerability

date: 2024-08-16, updated: 2024-08-15, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The press is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/zero-click-windows-tcp-ip-rce-impacts-all-systems-with-ipv6-enabled-patch-now/">reporting</a> a critical Windows vulnerability affecting IPv6.</p>
<blockquote><p>As Microsoft explained in its Tuesday advisory, unauthenticated attackers can exploit the flaw remotely in low-complexity attacks by repeatedly sending IPv6 packets that include specially crafted packets.</p>
<p>Microsoft also shared its exploitability assessment for this critical vulnerability, tagging it with an &#8220;exploitation more likely&#8221; label, which means that threat actors could create exploit code to &#8220;consistently exploit the flaw in attacks.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

## Musk is just getting started

date: 2024-08-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Podcast: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/15/elonMuskIsJustGettingStartedWithTwitter.m4a">11 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>I see happy talk all over the place that Twitter is done, Musk is killing it, blah blah blah. </p>
<p>It's <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a>. In the next few months Twitter is going to morph into the political system that Barack Obama could have and should have built.</p>
<p>It turns out creating a president of the United States is worth a lot of money. Trump is inept at squeezing the money out of it, he's a loudmouth who proved one thing, Twitter is all you needed in 2016 to get elected president. That's going to change, as competition shows up (Zuckerberg, for example, with Threads). </p>
<p>They know, even if you don't -- that it can be very profitable to own the presidency. </p>
<p>If Trump loses, Musk won't get it on this round, but eventually he will own a big piece of the president, and then he will move his deals with SpaceX and Tesla up a notch.</p>
<p>Listen to the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/15/elonMuskIsJustGettingStartedWithTwitter.m4a">podcast</a>, it's only 11 minutes. You probably haven't considered this angle, but I promise you he's moving, and he's mostly unopposed right now. He's not the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nudnik">nudnick</a> so many people seem to think he is. </p>

Shortly after the feature would be in Radio UserLand. It was the only episode I did in August 2004. The next one is on September 1 and there are a total of nine shows in September, including the first <a href="http://secrets.scripting.com/">Trade Secrets</a> which is a podcast Adam and I did together.

## NIST Releases First Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithms

date: 2024-08-15, updated: 2024-08-15, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>From the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-08-14/pdf/2024-17956.pdf">Federal Register</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After three rounds of evaluation and analysis, NIST selected four algorithms it will standardize as a result of the PQC Standardization Process. The public-key encapsulation mechanism selected was CRYSTALS-KYBER, along with three digital signature schemes: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+.</p></blockquote>
<p>These algorithms are part of three NIST standards that have been finalized:</p>
<ul>
<li>FIPS 203: <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final">Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism Standard</a></li>
<li>FIPS 204: <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final">Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Standard</a></li>

## 2024-08-14 Web applications

date: 2024-08-15, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-14-web-applications">2024-08-14 Web applications</h1>

<p>For my own peace of mind, I have resolved to no longer think of websites as &ldquo;websites&rdquo;. Instead, there are <em>web documents</em> and <em>web applications</em>. I find it easier to accept to use a browser like Firefox like a virtual computer for web applications. Many of the websites these days are in fact web applications.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no point in railing against web applications. I like to write web applications! And I use many of them myself, too.
Things like <a href="Face_Generator">Face Generator</a>, <a href="Text_Mapper">Text Mapper</a> or <a href="Hex_Describe">Hex Describe</a> are impossible to do as documents. In an emergency, you could have a form that then generates a PDF to download, maybe? But is that really preferable? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t get me started on writing native graphical user-interface applications. It takes so much energy to get it right. It gives me a headache. I tried. Take a look at <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/gridmapper-local.git/">Gridmapper with Common Lisp and SDL2</a>, if you want. Compare it with regular <a href="Gridmapper">Gridmapper</a>. Is that really preferable? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>And the reverse is also not cool. I wrote a text user interface tool to generate maps, which can then be downloaded as SVG files. Give <a href="Hex_Populate">Hex Populate</a> a try, it works over SSH. Is that really preferable? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried Gemtext for a long time. I was very much into <a href="Gemini">Gemini</a>. But these days I no longer think it&rsquo;s the answer. It&rsquo;s like a piece of performance art: the doing of it is a statement. People who step into it are confounded, their beliefs challenged. It&rsquo;s good art! It&rsquo;s interesting technology. But it&rsquo;s not a replacement for <em>web applications</em>. It&rsquo;s not even a good format for <em>web documents</em>! I want inline emphasis – bold, italics, code – and accessible tables with captions and cell navigation, and row-spans, and column-spans. I tried writing code that translated Wikipedia tables into ASCII tables to be used as pre-formatted text in Gemtext. It&rsquo;s hard to do well with the sizing of columns, the line wrapping in cells, the limited space available in a terminal, and when you&rsquo;ve solved all of that, it&rsquo;s still hell for people with bad eye-sight or cognitive problems trying to understand what they&rsquo;re seeing. It&rsquo;s terrible. You could of course do away with all tables. But is that really preferable? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>And so… there&rsquo;s that bifurcation in the road. For this site, for most of the pages that I think of as <em>web documents</em>, I write (or generate) HTML that doesn&rsquo;t require fonts or scripts. If one uses browsers such as eww, links2, w3m, lynx or dillo, it should just work. I wasn&rsquo;t going to convert the corporate web, anyway.</p>

<p>I still serve my site as Gemini and Gopher. But I do it as a political statement, as a piece of performance art.</p>

<p>At the same time, I swallow my pride and <a href="2018-11-14_Firefox_Setup">setup Firefox</a>.</p>

<div style="text-align: center">⁂</div>

<p>I still wish we would all push for a web that does not require a lot of resources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nearly all growth in smartphone sales volume since the mid &lsquo;10s occured in the &lsquo;budget&rsquo; and &lsquo;low-end&rsquo; categories. … if portals fail to work well on phones, smartphone-dependent folks are predictably excluded … Framework-based, &ldquo;full-stack&rdquo; development is now the default in Silicon Valley, but should obviously be avoided in universal services. – <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/08/the-landscape/">Reckoning: Part 1 – The Landscape</a></p>

## Pundits are idiots, part 2,297,748

So what are we doing <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C-sPAfVJ9GD">on Threads</a> and why does Facebook (aka Meta) want to get the best minds of Twitter using their software. I am not a lawyer and I haven't read the user agreement, but that said, I bet it has something to do with building out their AI model so they can compete with OpenAI, Google, Amazon, Apple, etc.

The best journalism is coming <a href="https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq">from the candidate</a>. I think you could make a pretty good hour-length show on MSNBC with 12 of their posts, five minutes each, one after the other, with a small panel of pundits quickly snarking about what they just saw. Go have a look at <a href="https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq">the feed</a> and see if you agree. The best thing about it is that the writing is totally blogger-style.

## Texas Sues GM for Collecting Driving Data without Consent

date: 2024-08-14, updated: 2024-08-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Texas is suing General Motors for collecting driver data without consent and then selling it to insurance companies:</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/13/business/texas-sues-general-motors-driver-data/index.html">CNN</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In car models from 2015 and later, the Detroit-based car manufacturer allegedly used technology to &#8220;collect, record, analyze, and transmit highly detailed driving data about each time a driver used their vehicle,&#8221; according to the AG&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>General Motors sold this information to several other companies, including to at least two companies for the purpose of generating &#8220;Driving Scores&#8221; about GM&#8217;s customers, the AG alleged. The suit said those two companies then sold these scores to insurance companies...</p></blockquote>

## Harris makes me proud

date: 2024-08-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I am so impressed with how well the new Democratic Party is running this campaign. Latest innovation, they're going to do at least one public rally during the convention, so everyone can be part of the celebration, and I plan to watch every minute of it. What I don't want to witness is what the journalists try to provoke. I've been to two DNCs and later heard what they were talking about on CNN, and my god they invented crises that simply didn't exist. Who's going to have time to call them out because no one at the convention is watching TV. </p>
<p>I heard on a podcast yesterday that it's weird that Harris is polling as well as the <a href="https://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/2021/11/23/the-generic-ballot-what-to-know-why-its-so-important">generic</a> Democrat, which they felt was odd because she's not a white man, which made me think that in 2024, she is the face of the Democratic Party. Obama and Hillary Clinton knocked down those barriers, and now it would feel strange if the candidate at the top of the ticket were not interracial and female.</p>
<p>I'm proud that my country has nominated such an attractive group of talented people with such fierce competence and humility. For these moments I wish I had a new graphic to put in the margin to symbolize the United States. We're strong, and we win, and when we don't we get back up and fight. Uncle Sam is a great symbol. But we've yet to create the interracial and female version that symbol. </p>
<p>One more thing, there are a lot of white male voters to be courted and welcomed back into the fold. Trump has had the advantage there, but it doesn't have to be that way. A hand reached out in brotherhood could turn this election into the kind of landslide we need to cleanse our political system its flirtation with fascism. </p>

## Ezra Klein and Nate Silver

date: 2024-08-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I had another morning of driving around so I listened to a bunch of podcasts about how the campaign is going, all good news for Democrats which of course makes me happy. The last podcast I listened to was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-nate-silver.html">Ezra Klein's interview with Nate Silver</a>. I only listened to the first 20 minutes because I ran out of time. I may pick it up later on my afternoon walk (it's a gorgeous day in the mountains). </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/13/trafficUptight.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">They talked about their bond as old school bloggers. I didn't know either of them when they were starting out, which is kind of sad -- most of the bloggers I heard from in that period were mad at me the way they are mad at Elon Musk now. Both Silver and Klein campaigned for Biden to step aside, which I felt it was inappropriate -- for Silver who was/is a trusted polling analyst, and Klein who is a columnist for the NYT. I had already listened to Klein's interview with Nancy Pelosi. But I really don't like that both of them crossed a line I felt they had no business crossing, becoming an advocate rather than a journalist. I can't thikn about either of them without thinking about that. But I listened anyway, because I'm interested in both, and esp the combination. </p>
<p>The discussion was interesting and even agreeable until Klein asked Silver about his relationship with Peter Thiel. I had read that Silver was connected to Thiel in some way. Before they moved on neither commented on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker#Hulk_Hogan_sex_tape">Thiel's funding</a> of the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that destroyed Gawker. I don't know how they can both, for their careers, which depend on free speech, still have a kind word for Thiel. I never liked Gawker, they made fun of me, and others, in horrific ways, that weren't even based on facts, the kind of bullshit pre-teens make up about people when they can't think of anything else to say. Even though they hurt me, embarrassed me, aroused my hate, even if I had the kind of money Thiel has, I never in a million years would use that money to destroy them. </p>
<p>Thiel's wealth is a weapon aimed at all our freedom. This is something imho that has to at least be <i>mentioned</i> when a journalist talks about Thiel, and neither of them did. I guess they feel safe from Thiel's attacks, perhaps because they have adjusted their writing so as to never risk offending him, which totally undermines their integrity, if so. A good way to prove that's not true would be to never mention him without saying his behavior the Hulk Hogan vs Gawker was reprehensible. </p>
<p>I still listened, even though they provoked my ire in a very fundamental way. I'd be interested in hearing from them, as a fellow old school blogger, if they justify Thiel's funding of the Hogan lawsuit and if so, how. But I expect that both of them consider themselves in an elite class and wouldn't deign to explain themselves, or the truth is something they don't want disclosed. Either way, to be blogger-blunt, they both suck. </p>
<p>Update: I listened to more of the interview. I think these guys need to get out more. The reason Harris is having such a strong response is that we the voters are desperate to not have another term for Trump. We understand the stakes in the election. You always try to reduce it to numbers, when the facts are available at a more human level. The reason we love Kamala is born of desperation. Stop talking to each other, you already know why we care, because underneath it all <i>you</i> care because you're human and you come from America too. And btw about VCs, I know a lot about them, I'm assuming at some point Klein will leave the NYT to make millions with Thiel, and I imagine Silver is already doing that, but you both have the disease. You assume great money makes people interesting. It can make them dangerous. </p>

## On the Voynich Manuscript

date: 2024-08-13, updated: 2024-08-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Really interesting <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/09/decoding-voynich-manuscript/679157/?gift=YFkW3a8mqv4T0YBMneIYIuIiYZJAqQJorEylZzhFIOw&#038;utm_source=copy-link&#038;utm_medium=social&#038;utm_campaign=share&#038;fbclid=IwY2xjawEhtldleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHdyEbPaL8wyhs9wMtkGXHfevH3pYDJ2kW9Oax8-NaxAEyKrmldht_ShcSg_aem_gPeUGAVQrTw8m61YZhwgig">article</a> on the ancient-manuscript scholars who are applying their techniques to the Voynich Manuscript.</p>
<p>No one has been able to understand the writing yet, but there are some new understandings:</p>
<blockquote><p>Davis presented her findings at the medieval-studies conference and <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/56/article/754633/pdf">published them in 2020</a> in the journal <i>Manuscript Studies</i>. She had hardly solved the Voynich, but she’d opened it to new kinds of investigation. If five scribes had come together to write it, the manuscript was probably the work of a community, rather than of a single deranged mind or con artist. Why the community used its own language, or code, remains a mystery. Whether it was a cloister of alchemists, or mad monks, or a group like the medieval Béguines&#8212;a secluded order of Christian women&#8212;required more study. But the marks of frequent use signaled that the manuscript served some routine, perhaps daily function...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web

date: 2024-08-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-11-serving-bare-git-on-the-web">2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web</h1>

<p>In the old days, I used <code>cgit</code> to render my git repositories on the web.
It&rsquo;s simple to set up since it&rsquo;s a CGI script.
This is ideal for URLs that get very few hits.
When nobody is requesting the URL, the CGI script isn&rsquo;t running and no resources are being used.
When a URL is requested, however, the CGI script loads, the interpreter loads, the libraries load, the script executes…
It&rsquo;s an expensive end-point!
And you know how it is.
The web is full of leeches and bad bots, crawlers and idiots.
Having an expensive end-point means it needs protection.</p>

<p>For I while I thought that <code>legit</code> was the answer.
It was nice and fast and all that.
But recently, <code>git clone</code> no longer worked.
It calls <code>git upload-pack</code> as an intermediate workaround for <a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/1062">#1062</a>.
This was failing for some reason, however.
I tinkered with it for a while but didn&rsquo;t get anywhere.</p>

<p>Then I started thinking about <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a>&rsquo;s post on <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos">hosting git repos</a>.
I made some changes to my Apache config and now <code>git clone</code> works again.</p>

<p>The key is that you need a <code>post-update</code> hook that calls <code>git update-server-info</code>.
Each git repository already comes with a <code>post-update.sample</code> hook containing the necessary code, so I needed to loop over all the bare repositories I had and rename the example hook.</p>

<p>Using the Fish shell:</p>

<pre><code>for d in *.git
    sudo -u git mv $d/hooks/post-update.sample $d/hooks/post-update
end
</code></pre>

<p>Sadly, this is not good enough.</p>

<p>In order to generate an <code>index.html</code> file for every repository, I need a hook that regenerates it.
If you know how to determine whether regeneration can be skipped, I&rsquo;d love to hear how to that.</p>

<p>This hook also updates or adds the <code>AddDescription</code> lines I need.</p>

<p>I prepared a hook that I wanted to install in every repository and saved it as <code>~/post-update</code>.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like, using the Fish shell:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish

git update-server-info

# create index.html
set branch (git branch --show-current)
set template (cat /home/git/.readme.html | string collect)
set title (basename (pwd))
set body (git show $branch:README.md | cmark --to html | string collect)
printf &quot;$template&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &quot;$body&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &gt; index.html

# update description
set description (cat description)
sed --in-place=~ --expression &quot;/ $title/d&quot; /home/git/.htaccess
printf &quot;AddDescription \&quot;$description\&quot; $title\n&quot; &gt;&gt; /home/git/.htaccess
</code></pre>

<p>(I need the title twice, once for the title and once for the reminder on how to clone.)</p>

<p>I turn Markdown into HTML using <code>cmark</code>.
Common Mark is the closest we have to a standard, I guess.</p>

<p>The template <code>/home/git/.readme.html</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;format-detection&quot; content=&quot;telephone=no&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
html { max-width: 70ch; padding: 1ch; margin: auto; }
body { hyphens: auto; }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://src.alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
%s&lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Clone&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/%s&lt;/mark&gt;
      &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So now I needed to distribute the <code>post-update</code> hook to every repository and run it once.
I wrote yet another Fish script, <code>~/recreate-index</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for d in /home/git/*.git
    echo $d
    cd $d
    cp ~/post-update hooks/
    chown git:git hooks/post-update
    chmod 775 hooks/post-update
    sudo -u git git hook run post-update
end
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently hosting 95 repositories according to <code>ls -d /home/git/*.git | wc -l</code>.
Some of these don&rsquo;t have a <code>README.md</code> file.
Should I ever touch them again, I&rsquo;ll have to investigate.</p>

<p>Now, for the Apache web server – I changed my site to the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerAdmin alex@alexschroeder.ch
    ServerName src.alexschroeder.ch
    Include conf-enabled/blocklist.conf
    SSLEngine on
    DocumentRoot /home/git
   &lt;Directory /home/git&gt;
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>/home/git</code> directory has an <code>.htaccess</code> file that starts out containing the following:</p>

<pre><code>HeaderName .top.html
IndexOptions SuppressIcon SuppressSize FancyIndexing HTMLTable IgnoreCase
IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
IndexHeadInsert &quot;&lt;meta name=\&quot;viewport\&quot; content=\&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\&quot;&gt;&quot;
IndexOptions Charset=UTF-8
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>.top.html</code> file contains a fragment to add to the top of the index:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
body { max-width: 80ch }
table { overflow-x: auto }
td { padding: 0.5ex 1em 0 0; white-space: nowrap }
td:nth-child(3) { white-space: wrap }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Hello!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'm Alex Schroeder.
  These are my source code repositories. You can find out more about me on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. There, you'll also find a page
  listing ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Contact&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As for the git repositories, you should be able to clone them as they are.
  For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/oddmu.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For more about this setup, see
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos&quot;&gt;How to host git repos&lt;/a&gt;
  by &lt;a href=&quot;https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra&quot;&gt;@Sandra&lt;/a&gt; and my post,
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/edit/2024-08-11-bare-git&quot;&gt;2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/">Take a look</a>!</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Git">#Git</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-12</strong>. I wondered about links from the README to local files.
Right now, linking to images and files hosted in the same repository doesn&rsquo;t work since they don&rsquo;t exist in the raw repository.
The question then becomes, as far as I am concerned, whether this README is supposed to speak to developers or end-users?
If it is for developers, then pictures, screenshots, PDF files and all of that don&rsquo;t need to be linked from the repository.
If you are interested in these things, do a <code>git clone --depth 1</code> and investigate locally.</p>

<p>If the repository is for the end users, however, things are harder.
The <code>post-update</code> hook should extract all the local files linked to from the README.
Something like the following, perhaps:</p>

<pre><code>for file in (printf &quot;%s\n&quot; $body | /home/oddmu/oddmu links - | egrep -v '^(https?:|mailto:|/)')
    set dir (dirname $file)
    if test ! -d $dir
        mkdir -p $dir
    end
    echo $file; sudo -u git git show $branch:$file &gt; $file
end
</code></pre>

<p>This uses <a href="oddmu">oddmu</a> to extract the links from a Markdown file, creates the necessary directories and checks out the files.</p>

<p>But if the files are no longer linked from the README, they are not deleted.
If a directory is linked from the README (I have done this! 🤦), the checkout won&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>I think the better way forward is to move this information elsewhere.
The README is not the documentation.</p>

<p>And with that, I think I did it! Serving git repositories from static files. A single directory per project containing the bare git data and a single <code>index.html</code> file. No more gazillion end points for crawlers to lose themselves.</p>

When Google tells you it's easy to convert a site to HTTPS they're wrong. It's an insurmountable job for scripting.com. 30 years of writing is on that domain, lots of different runtimes on lots of different domains which would also have to be converted. Images in all the pages. All that breaks when you flip the switch. I can't walk away from a big part of my life's work. Sorry, not for Google. Every time someone assumes I'm to blame for this situation, that's how Google has tricked you. I followed the rules. They broke them.

## Taxonomy of Generative AI Misuse

date: 2024-08-12, updated: 2024-08-15, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting paper: &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13843">Generative AI Misuse: A Taxonomy of Tactics and Insights from Real-World Data</a>”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Generative, multimodal artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers transformative potential across industries, but its misuse poses significant risks. Prior research has shed light on the potential of advanced AI systems to be exploited for malicious purposes. However, we still lack a concrete understanding of how GenAI models are specifically exploited or abused in practice, including the tactics employed to inflict harm. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of GenAI misuse tactics, informed by existing academic literature and a qualitative analysis of approximately 200 observed incidents of misuse reported between January 2023 and March 2024. Through this analysis, we illuminate key and novel patterns in misuse during this time period, including potential motivations, strategies, and how attackers leverage and abuse system capabilities across modalities (e.g. image, text, audio, video) in the wild...</p></blockquote>

<p>My sister just got back from two months in Europe and returned bearing gifts, including this adorable onesie for our baby in utero that I just had to share 😅 I couldn&rsquo;t help but quip, “Ah, a country I&rsquo;ve never been to!” (in good humour – it&rsquo;s super cute, I was very appreciative!) but seriously, I guess I do have some Irish heritage, and therefore, so does our baby, so it still works. It&rsquo;s a gorgeous onesie in any case 😂</p>

A lot of people are thinking that <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C-jAIEDp-9K">Threads</a> is the new "nice" version of The Original Twitter, but folks, that's pure <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a> -- remember who owns Threads and ask yourself if you want that dude to be in charge of our political organizing network. We need <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/08/04/itsTimeToCreateOurOwnMediaAgain.html">something</a> better.

Idea for a neat product from Automattic or really anyone: Configure WordPress for writing a book, hook it up to an AI service that can always turn that site into prose, reorganized into chapters, however you'd like, on demand, in an instant. You could use an outliner to arrange the table of contents and it could automatically generate a back of the book index. Technologically I think today's AI is ready to do this, just needs to be packaged. Charge a fair price for the service, esp at the beginning it would totally be worth it. Who knows where it would lead. I bet a lot of writers would use it, I certainly would.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/11/zuckerberg.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I carry two phones, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_13_Pro">iPhone 13 Pro</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_6">Pixel 6 Pro</a>. The latter is my main phone, and I prefer it to the Apple phone, not sure why, it's what I use for most things. I need the iPhone because I use an Apple Watch. Lately there's been some trouble with the screen on the Pixel 6, on certain gestures, the right edge lights up in bright green and then immediately returns to normal. I'm thinking the display may be about to fail? It might be time for a new phone. So I went to the Pixel site to see what they have that's new and found that they're announcing a new phone, the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ac8f1461-9923-43da-87b9-b951ff2f32b2">Pixel 9</a>, on Tuesday. So I immediately, of course, dropped the idea of buying an upgrade today, why not wait till the new version is out. I looked over the teaser, guessing that AI figures big in this release. Not sure how I feel about that because the last thing I want to do is switch over to Google's AI from my beloved ChatGPT. Kind of the same thing I see happening with Threads re Twitter.

I don't mind doing hard work, I just don't want to hear what the NYT-centered media has to say because it's all <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a>. If I have to listen to nonstop bullshit, I'd rather hear from people who tell me we can have a bright future, than the usual NYT-spawned <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a>. It's just <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a>. I'm tired of <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a>. That's all I have to say about <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a> for now at least. Have a nice day.

At some point ChatGPT will imho be programmed to compile C apps to JavaScript, for example, even large ones with bugs.
