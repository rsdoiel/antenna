<p>Romantasy is a subgenre getting considerable attention and India Holton enters the field with a new series, that is a lot of fun. The first book, <strong>The Ornithologist‚Äôs Field Guide to Love</strong>, introduces two academics, Beth Pickering and Devon Lock¬≠ley, who specialize in the study and, if necessary, capture of thaumaturgic birds.

## Estimated Play Time

date: 2024-11-09, from: IF Database News

You can now use the "Estimated Play Time" form on any game to submit a "vote" for how long it takes to finish the game.

<ul>
<li>Vote only if you've played the game.</li>
<li>Vote on how long it would take to get to one final ending without hints or a walkthrough.</li>
<li>Time spent away from the game doesn't count.</li>
<li>Times don't need to be exact. Good-faith estimates are fine.</li></ul>

<p>We'll display the median time vote near the top of that game's page.</p>

<p><b>This feature is very, very new.</b> We've got a lot of <a href="https://github.com/iftechfoundation/ifdb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22estimated+play+time%22">ideas for improvements</a>, and we've got a <a href="https://intfiction.org/t/ifdb-what-are-your-thoughts-about-a-field-for-length-of-time/72064/27?u=dfabulich">public discussion going on the intfiction.org forum</a>.</p>

## JSON APIs

date: 2024-11-09, from: IF Database News

Most of our <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/">IFDB API</a> endpoints now support JSON.

<ul>
    <li>You can <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/search">search for games</a> and get JSON results</li>
    <li>You can <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/viewgame">view an individual game</a> and get JSON results (now including tags and complete, unstripped HTML!)</li>
    <li>You can <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/taggame">tag games</a> by posting a JSON array of tags</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the old APIs still work in XML mode, but <b>JSON is the preferred format for all new code.</b> (The API to add/edit games is still XML-only, for now.)</p>

<p>In addition, we deprecated the <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/gametags">gametags API</a>. You can view tags on an individual game with the <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/viewgame">viewgame API</a>, or view your own tags with the <a href="https://ifdb.org/api/search">search API</a>, like this:</p>

## Removed Clubs

date: 2024-11-09, from: IF Database News

The IFDB "clubs" feature has been removed. Nobody was using the feature, partly because <a href="https://github.com/iftechfoundation/ifdb/issues/950">clubs didn't do very much</a>.

## SF in Japan

date: 2024-11-09, from: Locus Magazine

<p class="subhead" xml:lang="en-us"></p>
<p class="normal" xml:lang="en-us">In my previous article on Japanese science fiction, published in¬†Locus¬†in 2016, I likened my experience of living in Japan to Urashima Taro‚Äôs rise from his present world (eighth century) to the world of the future, with its fast-forward jumble of pop-culture iconography. This sense of Japan and its current state in science fiction is even more relevant in the wake of COVID, as these changes have only accelerated.  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/11/sf-in-japan/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Kree by Manuela Draeger: Review by Jake Casella Brookins

date: 2024-11-09, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Kree</strong>, Manuela Draeger (University of Min¬≠nesota Press 978-1-51791-512-4, $21.95, 280pp, tp) October 2024.</p>
<p>Manuela Draeger‚Äôs <strong>Kree </strong>is so immedi¬≠ately violent that I wasn‚Äôt sure it was going to be for me. Somehow, though, within just a few chapters, the novel‚Äôs mix of haunting imagery and almost humorous un¬≠predictability grew so compelling that I found myself wanting to track down everything else the author has written.

## Write On: Screenwriting Coach Lee Jessup & Literary Manager Jeff Portnoy

date: 2024-11-08, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper">

</div> 
<div>
  ‚ÄúThe streaming bubble finally popped, and I think the tip of the spear that popped it was the double strikes we had last year and now we‚Äôre calling it the great contraction. It‚Äôs a really tough time for up-and-coming writers to break in. It‚Äôs tough for everyone, even up-and-coming agents and managers, anyone coming out to Hollywood to pursue a career. It‚Äôs one of the toughest times ever, so you need to be patient,‚Äù says literary manager Jeff Portnoy, of Bellevue Productions. &nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>On today‚Äôs podcast, guest host Lee Jessup, Hollywood‚Äôs leading screenwriting career coach and judge of the Big Break screenwriting competition, interviews Jeff Portnoy, literary manager for Bellevue Productions. They discuss the current state of the industry and how it‚Äôs affecting writers.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been encouraging a lot of new writers to focus on features at the moment and explaining how bleak the TV staffing market is right now. So if they have hopes of getting staffed, it‚Äôs very difficult right now. Typically, if we had a client who wants to write in the TV space, we‚Äôd help them get a TV agent and we, the agents and I, would go out and try to get them staffed. But agents aren‚Äôt really signing anyone below mid level right now, so they‚Äôre not taking on those up-and-coming writers,‚Äù says Portnoy.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>But there is hope considering business trends are always cyclical. Portnoy shares this advice about writing spec features in this climate: ‚ÄúYou want to stand out and that comes down to your ideas. The execution has to be great. It‚Äôs about choosing ideas that really stand out in a pack ‚Äì the words I like to use are loud, bold, audacious. Managers, agents, producers ‚Äì we see thousands of loglines a month and if we see a logline that‚Äôs loud, audacious and bold, it‚Äôs going to stand out.‚Äù

<p>‚Äú<strong>Every Hopeless Thing</strong>‚Äù by <strong>Tia Tashiro </strong>in the July issue of Clarkesworld is a sweet story about a spacefaring pilot, Elodie, who while scavenging on a supposedly abandoned Earth discovers a whole population living underground.

## State of Paradise by Laura van den Berg: Review by Ian Mond

date: 2024-11-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>State of Paradise</strong>, Laura van den Berg (Farrar, Straus, Giroux 978-0-37461-220-7, $27.00, 224pp, hc) July 2024.</p>

  ‚ÄúI think [ 
 <em>Here</em>] has some of the imagination of 
 <em>Forrest Gump</em>, but it‚Äôs not 
 <em>Forrest Gump</em>. It‚Äôs a different animal. I mean, it has the same kind of humanity to it, which is what I‚Äôm pretty good at,‚Äù says Eric Roth about his latest film 
 <em>Here</em>, co-written and directed by Robert Zemeckis and reuniting actors Tom Hanks and Robin Wright.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>On today‚Äôs podcast, we speak with Oscar winning screenwriter Eric Roth about the challenges of writing the screenplay for 
 <em>Here</em> that mostly takes place in one room, with a fixed camera that never moves. The movie explores the ordinary lives of multiple generations of families in a way that many will find relatable, heartbreaking and, at times, claustrophobic.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure [the characters in 
 <em>Here</em>] are extraordinary or not, but they show the length and breadth of what people can and can‚Äôt do and when they‚Äôre trapped. I think when it works that way dramatically, it‚Äôs quite lovely and quite beautiful. I don‚Äôt want to use the word profound, but I think the [movie] is profound to a certain extent because it is just about the regularity of life. And that, from dinosaurs to the future, it‚Äôs going to keep going. Hopefully people will find great joy in how they‚Äôre living and I‚Äôm sure great pain too, but I think that‚Äôs just sort of the circle of life,‚Äù he says.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>We also discuss some of his other films like 
 <em>Forrest Gump</em>, for which he won an Oscar, and 
 <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>He shared this advice about using subtext in screenplays. ‚ÄúI think that I‚Äôm always trying to find a way to enhance the scene with not only subtext, but with some kind of metaphor and make it possibly more interesting as to getting to the root of people‚Äôs feelings without them having to vomit out what they‚Äôre saying you know. It‚Äôs not easy, but I think as I‚Äôve gotten more successful and more accomplished at it,‚Äù he says.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>To hear more of Eric Roth‚Äôs advice for screenwriters, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;

date: 2024-11-04, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Smothermoss</strong>, Alisa Alering (Tin House 978-1-959-03058-4, $17.95, tp, 256pp) July 2024.</p>
<p>Alisa Alering‚Äôs debut novel <strong>Smothermoss </strong>is a master class in conveying both a physically and psychologically oppressive atmosphere. Set in a small rural Appalachian town in the early 1980s, the novel follows the tough adventures of sisters Sheila and Angie. At seventeen years old, Sheila is acutely aware of her ‚Äò‚Äòotherness,‚Äô‚Äô a kid all too often bullied and  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/11/smothermoss-by-alisa-alering-review-by-colleen-mondor/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Cory Doctorow: Hard (Sovereignty) Cases Make Bad (Internet) Law

date: 2024-11-04, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Let‚Äôs start with two obvious facts:</p>

<li>The internet is a communications medium, that</li>
<li>crosses international borders.</li>

<p>That means that every single policy question related to the internet will have:</p>

<li>a) A free expression dimension, and</li>
<li>b) A national sovereignty dimension.</li>

<p>With that out of the way&#8230;.</p>
<p>Late last August, Pavel Durov ‚Äì the billionaire owner of the Telegram app ‚Äì was arrested by French authorities after he landed his private  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/11/cory-doctorow-hard-sovereignty-cases-make-bad-internet-law/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Fiyah, Flash Fiction Online, Escape Pod, and Strange Horizons: Short Fiction Reviews by Charles Payseur

date: 2024-11-03, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Fiyah Summer ‚Äô24
Flash Fiction Online 7/24
Escape Pod 7/25/24
Strange Horizons 7/15/24, 7/29/24, 8/12/24</p>
<p>The Summer ‚Äô24 Fiyah theme is disability. The issue seeks to break down stereotypes and expectations that Black people are monolithic and separate from experiences with disability, and it does sharp work of just that, as in <strong>F. Kirk</strong>‚Äôs ‚Äú<strong>Worms Fill My Mouth</strong>‚Äù, which finds Isaac experiencing an acute horror that the  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/11/fiyah-flash-fiction-online-escape-pod-and-strange-horizons-short-fiction-reviews-by-charles-payseur/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
