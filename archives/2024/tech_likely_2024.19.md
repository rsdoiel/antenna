**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-05-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

It's pretty easy to create a <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> news service for your friends or co-workers, and it'll plug into a lot of the stuff we're working on now for presenting news without requiring people to learn a feed reader. That's a bridge too far for many people. In other words, your understanding of feeds (RSS, Atom, etc) can be of service to others. And by collecting useful sources of news, maybe even insightful ones, we can help upgrade the quality of news we all get. The first step is to learn how to use FeedLand, and <a href="https://docs.feedland.com/gettingstarted.md">it's pretty easy</a>, esp if you already understand feeds. And with categories and OPML subscription lists, you can organize your feed reading everywhere, not just in FeedLand.

## COSMIC improves its application store, display mirroring, and more

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

As its first alpha release is closing in, we have another monthly update about COSMIC, System76&#8217;s new Linux desktop environment written in Rust. This month, they&#8217;ve further polished and shored up their application store, imaginatively named COSMIC App Store, and it&#8217;s supposedly incredibly fast &#8211; something I can&#8217;t say for its GNOME and KDE counterparts, which tend to be so slow I&#8217;ve always just defaulted to updating through the command line, mostly. The file manager now has support for GVfs (GNOME Virtual file system) for making external storage like USB drives work properly, and Greeter login screen, Edit text editor, drag and drop, and copy/paste have been improved in various ways as well. Theming has seen a lot of work this month, with support for icon themes added to the App Library, fixed applet sizes, and more tweaks, while light themes have been disabled for now to fix a number of issues with colour selection being too dark. There&#8217;s also display mirroring now, which even works when the individual displays have different resolutions, orientations, and refresh rates. Pop!_OS is now also being built for ARM64, which makes sense because System76 is now also selling ARM servers. There&#8217;s also a bunch of work being done by the community as the alpha release nears.

## Opening windows in Linux with sockets, bare hands and 200 lines of C

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

X Server is slowly being deprecated in the Linux world and being replaced Wayland. Still X11 is an interesting protocol to look at from the perspective of binary communication and management of resource which require fast speeds. In this post I tried to cover basic information and create a simple but working app that is simple, defined in single file and easily compiles. No external code except libc was used. I find it fascinating when you can open black boxes and see how gears move each other. ↫ Hereket As much as the time of X has come and is now finally in the process of going, it&#8217;s still an incredibly powerful set of tools that even in a bare state can do way, way more than you think. X has come with its own window manager &#8211; twm &#8211; for decades, and it includes several basic applications like xedit, xclock, xterm, xeyes. Twm is actually pretty cool, and includes some features, like iconify to desktop, that I wish still existed in modern desktop environments. It&#8217;s quite bare-bones, though, and I doubt there&#8217;s anyone out there unironically using it today. As the linked article notes, even without advanced, complex libraries, toolkits, desktop environments, and so on, it&#8217;s entirely possible to create fully functional windows and applications with X. Of course, this makes perfect sense and shouldn&#8217;t be surprising &#8211; it&#8217;s the X Window System, after all &#8211; but you so rarely hear or read about it that you&#8217;d almost forget and just assume something like GNOME or KDE is an absolute requirement to use X.

<a href="https://stackoverflow.co/company/press/archive/openai-partnership">StackExchange and OpenAI</a> have made a deal. I used to use StackExchange all the time, now I never do, ChatGPT is much better. There's a lot of anxiety out there, it seems but this is like shutting the barn door after the horse has <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/close_the_stable_door_after_the_horse_has_bolted">bolted</a>. There was a time when StackExchange was a godsend for programmers. But that time has passed. Here's a <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/7f8d9567-2790-4e9a-b699-0b87bfad1174">demo</a>. I was trying to figure out why some ancient code wasn't working. I never understood how it worked, and now I had to figure out what was going wrong. So I debugged it, carefully, step by step, with ChatGPT. It's as if I was working with another programmer who had read and fully understood every StackExchange message, and was willing to work with me for no pay to get to the bottom of the problem. This is what we call disruption. It's a whole new level of programming. Here's the <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/7f8d9567-2790-4e9a-b699-0b87bfad1174">transcript</a>.

## ChromeOS App Mall unifies app discovery for Chromebooks

date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News

We’ve been on the lookout for the arrival of the ChromeOS App Mall for a few months now. First discovered back in March, the new App Mall is arriving to do one, simple task: put the apps users want in one place to be found a Chromebook. While we have access to web apps, PWAs, Android apps and Linux apps on Chromebooks, it’s not always clear how to go about finding them. Should you install the web version or the Play Store version? Which Play Store apps install a PWA versus an Android app? Where should you go to find the right one for you? ↫ Robby Payne at Chrome Unboxed ChromeOS definitely needs a more unified, single place to find applications, and this seems like exactly what&#8217;s happening here.

## I Bought a Steam Deck

date: 2024-05-09, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>A couple of days I posted about <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2024/05/getting-back-into-the-sims-games.html">wanting to get back into The Sims (2 &amp; 4)</a>. What I didn&rsquo;t mention then, that I will now, is I&rsquo;d kinda been wanting to get back into casual gaming already. I&rsquo;ve never been a real Gamer™ exactly, but I have purchased a bunch of indie games through Steam and itch.io over the years, and spent a fair bit of time&hellip; you know&hellip; casually gaming. For the most part I like turn-based <abbr title="Role-Playing Games">RPGs</abbr>, simulation games, and the occasional puzzle game. Nothing with too grim or dreary an atmosphere. And, of course, I&rsquo;ve only really played games on computers (well, and the occasional mobile game, I guess). My parents never let us have a gaming console growing up, and with my disability it&rsquo;s too hard to use a controller anyway – my right hand just isn&rsquo;t dexterous enough to operate its side of the controls.</p>
<p>When I was playing a lot of indie games between about 2018–2020, I mostly did so on a desktop computer, running Linux. Not only did a ton of indie games support Linux natively, but Steam rolled out an embedded implementation of Wine called Proton, so most games <em>without</em> official Linux versions worked on Linux, too. I mean, in 2017 I&rsquo;d been using PlayOnLinux to play <cite>The Sims 4</cite>, so I already knew Wine wasn&rsquo;t too bad by that time, but I guess Steam&rsquo;s real triumph was in rolling the compatibility layer into the client, moving a lot of the hassle behind the scenes and out of the player&rsquo;s way. Even though I haven&rsquo;t been playing games so much since 2020, as I understand it, Proton has just got better and smoother ever since, such that these days the only games that really don&rsquo;t work with it are always-online multiplayer games with kernel-level anticheat, which I don&rsquo;t play, anyway. At any rate, even five years ago, life as a Linux-using indie gamer was good.</p>
<p><em>But</em>, time passes. I stopped being able to use that desktop so much when a) the monitor broke and, because it was within warranty, I spent a couple of months working through the warranty process with the retailer instead of just buying a new one; and b) Viv started working from home a lot when the Covid pandemic began, and commandeered that desk and computer for himself. I started using a MacBook Air as my primary computer, and switching back and forth between it and the desktop was a bit of a hassle, and since the only thing the desktop was really <em>better</em> for was playing games, I just&hellip; stopped doing that so much. I could still play a number of games on the Mac anyway&hellip; just not the more demanding ones, but also not the ones <em>so</em> undemanding that they only had 32-bit versions, and definitely not the ones that lack native Mac versions. (There&rsquo;s no equivalent of Proton for Mac.) But a few games, sure.</p>
<p>Anyway, getting to the Steam Deck. It had been playing on my mind for a while that I really did have this backlog of games that I should probably work through at some point. The desktop has become really inconvenient to use (and as I mentioned in the Sims post, its Linux install is currently not even working properly, for reasons I have not been able to work out), and my MacBook Air isn&rsquo;t designed for gaming. I&rsquo;d kind of presumed that the eventual answer would be to buy <em>another</em> Linux computer – preferably a laptop, for the portability – but a gaming laptop is like AUD$3000 and not even really very portable and honestly I didn&rsquo;t even <em>want</em> a whole new computer, just a gaming device, and then one day the obvious answer finally hit me&hellip; a Steam Deck. Duh!</p>
<p>Valve, for some reason, has declined to sell Steam Decks in Australia, but you can easily buy grey-imported ones. Last week, after about a month of dithering, I took the plunge and ordered one – one of the new OLED screen ones, with 512GB storage space. Today, it arrived!</p>

  alt="a Steam Deck, switched off, sitting in its travel case"
  loading="lazy" class="u-photo u-featured"></a>
<p>There are a number of reasons I think the Steam Deck is a very exciting device. Firstly, it&rsquo;s purpose-built to make it really easy to just pick up and jump straight into a game, suspend and resume as needed, etc.. It&rsquo;s all the convenience of picking up your phone to scroll social media, except doing something that is actually fun instead of doomscrolling social media. You can use it easily on the couch (well, maybe not if your cat is as obsessed with sitting on your lap as mine, but in theory). It&rsquo;s just like&hellip; if one of the biggest obstacles to me working through my game backlog is the <em>hassle</em>, the Steam Deck should really help with that.</p>
<p>Secondly, it offers a lot of different ways to control your games (D-pad, joysticks, A/B/X/Y buttons, trackpads, a touchscreen, bumper buttons&hellip;) and <strong>they are all reconfigurable</strong>! There is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2804823261">a very detailed guide on the Steam Community site<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>. Like I mentioned in my introduction paragraph, I&rsquo;ve never been able to play with a video game controller and I wanted to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t going to have any accessibility issues with the Steam Deck. Well, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;d enable me to play the kinds of fast-paced action games or high-precision platformers that I don&rsquo;t feel able to play already, but you can totally do things like tell the D-pad to work as A/B/X/Y and use the left joystick for directions so you can control a game entirely from the left side of the device. No problem. Plus, with any game that&rsquo;s designed to work entirely with a mouse, you can just use the touchscreen. I think it&rsquo;s really cool just how customisable the Deck is in this regard.</p>
<p>And <em>thirdly</em>, I love the fact that the Steam Deck is really just a Linux computer under the hood, after all. If you remember my post about the Sims the other day, and how miffed I was that I couldn&rsquo;t play my copy of <cite>The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection</cite> on my Mac, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear that one <strong>can</strong> play it on the Steam Deck. There is <a href="https://github.com/voicemxil/TS2-Starter-Pack/wiki/Linux-Specifc-Setup-Steps">a brief guide here<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>, which links to another, seemingly more detailed, guide on YouTube. The process isn&rsquo;t quite as easy as &ldquo;find game in Steam store, purchase, install&rdquo; of course, but it&rsquo;s doable! You can also use your Steam Deck to play games from other online stores like itch.io or GOG, you can connect to most providers of cloud storage you might use to share data painlessly with your other computers, and you can install and use other software beyond games – pretty much anything available on Linux. You can connect peripherals like a keyboard, external monitor and mouse/touchpad and play like on a more traditional computer if you want. It&rsquo;s very flexible. And much, much cheaper than a gaming laptop 😁</p>
<p>At approx. AUD$1,075, it was still a bit of a splurge, but I haven&rsquo;t treated myself to any &ldquo;new shinies&rdquo; since 2020, and honestly I&rsquo;m excited to get into this thing. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes!</p>

## 2024-05-09 Hoping for the next AI winter

date: 2024-05-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-09-hoping-for-the-next-ai-winter">2024-05-09 Hoping for the next AI winter</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://chirp.enworld.org/@taichara" title="@taichara@chirp.enworld.org">@taichara</a> pointed me to a blog post that Creative Commons (CC) wrote in 2023 about the court cases against GitHub, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and the claim that their use of copyrighted works to train the machines is copyright infringement. CC does not agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Creative Commons has argued elsewhere, and others agree, I believe that this type of use should be protected by copyright’s fair use doctrine. In this blog post I will discuss what fair use is, what purpose it serves, and why I believe that using copyrighted works to train generative AI models should be permitted under this law. – <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/02/17/fair-use-training-generative-ai/">Fair Use: Training Generative AI</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t mind that blog post. For one, Fair Use is a very USA thing and I don&rsquo;t live there. Furthermore, the CC licenses don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;this material is fine for AI training&rdquo; – so whether this is fine or not will be decided by the courts. I would only worry if CC turns out to be working on a version 5 of their licenses with an explicit exception for AI training. And even then, we can keep on using version 4 of the license. There is no automatic upgrade option.</p>

<p>This is why I feel fine.</p>

<p>Imagine the Dude from The Big Lebowski saying, &ldquo;Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s just, like, their opinion…&rdquo;</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look as if CC will be changing the license. The courts still get to decide. If the courts decide in favour of free-for-all AI training, then rich people win for the moment. But even then, we can still nationalise their businesses, or prohibit AI training, or raise prices on electricity and water. The fight isn&rsquo;t over. Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a thing with lawyers. We trust people who share our values and we’d trust somebody when they write something along the lines of “AI training is terrible and AI use is dubious but what can you do, it’s in the hand of the courts, we certainly don’t support it.” But lawyers trust other lawyers who say “we’ll see what the courts say but our understanding is that nobody should stop AI training because that’s the trade-off copyright makes and we support people and corporations exercising their rights.”</p>

<p>The apparent moral support on copyright grounds is revolting, but this approach seems typical to me. They say: The point of the law is this or that. We say: The result of these actions is bad for society and bad for the climate. They are externalising all the costs. The artists and authors who want to produce new works are losing their jobs. The people double-checking the computers and their training are burning out. The communities where these corporations build their computing centres suffer from water scarcity because the water is used to cool the computers. The countries where these corporations build their computing centres need to build more power plants because so much electricity is required to train their models. The move to renewable energies is delayed. Phasing out nuclear power is delayed and more radioactive waste ends up on our lands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.
This place is not a place of honor&hellip; no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here&hellip; nothing valued is here.
– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages">Long-term nuclear waste warning messages</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what for? The people who are looking for answers get served bullshit slop that&rsquo;s wrong and hurtful and racist and misogynist. We see this in customer service degrading, in search engines degrading, in websites degrading. The corporations don&rsquo;t mind that they&rsquo;re feeding us slop as long as they are making money.</p>

<p>We are enabling this because these corporations are powerful and rich. They buy our politicians with money and promises of jobs, they don&rsquo;t pay the taxes they ought to pay and then they don&rsquo;t deliver on the jobs, and the jobs they offer are menial and subservient when we&rsquo;d prefer to be creative and free. We thought we&rsquo;d be writing and painting all day while the machines serve us but we end up serving them while they do the writing and painting, badly!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to defend against these corporations because the knowledge required to defeat them is not known to us all. We don&rsquo;t read about it in the media. Instead, they volunteer for all the posts, offer their experts, pay for their own research, write their own glowing press releases and commission promising reports. This is how regulatory capture works.</p>

<p>So yes, we should nationalise them, regulate them, force them to pay for the true cost of resources they use, outlaw their energy waste, force them to label their output, shun them. We should kick them from our company. Like a creeping disease their rot spreads, destroying the technology we built, the search engines, databases, websites, turning it all into AI slop. It is revolting.</p>

<p>And maybe copyright is not the right tool to stop corporations from training their machines on our works. But in the big picture, they are still wrong.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.coop/@eloquence" title="@eloquence@social.coop">@eloquence</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The folks who are calling such training &ldquo;theft&rdquo; might regret what they seem to be implicitly asking for, i.e. much stricter copyright. Copyright law won&rsquo;t prevent Microsoft, Google, OpenAI or Adobe from making shady licensing deals, but they&rsquo;ll prevent the free/open community from keeping up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s true, I don&rsquo;t want to ask for stricter copyright. But I still oppose all the things that are wrong with the current AI bubble.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc" title="@mcc@mastodon.social">@mcc</a> recently wrote about a similar thing: We use free software licenses in order to distribute our software for the benefit of our fellow humans but not necessarily to train the machines of corporations that are responsible for all the slop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like, heck, how am I <em>supposed</em> to rely on my code getting preserved after I lose interest, I die, BitBucket deletes every bit of Mercurial-hosted content it ever hosted, etc? Am I supposed to rely on <em>Microsoft</em> to responsibly preserve my work? Holy crud no.
We <em>want</em> people to want their code widely mirrored and distributed. That was the reason for the licenses. That was the social contract. But if machine learning means the social contract is dead, why would people want their code mirrored? – <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc/112209218607258564">mmc</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;re using copyright to keep the software free. If AI regurgitating our software from its impenetrable memories circumvents copyright it also circumvents our licenses and therefore pulls the claws and teeth free software has to fight for its freedom.</p>

<p>This is why opposing the current AI bubble is important. No matter how I look at it, the big picture shows that this kind of AI is our enemy.</p>

<p>This is why we continue fighting all the negatives these corporations bring to the table. And if it turns out that their business model doesn&rsquo;t work unless they bring all these negatives to the table, then I guess that&rsquo;s just that. We are under no obligation to support their business model. In fact, it is our right and our duty to regulate the world in order to improve it for all of us. We&rsquo;ve been doing it for a very long time.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping for the next AI winter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or even decades later. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI winter</a></p>

## PostgreSQL 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19 Released!

date: 2024-05-09, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported
versions of PostgreSQL, including 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15, and 12.19.
This release fixes one security vulnerability and over 55 bugs reported
over the last several months.</p>
<p>A security vulnerability was found in the system views
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext.html"><code>pg_stats_ext</code></a>
and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext-exprs.html"><code>pg_stats_ext_exprs</code></a>,
potentially allowing authenticated database users to see data they don't have
sufficient privileges to view. The fix for this vulnerability only fixes
fresh PostgreSQL installations, namely those that are created with the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-initdb.html"><code>initdb</code></a> utility
after this fix is applied. If you have a current PostgreSQL installation and are
concerned about this issue, please follow the instructions in the "Updating"
section for remediation steps.</p>
<p>For the full list of changes, please review the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a>.</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL 12 EOL Notice</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL 12 will stop receiving fixes on November 14, 2024. If you are
running PostgreSQL 12 in a production environment, we suggest that you make
plans to upgrade to a newer, supported version of PostgreSQL. Please see our
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/">versioning policy</a> for more
information.</p>
<h2>Security Issues</h2>

commands of other users. The most common values may reveal column values the
eavesdropper could not otherwise read or results of functions they cannot
execute.</p>
<p>This fix only fixes fresh PostgreSQL installations, namely those that are
created with the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-initdb.html"><code>initdb</code></a>
utility after this fix is applied. If you have a current PostgreSQL installation
and are concerned about this issue, please follow the instructions in the
"Updating" section for remediation steps.</p>
<p>The PostgreSQL project thanks Lukas Fittl for reporting this problem.</p>
<h2>Bug Fixes and Improvements</h2>

<h2>Updating</h2>
<p>All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases,
users are not required to dump and reload their database or use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in
order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and
update its binaries.</p>
<p>For existing installations that are impacted by CVE-2024-4317 that wish to
remediate the issue, you will have to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the SQL script <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> in the <code>share</code> directory of
your PostgreSQL installation (e.g. in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>), or download it
from the PostgreSQL git repository from one of the URLs below. You will need to
use the script that matches your major version:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">PostgreSQL 16</a>: <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE">PostgreSQL 15</a>: <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE">https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE</a></li>

</ol>
<p>From the above URLs, you can click the URL that says "raw" to download a version
that you can copy and paste.</p>
<p>Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version. If you
do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only PostgreSQL 14,
15, and 16 are affected) or your minor version is too old to have the fix.</p>
<ol>
<li>In each database of the cluster, run the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script as
a database superuser. For example, in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html"><code>psql</code></a>,
with the file located in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>, this command would look like:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code></p>
<ol>
<li>You must also execute this script in the <code>template0</code> and <code>template1</code>
databases, or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later.
To fix <code>template0</code>, you'll need to temporarily allow it accept connections. You
can do this with the following command:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;</code></p>
<p>After executing the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script in <code>template0</code> and
<code>template1</code>, you should revoke the ability for <code>template0</code> to accept
connections. You can do this with the following command:</p>
<p><code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;</code></p>
<p>Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional
post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier versions for
details.</p>

## Did GitHub Copilot really increase my productivity?

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

Yuxuan Shui, the developer behind the X11 compositor picom (a fork of Compton) published a blog post detailing their experiences with using GitHub Copilot for a year. I had free access to GitHub Copilot for about a year, I used it, got used to it, and slowly started to take it for granted, until one day it was taken away. I had to re-adapt to a life without Copilot, but it also gave me a chance to look back at how I used Copilot, and reflect &#8211; had Copilot actually been helpful to me? Copilot definitely feels a little bit magical when it works. It&#8217;s like it plucked code straight from my brain and put it on the screen for me to accept. Without it, I find myself getting grumpy a lot more often when I need to write boilerplate code &#8211; &#8220;Ugh, Copilot would have done it for me!&#8221;, and now I have to type it all out myself. That being said, the answer to my question above is a very definite &#8220;no, I am more productive without it&#8221;. Let me explain. ↫ Yuxuan Shui The two main reasons why Shui eventually realised Copilot was slowing them down were its unpredictability, and its slowness. It&#8217;s very difficult to understand when, exactly, Copilot will get things right, which is not a great thing to have to deal with when you&#8217;re writing code. They also found Copilot incredibly slow, with its suggestions often taking 2-3 seconds or longer to appear &#8211; much slower than the suggestions from the clangd language server they use. Of course, everybody&#8217;s situation will be different, and I have a suspicion that if you&#8217;re writing code in incredibly popular languages, say, Python or JavaScript, you&#8217;re going to get more accurate and possibly faster suggestions from Copilot. As Shui notes, it probably also doesn&#8217;t help that they&#8217;re writing an independent X11 compositor, something very few people are doing, meaning Copilot hasn&#8217;t been trained on it, which in turn means the tool probably has no clue what&#8217;s going on when Shui is writing their code. As an aside, my opinion on GitHub Copilot is clear &#8211; it&#8217;s quite possibly the largest case of copyright infringement in human history, and in its current incarnation it should not be allowed to continue to operate. As I wrote over a year ago: If Microsoft or whoever else wants to train a coding “AI” or whatever, they should either be using code they own the copyright to, get explicit permission from the rightsholders for “AI” training use (difficult for code from larger projects), or properly comply with the terms of the licenses and automatically add the terms and copyright notices during autocomplete and/or properly apply copyleft to the newly generated code. Anything else is a massive copyright violation and a direct assault on open source. Let me put it this way – the code to various versions of Windows has leaked numerous times. What if we train an “AI” on that leaked code and let everyone use it? Do you honestly think Microsoft would not sue you into the stone age? ↫ Thom Holwerda It&#8217;s curious that as far as I know, Copilot has not been trained on Microsoft&#8217;s own closed-source code, say, to Windows or Office, while at the same time the company claims Copilot is not copyright infringement or a massive open source license violation machine. If what Copilot does is truly fair use, as Microsoft claims, why won&#8217;t Microsoft use its own closed-source code for training? We all know the answer. Deeply questionable legality aside, do any of you use Copilot? Has it had any material impact on your programming work? Is its use allowed by your employer, or do you only use it for personal projects at home?

## Raspberry Pi Connect: remote desktop for your Pi

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

Today we’re pleased to announce the beta release of Raspberry Pi Connect: a secure and easy-to-use way to access your Raspberry Pi remotely, from anywhere on the planet, using just a web browser. It’s often extremely useful to be able to access your Raspberry Pi’s desktop remotely. There are a number of technologies which can be used to do this, including VNC, and of course the X protocol itself. But they can be hard to configure, particularly when you are attempting to access a machine on a different local network; and of course with the transition to Wayland in Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, classic X remote desktop support is no longer available. We wanted to be able to provide you with this functionality with our usual “it just works” approach. Enter Raspberry Pi Connect. ↫ Gordon Hollingworth Pi Connect uses WebRTC, and a daemon running on your Pi listens for incoming screensharing requests from the Raspberry Pi website to connect the VNC server on your Pi to the VNC client running in your browser. The service is in beta, it&#8217;s free, but the one major downside is that for now, there&#8217;s only one TURN server for this service, located in the UK, but they might set up more of them if demand is high enough. If you want to try this service on your own Pi running Raspberry Pi OS, you&#8217;re going to need to be using a Raspberry Pi 5, 4, or 400, using the latest version of the operating system running Wayland. Update your operating system, install the rpi-connect package, reboot, and you&#8217;re good to go.

## US revokes Intel, Qualcomm’s export licenses to sell to China’s Huawei, sources say

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

The U.S. has revoked licenses that allowed companies including Intel and Qualcomm to ship chips used for laptops and handsets to sanctioned Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies, three people familiar with the matter said. ↫ Alexandra Alper, Fanny Potkin, David Shepardson The timing of this news is very interesting, as despite the massive sanctions the United States levied against Huawei, the company seems to be doing really well, with its smartphone business seeing massive gains in the Chinese market, at the expense of everyone else. This proves that Huawei does not need access to western chips and technologies to be successful, which must definitely sting in the US and Europe. Strong financial results, using hardware and chips designed not by western companies but by Chinese ones, combined with the only mobile operating system that has any serious potential to at least somewhat threaten Android and iOS. The various sanctions were clearly intended to hurt Huawei and possibly contain it to just China, but it seems they&#8217;re not having their desired effect at all.

## OTPS seeks input from the lunar community to inform a framework for further work on non-interference of lunar activities

date: 2024-05-08, from: NASA breaking news

Questionnaire responses due by June 7, 2024 NASA’s Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy (OTPS) is asking members of the lunar community to respond to a new Lunar Non-Interference Questionnaire that will inform the development of a framework for further work on non-interference of lunar activities. There is no funding or solicitation expected to follow. [&#8230;]

## The Alternative Implementation Problem

date: 2024-05-08, from: Michael Tsai

Maxime Chevalier: What I&#8217;ve concluded, based on experience, is that positioning your project as an alternative implementation of something is a losing proposition. It doesn&#8217;t matter how smart you are. It doesn&#8217;t matter how hard you work. The problem is, when you build an alternative implementation, you&#8217;ve made yourself subject to the whims of the [&#8230;]

## On guestbooks

date: 2024-05-08, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Sometimes you have to listen to the messages life sends your way. And today that message is that I have to write something about guestbooks. In less than 2 hours, two emails landed in my inbox—I love emails, if you want to get in touch please <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">do send one</a>—both on the topic of guestbooks.</p>
<p>The first one was from <a href="https://bjhess.com">Barry</a>. His site now has a <a href="https://bjhess.com/guestbook">lovely guestbook</a> that I haven’t signed yet because I want to come up with a nice drawing for it. Barry also works on a blog platform called <a href="https://pika.page">Pika</a>, worth checking out if you want to start a blog—you should—and you’re considering a hosted solution.</p>
<p>The second email was a ping from <a href="https://devastatia.com/123guestbook-shutting-down">Devastatia’s website</a>. She wrote a post on the subject of guestbooks because apparently <a href="https://www.123guestbook.com">123guestbook.com</a>, one of the OG sites, <a href="https://www.123guestbook.com/news.php?id=closure">is shutting down</a>. If for some reason you were using it to power your guestbook you should consider exporting your content and preserving all the signatures in some way.</p>
<p>Guestbooks are cool. If you haven’t already, <a href="http://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook">go sign mine</a> and let me know if your site has one because I’m going to both sign it and also add it to the list on my guestbook page.</p>                <hr>

I use the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134">Voice Memo app</a> to take notes while I'm programming. Sometimes I talk for as much as fifteen minutes, because I ramble a lot, but I figure stuff out this way. I'm sure at some point the Voice Memo app will do automatic transcripts, I wish it did now. When I finish a memo, a few minutes or seconds later, there's an email waiting for me with the text of the memo. Now here's how they boost the stock price. They also provide an <i>edited</i> version of the memo, without repetition and rambling, and sidebars (they can be treated as sidebars, and appear at the end).

## NetBSD 8.3 released, marks the end of the 8.0 branch

date: 2024-05-08, from: OS News

NetBSD 10 and NetBSD 9.4 were only recently released, leaving one final branch to receive what will be its last update: NetBSD 8.3. NetBSD 8.0 was originally released in 2018, so this final release marks six years of updates, which is a good track record, especially now that two newer main releases are available to choose from. With 8.3 being the final release, this means no more regular or security updates, pkgsrc no longer supports the 8.0 branch either &#8211; so yeah, time to upgrade. NetBSD 8.3 brings various updates and bug fixes for libX11, xterm, tmux, and httpd, and the root name servers and time zone data have been updated to their latest iterations as well. There&#8217;s of course a full list of changes to peruse through if you want to know every little detail that&#8217;s changed. You can update your installation in-place, of course, or download the installation media for 8.3 from one of the many mirrors.

## Just a bunch of scanners (JBOS?)

This is the story on how I spent far too much money and time getting a scanner to work over iSCSI so that I could prove “Chris O” wrong on StackExchange. The TL;DR is that yes scanners work fine over iSCSI. ↫ xssfox The next step is connecting a bunch of flatbed scanners to a disk array enclosure, but that turns out to be quite an expensive little exercise. Regardless, this is absolutely wild, and I love it when people go to great lengths just to prove that something pointless can actually be done. Bravo.

<pre><code>function: ROLL:s count fives and above {

## LPCAMM2 memory is finally here

date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News

But today we got our hands on LPCAMM2 for the first time, and this looks like the future to us. LPCAMM2 is a totally modular, repairable, upgradeable memory standard for laptops, using the latest LPDDR chips for maximum speed and efficiency. So instead of overpaying (or under-speccing) based on guesswork about your future memory needs, you’ll hopefully be able to buy your next laptop and then install more RAM as needed. Imagine that! ↫ Carsten Frauenheim LPDDR memory, used in modern laptops, has been difficult &#8211; or impossible &#8211; to upgrade because its low power nature means it needs to be located as close to the processor as possible with short traces, since the longer the traces, the more power is needed to maintain signal integrity between the processor and RAM. This would defeat the entire purpose of low-power DDR memory to begin with. Originally developed by Dell and eventually adopted by JEDEC and the wider industry, LPCAMM2 solves this problem by using screw-down RAM modules located right next to the processor. These modules can, like regular memory modules, be replaced and upgraded when needed or desired. This is a great leap forward, and I really, really hope we&#8217;re going to see quick, widespread adoption.

## GCC 14.1 released

date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News

GCC 14.1 has been released, and it should come as no surprise that the new features are not exactly something I, someone who doesn&#8217;t program, can properly parse. So, here&#8217;s the three items GCC itself thought were important to list first. The C frontend when targeting standards newer than C89 now considers many non-standard constructs as errors that were previously only warnings. See https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/porting_to.html#warnings-as-errors for more details. C23 _BitInt Bit-precise integer types are now supported, for now only on IA-32, x86-64 and AArch64. The C++ frontend now implements several C++26 features, some missing C++23 bits and defect report resolutions. Diagnostics involving C++ templates now quote source from the instantiation context. The libstdc++exp.a library now includes all symbols for the Filesystem TS and the experimental symbols for the C++23 std::stacktrace class, so -lstdc++exp can be used instead of -lstdc++fs.

## Stack Overflow signs deal with OpenAI, bans users trying to alter answers

date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News

We&#8217;re all aware of Stack Overflow &#8211; it&#8217;s a place where programmers and regular users can ask technical questions, and get answers from anyone who thinks they know the answer. Stack Overflow has become so ubiquitous among programmers and developers, the concept of &#8220;I just copied the code off Stack Overflow&#8221; has become a consistent meme to indicate you don&#8217;t fully grasp how something works, but at least it works. If you&#8217;ve ever contributed answers to Stack Overflow, you might want to consider deleting them, altering them, or perhaps even go as far as request a GDPR removal if you&#8217;re in the European Union, because Stack Overflow has just announced a close partnership with &#8220;AI&#8221; company OpenAI (or, more accurately, &#8220;Open&#8221; &#8220;AI&#8221;). Stripped of marketing speak, the gist is exactly as you&#8217;d expect: OpenAI will absorb the questions and answers on Stack Overflow into its models, whether their respective authors like it or not. As much as you may want to try and delete your answers if you&#8217;re not interesting in having your work generate profit for OpenAI, deleting popular questions and answers is not possible on Stack Overflow. The other option is altering your answers to render them useless, but it seems Stack Overflow is not going to allow you to do this, either. Ben Humphreys tried to alter his highest-rated answers, and Stack Overflow just reverted them back, and proceeded to ban him from the platform. Stack Overflow does not let you delete questions that have accepted answers and many upvotes because it would remove knowledge from the community. So instead I changed my highest-rated answers to a protest message. Within an hour mods had changed the questions back and suspended my account for 7 days. ↫ Ben Humphreys Now that they&#8217;ve made what is most likely an incredibly lucrative deal with OpenAI that&#8217;s going to net Stack Overflow&#8217;s owners boatloads of money, they obviously can&#8217;t let users delete or alter their answers to lower the monetary value of Stack Overflow&#8217;s content. Measures to prevent deletion or alteration are probably one of the clauses in the agreement between Stack Overflow and OpenAI. So there&#8217;s likely not much you can do to not have your answers sucked into OpenAI, but you should at least be aware it&#8217;s happening in case of future answers you might want to contribute.

## Breaking the Scaling Limits: New Ultralow-noise Superconducting Camera for Exoplanet Searches

When imaging faint objects such as distant stars or exoplanets, capturing every last bit of light is crucial to get the most out of a scientific mission. These cameras must be extremely low-noise, and be able to detect the smallest quantities of light—single photons.  Superconducting cameras excel in both of these criteria, but have historically […]

<p>If you create a <a href="https://id.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi ID</a>, you can sign up for Connect, install <code>rpi-connect</code> on a Pi 4 or 5 running 64-bit Pi OS 12 'Bookworm', and register that Pi with the service.</p>

## Running NetBSD on OmniOS using bhyve

date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News

I want to run GoToSocial on some *BSD system. Because I am who I am, I went for using NetBSD 10.0 . And because my hypervisor is running bhyve on OmniOS , you get the title of this blog post. Don’t get too anxious, it is quite straightforward. So let the journey begin. ↫ Joel Carnat Bhyve is a hypervisor originating from FreeBSD, while OmniOS is a distribution of illumos, a continuation of the last open source Solaris release from Oracle. GoToSocial, meanwhile, is an ActivityPub social network server, so it belongs in the same family as Mastodon, Glitch, Akkoma, and countless others. This guide makes this whole process look like a piece of cake, so if you&#8217;ve ever been interested in running your own ActivityPub server &#8211; read on. On a slightly related sidenote, there&#8217;s no OSNews AT instance, partly because I don&#8217;t want to deal with the moderation and costs, and partly because I&#8217;m incredibly happy being a member of Exquisite, a Glitch instance running on OpenBSD, managed by OpenBSD enthusiasts. Never say never, of course, but the odds of seeing an OSNews AT instance in the future are very slim.

The quote was from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399386648851185">Jeff Jarvis</a>, who like me, <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/06/135847.html#a140303">cross-posts</a> to a variety of social webs, presumably manually. Where did I put my comment? Hell if I know. Heh I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jeffjarvis/112399484570566051">found</a> it. My comment: "I didn’t know he had been a blogger. So my respect for him went up dramatically in an instant, and in another instant, plummeted. What’s wrong with people?" Bad news for Ben, he's still is a blogger, btw, in his heart. I can tell. And true journalists and true bloggers share an ethos that the fakers like Morning Joe will never understand. So I guess when you're on with Joe you have to pander.

date: 2024-05-07, from: O'Reilly Rador

In the past month, we saw a blizzard of new language models. It’s almost hard to consider this news, though Microsoft’s open (but maybe not open source) Phi-3 is certainly worth a look. We’ve also seen promising work on reducing the resources required to do inference. While this may lead to larger models, it should [&#8230;]

## AI Whitewashing

date: 2024-05-07, from: Status-Q blog

Yesterday, I asked: Here&#8217;s a question, O Internet: If I buy full-fat milk and dilute it 50/50 with water, do I effectively have semi-skimmed milk, or is there something more sophisticated about the skimming process? And if I then dilute it again, do I get skimmed milk&#8230; for one quarter of the price?

## Getting Back Into the Sims Games

date: 2024-05-07, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, I&rsquo;ve felt this rising tide of nostalgia building up in me and urging me to revisit the <cite>Sims</cite> games. I used to be an avid player of <cite>The Sims 2</cite> in the late 2000s and early 2010s, playing legacy challenges (where you strive to play the same family over 10 generations) and participating in the thriving LiveJournal Sims community of the era. Around the time this nostalgic impulse started, I stumbled upon a corner of Reddit where people are still talking about, and playing, <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, and that in turn got me sucked into YouTube videos such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpEVeAeyWJHOpjr8FOkf7WTwB5YrNJ8VX">Tanic Sims 2&rsquo;s series on the borked character files of the premade hoods<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cB67DGDXFQ">this two-hour masterpiece by April Black<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> on the scourge of hood corruption, and how many of the things Simmers long thought cause it actually don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Anyway, it made me really want to play <cite>The Sims 2</cite> again. I do actually own the Ultimate Collection via <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> Origin, but there was a slight problem&hellip; the computer I use is a Mac. And we do have a Linux desktop as well, and these days Wine/Proton/etc. is so good that <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> can easily be played on that <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> now&hellip; but somehow that install of Linux got borked and only works in recovery mode, which is sufficient to run the Plex server I mainly use that desktop for these days, but not really good enough for <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. Alas.</p>
<p>Another option would have been to purchase Aspyr&rsquo;s Mac port – the Super Collection – for AUD$50 in the App Store. I do want to admit that in principle (even though I already own the game on another platform) this seems like a worthy option. Unlike <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>, Aspyr has actually put the effort in to keep their port updated for new versions of Mac OS, including upgrading the game to 64 bits when Apple dropped support for 32-bit applications, and updating the game again to run natively on Apple Silicon (the M1 chips and beyond). That&rsquo;s great and they deserve to be supported for that! My reasons for not just choosing that option are a bit on the selfish and picky side. Firstly, <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr> never allowed Aspyr to port the last couple of expansion packs (<cite>FreeTime</cite> and <cite>Apartment Life</cite>) to Mac OS, and <cite>FreeTime</cite> in particular is so fundamental to all my nostalgic memories of the game (plus, packed with quality of life features) that I just don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m willing to play without it. Secondly, the April Black video I linked in paragraph #1 introduced me to the fact that Macs have a hardcoded limit of approximately 10,000 files that can be open at one time&hellip; which can be a potential cause of corruption in <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which was designed to draw on a large number of tiny, atomic files (e.g. every Sim in a neighbourhood gets its own individual file) instead of large consolidated ones. Considering that on top of that, I have a folder of all the custom content I was using at the time I stopped playing <cite>The Sims 2</cite>, which I actually think is pretty lean, and yet by itself it has 4,242 files in it&hellip; yeah, I was nervous about the possibility that playing <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on a Mac would not be very sustainable for me. Alas.</p>
<p>So, I turned my sights to the newest instalment of the franchise, <cite>The Sims 4</cite>. Now I played this version of the game quite a bit in 2017–8, and I remember being impressed at first by the graphics (it&rsquo;s <em>so</em> much prettier than unmodded <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>) and the quality of life improvements offered by the game engine, like better routing and Sims&rsquo; new ability to multitask. However&hellip; the shine wore off. The main issue I had with <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> was just that it wasn&rsquo;t as <strong>fun</strong> as <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>. The zany shit that used to keep me so entertained as a teen was just so much rarer in <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr>. Most Sims&rsquo; personalities were so bland, with personality points gone and replaced with just <strong>three</strong> traits (plus an aspiration trait) and no more than a handful of those traits did anything more than &ldquo;give Sims an emotion buff sometimes&rdquo;. There were no more wants and fears, just &ldquo;whims&rdquo; which were rarely interesting, and nothing bad happened if you ignored them entirely (Sims couldn&rsquo;t go into aspiration failure any more). So&hellip; I started playing a legacy in <cite>The Sims 4</cite> and did get up to generation 6. After a couple of fun generations where I really put effort into making my Sims generate drama, I got a generation where my heir had TRIPLETS and my entire game became a production line of desperately trying to build up the toddlers&rsquo; potty training skill to the point that they could at least fucking toilet themselves and it was literally a neverending process and none of my adult Sims were doing anything interesting either and I got so frustrated that I just&hellip; never opened the game again. 😅</p>
<p>That said, quite a few years have passed since 2017–8. It occurred to me that more mods might&rsquo;ve come out giving the Sims more personality and making their autonomous behaviour more individualised. It also seems like the game itself has come out with updates addressing some of the stuff I criticised (for example they supposedly replaced whims with wants &amp; fears again, and as of a recent expansion Sims can &ldquo;self-discover&rdquo; new traits?)&hellip; basically, I started to wonder if it was worth trying again.</p>
<p>So, I installed the base game via the Origin app (which supposedly already booted off everyone in favour of <abbr title="Electronic Arts">EA</abbr>&rsquo;s new app, but it hasn&rsquo;t booted <em>me</em> off) and started a new save. I haven&rsquo;t got very far into it yet, and I&rsquo;m also adding mods progressively, bit by bit, rather than adding <strong>every</strong> &ldquo;give your Sim more personality!&rdquo; mod all at once, to make the investigation easier for myself if I inadvertently add something bugged or something that conflicts with another mod. That said, some of the mods I&rsquo;m interested in playing with are:</p>

</ul>
<p>Now, having said all of this&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure how much it&rsquo;ll satisfy that part of me nostalgic for the Sims community on LiveJournal. Because a big part of my fun wasn&rsquo;t just <em>playing my game</em>, it was publishing updates on my legacy and – perhaps even more important – reading other people&rsquo;s updates on their legacy. There are sooooo many hilarious people whose legacies I used to read – hell, I started reading them even before I owned a Windows computer to play <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> on myself! – and I really also miss&hellip; that. For nostalgia&rsquo;s sake I went back to revisit some of them today, but between Tinypic purging old pictures, Photobucket watermarking old pictures, and LiveJournal itself becoming a gross ad-infested shell of what it once was, it was just sad. I can put together legacy updates for myself, and I can publish them on the internet (I even have <a href="https://sims.jayeless.net">a dedicated subdomain<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>, originally to host my pictures, but when LJ went downhill I started backing up the actual updates there too), but&hellip; I have no idea where a Simmer <em>shares</em> these things, these days, for potential interested readers to find. At least in 2017–8, I knew Tumblr was popular, but I tried searching tags like &ldquo;sims 4 legacy&rdquo;, &ldquo;sims 4 gameplay&rdquo; and so forth today and did not find a single &ldquo;legacy update&rdquo; as I would think of them. Mostly I found custom content, people posting their own challenge rules based on the original legacy challenge, and the occasional &ldquo;artsy&rdquo; highly edited screenshot with no or minimal commentary. I don&rsquo;t really want contextless game screenshots&hellip; I want funny shit. I want quirky Sims autonomously starting drama and being hilarious! Where is that?! Or does everyone who wants that just stick with <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr>? Because like, at least I found <strong>one</strong> active <abbr title="The Sims 2">TS2</abbr> legacy posting updates on Reddit&hellip; actually I found an active <abbr title="The Sims 4">TS4</abbr> legacy on Reddit too, but it&rsquo;s a bit more serious and less &ldquo;this is what happened in my game lol&rdquo;. Are people just making <em>videos</em> of that style of content now, instead of screenshots with commentary, and posting them on YouTube? Because&hellip; I am not going to do that. Haha.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; anyway&hellip; step 1 is to actually play my game, right. Experiment with mods and see if it feels fun enough for me to persist with it. It&rsquo;s sad about the difficulty finding or sharing legacy updates, but it&rsquo;s really just an adjunct to actually playing the game anyway, I suppose.</p>

## The VGA attribute controller is weird

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

The grabber in Windows 3.1 was improved to save and restore the index register as well, but it does not attempt to restore the flip-flop state, which is significant. The problem with the VGA emulation was that it erroneously applied the flip-flop state to reads from port 3C0h, and Windows 3.1 would save the wrong index register value… but only the second time through, because the flip-flop state was different at that point. That is to say, the Windows 3.1 standard mode grabber read from port 3C0h to query the attribute controller index register state, but the emulation returned the currently selected data register contents instead. And then, when restoring the attribute controller index register the next time around, the register would be restored to the wrong value which didn’t have bit 5 set, causing the screen to go blank. ↫ Michal Necasek It&#8217;s not every day that you learn how an aspect of the workings of VGA causes a blank screen under very specific circumstances when running Windows 3.1 in Standard mode under emulation, and that this specific aspect of the workings of VGA was implemented to maintain backwards compatibility with EGA. Absolutely bonkers.

## PowerPC 40x processor support to be dropped from the Linux kernel

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

In addition to Linux 6.10 expected to drop support for very old DEC Alpha processors (EV5 and earlier), it looks like the PowerPC 40x (early PowerPC 400 series) processor and platform support will be retired too. Back in 2020 was a proposal for dropping PowerPC 40x support from the Linux kernel given that the code was orphaned for a long time with no apparent users. The PowerPC 40x processors were found in thin clients, set-top boxes, and other devices during the 90&#8217;s. Finally now it looks like that the PowerPC 40x removal is set to happen. ↫ Michael Larabel Spring cleaning in the hardware support department. I wonder what has more users &#8211; Windows on ARM, or Linux on PowerPC 40x.

## First-generation Windows on ARM PCs will not be able to run Windows 11 24H2

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

Windows 11 supports a variety of ARM processors from Qualcomm. According to the official documentation, you need a computer with the Snapdragon 850 processor inside or newer to run the current operating system officially. However, customers with PCs powered by the Snapdragon 835, the original Windows on ARM chip from 2016, can bypass hardware requirements and install Windows 11 at their own risk. Sadly, those days will be ending soon. Starting with Windows 11 version 24H2, Microsoft&#8217;s operating system requires ARM v8.1 to run. An attempt to boot it from a device with an ARM v8.0-based processor results in system crashes. For reference, the Snapdragon 835 from 2016 is a chip with Kryo 280 cores, which are derivative of ARM&#8217;s Cortex-A73 cores. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin I&#8217;m sure all three Windows on ARM users are devastated.

## Snikket: this week’s sponsor

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

Snikket is a FOSS project for creating private chat spaces for small groups, such as families, friends, or clubs. It doesn’t depend on a phone number, doesn’t upload address books anywhere, and doesn’t sell data to advertisers. It supports all the features you expect, including media and voice messages, audio and video calls, end-to-end encryption, group messaging, and more. Use it from multiple devices at once with the official apps, or even with unofficial, third-party apps. Snikket is easy to self-host, and professional managed hosting is also available. Our previous sponsor, JMP, opted to donate a free week&#8217;s sponsorship to Snikket, which any paying OSNews sponsor can opt to do. This is our very small way of giving something back to the countless open source and/or smaller projects out there. Thank you Snikket for sponsoring OSNews!

## With PowerPC, Windows CE and the WiiN-PAD slate, everyone’s a WiiN-er (except Data General)

date: 2024-05-06, from: OS News

That&#8217;s right: it&#8217;s PowerPC, the most unloved of the architectures CE ever ran on — in fact, this is the first PowerPC Windows CE device I&#8217;ve ever found, and I&#8217;m the self-described biggest pro-PowerPC bigot in the world. Here&#8217;s an unusual form factor Windows CE device, running on the operating system&#8217;s least used CPU, from a storied computer company near the end of its run, intended for medical applications, produced in very small numbers and cancelled within months. What are we going to do with it? Well, what do you think we&#8217;re gonna do with it? We&#8217;re going to program it, so that we can finally have some software! And, of course, since this wacky thing was there at the bitter end, we&#8217;ll talk more about the last days of Data General and what happened next. ↫ Cameron Kaiser I knew Windows CE supported PowerPC, but I never knew any PowerPC-based Windows CE devices ever actually shipped and made it to market. Only Windows CE 2.0 seems to have supported the architecture, and it seems to have been eliminated in 3.0 and 4.0, so it&#8217;s not surprising there weren&#8217;t many PowerPC Windows CE devices out there. The device that&#8217;s the subject of this article, too, only lasted on the market for a few months, so it&#8217;s definitely a rarity.

## Palm OS gets a TOTP application

Still rocking your Palm OS device, but mutter under your breath every time you need to log into a website or service with two-factor authentication? Sick of carrying around an Android or iOS device just so you can log in on your Palm PDA? Worry no more, your prayers have been answered, you can finally throw that Android or iOS garbage into the sun. Get your 2-factor codes on your Palm, just like Google Authenticator. Unlike Hotpants (an old port of a J2ME phone app), this version takes up much less space and supports all Palm OS versions. ↫ Nathan Korth You can now generate 2FA codes on your Palm device. This is wild, and I absolutely love it. I might if set it up on one of my dozens of Palm OS devices and just put it next to my keyboard for easy access. There&#8217;s no cooler way to handle 2FA than this.

## Cross-posting in 2024

date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Some pragmatic notes how cross-posting works these days.</p>
<p>I use regularly: Twitter, Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky.  </p>
<p>Two that have APIs I can use: Mastodon and Bluesky.</p>
<p>I can't send images to Bluesky via their API, they broke the interface. My way of doing it is now called "legacy." The app that uses that feature doesn't work. But I don't even remotely have the time to go back and fix it.</p>
<p>The items in my <a href="http://scripting.com/?tab=links">linkblog</a> come from this flow. If it appears in my linkblog, it also appears on Masto and Bluesky.</p>
<p>When I want broader distribution, I do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a new browser window.</li>
<li>Open a tab to Twitter usually. I don't know why.</li>
<li>I write some text into the Twitter tab.  </li>
<li>Paste an image if there is one.</li>
<li>I open another tab for Threads, Facebook, Mastodon, Bluesky. </li>
<li>I make one pass to paste the text, another to paste the image.</li>
<li>I click Send in each of the tabs, and get back to what I was doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure a lot of people are doing something very much like this. I can actually witness Jeff Jarvis doing it. I think Jay Rosen probably is too.</p>
<p>One thing that Bluesky may not be aware of is that their character limit is signficantly lower than the others, so sometimes I can't include them in this rotation. </p>
<p>I'd love to see one of these support the features of <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. I would give them 100 good netizen points for that, because it wouldn't be long before the others did it, and we'd have a much more complete network writing environment. </p>

I usually write my prompts very carefully, esp when using it to build software, but I just tried not really caring, and asking a question the way I thought of it, so it rambled a lot, was repetetive and had an error I didn't bother to correct, to see what would happen. It didn't even criticize me. It figured out what I was trying to ask/say, and gave me the answer I was looking for. Yes I am aware that all my fellow programmers taught it how to do this, though I have no idea how it does that, but it is freaking amazing. I keep finding miracles in this tech.

## Random RSS & ActivityPub notes

date: 2024-05-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/27/rssClub.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Back when I did my first XML-based serialization format, I did it because the XML people were asking developers to do that. "Now you can create your own formats!" The theory was they had finished their work, XML was ready to go, and developers should start building on it. So I did, thinking in the back of my mind, "they don't really mean it." This was based on experience with commercial platform vendors who heavily evangelized their products when they were new, but took <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrage">umbrage</a> at the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/chutzpah">chutzpah</a> of the developer who thought they could do anything really useful or important, don't they know that's what BigCo's do. Anyway a few years later, that's exactly what happened. Predictably, the big companies, IBM, Microsoft, Google, Sun etc thought they should define the syndication format of the future, so they set about to do it as a "standard" and thus was born Atom. My opinion, <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way is better</a> than two, and they should have jumped on the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> bandwagon. But that's not what they do. They're still <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to make RSS unnecessary, you think they would have figured out that there's no point in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">trying</a> to do that. It isn't going away. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>I wonder if anyone has thought of working with ChatGPT or Meta.ai to create a Busy Developer's Guide to ActivityPub? Here's the prompt. "I want to write a simple bridge between my writing app and any app that runs in the Fediverse, using only ActivityPub. The operations are basically those of the MetaWeblog API, create a post, update a post. Just to start. How should it handle identity? I work in Node.js." I asked both AI tools, and the Meta.ai answer was pretty useless, but <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/3a37d2dd-a442-4d8c-b314-0c934b87f5e1?oai-dm=1">ChatGPT gave</a> what seems to be a reasonable outline for the project. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> is a product of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_astronaut">Architecture Astronauts</a>. Start with a simple idea but generalize it too far, so it can do everything, so much so that no one understands how to do the simple stuff. You have to understand the theory before you do can anything pragmatic. It's why I said last week that they <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/28.html#a124521">need a BDG asap</a>, with implementations in all major runtime environments. I would help them design it, I'm a fairly typical "busy developer." I would support it if it were easier to understand, thus more likely not to be revised with breakage to apps. I've also seen this happen before, in fact it happens more often than not. If you don't understand a format, you can't actually support it. This is part of the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html#5">you can't lie to a compiler</a> axiom. </p>

## Why I run a BSD on a PC

date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News

But the biggest differential factor between BSDs and GNU/Linux is the way it is structured. In Linux, all components are designed to work together, but are completely separate. You’ve got the kernel, init systems, multimedia daemons, userland, bootloader, virtualization and containerization mechanisms, package managers, and so on. They are all separate projects with their own goals and are operated by separate entities. This is why we’ve got different Linux Distributions instead of Operating System. Everyone can take the kernel, start adding components on top of it, and a few minutes later the DistroWatch is even harder to keep up with. Each BSD on the other hand is designed as single system. All components are created and developed together. Things work together perfectly, because they are designed, coded, tested and released as one. ↫ Michał Sapka As I&#8217;ve mentioned here and there over the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been exploring the world of BSD lately, and after bouncing of FreeBSD I&#8217;ve found a very happy home on OpenBSD. Now, this doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m now a full-time OpenBSD user or anything like that &#8211; Linux is the main operating system on my gaming PC, my laptop, and my workstation, and that&#8217;s not going to be changing any time soon. However, after installing, exploring, and using OpenBSD on a machine cobbled together from spare and older parts, I can definitely see the appeal. OpenBSD feels more coherent than a Linux distribution &#8211; I use Fedora KDE, if that matters &#8211; and the various lower-level systems seem to talk to each other in ways that make more intuitive sense than the individually developed systems in a Linux distribution do. Diving into the command-line interface of a Linux distribution can sometimes feel confusing because different tools use different conventions, because they&#8217;re developed by entirely different people and projects, with different ideas about how flags should work, how output should be presented, and so on. On OpenBSD, it seems much easier to carry over something you learn from one tool to the next. I simply feel more secure and knowledgeable, even if it&#8217;s still the same idiot me. The documentation plays a big role here. They&#8217;re in one place, written in a consistent style, and reference each other left and right, making it easy to find your way around to other commands or tools you haven&#8217;t yet considered using. On Linux, you&#8217;re going from one project&#8217;s documentation to another project&#8217;s documentation, and not only will the style change, the quality will also vary greatly. That&#8217;s not to say everything&#8217;s perfect on OpenBSD &#8211; it&#8217;s clearly a hardened server operating system, and its focus on security will definitely throw up annoying hurdles if you&#8217;re just trying to do workstation things. Firefox, for instance, is hobbled by strict security rules through unveil, which makes perfect sense for what OpenBSD is first and foremost trying to be, but if you&#8217;re just a regular user like me, it&#8217;s annoying that Firefox can only access ~/Downloads, or that it can&#8217;t set itself as the default browser so unless you disable that check, Firefox will keep complaining about it. Diving into Firefox and unveil is on my list, though, because you should be able to &#8216;fix&#8217; this. Furthermore, while every piece of software, or an equivalent, is pretty much always available for Linux, on OpenBSD it&#8217;s more hit and miss, and it seems to take a bit longer for new releases of especially bigger software packages to get updated. I mean, there&#8217;s obviously no Steam on OpenBSD, but smaller, less well-known projects generally also don&#8217;t support OpenBSD, so you&#8217;re either going to be compiling things yourself or hope someone packages it up for OpenBSD. Then there&#8217;s the various vanity things we&#8217;ve come to expect from modern Linux distributions, like slick, fully graphical boot and shutdown sequences, detailed graphical tools for managing your packages, graphical firmware and driver managers, and so on. OpenBSD has none of these things, and while that&#8217;s no issue for me, I can see how it would throw other people off. FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and the few others often kind of get lost in all the Linux, Windows, and macOS violence, and to be quite honest &#8211; I feel like many people in the BSD community seem mostly okay with that. If you&#8217;ve never spent any serious time using any of the BSDs, but you&#8217;re interested in operating systems and don&#8217;t mind spending a few hours learning how to manipulate your system through CLI tools &#8211; dive in. There&#8217;s a ton of fun to be had, and things to learn. For now, I&#8217;m continuing my exploration of OpenBSD, and if things keep going as well as they are, I may consider at least switching over the workstation in my office from Fedora KDE to OpenBSD &#8211; but I highly doubt it&#8217;ll ever make its way to my gaming desktop or my laptop.

## The Game of Trees version control system

date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News

Game of Trees (Got) is a version control system which prioritizes ease of use and simplicity over flexibility. Got is still under development; it is being developed on OpenBSD and its main target audience are OpenBSD developers. Got uses Git repositories to store versioned data. Git can be used for any functionality which has not yet been implemented in Got. It will always remain possible to work with both Got and Git on the same repository. ↫ Game of Trees website OpenBSD is developing Game of Trees because they want a version control system that adheres to OpenBSD coding conventions, implements various OpenBSD security practices, and uses nothing but BSD-licensed code. It&#8217;s important to note, as its developers make very clear, that GoT is not in any way intended as a replacement for git.

## X.Org on NetBSD: the state of things

date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News

The big question &#8211; does all this have a future? The good news is that all new hardware has generic support in X. Someone writes either a modesetting kernel driver or a classical wsdisplay kernel driver and they will be automatically supported by the associated drivers in X. The bad news is that to have applications running we require access to a larger open source ecosystem, and that ecosystem has a lot of churn and is easily distracted by shiny new squirrels. The process of upstreaming stuff to X.Org is an ongoing process, but it&#8217;s likely we&#8217;ll run into things that will never be suitable for upstream. ↫ Nia Alarie on the NetBSD blog I had no idea NetBSD did such heavy customisations of its X.Org implementation, many of which have never made their way upstream. The project also maintains support for several older GPUs, uses its own input driver, and more &#8211; it&#8217;s quite impressive.

## Dillo 3.1.0 released: first release since 2015

date: 2024-05-05, from: OS News

Do any of you remember the browser Dillo? The project&#8217;s been through a rough few years after the main developer of the layout engine sadly passed away, the lead developer disappeared from the project, the dillo.org domain was lost and taken over by spammers &#8211; but now there&#8217;s new people at the helm, and the browser just released it first new version since 2015. Dillo 3.1.0 brings a whole host of new features and improvements. Dillo is open source, uses the FLTK toolkit, and runs on Linux, BSD, MacOS, Windows (Cygwin), and more.

<p>Update on SwiftGodot and strict concurrency.</p><p>The easy stuff is gone, but the remaining stuff is hard.   I could brute force my way to the end, but goal is not to just have it build, I want to make sure that my users can rely on the guarantees and be able to benefit from this additional level of safety.</p><p>So the next step will take some time to complete, as many of these will require some research into some Godot features.</p>

## A quick light-dark() experiment

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I wanted to experiment with the new CSS function <code>light-dark()</code> and get a sense of how to use it in a CSS architecture of nested (web) components. I think it’s going to be a powerful tool in <a href="https://web.dev/articles/new-responsive">the new responsive</a> world of component architecture but I don’t want to recommend something unless I have experience with it in a project first.</p>
<p>My first pass was to add <code>light-dark()</code> to my components…</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* global.css */</span>
<span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--dark</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--light</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">));</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--dark</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--light</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But if every component is in charge of it’s own <code>light-dark()</code> handling for <code>border</code>, <code>background</code>, and <code>color</code> on every element… the codebase will get messy managing dark mode in a lot of different places, leading to a lot of inconsistencies over time. A more elegant solution for me would be to handle this job in a single location at the root scope level and leverage the cascade a bit.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The nice thing about using <code>light-dark()</code> at the root token level is your components can be dumber. You provide default light-dark experience and, like good children, your components abide in their parent’s decision. Of course, due to the nature of CSS custom properties, your components aren’t locked into the system and your component level styles can opt out (read: not include) or override the global variables if necessary.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="c">/* Inside &lt;my-component&gt;'s Shadow DOM */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--surface-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--text-color</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c">/* this is a real example from my past */</span>
<span class="nd">:host</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="nt">theme</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">"lunar-new-year"</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>At this point in the experiment I was pleased with the results… until I deployed it to production. I overestimated the browser support for <code>light-dark()</code> and it didn’t work on my phone running Safari 17.4 (but it’s coming in Safari 17.5). I replicated the issue by changing <code>light-dark()</code> to <code>light-d0rk()</code> to verify and fixed it by adding a tried-and-true CSS <code>@supports</code> query.</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="nd">:root</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">;</span>

	<span class="c">/* NOTE: For Safari 17.4 (2024-05) */</span>
  <span class="err">@supports</span> <span class="err">(</span><span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">black</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">white</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="n">color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span>  <span class="n">light</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">;</span>
	  <span class="py">--surface-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#fff</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#000</span> <span class="p">);</span>
	  <span class="py">--text-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">light-dark</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="m">#000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">#fff</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now Safari 17.4 and other browsers that lack support will only have a dark theme and newer browsers will get the <code>light-dark()</code>  enhancement. I also threw a little <code>NOTE:</code> and datestamp in there so future versions of me will know when and <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/you-want-border-color-transparent-not-border-none/">why I built this fence</a>.</p>

## I support the students

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/05/marchOnWashington.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">As a boomer who marched on Washington as a high school student, who started an underground newspaper, and organized student strikes, I support today's students making their political opinions heard. I also see journalists doing what they did in the 60s and 70s, reporting on violence as if it were caused by the protestors, which wasn't true then and I'm pretty sure it isn't true now. </p>
<p>And they describe them as Palestinians, when that also is certainly not what's really going on. My guess is that 99% of them are American students, who, growing up were taught that America had great values, only to discover that America often has taken the wrong side in a war, as we are now in the war between Hamas and Israel. </p>
<p>We shouldn't have taken a side in that war, as long as Israel insists on killing massive numbers of civilians in Gaza. Yes, what Hamas did was unsupportable, and provocative, and just plain wrong, but Israel is killing far more people than Hamas did, and further, it's exactly what Israel, which pretends to represent Holocaust survivors, should <i>not</i> be doing, perpetrating a new Holocaust. </p>
<p>As Americans we have a responsibility to think for ourselves, and that's why I support the students. They aren't right or wrong, but they are continuing the legacy of free speech in the US, and our government and journalists are lining up against them, which to me is as tragic in the 2020s as it was in the 1970s.</p>

## Why is my ElasticSearch query so slow?

date: 2024-05-05, from: Matthew Lincoln Blog

<p>The center of my working hours for the past two years has been <a href="https://constellate.org">constellate.org</a>, a platform for teaching, learning, and performing text analysis with scholarly and primary source content from JSTOR, Portico, and elsewhere.</p>

<!--figure tags without plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll -->

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images-display/constellate-builder.png" alt="The Constellate [dataset builder page](https://constellate.org/builder)." />
	<figcaption>
		<p>The Constellate <a href="https://constellate.org/builder">dataset builder page</a>.</p>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our dataset builder allows users to filter and explore a corpus of over 35 million documents.
This search - and the analytical queries that power the data visualizations in this builder - rely on an ElasticSearch cluster on the backend.
We rely heavily on ElasticSearch aggregations every time a user updates their filters, taking the resulting set of documents (no matter if it is 500 docs or 15 million) and count up the different document types, providers, genres, decades of publication, and more.
These aggregations are memory-heavy actions, especially when aggregating over 10+ million documents.
Even so, ElasticSearch was usually able to return results in under 3,000 milliseconds, providing an acceptable user experience.</p>

<h2 id="why-have-our-queries-gotten-slower-and-slower">Why have our queries gotten slower and slower?</h2>

<p>But we started to see something concerning happening: over the past six months, we watched the worst-case query durations (those the 95th percentile execution time for all searches performed in a week) steadily growing, starting to crest over an unbearable 10 seconds long.
At that point our default request timeouts on our backend services were truly breaking the end user experience.</p>

<!--figure tags without plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll -->

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/images-display/constellate-durations.png" alt="Median and 95th percentile durations (in milliseconds) of search queries on [constellate.org](https://constellate.org)" />
	<figcaption>
		<p>Median and 95th percentile durations (in milliseconds) of search queries on <a href="https://constellate.org">constellate.org</a></p>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I hadn’t made any changes to the way we composed the queries we sent to ElasticSearch in that time.
Our overall usage was increasing, yes, and during very large bulk ingests we did see some overall slowdowns in query processing as expected.
But not at a pace that seemed liable to explain why these pathological query times were growing steadily worse.
We had been steadily adding new documents to the index, some coming in large monthly batches, but we’d been doing that for years without seeing this kind of progressive slowdown.</p>

<p>So I started experimenting, running searches directly against our cluster and one at a time, removing and adding back in the aggregations to see if any oe was causing a particularly heavy load on the cluster.
The culprit: our aggregation of keyphrases, which were sets of significant terms calculated for each document.
For very large search result sets that returned 20 or 30 million documents, the keyphrases <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code></a> aggregation was adding between 3 and 8 ruinous whole seconds onto the query.</p>

<p>Why was this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code> aggregation so slow, while the half-dozen others we were running were fast as ever?
Cardinality.
While we only have a handful of different providers, a few dozen subject categorizations, and maybe a hundred different languages, there are over <strong>50 million distinct keyphrases</strong> in the system.
With such high cardinality, ElasticSearch had to generate an extremely large set of global ordinals when being asked for a terms query, and then actually rank those ordinals and return the top fifty most frequently occurring.
Even <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/eager-global-ordinals.html#_avoiding_global_ordinal_loading">precalculating global ordinals</a> (the usual first step in addressing slow <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code> aggregations) was not enough to tame the IO needed to aggregate 30+ million documents’ intersection with 50+ million keyphrase values.</p>

<p>Why hadn’t this problem asserted itself before?
Because for a few years, we had only extracted keyphrases from about 1/3 of our documents, and weren’t actively contributing new ones into the system.
While better automating our ingest pipelines this year, we took the opportunity to regenerate a lot of our keyphrases, backfilling our database with an enormous number of new keyphrase values.
While this problem of cardinality was in our system all along, the scale simply wasn’t large enough to make its impact felt until recently.</p>

<h2 id="so-make-the-problem-smaller">So make the problem smaller</h2>

<p>Because we only want to get a relative ranking of the top keyphrases, a straightforward way to reduce this problem is to use a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/search-aggregations-bucket-sampler-aggregation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sampler</code></a> aggregation.
By grabbing a sample of up to 5,000 documents before running the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terms</code> aggregation, we easily brought the impact of the keyphrases aggregation back under control.
This effectively puts a ceiling on the number of files whose keyphrases need to be looked up in an aggregation, and mitigates the real scaling issues that we were starting to encounter with our data.</p>

## Vibe Check №32

date: 2024-05-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>An unseasonable gloomy spring in Austin, TX. The kids are nearly done with school for the year and summer plans are shoring up. My son goes to middle school next year. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>We’ve battled some on-and-off sicknesses these past couple months and with all the holidays every week has felt like a false start. But here we are, barreling into summer. I’ve already been out on the lake to surf on my cousin’s boat, so I’ve got that going for me.</p>
<h2>The Eclipse</h2>
<p>In April my wife’s entire family came out from Arizona to Austin for the eclipse on April 8th. We got a big Vrbo near the lake right in the path of totality. The weather was cloudy and dismal in Austin for the eclipse. But then… ten minutes before full totality, the sky broke open.</p>
<p>I’ve seen partial eclipses before and those were cool. But nothing prepared me for seeing the total eclipse. The complete darkness. The confused birds. The sudden drop in temperature. The fully visible halo effect eminating from the sun. It’s other worldly to see the big space rock that goes around our planet move in front of the big fireball that keeps our planet alive.</p>
<p>Happy to get to celebrate something so cosmic with the family.</p>
<h2>44 and there’s so much more</h2>
<p>I turned 44 at the end of April and had an uneventful birthday. That’s how birthdays go after the big four-oh. I spent most of my day cleaning the house and watching anime. My family treated me to a “fancy dinner” at a place with cloth napkins and the kids behaved themselves through the whole meal.</p>
<p>The highlight of my birthday was exchanging texts with some old friends who have known me for decades. Old friends like that – even though you often live distant parallel busy lives – have the ability to tap into a deep well of friendship. For that I am thankful.</p>
<h2>Making Games</h2>
<p>I haven’t talked about it much, because I don’t want to jinx it, but I’ve been making some games in my spare time. And not one style of game either, a big swath of random ideas in different formats.</p>
<ul>
<li>A “Guess Who?”-style game for Panic’s <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a>.</li>
<li>A one-page TTRPG. Almost everything is in place for this.</li>
<li>A 52-card deck game that I’m turning into a game for your mobile computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making games has been a fun and different way to spend my time. I don’t have much to show for all that tinkering right this minute, but soon maybe?</p>
<h2>Waiting for a life-changing email</h2>
<p>You know that feeling when your boss emails you and asks “Hey, you got a minute?” and those minutes until you talk to your boss feels like hours as your amygdala floods your limbic system with intense, wet, hot anxiety? That’s more or less what I’ve been feeling for the last two months as I waited for a life-changing email. There were two emails actually. Then that got stressful. Then I had to wait on a package.</p>
<p>To be totally honest, all that waiting nearly broke me. I’m a decently patient person but a giant cloud LOOMING over me every day that I’m unable to control is distressing. Then your friends and family and kids ask you “Hey did that life-changing email come yet?” and you have to say “Nope, not yet” over and over.</p>
<p>But the email did come. And so did the package. And the giant cloud of concern is slowly dissipating. And on Monday I’ll embark on the next big phase of my adult life. Ominous, I know.</p>
<h2>Stats and consumption</h2>
<p>What you jackals come here for…</p>
<h3>🧠 <strong>Learning</strong></h3>
<p>I took some time to do some deep dives both formally and informally.</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript - Almost certain I’ll be using this sometime in the future, so I took a <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</a> course to connect all the pieces I had scattered about in my brain.</li>
<li>LLM Vector Embeddings - All this LLM search jazz is normal vector search but with special GPT-based embeddings instead of Postgres’s default embeddings. Way less threatening or opaque to me now that I understand it.</li>
<li>Solo RPGs - I got a bit obsessed with the idea of playing a TTRPG by yourself and it inspired me to make a game.</li>
</ul>
<h3>💪 Wellness</h3>
<p>I’ve put on a bit of weight and that’s frustrating but I think again it’s stress-related.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking walks</li>
<li>Got a weighted vest for “rucking”</li>
<li>Rode my new bike once</li>
</ul>
<h2>📖 <strong>Reading</strong></h2>
<p>Reading is still on a book-a-week clip. This year I’m mulling around tech and ethics, as well as reading about people who created or harnessed a new technology. I also got back into comics and have read some wonderful pieces. If it’s sci-fi themed and has good art, I’m all-in.</p>
<p><strong>Finished</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/43cI1vi">Doom Guy: Life in First Person</a> by John Romero - An autobiography about the man who created DOOM.</li>

<h3>📝 <strong>Blogging</strong></h3>
<p>Slowed down a lot on blogging. That’s okay. I still have three dozen drafts but I’m being pretty choosy about where I toil. It’s easy for me to lose a weekend tinkering on a handful of posts, or piecing together a giant overly complex post like this. I need to stop doing that. Or I need to do that more often. Who knows.</p>

## Using DuckDB to seamlessly query a large parquet file over HTTP

date: 2024-05-05, from: Marginallia log

A neat property of the parquet file format is that it&rsquo;s designed with block I/O in mind, so that when you are interested in only parts of the contents of a file, it&rsquo;s possible to some extent to only read that data. Many tools are aware of this property, and DuckDB is one of them. Depending on which circles you run in, a lesser known aspect of HTTP is range requests, where you specify which bytes in a file to be retrieved.
