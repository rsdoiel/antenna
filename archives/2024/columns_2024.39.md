## 2024-09-22 Holidays at home

date: 2024-09-23, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-22-holidays-at-home">2024-09-22 Holidays at home</h1>

<p>Friday we went to hear some classical music at the Tonhalle in Z√ºrich. Thorvaldsdottir‚Äôs composition was amazing. Apparently there will be more Icelandic elements this season. üòÑ</p>

<p><a href="https://tonhalle-orchester.ch/">Tonhalle-Orchester Z√ºrich</a>, Paavo J√§rvi, Music Director, <a href="https://www.vikingurolafsson.com/">V√≠kingur √ìlafsson</a>, piano: Johannes Brahms Klavierkonzert Nr. 1 d-Moll op. 15.</p>

<p>Same director and same orchestra, <a href="https://www.annathorvalds.com/">Anna Thorvaldsdottir</a>‚Äôs ¬´Archora¬ª for orchestra.</p>

<p>Same director and same orchestra, Igor Strawinsky‚Äôs ¬´L&rsquo;oiseau de feu¬ª, Konzert-Suite (1919).</p>

<p>On Sunday we went to hear Old Music.</p>

<p>El Cant de la Sibil‚Ä¢la;
Draumkvedet ‚Äì Traumlied;
Orlando di Lasso:
Prophetiae Sibyllarum.</p>

<li><a href="https://ensembletheleme.com/">th√©l√®me</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is the second week of our holidays. We stayed in Z√ºrich and decided to live as if we‚Äôre on a trip: hikes, runs, activities (today: cycling!), restaurants, museums or concerts. I told myself that we can spend the hotel budget on cultural events and train rides and suddenly everything seems possible where until now I would have hesitated. Is it really worth that much money? But since we‚Äôre not paying for the hotel ‚Ä¶ I convinced myself that it‚Äôs OK.</p>

As I travel around the United States, one of the things that always jumps out to me is just how beautiful this country is.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Instead of just fact-checking the candidates, and presenting "both sides," how about recording the number of times the candidate threatens specific races, genders, lifestyles, origins, religions and of course individual people. Keep a page where you tally the groups he <i>doesn't</i> threaten with expulsion or worse. That would be very revealing, and in line with the true issue of this election. Time for you all to get in sync with the actual American history that's being made.

It's around this time of year that I start thinking about my <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty">BOTY</a>. I should give out a plaque or a statue or something. Someday! Anyway almost immediately I had my answer. The announcement will wait till December of course, sometimes early January.

Social networks are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=social+networks+race+hate">condemned</a> when they carry lies from race-hate, misogyny and worse, but the major news orgs do it all the time. It's ridiculous that there are two standards.

To my programmer friends, how long would it have taken to answer <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/66f038e3-7218-8012-a294-05bb7afa9b97">this question</a> using Google and StackExchange. There was a bug in this one line of code, a call to <i>new Date ()</i> in JavaScript, that was behaving as if months were not 0-based, which they are known to be. The problem: I was specifying the day as 0 and month, correctly, but the day had to be 1 in order for it to work and without thinking I had specified it as 0.

On Thursday, September 19, the day after the Federal Reserve began to lower interest rates two and a half years after it began to raise them to get inflation under control, President Joe Biden spoke to the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., a nonprofit, nonpartisan forum where leaders from around the world can speak to larger questions about the global economy.

## They stole my voice with AI

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">They stole my voice with AI</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHfPH-Kr9XU">this clip</a>:</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but that sounds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMofZIT9FcQ">pretty familiar</a>. I mean I <em>would</em> like you to subscribe to my YouTube channel. But that's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling">Jeff Geerling channel</a>, not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHfPH-Kr9XU">Elecrow</a>, where the clip above is from. I never said the words that are in that video.</p>

<p>Someone emailed me a link to Elecrow's video and said it sounded <em>off</em>. I'm guessing at least some of the thousands of people who watched the video thought I agreed to voice some Elecrow videos, since I talk about some of the same topics on my channel.</p></div>
