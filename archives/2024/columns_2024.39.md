## Qualcomm Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows Teardown (2024)

## Four years ago today…

I&#8217;ve taken to ignoring all the autogenerated &#8220;memories&#8221; that my phone would like to show me from four years ago &#8212; because while the system simply matches the date, *I* know that four years ago was the depths of despair of the pandemic.

## 2024-09-22 Holidays at home

date: 2024-09-25, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-22-holidays-at-home">2024-09-22 Holidays at home</h1>

<p>Friday we went to hear some classical music at the Tonhalle in Zürich. Thorvaldsdottir’s composition was amazing. Apparently there will be more Icelandic elements this season. 😄</p>

<p><a href="https://tonhalle-orchester.ch/">Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich</a>, Paavo Järvi, Music Director, <a href="https://www.vikingurolafsson.com/">Víkingur Ólafsson</a>, piano: Johannes Brahms Klavierkonzert Nr. 1 d-Moll op. 15.</p>

<p>Same director and same orchestra, <a href="https://www.annathorvalds.com/">Anna Thorvaldsdottir</a>’s «Archora» for orchestra.</p>

<p>Same director and same orchestra, Igor Strawinsky’s «L&rsquo;oiseau de feu», Konzert-Suite (1919).</p>

<p>On Sunday we went to hear Old Music.</p>

<p>El Cant de la Sibil•la;
Draumkvedet – Traumlied;
Orlando di Lasso:
Prophetiae Sibyllarum.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://hirundomaris.com/">Hirundo Maris</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ariannasavall.com/">Arianna Savall</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ensembletheleme.com/">thélème</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is the second week of our holidays. We stayed in Zürich and decided to live as if we’re on a trip: hikes, runs, activities (today: cycling!), restaurants, museums or concerts. I told myself that we can spend the hotel budget on cultural events and train rides and suddenly everything seems possible where until now I would have hesitated. Is it really worth that much money? But since we’re not paying for the hotel … I convinced myself that it’s OK.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Life">#Life</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-09-25</strong>. Today we went to the Tonhalle again.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich</li>
<li>Paavo Järvi Music Director</li>
<li>Golda Schultz Sopran</li>
<li>Anton Webern «Langsamer Satz» für Streichorchester (Arr. Gerard Schwarz)</li>
<li>Richard Strauss «Vier letzte Lieder» für Sopran und Orchester</li>
<li>Anton Bruckner Sinfonie Nr. 1 c-Moll «Linzer Fassung»</li>
</ul>

<p>I saw the third flutist sitting around a lot and not playing the flute and when the volume went up he covered his ears. Poor lad. Did he just play five notes early in the performance and then he had to wait until the end? How strange!</p>

## Elecrow responded, apologized for AI voice cloning

<p>I couldn't prove it at the time, but there are AI identity detection services like <a href="https://www.resemble.ai">Resemble.ai</a> that can at least give some input into whether it was a direct clone or just something that sounds 'midwestern US male.'</p>

<p>Anyway, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMofZIT9FcQ">made a short video about it</a>, because I wanted to make a point that it is <em>not</em> okay for a corporation to clone someone's voice and use it in their videos without that person's consent.</p></div>

## New Windows Malware Locks Computer in Kiosk Mode

date: 2024-09-25, updated: 2024-09-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/malware-locks-browser-in-kiosk-mode-to-steal-google-credentials/">Clever</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A malware campaign uses the unusual method of locking users in their browser&#8217;s kiosk mode to annoy them into entering their Google credentials, which are then stolen by information-stealing malware.</p>
<p>Specifically, the malware &#8220;locks&#8221; the user&#8217;s browser on Google&#8217;s login page with no obvious way to close the window, as the malware also blocks the &#8220;ESC&#8221; and &#8220;F11&#8221; keyboard keys. The goal is to frustrate the user enough that they enter and save their Google credentials in the browser to &#8220;unlock&#8221; the computer.</p>
<p>Once credentials are saved, the StealC information-stealing malware steals them from the credential store and sends them back to the attacker...</p></blockquote>

## “The aesthetic is liquidity.”

It goes back to housing as an investment. Speaking very macro, property, since the 1980s, has far eclipsed wages&#8230; And that—and leverage—define our economy now. This makes design important, but downstream, and in a narrower context than we think. Furniture must reflect… the investment value a house has. For these types of houses, the design’s [&#8230;]

## Open-Source Journalism

date: 2024-09-24, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Fourteenth in the News Commons series. The main work of journalism is producing stories. Questions following that statement might begin with prepositions: on what, of what, about what. But the preposition that matters most is with what. Ideally, that would be with facts. Of course, facts aren&#8217;t always available in the pure form that researchers call data. [&#8230;]

ActivityPub is not the web any more than Dan Quayle was Jack Kennedy. The web is simple. That was hard to do. Very little since then lives up to that standard of simplicity, definitely not ActivityPub. The web is the web is the web is the web etc. Pick another more humble name. If it ever does achieve the utility of the web does we can take another look.

## A Hello World for Bluesky?

date: 2024-09-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First, a couple of examples/case studies.</p>
<p>1. About ten years ago I was trying to figure out how to get started with Node.js. I knew a little JavaScript, but nothing I read about Node made it click. It's server software, so there must be a way to write an HTTP server? From there, I read all the details about the power it has, but what I needed was a Hello World script. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22brent+simmons%22">Brent Simmons</a> gave me the script, and step by step <a href="https://inessential.com/2013/12/09/getting_started_with_web_services_using_.html">instructions</a> on how to write it. </p>
<p>I followed his steps, and it worked, and of course I wrote a <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/01/29/imBecomingANodejsDeveloper.html">blog post</a> about it.  That was the key I needed that unlocked what Node is, and helped me see what I could do with it. The first thing I did was factor out some of the bits so I could make it even simpler and then I built. I just wanted a few lines of code that created a server and responded to requests. All I needed was a Hello World to get me going. </p>
<p>Now Brent knew that I knew the basics of HTTP servers, we both worked together on a huge app that had as a small part of it a full HTTP server, thanks to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wes+felter%22">Wes Felter</a> who wrote it, no one asked him to, one day he showed up with a server that ran in <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>. I was ecstatic. That's the key. If you have something that isn't truly new, that might have some analogies in other worlds, if you want people in those other worlds to know how to get started, give them the beginning. The first step.</p>
<p>2. Another example. How I learned to create and edit a website. It was 1994. I loved the web the way I love ChatGPT today. I knew how to use it, but I didn't know how to make it. Everyone told me it was really simple and they sent me links to all the docs, but they made no sense, because they talked about things I didn't understand. What I really needed was a way to make a web page that was as simple as the one Brent provided for Node-based HTTP servers, with tools and concepts I knew how to use. I found one, a service provided by <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/04/07/howIDoNewThings.html">Ohio State University</a>. You emailed a message to them and they put it "on the web" and sent you back a link to the page. Click the link and there's what you typed. I tried <i>Hello World</i> and got back a link to a page that said Hello World. So I tried something more complicated, I did a view source of Hotwired.com's home page, and copy and pasted it into an email. That worked too (with broken images because the urls were relative). </p>
<p>Everything I've ever learned how to do required me to first understand it at this level.</p>
<p>Okay here we are in 2024, and I want to understand what Bluesky is. I know how to use it, but I don't know how to <i>make</i> it. But I would be surprised if it is any more complicated that writing a web content management system that uses feeds, something I've done many times. I know the components of a message, have iterated over it for the last thirty years. I even wrote the spec that defines them in RSS 2.0. We're all doing the same thing over and over and Bluesky is no different. I hear there's some nice design for the protocol, but right now I don't care. I want my Hello World. The minimal code I need to add a node to the network defined by Bluesky and I want to see what it can do with the same kind of aha moment I had with the web. I want it to work when I try it, and I want it to reveal what Bluesky is beyond what I can see from using it. I want to begin to understand the opportunities for interop. </p>
<p>Why do I ask? For one, I'm a student of this stuff, and I want to understand. But I also am very active in this area, and <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop">interop is my product</a> (really read that piece, I mean it, and I think it's Bluesky's product too). I'm into <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html">working together</a> -- it happens so infrequently. So here I'm also trying to show not just you how to explain what you do for a curious but time-limited developer, but I want to make this a this.how document that explains how to do it for everyone, hoping that we as an art and industry start explaining ourselves better to each other, because we absolutely need to do this much better imho, ymmv, mmlm, etc. </p>
<p>To summarize -- assume I know how the web works. I've worked with the structures and protocols for systems that are very much like Bluesky. Don't try to explain the design of the protocol, just use it to solve a problem that I will understand because I use the product and I have developed lots of stuff like it. It should be possible to show us, to teach us, what your product does. </p>
<p>PS: It could take a few days to put a Hello World together. Because once you do the first iteration, you may think of a more direct way to illustrate the idea, and you should do it, iterate until it works, until you can't make it any simpler. </p>
<p>PPS: And if you don't want to do it, that's okay too. I just thought it was worth the effort to explain what's needed to foster a greater understanding of what you're doing and what the opportunities for interop are. </p>

## On Intelligence

date: 2024-09-24, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Now that AI is a huge thing, it&#8217;s worth visiting what intelligence is, and how we mismeasure it—for example, by trying to measure it at all. I&#8217;ve been on this case for a while now, mostly by answering questions ab0ut IQ on Quora. My answer with the most upvotes is this one, to the question [&#8230;]

Judges with the power of life and death. In some states with the death penalty judges have the power to sentence people to death, but not for having a well-accepted medical procedure. But that's the situation women with a troubled pregnancy are in, if they live in the wrong state. From the patient's point of view, I have a slight inkling about what this is like because twice in my life I've needed health care to save me from imminent death. The health care system never hesitated to help. But what if they had said "we can't admit you until a judge rules that we can." In the new USA, abortion is like a pardon, something only the government can grant. Forget about juries of our peers. It raises so many questions. If a woman is about to miscarry are they even allowed to admit her to the hospital, or does she have to wait until she is actually dying? If you can check her in, what are the limits of the treatment they can provide? Aspirin? Blood? Oxygen? Surgery? And btw, medicine has advanced a <i>lot</i> since before Roe v Wade. Whatever practices they had for avoiding abortion can't apply now. This is the kind of thing no society should change the way we changed it as an edict handed down by judges who are subject to corruption. We are learning about a serious flaw in our system of government.

It would be great if we could make voting a party, a celebration, something to look forward to, not something you have to make time for. That would probably do more to improve the lives of all Americans than any other single thing. It's like the SuperBowl, the NBA Finals, Coachella or the Oscars, only better -- because we are the stars.

## Israel’s Pager Attacks and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

date: 2024-09-24, updated: 2024-09-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Israel&#8217;s brazen attacks on Hezbollah last week, in which hundreds of pagers and two-way radios exploded and killed at least 37 people, graphically illustrated a threat that cybersecurity experts have been warning about for years: Our international supply chains for computerized equipment leave us vulnerable. And we have no good means to defend ourselves.</p>
<p>Though the deadly operations were stunning, none of the elements used to carry them out were particularly new. The tactics employed by Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied any role, to hijack an international supply chain and embed plastic explosives in Hezbollah devices have been used for years. What&#8217;s new is that Israel put them together in such a devastating and extravagantly public fashion, bringing into stark relief what the future of great power competition will look like&#8212;in peacetime, wartime and the ever expanding ...</p>

Dewayne Hendricks, my friend of nearly four decades, passed away last Friday at age 74. His <a href="https://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/140305-slides.pdf">mentors</a> were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran">Paul Baran</a>. He was a pioneer of wireless Internet connectivity, a serial entrepreneur, curator of an influential e-mail list, and for the last 30 years on the organizing committee of the <a href="https://amw.org">Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop</a>.<br />
<br />
For someone of his remarkable achievements he has left very little impression on the Web. An example is his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dewayne-hendricks-b118">Linkedin profile</a>. Below the fold I collect the pieces of his story that I know or have been able to find from his other friends. If I can find more I will update this post. Please feel free to add information in the comments.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<h3>Wayne State University</h3>
Dewayne was a student at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_State_University">Wayne State</a>, where he got into systems programming for the IBM 370. They ran the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan Terminal System</a> on a 512K 370/155. He tried to run the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Newcastle_upon_Tyne">University of Newcastle</a>'s CMTS, an experimental version of MTS that didn't use dynamic address translation, and ran into performance problems. He worked with Larry Chace at the University of Illinois to get it running on their 1+2M 360/75. After Chace rewrote it to swap pages to their 2301 drum storage it ran well.<br />
<h3>Southern Illinois University</h3>
While at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Illinois_University">Southern Illinois Univerity</a> in the '70s he worked for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a> and continued his involvement in IBM systems programming, now for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VM_(operating_system)">VM/370</a>.  Melinda Varian, historian of that era of IBM's groundbreaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing)">SHARE</a> user group, wrote in <a href="https://www.leeandmelindavarian.com/Melinda/25paper.pdf"><i>VM and the VM Community: Past, Present, and Future</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Dewayne Hendricks reported at SHARE XLII, in March, 1974, that he had successfully implemented MVT-CP handshaking for page faulting, so that when MVT running under VM took a page fault, CP would allow MVT to dispatch another task while CP brought in the page.  At the following SHARE, Dewayne did a presentation on further modifications, including support for SIOF and a memory-mapped job queue. With these changes, his system would allow multi-tasking guests actually to multi-task when running in a virtual machine. Significantly, his modifications were available on the Waterloo Tape.<br />
<br />
Dewayne became the chairman of the Operating Systems Committee of the SHARE VM Project.  Under his guidance, the Committee prepared several detailed requirements for improvements to allow guest systems to perform better. At SHARE XLV, in 1975, the Committee presented IBM with a White Paper entitled Operating Systems Under VM/370, which discussed the performance problems of guests under VM and the solutions that customers had found for these problems. Many of the solutions that Dewayne and others had found, such as PAGEX, made their way into VM fairly quickly, apparently as the result of customers’ persistence in documenting them. By SHARE 49, Dewayne was able to state that, “It is now generally understood that either MFT or MVT can run under VM/370 with relative batch throughput greater than 1.” That is to say, they had both been made to run significantly faster under VM than on the bare hardware. Dewayne and others did similar work to improve the performance of DOS under VM.
</blockquote>
<h3>Amateur Radio</h3>
Dewayne was a major figure in developing and sustaining the use of <a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">amateur packet radio</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He has been involved with radio since receiving his amateur radio operator's license as a teen. He currently holds official positions in several national non-profit amateur radio organizations and is a director of the Wireless Communications Alliance, an industry group representing manufacturers in the unlicensed radio industry.
</blockquote>
In <a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">particular</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Back in 1986, he ported the popular KA9Q Internet Protocol package to the Macintosh, allowing the Macintosh platform to be used in packet radio networks. Today, thousands of amateur radio operators worldwide use the NET/Mac system he developed to participate in the global packet radio Internet. This system continues to be developed and deployed by the amateur radio service.
</blockquote>
Dewayne was a member of the <a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/who-we-are/">Amateur Radio Digital Communications Grants Evaluation Team</a> from 2021 to his death. ARDC grants around <a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/">$5M/year</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
ARDC makes grants to projects and organizations that are experimenting with new ways to advance both amateur radio and digital communication science. Experimentation by amateur radio operators has benefited society in many ways, including the development of the mobile phone and wireless internet technology. ARDC envisions a world where all such technology is available through open source hardware and software, and where anyone has the ability to innovate upon it. To see examples of the types of grants we make, go to <a href="https://www.ardc.net/grants/">https://www.ardc.net/grants/</a>. 
</blockquote>
<h3>Tetherless Access</h3>
One of the many ahead-of-their-time companies Dewayne started was Tetherless Access. He co-founded it with Charlie Brown in 1990 to develop wireless Metropolitan Access Networks. It went public in 1996 on NASDAQ and folded two years later. The idea was to use the 900MHz unlicensed spectrum to distribute Internet connectivity from a base station via point-to-point links, in contrast to Metricom's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)">Ricochet</a> service, started by Dewayne's mentor Paul Baran, which four years later used mesh network technology in the same spectrum.<br />

Tetherless Access launched a testbed network <a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">which</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Started in Fall ‘96</li>
<li>Covered 35 mi area in south bay</li>
<li>Delivered from ISDN to 30 Mbps bandwidth</li>
<li>Used both licensed and unlicensed equipment (Part 15 and 97)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>NSF Projects</h3>
Dewayne was involved in a number of NSF funded experiments in using wireless to <a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">connect remote communities</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prior to forming Dandin Group, he was the General Manager of the Wireless Business Unit for Com21, Inc. He joined Com21 following an opportunity to participate as the Co-Principal Investigator in the National Science Foundation’s Wireless Field Tests for Education project. The project sucessfully connected remote educational institutions to the Internet. The test sites ranged from rural primary schools in Colorado, USA to a University in Ulaan Bataar, Mongolia.
</blockquote>
Com21 was founded by Dewayne's mentor Paul Baran.<br />

The Dandin Group, Dewayne's next company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000301193938/http://www.dandin.com/projects.html">was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
a partner in the Advanced Networking Project with Minority Serving Institutions (AN-MSI) an EDUCAUSE project funded by the National Science Foundation. The project's purpose is to provide improved communication services, including Internet access, to underserved minority and tribal-nation institutions. Because these institutions are frequently in remote locations which currently lack communication infrastructures, Internet-linked services delivered by wireless networks offer the most appropriate and cost-effective approach to connecting their communities to the world and to each other.

<h3>Developing Countries</h3>
Dewayne was not just active in getting Internet service to under-served communities with the NSF. The <a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">bio on his website</a> states:<br />
<blockquote>
Tetherless Access was one of the first companies to develop and deploy Part 15 unlicensed wireless metropolitan area data networks using the TCP/IP protocols. He has participated in the installation of these networks in other parts of the world including: Kenya, Tonga, Mexico, Canada and Mongolia.

Amara Angelica reported that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000307045638/http://www.techweek.com/articles/8-23-99/wireless.htm"><i>Tonga first to go wireless for telecommunications</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
"We’re replacing the entire existing telecom infrastructure with a wireless IP [Internet protocol] network," says Dewayne Hendricks, CEO of Fremont-based Dandin Group and former general manager of Com21’s wireless business unit. "Since the country is a monarchy, there was only one guy to convince, Crown Prince Tupouto’a, and then we just went for it."<br />
<br />
Hendricks’ firm plans to replace Tonga Telecom’s aging landline system—which still uses mechanical relays—with a broadband wireless network for data, video and telephony (using voice over IP). It will run at 30Mbps with user access at 2Mbps and 10Mbps by the end of next year. "We can get all the spectrum we want," Hendricks says.<br />
<br />
The prince’s objective, Hendricks says, is to convert the country’s largely agricultural workforce, which has an astonishing 95 percent literacy rate, into knowledge workers, such as programmers. The government launched the Royal School of Science for Distance Learning last year, using Internet connections to allow students to take courses at international universities. There are just fewer than 100,000 people in Tonga scattered across 170 islands.<br />
<br />
"We’re going to an Internet-style mesh network," says Hendricks. MMDS, which some carriers are using to deliver broadband services, won’t scale well for an IP network, he says. Hendricks, a technical advisor to the FCC on ultrawideband (UWB) technology, is considering UWB for the network.

<a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">Tonga had</a> about 11,000 households and 6,500 phone customers, with an 8-year wait to get a phone. The goals of the project were to deliver 30Mbit/s IP to each home for a customer end budget of $450.<br />

<h3>FCC Technological Advisory Council</h3>
Dewayne was one of the inaugural members of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000818002106/http://www.fcc.gov/oet/tac/members.html">Federal Communications Commission's Technological Advisory Council</a>, launched on April 30<sup>th</sup> 1999, together with luminaries such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf">Vint Cerf</a>, AT&amp;T CTO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nagel">David Nagel</a>, CERFnet founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Estrada">Susan Estrada</a> and many others. He remained a member through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070930050129/http://www.fcc.gov/oet/tac/Confirmed_Members_and_Affiliations_10.20.05.pdf">fourth TAC</a> formed in 2005.<br />
<h3>Wired Article</h3>
In the January 2002 edition of <i>Wired</i>, Brent Hurtig's <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/"><i>Digital Cowboy</i></a> focused on Dewayne's work on the reservation:<br />
<blockquote>
At Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation in North Dakota, he's installing a wireless network. In its initial form, the system will meet FCC requirements governing frequency, power, and transmission technology. But not for long. Hendricks' mission is to build the best system possible - even if it's illegal - and he intends to use every tool at his disposal. Should the FCC crack down, the tribal leaders will hoist the flag of Native American sovereignty, asserting that they can do whatever they want with the sky above their reservation.
</blockquote>
Dewayne's work on the reservation, in Tonga and elsewhere was an attempt to demonstrate the problems with the obsolete US <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">spectrum allocation policy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There's no sensible reason why Americans shouldn't have inexpensive, ubiquitous, high-performance broadband access, Hendricks says. Using technologies that are already available or in fast-track development, everyone could enjoy reliable, fully symmetrical wireless at T1 speed or better. No more digital divide. No more last-mile problem. No more compromises. The only things standing in the way are the FCC, Congress, and "other people who just don't get it."
</blockquote>
<h3>EE380 Talks</h3>
Dewayne gave three talks to Stanford's EE380 symposium. The first one was apparently "in the ‘90s on wireless MANs" of which I have so far found no record.<br />
<br />
The second was on 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2000 entitled <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/000503.html"><i>Wiring Tonga: From the Ground Up and the Sky Down</i></a>. The abstract was:<br />
<blockquote>
One of the biggest barriers today standing in the way of deployment of advanced wireless communications systems turns out not to be the technology, but restrictions related to regulatory policies. This presentation will discuss the nature of these barriers and how they have affected the development of wireless data systems over the years.<br />
<br />
The speaker will also discuss on-going work in which he is involved to use advanced wireless technology to deploy multiservice IP systems as part of infrastructure-development projects in the Kingdom of Tonga and with Native American groups in the US, and how such projects are able to deal with the limitations imposed by conventional regulatory barriers.
</blockquote>
The slides are <a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">here</a>.<br />
<br />
The third was on 5<sup>th</sup> March 2014 and entitled <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/140305.html"><i>Inventing a New Internet: Learning from Icarus</i></a>. The abstract read:<br />
<blockquote>
From a future historical perspective, are we descendants of Icarus? Is our Internet like Icarus' wings? Are our protocols, ciphers and codes, brilliant capabilities built on immature engineering, which like Icarus' wax and feathers, are capable of taking us to great heights, but systematically flawed? For a brief historical moment, humanity has flown high like Icarus, on a vulnerable first generation Internet platform. Which as been used for securing and using distributed ideas, arts, media science, commerce, and machines. Promising brilliant futures with the arrival of networked things, autonomous personalized services and immersive media. But, now our first generation Internet , built on a fragile global network of vulnerable codes and protocols, is falling apart, like Icarus' wings, through a triple shock from:<br />
<ul>
<li>Massive dotcom data stalker economy built on mining of terabytes personal data.</li>
<li>Ubiquitous criminal penetration of financial and identity networks, on our devices, in the cloud.</li>
<li>Pervasive state intruders at all levels and every encrypted hardware and software node.</li>
</ul>
Humans eventually conquered the barriers to flight and learned to build durable and resilient aircraft. Similarly, humans must learn to build a more reliable, private and secure Internet for communications, innovation and commerce. We will share our thoughts on how we might go about the design of a more durable and resilient Internet:<br />
<ul>
<li>How prepared is the Internet for future human benefit?</li>
<li>What are the attributes of a future more durable internet?</li>
<li>What are the existing assets that could be harnessed?</li>
<li>What needs to be developed?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
Dewayne's slides for this talk are <a href="http://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/140305-slides.pdf">here</a>.  Video of the talk is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzUjFyQowT0">YouTube</a>
<h3>dewayne-net</h3>
For many years Dewayne with impeccable taste curated dewayne-net, an e-mail list to which he sent links, most he found but some contributed by his friends. A typical e-mail would have the title of the linked post, a link, and enough of the content to encourage recipients to read the whole thing. The last e-mails were two on 19<sup>th</sup> August, as it happens both links that I had sent him earlier. I have been one of the more frequent contributors, although only perhaps 20% of my contributions passed the curatorial filter. Prof. Dave Farber's <a href="https://ip.topicbox.com/groups/ip">IP list</a> is a similar and I believe even longer-standing list; he and Dewayne exchanged links fairly often.<br />
<br />
As an example of the list in full flow, lets take April 2022. That month he sent 66 e-mails, many about the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine, obviously both top of mind at the time. But they included topics including satellite tracking of commercial aircraft, the Kessler syndrome, the problems of the US patent system, cybercrime, microplastics, banned math textbooks in Florida, and Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter. I am already greatly missing this window into Dewayne's eclectic set of interests.<br />

It's a <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_9_pro_phone_case">case</a> for the new <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_9_pro">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. It shipped 17 days go. It was hell to just tell Google that the case was lost. I expected at that point they'd apologize and refund the money. That was a week ago. Just got an email saying want me to return the case when it arrives. It's never going to arrive. Luckily this is a cheap product, just $38. If it had happened with the $1300 phone, that would be a pretty big problem. It's amazing that a company the size and age of Google doesn't have a procedure for dealing with products that are lost (or more likely stolen) in transit. I've been through this with Amazon, they knew what to do, because UPS does lose packages, esp ones that look like they have phones in them. Anyway I have a fairly large credit with Google. I don't dare use it to purchase anything else, given how incompetent they are at dealing with fairly common customer problems.

Scripps at the time was involved with IBM in developing a line-of-sight optical network, which worked brilliantly on campus.

Getting in touch with some medical friends, they were concerned she&rsquo;d had a heart attack. This was near the mark: she had contracted a virus which had destroyed a third of her heart muscle. It took her a few years to die, and a miserable time it was for her and for us both. After the funeral, I had rented out my house and bought a Toyota motorhome, and I began traveling around the country. I ran my Asus through a solar panel hooked up to an inverter, a system which worked well and kept the beast going.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">After a couple of years, I decided to have a look around Australia.

A few tweaks around the ACPI subsystem and it computed away merrily, with not a BSOD in sight. A friend of mine who had popped in for a visit was so impressed with it that he ordered one too, and that arrived about three months later.

## Hacking the “Bike Angels” System for Moving Bikeshares

date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>I always like a good hack. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/nyregion/citi-bike-scam-nyc.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">this story</a> delivers. Basically, the New York City bikeshare program has a system to reward people who move bicycles from full stations to empty ones. By deliberately moving bikes to create artificial problems, and exploiting exactly how the system calculates rewards, some people are making a lot of money.</p>
<blockquote><p>At 10 a.m. on a Tuesday last month, seven Bike Angels descended on the docking station at Broadway and 53rd Street, across from the Ed Sullivan Theater. Each rider used his own special blue key -­- a reward from Citi Bike&#8212;­ to unlock a bike. He rode it one block east, to Seventh Avenue. He docked, ran back to Broadway, unlocked another bike and made the trip again...</p></blockquote>

## Enough twitter

date: 2024-09-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>BTW, to be clear, I have no interest in working on twitter-like systems.</p>
<p>It's been like a prison to writers, we're stuck with this huge divide, with crap on both sides.  </p>
<p>These things exist, they have a jumble of APIs and ways to integrate. </p>
<p>And we've been playing by the rules laid down by Twitter (ev, biz and jack) for 18 freaking years. That's enough. </p>
<p>This will never get sorted out until people realize it needs sorting out.</p>
<p>Not expecting much more to happen there. </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Instead of just fact-checking the candidates, and presenting "both sides," how about recording the number of times the candidate threatens specific races, genders, lifestyles, origins, religions and of course individual people. Keep a page where you tally the groups he <i>doesn't</i> threaten with expulsion or worse. That would be very revealing, and in line with the true issue of this election. Time for you all to get in sync with the actual American history that's being made.

Social networks are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=social+networks+race+hate">condemned</a> when they carry lies from race-hate, misogyny and worse, but the major news orgs do it all the time. It's ridiculous that there are two standards.

To my programmer friends, how long would it have taken to answer <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/66f038e3-7218-8012-a294-05bb7afa9b97">this question</a> using Google and StackExchange. There was a bug in this one line of code, a call to <i>new Date ()</i> in JavaScript, that was behaving as if months were not 0-based, which they are known to be. The problem: I was specifying the day as 0 and month, correctly, but the day had to be 1 in order for it to work and without thinking I had specified it as 0.
