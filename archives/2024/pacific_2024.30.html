<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Powerful leaders of the Democratic establishment quickly embraced Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday after President Joe Biden&amp;#8217;s shocking exit from the race, hoping that a seamless succession could end a month of damaging chaos and transform a contest widely believed to be tipping toward Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;A couple of decades ago, universities entered a new kind of competition. In addition to the academic programs, campuses were enhancing their living and recreation facilities. I still remember the first time I heard about the lazy river installed at Louisiana State University in 2017 that spelled out &amp;#8220;LSU,&amp;#8221; but they were by no means the only university that sought to woo students based on out-of-class amenities. Water parks, giant spa pools, aquatic basketball, etc. popped up at several large campuses. Predictably, there was also backlash from faculty and citizens, especially concerning these projects at public universities (see the NY Times opinion piece &amp;#8220;No College Kid Needs a Water Park to Study&amp;#8221;). Still, despite these amenities, students still come to universities to learn and to gain the credentials to make a good living, support their families, and contribute to the well-being of their communities.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Iused to think of Athens as a big ugly city with obligatory ancient sights, fine museums, the Plaka (the extremely touristy old center), and not much else. &amp;#8220;The joy of Greece is outside of Athens,&amp;#8221; I wrote. &amp;#8220;See Athens&amp;#8217; museums and scram.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

deter day-trippers, Venice tested a 5 euro entrance fee. Did visitors
