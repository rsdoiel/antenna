<p>Amazon’s plans to shift its packaging strategy points at a new front
in the lengthy tug of war between paper and plastic—a war that started
in grocery stores.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;With great timing, a post by Nicolas titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/06/23/should-i-remove-this-blog-from-google-search&quot;&gt;Should I remove this blog from Google Search?&lt;/a&gt;” landed in my RSS feed earlier today. I’ve been thinking a lot about the current phase the web is going through, especially after reading all the various news related to Perplexity AI. I don’t think they’re especially bad or wrong in what they’re doing, I’m sure the other companies are equally as bad and they’re also not giving half of a fuck about ingesting whatever they can find if it helps make their products better. They don’t care about book authors, they don’t care about journalists and they for sure don’t care about small personal bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
That brings up the question: what do we do? What even can we do? It’s
obvious that robots.txt is no longer an option because most companies
don’t even bother checking it. We can try to block the user agents at a
server level but they can avoid that by simply sending a generic UA. We
could de-list our sites but that would make it very hard for actual
users to find our content and I suspect the point of writing for most of
us is to share and connect with others. The legal system sure ain’t
gonna fix this situation anytime soon. So what’s left? I guess there are
only two options left:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Accept the fact that some dickheads will do whatever they want because
that’s just the world we live in
</li>
<li>
Make everything private and only allow actual human beings access to our
content
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Both solutions are suboptimal. Reading Nicolas’s post made me also think
about something else. He wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the case of Perplexity for example, a company that obviously steals
content, lies, doesn’t really credit its sources, and — on top of it
all — ignores the robots.txt rules from websites. If I were the
TechCrunch, the New York Times, and the Financial Times of the world, I
would simply stop reporting on the company. Not a blip on the radar,
radio silence, except for their next fuck up. And then good luck finding
investors if no one talks about you. They had their chance, they blew
it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What if Google decided to do that? What if Google decided to not return
any result related to a company like Perplexity? I know it’s obviously
not going to happen but wouldn’t that be funny?

<p>I don’t think it does. Not for everything. We already have personal
AI for autocomplete. Do we need Big Compute for a personal AI to tell us
which pieces within our Amazon orders are in which line items in our

different charges on a card.) […]</p>

<p>The tech news has had a lot of coverage recently of Microsoft’s
proposed ‘Recall‘ system, which (as a very rough approximation) takes a
screenshot of your display every five seconds, and uses their AI-type
Copilot system to allow you to search it. “What was that cafe or
restaurant that someone in the call recommended yesterday?”

<h2 id="andrew-s.-tanenbaum-receives-acm-software-system-award">Andrew
S. Tanenbaum receives ACM Software System Award</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Andrew S. Tanenbaum, professor emeritus of Computer Science at VU
Amsterdam, receives the ACM Software System Award for MINIX, which
influenced the teaching of Operating Systems principles to multiple
generations of students and contributed to the design of widely used
operating systems, including Linux. Tanenbaum created MINIX 1.0 in 1987
to accompany his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation.
MINIX was a small microkernel-based UNIX operating system for the IBM
PC, which was popular at the time. It was roughly 12,000 lines of code,
and in addition to the microkernel, included a memory manager, file
system and core UNIX utility programs. It became free open-source
software in 2000. ↫ VU Amsterdam website Definitely a deserved award for
Tanenbaum, and it’s a minuscule bit of pride that VU Amsterdam happens
to be my Alma mater. He also wrote an article for OSNews way back in
2006, detailing MINIX 3, which is definitely a cool notch to have on our
belt.</p>
