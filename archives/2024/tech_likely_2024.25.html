<h2 id="cinnamon-6.2-released">Cinnamon 6.2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Cinnamon, the popular GTK desktop environment developed by the Linux
Mint project, pushed out Cinnamon 6.2 today, which will serve as the
default desktop for Linux Mint 22. It’s a relatively minor release, but
it does contain a major new feature which is actually quite welcome: a
new GTK frontend for GNOME Online Accounts, part of the XApp project.
This makes it possible to use the excellent GNOME Online Accounts
framework, without having to resort to a GNOME application – and will
come in very handy on other GTK desktops, too, like Xfce. The remainder
of the changes consist of a slew of bugfixes, small new features, and
nips and tucks here and there. Wayland support is still an in-progress
effort for Cinnamon, so you’ll be stuck with X for now.</p>

<p>Less than a month after 3.5.0, IceWM is already shipping version
3.6.0. Once again not a major, earth-shattering release, it does contain
at least one really cool feature that I think it pretty nifty: if you
double-click on a window border, it will maximise just that side of the
window. Pretty neat. For the rest, it’s small changes and bug fixes for
this venerable window manager.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems that if you want to steer clear from having Facebook use
your Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. data for machine learning
training, you might want to consider moving to the European Union. Meta
has apparently paused plans to process mounds of user data to bring new
AI experiences to Europe. The decision comes after data regulators
rebuffed the tech giant’s claims that it had “legitimate interests” in
processing European Union- and European Economic Area (EEA)-based
Facebook and Instagram users’ data—including personal posts and
pictures—to train future AI tools. ↫ Ashley Belanger These are just the
opening salvos of the legal war that’s brewing here, so who knows how
it’s going to turn out. For now, though, European Union Facebook users
are safe from Facebook’s machine learning training.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way, way back in the cold and bleak days of 2021, I mentioned Vinix
on OSNews, an operating system written in the V programming language. A
few days ago, over on Mastodon, the official account for the V
programming language sent out a screenshot showing Solitaite running on
Vinix, showing off what the experimental operating system can do. The
project doesn’t seem to really publish any changelogs or release notes,
so it’s difficult to figure out what, exactly, is going on at the
moment. The roadmap indicates they’ve already got a solid base going to
work from, such as mlibc, bash, GCC/G++, X and an X window manager, and
more – with things like Wayland, networking, and more on the
roadmap.</p>

id="microsoft-starts-beating-the-windows-11-pr-drum-in-face-of-reluctant-windows-10-users">Microsoft
starts beating the Windows 11 PR drum in face of reluctant Windows 10
users</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>I have a feeling Microsoft is really starting to feel some pressure
about its plans to abandon Windows 10 next year. Data shows that 70% of
Windows users are still using Windows 10, and this percentage has proven
to be remarkably resilient, making it very likely that hundreds of
millions of Windows users will be out of regular, mainstream support and
security patches next year. It seems Microsoft is, therefore, turning up
the PR campaign, this time by publishing a blog post about myths and
misconceptions about Windows 11. The kind of supposed myths and
misconceptions Microsoft details are exactly the kind of stuff
corporations with large deployments worry about at night. For instance,
Microsoft repeatedly bangs the drum on application compatibility,
stating that despite the change in number – 10 to 11 – Windows 11 is
built on the same base as its predecessor, and as such, touts 99.7%
application compatibility. Furthermore, Microsoft adds that if
businesses to suffer from an incompatibility, they can use something
call App Assure – which I will intentionally mispronounce until the day
I die because I’m apparently a child – to fix any issues. Apparently,
the visual changes to the user interface in Windows 11 are also a cause
of concern for businesses, as Microsoft dedicated an entire entry to
this, citing a study that the visual changes do not negatively impact
productivity. The blog post then goes on to explain how the changes are
actually really great and enhance productivity – you know, the usual PR
speak. There’s more in the blog post, and I have a feeling we’ll be
seeing more and more of this kind of PR offensive as the cut-off date
for Windows 10 support nears. Windows 10 users will probably also see
more and more Windows 11 ads when using their computers, too, urging
them to upgrade even when they very well cannot because of missing TPMs
or unsupported processors. I don’t think any of these things will work
to bring that 70% number down much over the next 12 months, and that’s a
big problem for Microsoft. I’m not going to make any predictions, but I
wouldn’t be surprised if Microsoft will simply be forced by, well,
reality to extend the official support for Windows 10 well beyond 2025.
Especially with all the recent investigations into Microsoft’s shoddy
internal security culture, there’s just no way they can cut 70% of their
users off from security updates and patches.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Stranded on a desert island; lost in the forest; stuck in the snow;
injured and unable to get back to civilization. Human beings have used
their ingenuity for millennia to try to signal for rescue. there’s been
a progression of technological innovations: smoke signals, mirrors, a
loud whistle, a portable radio, a mobile phone. With each invention,
it’s been possible to venture a little farther from populated areas and
still have peace of mind about being able to call for help. But once you
get past the range of a terrestrial radio tower, whether it’s into the
wilderness or out at sea, it starts to get more complicated and
expensive to be able to call for rescue. In the next year or so, it’s
going to become a lot simpler and less expensive. Probably enough to
become ubiquitous. Hardware infrastructure is already in place, and the
relevant software and service support is rolling out now. It’s been
possible for decades for adventurers to keep in contact via satellite.
The first commercial maritime satellite communications was launched in
1976. Globalstar and Iridium launched in the late 90s and drove down the
device size and service cost of satellite phones. However, the service
was a lot more expensive than cellular phone service, and not enough
people were willing to pay for remote comms to be able to overcome the
massive infrastructure costs, and both companies went bankrupt. Their
investors lost their money, but the satellites still worked, so once the
bankruptcies were hashed out they fulfilled their promise, as least
technologically. On a parallel track, in the late 1980s International
Cospas-Sarsat Programme was set up to develop a system for satellite
aided search and rescue system that detects and locates emergency
beacons activated by aircraft, ships and people engaged in recreational
activities in remote areas, and then sends these distress alerts to
search-and-rescue (SAR) authorities. Many types of beacons are
available, and nowadays they send exact GPS coordinates along with the
call for rescue. In the 2010s, the Satellite Emergency Notification
Device or SEND device was brought to market. These are portable beacons
that connect to the Globalstar and Iridium networks and allow people in
remote areas not only to call for help in emergencies, but also to
communicate via text messaging. Currently the two most popular SEND
devices are the Garmin inReach Mini 2 and the Spot X. These devices cost
$400 and $250 USD respectively, and require monthly service fees of
$12-40. For someone undertaking a long and dangerous expedition into the
backcountry, these are very reasonable costs, especially for someone who
does it often. But for most people, it’s just not practical to pay for
and carry a device like that “just in case.” In 2022, the iPhone 14
included a feature that was the first step in taking satellite-based
communication into the mainstream. It allows iPhone users to share their
location via Find My feature with new radio hardware that connects to
the Globalstar service. So if you’re out adventuring, your friends can
keep track of where you are. And if there’s an emergency, you can make
an emergency SOS. It’s not just a generic Mayday: you can text specific
details about your emergency and it will be transmitted to the local
authorities. You can also choose to notify your personal emergency
contacts. Last week, at WWDC, Apple announced the next stage: in iOS 18,
iMessage users will be able to send text messages over satellite, using
the same Globalstar network as its SOS features. Initially at least,
this feature is expected to be free. With this expansion, iPhone users
will have the basic functionality of a SPOT or inReach device, without
special hardware or a monthly fee. SpaceX’s Starlink, which first
offered service in 2021, has much higher bandwidth and lower latency
than the Globalstar and Iridium networks. Starlink’s current offering
requires a dinner plate sized antenna and conventional networking
hardware to enable high bandwidth mobile internet. It’s great for a
vehicle, but impractical for a backpacker. However, SpaceX has announced
2nd generation satellites that can connect to 1900MHz spectrum mobile
phone radios, and T-Mobile has announced that it will be enabling the
service for its customers in late 2024, and Apple, Google, and Samsung
devices are confirmed to be supported. Initially, like Apple’s service,
this will be restricted to text messaging and other low-bandwidth
applications. Phone calls and higher bandwidth internet connectivity are
promised in 2025. The other two big US carriers, AT&amp;T and Verizon,
have announced they will be partnering with a competing service, AST
SpaceMobile, but it’s unlikely those plans will come to fruition very
soon. Mobile phone users outside the US will also need to wait. Apple’s
Message via satellite is only announced for US users, as is T-Mobile’s
offering. So if you’re in the US, and have an iPhone, or are a T-Mobile
subscriber with an Apple, Samsung, or Google device, you’ll soon be able
to point your phone at the sky, even in remote areas, to call for help,
give your friends an update on your expedition, or just stay in touch.
Pretty soon, Tom Hanks won’t have to make friends with a volleyball when
he crash lands on a deserted island, at least not until his battery
dies.</p>

<h2 id="twenty-years-ago-today">Twenty years ago today</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I was talking with a friend over the weekend about the origins of
podcasting, and how, in June of 2004, I finally decided to do an audio
post, to get my feet wet, and to prove all you needed was a laptop and a
little software and you could be doing radio almost as easily as writing
a blog post.
</p>
<p>
That was
<a href="http://scripting.com/2004/06/11.html#When:9:13:45AM">June 11,
2004</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then it hit me, it’s June <i>2024</i> now, it’s been <i>twenty freaking
years</i>.
</p>
<p>
In hindsight, that podcast was the start of the bootstrap that saw a
dozen shows by September and then hundreds and thousands, and now here
we are, podcasting has been through quite a few bursts of growth and
it’s still as open as it was back in June 2004.
</p>
<p>
<b>Anyone with a laptop can do a podcast</b>. That was the goal. You
don’t need anyone’s permission. That was a breakthrough in radio. Prior
to that, you had to get a lot of approval, and every step made it less
real and less interesting, imho.
</p>
<p>
My partner in this at the time was
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Adam+Curry">Adam
Curry</a>. Sometime in that period he started
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Source_Code">The Daily
Source Code</a>, and then we did a podcast together for a few months
called <a href="http://secrets.scripting.com/">Trade Secrets</a>. My own
podcast was called <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning
Coffee Notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
So I thought, why not do a Serial-like podcast over the next few months,
with the actual programs from 2004, along with the Trade Secrets shows.
I think I have them all archived. And it would be great if Adam did the
same with his shows, starting when they started. And Dawn &amp; Drew,
Dave Slusher. This can go on forever if you like. (I promise mine
won’t.)
</p>
<p>
So here’s the URL for the podcast.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml</a>
</p>
<p>
I’m sure there will be a lot of cringeworthy moments, but what the heck.
I’ll hopefully have the feed up before the end of the day, and I’ll
register it with Apple so will hopefully be transcripts.
</p>
<p>
I hope I can count on you to spread the word, this is how the podcasting
bootstrap happened. If you want to learn how two weird geek hippie types
like Adam and myself, can have an idea, and then by constantly trying
out new approaches, eventually it sticks and becomes a new medium that’s
still thriving twenty years later.
</p>
<p>
It should be quite a story! :-)
</p>
<p>
Here’s a picture of myself and Adam at Gnomedex in the summer of 2004.
And that’s the laptop I used to make all these podcasts. I was living in
Seattle at the time.

<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a> and I have
been trying to connect our servers using old tech for quite a while.
</p>
<h2 id="uucp">
UUCP
</h2>
<p>
The latest effort has been in connecting our servers using <em>Unix to
Unix copy</em> (UUCP). The benefit is that once you have that, you can
also have <em>remote command execution over UUCP</em> using
<code>uux</code> and it is as terrifying as it sounds.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see whether I can reconstruct my setup.
</p>
<p>
I use Debian.
</p>
<p>
lkh has a “travelling laptop” that is mostly offline, but sometimes it’s
online. That’s when he wants to exchange stuff with us. The laptop is
called Dwalin.
</p>
<p>
My server is Campaign Wiki.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for peering between news servers via UUCP is available
via <code>man 8 send-uucp</code>.
</p>
<h3 id="var-spool-uucp-ssh-authorized-keys">
/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys
</h3>
<p>
This allows Dwalin to connect via ssh.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins public key, ssh executes the remote
# uucico and hands over my login:
restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Udwalin -l&quot; ssh-rsa another-long-string-of-stuff uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-passwd">
/etc/uucp/passwd
</h3>
<p>
This is where Dwalin’s password is stored. This is important because
there’s no actual Dwalin user on my system.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins login on campaignwiki
Udwalin some-long-string-of-stuff
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-sys">
/etc/sys
</h3>
<p>
I kept the defaults and added Dwalin.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins system entry, no Port or
# credentials are given, since dwalin
# is expected to always call in.
system dwalin
called-login Udwalin
local-send /
local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
time any
forward ANY
protocol i
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-config">
/etc/uucp/config
</h3>
<p>
This is where I set my own node name.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me some spool related entries. I’m not sure whether I needed
them.
</p>
<pre><code>nodename campaignwiki

spool     /var/spool/uucp
pubdir    /var/spool/uucppublic
lockdir   /var/spool/uucp/Lock
logfile   /var/spool/uucp/Log     # The UUCP log file
statfile  /var/spool/uucp/Stats   # The UUCP statistics file
debugfile /var/spool/uucp/Debug   # The UUCP debugging file
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
In our case, lkh’s Dwalin is connected to kyonshi’s Erebor system and
here’s me sending a file to Erebor via Dwalin (since I’m not connected
to Erebor directly):
</p>
<pre><code>uucp some-local-file 'dwalin!ereborbbs.duckdns.org!~/'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="news">
News
</h2>
<p>
Yes, we want to exchange news. That means we need to install INN.
</p>
<p>
Look at the requisites:
</p>
<pre><code>perldoc /usr/lib/news/bin/send-uucp.pl
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-send-uucp-cf">
/etc/news/send-uucp.cf
</h3>
<p>
This define the sites to send news to, how to compress them and how big
the batches should be.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin      gzip        1048576
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-newsfeeds">
/etc/news/newsfeeds
</h3>
<p>
Determine the newsgroups to send to Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code># newsfeed entry for dwalin
dwalin\
    :casa.*,campaignwiki.*,erebor.*\
    :Tf,Wnb,B4096/1024:

<p>
Oh yes, we do.

<p>
Debian comes with Exim. Exim uses Perl’s “taint” mechanism wherein
user-supplied values cannot be used for commands. They must be untainted
by a lookup. For example, a user supplied sender name like “alex” is
tainted, but if you look it up in <code>/etc/passwd</code> it becomes
untainted. Perl keeps track of this for you, if you want to. Once you
run into the error, however, you need to figure out where you could be
looking up the values you have. Is the local part a user on the system,
is the domain a local domain? I spent way too much time on this.

<p>
A new router for UUCP mail that has to come before
<code>200_exim4-config_primary</code>. If it comes after the primary,
then it won’t work because the primary router ends with
<code>no_more</code> and as the comment at the end of the file says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <code>no_more</code> above means that all later routers are for
domains in the local_domains list
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This router only accepts mail destined for domains listed in the new
file <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>### uucp      
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

uucp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: uucp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;

This is a file that translates the domain names I use for recipients to
UUCP names.
</p>
<p>
It only works for Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin   dwalin
</code></pre>
<p>
This means that a mail for <code>lkh@dwalin</code> gets recognised as
such (because of the first column) and it will be sent to the UUCP
system <code>dwalin</code> (because of the second column).
</p>
<p>
The UUCP system <code>dwalin</code> is correct because
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> has a section for <code>system dwalin</code>
(see above).
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim-conf-d-transport-40-exim4-config-uucp">
/etc/exim/conf.d/transport/40_exim4-config_uucp

The route above says that the transport to use is <code>rsmtp</code>.
</p>
<p>
Define this using a new transport config file:
</p>
<pre><code>### uucp
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

rsmtp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: rsmtp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver=pipe
    command = /usr/bin/uux - -r -a${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}} -gC $domain_data!rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 100
</code></pre>
<p>
This was the biggest problem for me. The examples I saw for the
<code>-a</code> argument to <code>uux</code> used
<code>$sender_address</code>, resulting in an error about the third
argument to <code>uux</code> being tainted. You can see these error
messages in the exim main log (followed by a log entry showing that exim
sends me a en error message):

</code></pre>
<p>
I guess the examples I had seen would only work for older Exim versions
that didn’t do taint checking.
</p>
<p>
The code I’m using means that I’m looking up the sender local part
(“alex” or “root”) in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and if a match is found,
the untainted key is returned (instead of the value from the password
list).
</p>
<p>
You can test these expressions on the command-line:
</p>
<pre><code>exim -d+all -be '${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}'
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it-2">

<p>
As an ordinary user, use <code>mail</code> on the command line to send
mail to <code>lkh@dwalin</code>.
</p>
<p>
Poor <code>lkh</code>. So many test mails.
</p>
<p>
As <code>root</code>, check the exim log:
</p>
<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus:~# tail /var/log/exim4/mainlog
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s a mail being enqueued successfully:

Hi,<br/> The Oberon subsystem opens in revision.10272 but the

&lt;F2&gt; doesn't clear marks. HotKeys has preempted the familiar

I found a note that &lt;F12&gt; should disable or toggle HotKeys. In

If you’re a regular reader of this site you know I love this kind of stuff and I especially love nuclear options when it comes to fighting silly tech.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

I experimented with blocking everything in the past but this recent
exchange made me want to revisit this idea. With perfect timing, Robb
Knight posted

<p>
I already had a 403 in place for Mastodon because I don’t want to get a
shit ton of traffic coming my way every time someone posts a link of
mine but I loved Matthew’s idea of returning a

</p>
<p>
So I grabbed 180 or so entries from the
<a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents">Dark Visitors’s agents

interesting to see if this has any effect on the server so I’ll write a
follow-up.

I tried to leave out all the RSS fetchers because I love RSS, RSS is
great and if you’re using RSS in 2024 you’re an awesome person BUT I
might have inadvertently broken some RSS feed out there with this move.

it.

<h2 id="streamos-source-code-republished-15-years-later">StreamOS source
code republished 15 years later</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way, way, way back in 2009, we reported on a small hobby operating
system called StreamOS – version 0.21-RC1 had just been released that
day. StreamOS was a 32-bit operating system written in Object Pascal
using the Free Pascal Compiler, running on top of FreeDOS. It turns out
that its creator, Oleksandr Natalenko (yes, the same person), recovered
the old code, and republished it on Codeberg for posterity. It’s not a
complete history, rather a couple of larger breadcrumbs stuck together
with git. I didn’t do source code management much back in the days, and
there are still some intermediate dev bits scattered across my backup
drive that I cannot even date properly, but three branches I pushed
(along with binaries, btw; feel free to fire up that qemu of yours and
see how it crashes!) should contain major parts of what was done. ↫
Oleksandr Natalenko It may not carry the same import as Doom for the
SNES, but it’s still great to see such continuity 15 years apart. I hope
Natalenko manages to recover the remaining bits and bobs too, because
you may never know – someone might be interested in picking up this 15
year old baton.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>The complete source code for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System

of the code was partially released a few years ago, this is the first
time the full source code has been made publicly available. ↫ Shaun
James at GBAtemp The code was very close to being lost forever, down to
a corrupted disk that had to be fixed. It’s crazy how much valuable,
historically relevant code we’re just letting rot away for no
reason.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-mac-enclaves-and-exclaves">A brief history of
Mac enclaves and exclaves</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Howard Oakley has written an interesting history of secure enclaves
on the Mac, and when he touches upon “exclaves”, a new concept that
doesn’t have a proper term yet, he mentions something interesting. While
an enclave is a territory entirely surrounded by the territory of
another state, an exclave is an isolated fragment of a state that exists
separately from the main part of that state. Although exclave isn’t a
term normally used in computing, macOS 14.4 introduced three kernel
extensions concerned with exclaves. They seem to have appeared first in
iOS 17, where they’re thought to code domains isolated from the kernel
that protect key functions in macOS even when the kernel becomes
compromised. This in turn suggests that Apple is in the process of
refactoring the kernel into a central micro-kernel with protected
exclaves. This has yet to be examined in Sequoia. ↫ Howard Oakley I’m
not going to add too much here since I’m not well-versed enough in the
world of macOS to add anything meaningful, but I do think it’s an
interesting theory worth looking into by people who posses far more
knowledge about this topic than I do.</p>

<h2 id="imagine-rss-as-a-cover-story">Imagine RSS as a cover story</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> has never been
on the cover of a magazine, so you can’t say ChatGPT is stealing this
from anyone. In fact I’m offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press
has chosen to focus on the idea that it’s plagiarizing journalists. The
ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If they’re doing
their jobs, they’re reporting facts that exist whether or not they wrote
a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a local paper
that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series">NLCS</a>.
I don’t owe a news org anything if I wrote that the Mets won, because I
read the news on their site. The news doesn’t belong to them.
</p>
<p>
The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn’t so
far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no
billionaires involved, so they didn’t consider it newsworthy I guess.
Some day we’re going to have to accept that we have to make our own
news, in the sense of Scoop Nisker’s famous line – “If you don’t like
the news go out and make some of your own.” So here we go. I asked
ChatGPT to imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story.

PS: Does the concept of a cover story even exist now that we rarely read

find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don’t know the extent
of it, but there’s a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I’m
thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the

do. We don’t have a good grasp of the depth of the feed products either.

<h2 id="cloudnativepg-1.23.2-1.22.4-and-1.21.6-released">CloudNativePG
1.23.2, 1.22.4 and 1.21.6 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is thrilled to announce a
new update for the <strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong>, now
available for the supported versions 1.23, 1.22, and 1.21.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to comprehensive refactoring and enhancement activities, we’ve
significantly improved the reliability of our automated End-to-End (E2E)
tests. With contributions from
<a href="https://enterprisedb.com">EDB</a>, we’ve tested the operator on
all major cloud providers, identified several defects, and resolved them
in these new releases, ensuring a more stable and resilient software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Versions 1.23.2, 1.22.4, and 1.21.6</strong> are patch releases
that contain crucial bug fixes, addressing issues such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Unnecessary reloads and shutdowns of PostgreSQL
</li>
<li>
Excessive CPU usage on fenced instances, due to busy waiting loop
</li>
<li>
The primary instance manager hanging indefinitely after a stop and
subsequent failure
</li>
<li>
Autovacuum not working correctly due to an issue between
<code>hot_standby_feedback</code> and our managed cluster-level
replication slots implementation
</li>
<li>
<code>pgaudit.log_rows</code> not functioning as intended
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With this update, version 1.21 has reached End-of-Life (EOL). Version
1.21.6 marks the final release for the 1.21 minor version.
</p>
<p>
We highly recommend updating the operator at your earliest convenience
to benefit from these improvements and bug fixes.
</p>
<p>
For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the release notes:
</p>
<ul>

<li>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.21/release_notes/v1.21/">Release
notes for 1.21.6</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additionally, we are pleased to announce that macOS users can now
install the <code>cnpg</code> plugin for <code>kubectl</code> via
Homebrew with the command: <code>brew install kubectl-cnpg</code>.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your continued support. We look forward to your seamless
experience with the updated CloudNativePG Operator. If you are using it
in production, please consider
<a href="https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md">adding
your organization as an adopter of the project</a>.
</p>
<p>
Your support helps us grow and improve!
