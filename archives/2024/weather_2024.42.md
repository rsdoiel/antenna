Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 PM CDT Mon Oct 14 2024

Valid 150100Z - 151200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected tonight.

...Discussion...
Isolated thunderstorms remain possible, mainly this evening, across
the Four Corners States ahead of a weak mid-level trough drifting
southeast over the southern Great Basin. Lake-effect showers and
embedded thunderstorms should remain most prevalent over Lake MI,
but will also be possible south of Lake Huron and Erie. Steep
mid-level lapse rates, sampled by the 00Z GRB/DTX soundings, will
slowly slide south atop the relatively warm waters and support weak
buoyancy for sporadic lightning flashes.

2. Western Caribbean Sea:<br>A broad area of low pressure could develop over the southwestern <br>Caribbean Sea by the middle to latter portions of this week. Some <br>gradual development is possible thereafter if the system stays over <br>water while it moves slowly west-northwestward towards northern <br>Central America. Regardless of development, locally heavy rainfall <br>is possible across portions of Central America later this week.<br>* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br>* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.<br><br />

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0459 PM CDT Mon Oct 14 2024

Valid 161200Z - 221200Z

...Days 3/Wednesday...
On Day 3/Wednesday, an expansive surface anticyclone will move
eastward from the central Plains into the OH Valley. At the same
time, a lee trough will deepen over the northern/central High Plains
-- in response to strengthening deep-layer southwesterly flow ahead
of an amplifying large-scale trough over the West. This will result
in a tightening pressure gradient and strong/gusty southerly surface
winds across much of the northern/central High Plains -- aided by
boundary-layer mixing into a strong low-level jet. Limited low-level
moisture return will favor near-critical RH, and given very dry
fuels, elevated to critical conditions are expected. Confidence in
the development of critical conditions is highest over south-central
SD and central NE, where the best overlap of strong winds and low RH
is forecast amid the warmest surface temperatures. 

Farther west, the strong southwesterly midlevel winds accompanying
the large-scale trough will overspread a relatively dry air mass
over the Great Basin. This will promote elevated to locally critical
fire-weather conditions during the afternoon. 

...Days 4-5/Thursday-Friday...
A tight pressure gradient and enhanced low-level jet will continue
to promote strong/gusty southerly surface winds over a large portion
of the Plains into the MS Valley on Day 4/Thursday. While elevated
to near-critical conditions are expected, confidence in critical
conditions is slightly lower than Day 3/Wednesday owing to
uncertainty in RH reductions. 

On the backside of the large-scale trough, strong deep-layer
northerly flow will overspread portions of central CA on Day
5/Friday. This will favor increasing fire-weather concerns, and
elevated to critical conditions are possible.
