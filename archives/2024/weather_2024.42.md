## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0459 PM CDT Tue Oct 15 2024

Valid 171200Z - 231200Z

A large-scale trough will amplify over the western CONUS on Days
3-4/Thursday-Friday, before evolving into a closed midlevel low over
the Four Corners region into Day 6/Saturday. Ahead of the trough,
strong deep-layer south-southwesterly flow will overspread the Great
Plains on Day 3/Thursday, while the surface pressure gradient
tightens between a deepening lee trough over the High Plains and
expansive surface anticyclone over the eastern CONUS.

...Day 3/Thursday - Northern/Central Plains...
The tightening pressure gradient and shallow boundary-layer mixing
into the strong deep-layer flow will favor an expansive area of
strong/gusty southerly surface winds across the Great Plains and
Upper/Middle MS Valley. While the degree of boundary-layer
heating/mixing and related RH reductions are uncertain (especially
with northward extent), confidence in at least 25-percent RH
overlapping the strong/gusty winds is high enough to introduce a
70-percent Critical area. 

...Day 4/Friday - Northern/Central California...
On the backside of the amplified large-scale trough, strong
deep-layer northerly flow will develop across California on Day
4/Friday -- where a relatively warm/dry air mass will be in place.
This will promote elevated to locally critical fire-weather
conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Tue Oct 15 2024

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN SOUTH DAKOTA...CENTRAL
NEBRASKA...AND INTO NORTHERN/NORTHWEST KANSAS...

The Critical area in the central/northern Plains was expanded
slightly westward, northward, and northeastward. Here, confidence in
the overlap of 20-25 mph sustained southerly surface winds (with
higher gusts) and around 20 percent RH over dry fuels has increased.

An Elevated area was introduced over portions of the central Gulf
Coast, where breezy post-frontal winds (sustained around 15 mph with
higher gusts) will overlap 25-30 percent RH for a few hours during
the afternoon. The Elevated area has been confined to areas that
missed out on appreciable rainfall over the last month, and fuels
should be receptive to fire spread. 

Elsewhere, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Weinman.. 10/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0230 AM CDT Tue Oct 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
...Central and Northern Plains...
A strong (sub 1000mb) surface cyclone will develop across eastern
Montana on Monday, with strong winds expected across much of the
central and northern Plains. This is due to the tight pressure
gradient between this surface low and the strong area of high
pressure centered over the Tennessee Valley. The strongest winds are
expected from west-central Kansas to southern South Dakota where
sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph are possible. The lowest relative
humidity is also expected in a similar area with sub 20 percent
relative humidity from the Texas Panhandle to central Minnesota. A
Critical area has been added from west-central Kansas to southern
South Dakota where these strongest winds and low relative humidities
overlap the driest fuels.

...Central Nevada into western Utah...
Some troughing may develop in the lee of the Sierra on Wednesday as
a mid-level trough crosses California. The combination of some
modest mid-level flow strengthening above a well mixed airmass, and
some tightening of the pressure gradient, may result in 15 to 20 mph
winds across central Nevada and into western Utah. An extended
period of above normal temperatures have dried fuels substantially
in this region recently. Therefore, an Elevated delineation has been
added to address the threat. 

...Gulf Coast...
Some dry and breezy offshore flow is possible across portions of the
Gulf Coast Wednesday with relative humidity of 20 to 30 percent and
surface winds of 10 to 15 mph. The strongest winds are currently
only forecast near the coast where fuels are not as receptive. The
only exception is across central Louisiana where some stronger winds
are possible. However, relative humidity is also not forecast to be
as dry across this region.
