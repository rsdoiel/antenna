Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1219 PM CDT Tue Sep 03 2024

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL ROCKIES...CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...NORTHERN PLAINS...AND
THE MIDWEST....

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe storms are possible on Wednesday across
parts of the central and northern Rockies and Plains into parts of
Minnesota.

...Synopsis...
A broad, positively tilted trough with several embedded shortwave
troughs will become more consolidated and start to amplify across
the northern Plains on Wednesday and Wednesday night. At the
surface, a cold front will move southeast across the northern Plains
with scattered thunderstorms possible. The greater thunderstorm
coverage is expected during the afternoon/evening across the central
Rockies, beneath the coldest air aloft, and across northwest
Wisconsin/eastern Minnesota early Thursday morning as the low-level
jet intensifies along the frontal zone. 

...Central Rockies into the central High Plains...
Scattered to widespread thunderstorms are expected across the
central Rockies on Wednesday afternoon as cold air aloft (-12C at
500mb) combines with significant heating over the higher terrain.
The greatest instability will be near the center of the vorticity
maximum/cold air pocket where wind shear will be quite weak. Some
wind gusts or isolated large hail will be possible, but a more
organized threat seems unlikely. A more favorable wind profile will
exist along the southern periphery of this trough from eastern Utah
to southern Wyoming and northern Colorado. However, the warmer
temperatures aloft within this corridor may limit storm
coverage/intensity somewhat. Therefore, a few strong to locally
severe storms are possible from southern Montana to northern
Colorado, western Nebraska, and southwest South Dakota, however, a
displacement between the best instability and wind shear should keep
the threat somewhat limited.  

...Upper Midwest...
A mid-level shortwave trough will eject across the Dakotas, in the
vicinity of the cold front, during the day Wednesday. Therefore, a
few thunderstorms are possible along the cold front, but a lack of
better moisture should mostly limit the daytime thunderstorm threat.
However, as the low-level jet strengthens overnight, it will result
in some moistening between 850mb and 700mb which will likely result
in more widespread thunderstorm development after 06Z. During this
period, mid-level flow will also strengthen from around 25 knots to
near 35 knots by 12Z. This will improve the shear across the region
and therefore, result in some threat for large hail and damaging
wind gusts near sunrise as storms develop within a region of
moderate instability and 30 to 35 knots of shear.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 AM CDT Tue Sep 03 2024

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

No changes are needed to the current D1 Fire Weather outlook. See
previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 09/03/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0102 AM CDT Tue Sep 03 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will continue into today across parts of the
northern Great Basin/northern Rockies as well as the Plains. The
upper trough currently over OR is forecast to slowly shift east over
the next 24 hours, reaching the northern Rockies by early Wednesday.
As this occurs, breezy surface winds within the dry slot of the
maturing low will support dry/windy conditions across parts of NV
and ID. Over the Plains, a tightening surface pressure gradient will
maintain windy conditions through the afternoon, resulting in areas
of elevated to critical fire weather conditions. 

...Nevada into Idaho...
A pronounced dry slot is developing in low-level water-vapor imagery
across the northwestern Great Basin/southern OR as the upper low
continues to mature. This dry slot is forecast to spread east
through this afternoon, which will limit cloud and precipitation
chances for northern NV and central to eastern ID and help support
RH reductions into the teens. Numerous lightning strikes have been
observed over the past 24 hours across this region with GOES IR
imagery showing active large fires as of 05 UTC. This fire activity
demonstrates the very receptive nature of the current fuel landscape
(with the exception of the few locations that received wetting
rainfall), and any holdover fires that resulted from the recent
lightning activity may become more active today as west/southwest
winds increase by late afternoon. Latest deterministic and ensemble
solutions continue to suggest 15-20 mph winds will be common,
especially through the Snake River Plain of southern/eastern ID and
in the lee of the Independence and Ruby Mountains in northeast NV. A
few locations may see periods of critical wind/RH conditions, but
recent guidance suggests elevated conditions are more likely.

Away from the dry slot, isolated to scattered thunderstorms are
expected again today across the broader central/northern Rockies
region. Forecast storm motions near 30 knots and PWAT values between
0.6 to 0.8 inches suggest dry lightning strikes are possible.
However, higher MLCAPE values and lower LCL heights compared to
yesterday (Monday) are mitigating factors for predominantly dry
thunderstorms. Additionally, latest guidance shows a better QPF
signal compared to previous days, which further limits confidence in
the dry lightning threat. While this concern precludes risk
highlights, any lightning strike may support fire starts given the
very dry fuel conditions (ERCs above the 90th percentile).

...Wyoming into Nebraska and South Dakota...
Surface pressure has been steadily falling across western NE/SD over
the past 12-24 hours, and is expected to fall further through the
afternoon as a lee trough continues to deepen. This will maintain
breezy southerly winds across the central Plains as well as
strengthen westerly downslope flow across eastern WY this afternoon.
Downslope warming/drying will result in another day of 15-20% RH
minimums across eastern WY and far western NE/SD. Elevated fire
weather conditions appear likely within the downslope regime prior
to the arrival of clouds (and potentially showers/thunderstorms)
around early evening.

To the east, modest moisture return into the Plains is ongoing,
which will result in a zonal moisture gradient across the Plains by
mid afternoon. Recent solutions suggest that the strongest winds may
lie within this moisture gradient, resulting in a somewhat confined
corridor of elevated fire weather conditions where 15-25 mph winds
(gusting to 30-35 mph at times) will overlap with 15-25% RH values.
Although guidance occasionally struggles to accurately capture the
degree of boundary-layer mixing within these return flow regimes,
latest deterministic solutions appear to be capturing moisture
trends well and don't show substantial signs of a moist bias. This
lends confidence to the ongoing forecast of predominantly elevated
fire weather conditions across the region (although some locations
may see periods of critical conditions).

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Tue Sep 03 2024

Valid 031630Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES/GREAT BASIN AND ADJACENT HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered thunderstorms developing across the northern Rockies and
adjacent portions of the Great Basin this afternoon may yield an
isolated severe risk, before spreading eastward toward the northern
High Plains this evening.

...Northern Great Basin/Rockies into the Adjacent High Plains...
Visible-satellite imagery this morning shows a smoke-encased mid to
upper-level low/vorticity maximum over central ID.  This upper
feature will move to near southwest MT/eastern ID late tonight.  The
satellite data late this morning shows agitated cumulus developing
immediately ahead of the vorticity max near the ID/MT border, and as
large-scale ascent spreads east, additional thunderstorms (widely
scattered to scattered coverage) should develop over the higher
terrain through early afternoon in tandem with daytime heating.

Forecast soundings across southwest MT into northwest WY show
500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE with some elongation of the hodograph.  A few
of the stronger storms will probably acquire transient supercell
characteristics and have an associated hail/wind threat.  Some
clustering may eventually evolve by early evening as storms move
into south-central MT and adjacent parts of northern WY.  

Somewhat more limited low-level moisture should be present this
afternoon farther south into WY and northern UT. Even so, diurnal
heating will aid in a deeply mixed boundary layer by this afternoon,
and steep mid-level lapse rates are also expected to remain over
this region. The net result will be high-based thunderstorms capable
of producing isolated severe gusts initially developing across
northern UT into far eastern ID, and subsequently moving
east-northeastward over WY through the evening.

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES/GREAT BASIN AND ADJACENT HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms developing across the northern Rockies and adjacent
portions of the Great Basin this afternoon may produce occasional
strong to severe wind gusts, before spreading eastward toward the
northern High Plains this evening.

...Northern Great Basin/Rockies into the Adjacent High Plains...
An upper trough/low over the Pacific Northwest this morning will
continue moving eastward today across the northern Rockies. This
feature is forecast to gradually weaken through the period, but
enhanced mid-level west-southwesterly flow will persist across parts
of the northern Great Basin into the northern Rockies and adjacent
High Plains. As large-scale ascent associated with the upper trough
overspreads the northern Rockies, thunderstorms should develop over
the higher terrain through early afternoon in tandem with daytime
heating.

Latest surface observations show somewhat greater low-level moisture
across this region, with surface dewpoints generally in the mid 40s
to low 50s across central ID into southwest MT. Although instability
is forecast to remain fairly modest this afternoon, deep-layer shear
around 25-35 kt should be sufficient to support organized
convection, including the potential for a couple of marginal
supercells initially with associated hail/wind threat. With
steepened low/mid-level lapse rates present, this activity should
continue to pose some threat for isolated strong to severe wind
gusts as it congeals and spreads east-northeastward across parts of
the northern High Plains through this evening.

Somewhat more limited low-level moisture should be present this
afternoon farther south into WY and northern UT. Even so, diurnal
heating will aid in a deeply mixed boundary layer by this afternoon,
and steep mid-level lapse rates are also expected to remain over
this region. The net result will be high-based thunderstorms capable
of producing isolated strong to severe winds initially developing
across northern UT into far eastern ID, and subsequently moving
east-northeastward over WY through the evening. Confidence in a more
concentrated corridor of severe winds remains generally low at this
time given the weak instability and modest deep-layer shear
forecast, especially with southward extent into the northern Great
Basin and WY.

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to be limited for Wednesday
across the country. The upper-level low currently over parts of the
Pacific Northwest is forecast to de-amplify and drift east into the
Plains. As this occurs, weak ascent will support widespread cloud
cover as well as isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms
across the central Rockies to central Plains. The surface pressure
trough currently in place along the High Plains will shift
east/southeast through the day, and while breezy conditions are
likely just ahead of the boundary, increasing moisture return into
the Plains will modulate diurnal RH reductions. Across the West,
building surface high pressure should limit wind speeds.
Consequently, the potential for elevated fire weather concerns
appears limited with no highlights required.

1254 PM CDT Sun Sep 01 2024

Areas affected...parts of western and northern New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011754Z - 011930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A broken line of storms may produce occasional gusty wind
this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Inhibition has been mostly eroded across western and
northern New York as temperatures have warmed to the upper 70s to
low 80s with mid 60s dewpoints. Expect scattered thunderstorms to
develop along a cold front once it moves east of Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario. Storms may be not be that deep given the relatively shallow
thermodynamic profile shown by the RAP forecast soundings. However,
relatively strong flow through the column and a well-mixed boundary
layer may support efficient transport of gusty winds to the surface
within these storms. Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible
through the afternoon with this threat waning near sunset.

## Tropical Storm Hone Forecast Discussion Number 41

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  41
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Sep 01 2024
 
The satellite presentation of Hone has become very ragged overnight, 
with the low-level circulation center becoming very difficult to 
locate with much confidence. An 1130z Oceansat-3 pass indicated 
that the low level center of Hone has shifted west-westward since 
the previous and appears to be merging with the mid-level low just 
east of the International Date Line. The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates from PHFO, SAB, and JTWC, all came in 
at 2.5 (35 kt), while the objective intensity estimates were 
similar. As a result, the initial intensity has been held at a 
perhaps generous 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is quite uncertain due to the low-level of Hone 
being in the process of merging with the mid-level low to the 
west, and is set at 300/12 kt. This general motion is expected 
to  continue today and tonight along with a decrease in forward 
speed as Hone merges with a mid-level low to the west.  Hone should 
begin moving northward with an increase in forward speed Monday and 
Monday night as it moves into a weakness in building mid-level 
ridges to the northwest and east of the system. A shift back toward 
the northwest is then expected late Tuesday through Thursday as a 
low and mid-level ridge builds to the north of Hone. The latest 
track forecast was adjusted to better align with the latest model 
guidance and generally follows the TVCE consensus.
 
Hone will be in a relatively favorable environment during the next
couple days, with warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical
wind shear. The interaction with a mid-level low, ragged LLCC and
entrainment of dry mid-level air should act to minimize the
potential for intensification however. Beyond 48 hours mid-level
moisture drops off considerably and the latest simulated satellite
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF suggest a loss of deep convection by
72 hours. As a result, the intensity forecast holds Hone as a 35 
kt Tropical Storm during the next couple days, with the cyclone 
expected to become a post-tropical remnant low by 72 hours, and 
dissipation occurring by 120 hours. The intensity forecast closely 
follows the latest intensity consensus guidance.
