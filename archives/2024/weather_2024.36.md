Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1124 AM CDT Thu Sep 05 2024

Valid 051630Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
FAR SOUTH-CENTRAL COLORADO INTO NORTHERN/CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of producing isolated severe wind gusts and
hail will be possible today across parts of far south-central
Colorado into northern/central New Mexico.

...Synopsis...
Satellite imagery shows a shortwave trough moving southeastward
through the central Rockies, between the upper ridging in place over
the western Great Basin and the broad upper troughing across central
Canadian and northern Plains/Upper MS Valley. Another shortwave
trough exists over the Upper MS Valley. This shortwave trough is
forecast to continue progressing eastward through the base broad
central Canada/northern Plains trough, moving across the Upper Great
Lakes and into eastern Ontario. 

Recent surface analysis places a surface low associated with this
shortwave over Lake Superior, with a cold front extending
southwestward from this low through KS and into northeast NM. This
front is forecast to progress southward/southeastward as its parent
surface low lifts northeastward. Isolated thunderstorms are possible
along this frontal boundary, but overall severity should be
mitigated by modest buoyancy and vertical shear. Greater
thunderstorm coverage and severity is anticipated over the southern
Rockies as the previously mentioned central Rockies shortwave trough
continues southeastward and promotes thunderstorm development. 

Lastly, a tropical wave just off the TX Coast is contributing to
abundant moisture across much of Gulf Coast, with low 70s dewpoints
reaching into much of east TX and northern LA, and upper 70s across
FL. Precipitable water values over 2" cover much of this region as
well. Heavy rain is the primary threat (as indicated by the latest
Day 1 Excessive Rainfall Outlook from WPC), but a few water-loaded
downbursts capable of damaging gusts are possible from southeast TX
and southern/central LA eastward along the Gulf Coast and over the
Florida Peninsula. Coverage of these gusts is expected to be sparse
and too low to delineate a 5% wind probability area.

...Southern Rockies/southern High Plains...
Moderate low-level moisture is anticipated within the post-frontal
airmass across the southern Rockies and adjacent southern High
Plains this afternoon, characterized by dewpoints in the low to mid
50s across the High Plains and upper 40s across the higher terrain.
Even with this modest moisture, the airmass is expected to
destabilize, fostered by deep boundary-layer mixing and cool
temperatures aloft (i.e. around -10 deg C at 500 mb). Surface
easterlies/northeasterlies beneath modest westerlies aloft will
contribute to effective bulk shear around 35 kt, which is strong
enough for some updraft organization. Isolated hail is possible
across the higher terrain with the initially more cellular
development. Damaging gusts are expected to be the primary risk
thereafter as storms trend towards a more clustered mode and move
eastward into the more mixed southern High Plains.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL ROCKIES INTO THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS AND UPPER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms capable of gusty winds and
hail may occur this afternoon and evening across parts of the
central Rockies into the northern/central Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley.

...20Z Update...
The forecast remains on track, and no appreciable changes were made
to the outlook with this update. Isolated thunderstorms are
developing/spreading eastward across the central Rockies this
afternoon -- ahead of a positively tilted midlevel trough moving
across the region. The strongest storms will be capable of producing
marginally severe hail and isolated severe gusts. For additional
details, see MCD #2047. Across the central Plains into the Upper MS
Valley, severe-thunderstorm potential is more uncertain along/behind
the cold front this evening into the overnight hours. However, given
the potential for isolated instances of severe hail and locally
strong/damaging gusts, the Marginal Risk has been maintained across
this area.

Farther east, clusters of thunderstorms are tracking westward across
the central Gulf Coast, in an environment characterized by 2+ inch
PW and pockets of diurnal heating/boundary-layer destabilization.
Given some banded convection here -- aided by enhanced low-level
easterlies -- a couple water-loaded downbursts will be possible.
Overall, the severe threat still appears too localized/marginal for
5-percent severe wind probabilities.

..Weinman.. 09/04/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1124 AM CDT Wed Sep 04 2024/

...Central Rockies into the central High Plains...
Recent satellite imagery reveals a broad shortwave trough currently
moving through southern ID and northern NV/UT. This shortwave trough
and accompanying cold mid-level temperatures are forecast to
continue eastward throughout the day, progressing across WY and
northern CO. Modest buoyancy, fostered mainly by cooling mid-level
temperatures, is anticipated across WY and adjacent parts of
northern CO as the shortwave trough progresses through. Thunderstorm
development is expected as the large-scale ascent attendant to the
shortwave trough interacts with this buoyancy during the afternoon.
Moderate mid-level westerlies will accompany this shortwave trough
as well, with the resulting increase in vertical shear supporting
the potential for a few more organized/persistent storms. Initially
more cellular development across the higher terrain could pose a
risk for isolated hail, particularly across south-central WY and
north-central CO where the best overlap between the stronger shear
and cold mid-level temperatures is expected. Damaging wind gusts are
possible as well, particularly as the storms reach the lower
elevations of central High Plains where a deeply mixed boundary
layer will be in place.

...Central Plains into the Upper MS Valley...
Recent surface analysis places a low over southeast ND, with weak
troughing extending southwestward from this low in east-central CO.
The primary cold front is west of this surface trough, extending
from the low over southeast ND into more of northwest SD and
adjacent northeast WY. The surface low is forecast to progress
east-southeastward throughout the day, reaching south-central MN by
late tonight. The attendant cold front is expected to push southward
during the same period, progressing through much of NE by early
Thursday morning.

Warm mid-level temperatures should preclude thunderstorm development
along the surface trough during the afternoon and evening. A few
isolated storms are possible during the evening behind the front as
the shortwave trough ejects out into the central Plains. Additional
thunderstorm development is expected overnight/early Thursday
morning across the Upper MS Valley, with some isolated hail possible
within the strongest storms.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0231 PM CDT Wed Sep 04 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe-thunderstorm potential appears relatively low for Friday,
though a few strong storms will be possible from near Lake Erie into
parts of the Ohio Valley.

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to amplify as it digs
southeastward across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley regions on
Friday. A mid/upper-level cyclone is forecast to develop with time,
as a strong embedded shortwave moves southeastward into the base of
the trough by Friday evening. A leading cold front is forecast to
slow down and weaken across parts of the Ohio Valley, as a
reinforcing front moves through parts of the Great Lakes and
Midwest.

...Lake Erie/Ohio Vicinity...
Thunderstorms are expected to develop along a cold front Friday
afternoon as it moves through the Ohio Valley. Weak lapse rates and
a lack of richer low-level moisture will result in only modest
instability, but strong forcing ahead of the approaching trough
should permit for some stronger storms to develop Friday afternoon.
A well-mixed, inverted-v type thermodynamic profile will support
some gusty winds. However, the lack of stronger lower tropospheric
flow or greater instability will likely preclude a more widespread
damaging wind threat. Nonetheless, if greater instability appears
possible, severe probabilities may eventually be warranted.

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO....

...SUMMARY...
A few strong to severe storms are possible across portions of
northeast New Mexico Thursday afternoon/evening.

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to amplify and move southeastward
across the Canadian Prairies into the upper Midwest/Great Lakes on
Thursday. To the southwest of this amplifying trough, a weakening
shortwave is forecast to move southeastward across the
central/southern Rockies into the southern High Plains. At the
surface, a cold front is forecast to extend southwestward from the
Great Lakes into parts of the Midwest and central/southern Plains
during the afternoon. 

...Southern Rockies and High Plains...
A concentrated area of thunderstorms are forecast across northeast
New Mexico on Thursday as a sharp mid-level shortwave trough
advances southeast across the central/southern Rockies and interacts
with a pocket of instability in the post-frontal airmass across
northeast New Mexico. Some increasing mid-level flow associated with
this trough will overspread the region and provide 20 to 25 knots of
deep layer shear. This may be sufficient for some storm organization
and the potential for severe-wind gusts. Some small hail is also
possible, but relatively modest instability/shear may limit the
potential for large hail. 

...Parts of the Upper Midwest...
Thunderstorms will likely be ongoing at the beginning of the period
along the frontal zone in northwest Wisconsin. Expect this activity
to wane by mid-morning as the low-level jet weakens. Strong height
falls will overspread the cold front by mid to late afternoon which
should support additional thunderstorm development along the cold
front during the afternoon/early evening. Forecast soundings show
limited moisture/instability (less than 1000 J/kg MLCAPE) and modest
effective shear (25-30 kts). This could support a few strong to
severe storms, but overall, expect the severe-weather threat to
remain limited/isolated.

..Thornton.. 09/04/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0108 AM CDT Wed Sep 04 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns appear limited for today across the country.
Breezy conditions will persist across the central Plains ahead of a
migratory surface trough. Low-level moisture has begun to advect
northward based on early-morning surface observations, and this
trend should continue through the day and modulate afternoon RH
minimums over the Plains. Areas of elevated fire weather conditions
are possible across central to southern UT as a cold front pushes
across the region, but confidence in prolonged/widespread elevated
conditions is limited and should occur over fuels that are only
modestly receptive. Dry conditions will persist across the Great
Basin and West Coast, but a building ridge over the western CONUS
will promote weak surface winds and limited fire concerns.

Areas affected...parts of western and northern New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011754Z - 011930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A broken line of storms may produce occasional gusty wind
this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Inhibition has been mostly eroded across western and
northern New York as temperatures have warmed to the upper 70s to
low 80s with mid 60s dewpoints. Expect scattered thunderstorms to
develop along a cold front once it moves east of Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario. Storms may be not be that deep given the relatively shallow
thermodynamic profile shown by the RAP forecast soundings. However,
relatively strong flow through the column and a well-mixed boundary
layer may support efficient transport of gusty winds to the surface
within these storms. Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible
through the afternoon with this threat waning near sunset.

## Tropical Storm Hone Forecast Discussion Number 41

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  41
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Sep 01 2024
 
The satellite presentation of Hone has become very ragged overnight, 
with the low-level circulation center becoming very difficult to 
locate with much confidence. An 1130z Oceansat-3 pass indicated 
that the low level center of Hone has shifted west-westward since 
the previous and appears to be merging with the mid-level low just 
east of the International Date Line. The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates from PHFO, SAB, and JTWC, all came in 
at 2.5 (35 kt), while the objective intensity estimates were 
similar. As a result, the initial intensity has been held at a 
perhaps generous 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is quite uncertain due to the low-level of Hone 
being in the process of merging with the mid-level low to the 
west, and is set at 300/12 kt. This general motion is expected 
to  continue today and tonight along with a decrease in forward 
speed as Hone merges with a mid-level low to the west.  Hone should 
begin moving northward with an increase in forward speed Monday and 
Monday night as it moves into a weakness in building mid-level 
ridges to the northwest and east of the system. A shift back toward 
the northwest is then expected late Tuesday through Thursday as a 
low and mid-level ridge builds to the north of Hone. The latest 
track forecast was adjusted to better align with the latest model 
guidance and generally follows the TVCE consensus.
 
Hone will be in a relatively favorable environment during the next
couple days, with warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical
wind shear. The interaction with a mid-level low, ragged LLCC and
entrainment of dry mid-level air should act to minimize the
potential for intensification however. Beyond 48 hours mid-level
moisture drops off considerably and the latest simulated satellite
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF suggest a loss of deep convection by
72 hours. As a result, the intensity forecast holds Hone as a 35 
kt Tropical Storm during the next couple days, with the cyclone 
expected to become a post-tropical remnant low by 72 hours, and 
dissipation occurring by 120 hours. The intensity forecast closely 
follows the latest intensity consensus guidance.

## Tropical Storm Hone Forecast Discussion Number 37

WTPA41 PHFO 311434
TCDCP1
 
Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  37
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sat Aug 31 2024
 
The nocturnal convective bloom persists along the eastern 
semicircle of Hone this morning. Deep convection obscured the low 
level circulation center (LLCC) through most of the night, with the 
LLCC now emerging from the western edge of the cold cloud cover. 
Subjective Dvorak satellite current intensity values ranged from 
2.0/30 kt to 2.5/35 kt between the three fix centers. UW-CIMSS ADT 
was 32 kt and, although a few points were rain-flagged, ASCAT-C 
showed enough winds in the 30 to 32 kt range within the northeast 
quadrant to justify bumping Hone's initial intensity to 35 kt for 
this forecast cycle, making this system a tropical storm again.

It seems that Hone's forward motion slowed significantly just as 
the convective bloom obscured the LLCC last evening, causing 
uncertainty as to what initial motion to assign. With the partial 
re-emergence of the LLCC from the western edge of cold cloud cover 
over the past hour, confidence in an initial motion of 315 degrees 
at 3 kt is higher than it would have been previously. Forecast 
philosophy remains unchanged. Global models show Hone's LLCC and an 
upper low less than 300 nm to its north becoming well-aligned in the 
next 24 hours as the upper feature drifts south, drawing the LLCC 
toward it. Afterward, the merged system will move slowly west 
northwestward. Because almost all track guidance wants to pull Hone 
almost due north initially, in contrast to current motion to the 
northwest, the forecast track is just to the left of the envelope 
through 24 hours, with little change made in the track forecast 
through then. The forecast track from 36 hours through 60 hours was 
adjusted noticeably to the right to keep it within the guidance 
envelope, mostly following HWRF, and creating a more pronounced kink 
in the track at 48 hours as guidance depicts the newly-aligned 
system transitioning from a west northwest track to an almost due 
north track. Beyond 72 hours, the forecast track once again closely 
mirrors the previous one.  

The environment that Hone will encounter offers far less shear and 
continued marginally favorable sea surface temperatures over the 
next 24 to 48 hours, and Hone is forecast to slowly strengthen 
during this time. Except for HAFS, which still calls for stronger 
intensification, the intensity guidance envelope is rather tight 
and well-behaved. The intensity forecast lies comfortably within 
this envelope, close to TVCN. Hone's intensity will peak by 72 hours 
at 50 kt, then slowly decrease afterward as it travels across the 
western North Pacific. After passing south of the northwest 
Hawaiian Islands, this system is forecast to cross the 
International Dateline late Sunday night Hawaii time.
