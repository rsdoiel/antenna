Now Schettini has written a book about his journey to becoming a professional TV scribe where he demystifies the process of breaking into the biz and offers other writers his best advice at all stages of their careers.&nbsp;</p>

## SATURDAY NIGHT: Jason Reitman and Gil Kenan On Telling a Real-Time Story

</div> 
<h2>Chaos. Genius. Drugs. Comedy. Revolution.&nbsp;</h2> 
<p>These five words may not seem to go together at first glance, but they perfectly sum up the rollercoaster ride that is the new film <em>Saturday Night</em>. Told in real time, the film takes us back to 1975 when a determined Lorne Michaels (Gabriel LaBelle) wrangles a motley crew of young comedians to change comedy television for the next 50 seasons – and beyond. I sat down with writers Jason Reitman and Gil Kenan to find out how they managed to put together such a turbulent, riotous movie about this beloved NBC institution.&nbsp;</p>

## Haunt Sweet Home by Sarah Pinsker: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2024-09-29, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Haunt Sweet Home</strong>, Sarah Pinsker (Tordotcom 978-1-250-33026-0, $20.99, 170pp, hc) Septem­ber 2024.</p>
<p>I seem to have found myself reading a number of haunted house novels in the last year or so, and it’s always fascinating to watch how authors still find ways to ring new changes on a template that goes back to the earliest Gothic novels. In <strong>Haunt Sweet Home</strong>, Sarah Pinsker’s witty approach is to focus  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/09/haunt-sweet-home-by-sarah-pinsker-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
