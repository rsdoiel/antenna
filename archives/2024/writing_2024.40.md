## Termush by Sven Holm: Review by Gabino Iglesias

date: 2024-10-03, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Termush</strong>, Sven Holm (Faber Editions 978-0-57137-915-6, £9.99, 119pp, tp) September 2022. (FSG 978-0-37461-358-7, $16.00, 128pp, tp) January 2024. Cover by Rodrigo Corral &#38; Adriana Tonello</p>
<p>Sven Holm’s <strong>Termush</strong>, originally published in 1967, is as timely now as it was back then.

<p>Anton Schettini is a TV writer best known for writing sitcoms like <em>Happy Together</em> and <em>Superior Donuts</em> – and even a drama called <em>Snap</em>. But before he was an actual writer, he spent years working his way up the Hollywood ladder as a production assistant, writers’ assistant and script coordinator. Now Schettini has written a book about his journey to becoming a professional TV scribe where he demystifies the process of breaking into the biz and offers other writers his best advice at all stages of their careers.&nbsp;</p>

## SATURDAY NIGHT: Jason Reitman and Gil Kenan On Telling a Real-Time Story

</div> 
<h2>Chaos. Genius. Drugs. Comedy. Revolution.&nbsp;</h2> 
<p>These five words may not seem to go together at first glance, but they perfectly sum up the rollercoaster ride that is the new film <em>Saturday Night</em>. Told in real time, the film takes us back to 1975 when a determined Lorne Michaels (Gabriel LaBelle) wrangles a motley crew of young comedians to change comedy television for the next 50 seasons – and beyond. I sat down with writers Jason Reitman and Gil Kenan to find out how they managed to put together such a turbulent, riotous movie about this beloved NBC institution.&nbsp;</p>

## Haunt Sweet Home by Sarah Pinsker: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

<p><strong>Haunt Sweet Home</strong>, Sarah Pinsker (Tordotcom 978-1-250-33026-0, $20.99, 170pp, hc) Septem­ber 2024.</p>
<p>I seem to have found myself reading a number of haunted house novels in the last year or so, and it’s always fascinating to watch how authors still find ways to ring new changes on a template that goes back to the earliest Gothic novels.
