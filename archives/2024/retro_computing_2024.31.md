## Tex Murphy and the Coming of the DVD (A Shaggy-Dog Story)

date: 2024-08-02, from: Digital Antiquarian

In his expatriate memoir Notes from a Small Island, Bill Bryson describes what a false picture of the world&#8217;s geography you would end up with if you were to try to surmise it from British mass media. Britain, you would probably assume from the crazy amount of attention the United States gets in that country&#8217;s [&#8230;]

date: 2024-08-01, from: RiscOS Story

FAST &#8211; a backronym for &#8216;Fast Access to Storage Technology&#8217; &#8211; is the name given by Andy Marks of RISCOSbits to a new range of machines launched at the 2023 Southwest Show &#8211; machines that do exactly as the acronym suggests, by accessing the PCIe port on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module to provide up to four full-speed SATA ports. At launch, Andy promised a regular upgrade cycle for anyone who buys a FAST computer, and he says the latest update &#8211; the second release for 2024 &#8211; brings the&#8230;

Kevin Wells has released an update to one of his various applications that allow remote sites to be interrogated for information from the RISC OS desktop &#8211; this time MACadd, a program used for getting information about MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. MAC addresses are usually written as twelve digit hexadecimal (base 16) values, and are intended to be unique addresses associated with devices connected to a network &#8211; although more often than not, they are usually associated with network interfaces on those devices.

## QML Haskell Library

date: 2024-07-31, from: James Hobson blog

Making UIs in haskell is a pain. Not because the libraries are bad, but because they are either hard to use or short lived. My reason for thinking this is because making UI bindings is just not a normal haskeller&rsquo;s idea of fun. They may make a library, and then abandon it.
There is basically one UI library that has stood the test of time, and that is gi-gtk, whi is here because it&rsquo;s auto-generated using gobject-introspection.
