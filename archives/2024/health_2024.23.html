next-generation sequencing could play a pivotal role in validating the
diagnosis of invasive mold disease of the central nervous system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundInvasive mold diseases of the central nervous (CNS IMD)
system are exceedingly rare disorders, characterized by nonspecific
clinical symptoms. This results in significant diagnostic challenges,
often leading to delayed diagnosis and the risk of misdiagnosis for
patients. Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) holds
significant importance for the diagnosis of infectious diseases,
especially in the rapid and accurate identification of rare and
difficult-to-culture pathogens. Therefore, this study aims to explore
the clinical characteristics of invasive mold disease of CNS IMD in
children and assess the effectiveness of mNGS technology in diagnosing
CNS IMD.MethodsThree pediatric patients diagnosed with Invasive mold
disease brain abscess and treated in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit
(PICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from
January 2020 to December 2023 were selected for this study.ResultsCase
1, a 6-year-old girl, was admitted to the hospital with “acute liver
failure.” During her hospital stay, she developed fever, irritability,
and seizures. CSF mNGS testing resulted in a negative outcome. Multiple
brain abscesses were drained, and Aspergillus fumigatus was detected in
pus culture and mNGS. The condition gradually improved after treatment
with voriconazole combined with caspofungin. Case 2, a 3-year-old girl,
was admitted with “acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia.” During induction
chemotherapy, she developed fever and seizures. Aspergillus fumigatus
was detected in the intracranial abscess fluid by mNGS, and the
condition gradually improved after treatment with voriconazole combined
with caspofungin, followed by “right-sided brain abscess drainage
surgery.” Case 3, a 7-year-old girl, showed lethargy, fever, and
right-sided limb weakness during the pending chemotherapy period for
acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Rhizomucor miehei and Rhizomucor
pusillus was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid by mNGS. The condition
gradually improved after treatment with amphotericin B combined with
posaconazole. After a six-month follow-up post-discharge, the three
patients improved without residual neurological sequelae, and the
primary diseases were in complete remission.ConclusionThe clinical
manifestations of CNS IMD lack specificity. Early mNGS can assist in
identifying the pathogen, providing a basis for definitive diagnosis.
Combined surgical treatment when necessary can help improve
prognosis.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAccumulated evidences indicate that dysbiosis of the
urinary microbiota is associated with kidney stone formation. In the
present study, we aimed to investigate the urinary microbiota
composition and functionality of patients with calcium oxalate stones
and compare it with those of healthy individuals.MethodWe collected
bladder urine samples from 68 adult patients with calcium oxalate stones
and 54 age-matched healthy controls by transurethral catheterization.
16S rRNA gene and shotgun sequencing were utilized to characterize the
urinary microbiota and functionality associated with calcium oxalate
stones.ResultsAfter further exclusion, a total of 100 subjects was
finally included and analyzed. The diversity of the urinary microbiota
in calcium oxalate stone patients was not significantly different from
that of healthy controls. However, the urinary microbiota structure of
calcium oxalate stone formers significantly differed from that of
healthy controls (PERMANOVA, r = 0.026, P = 0.019). Differential
representation of bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium) and several enriched
functional pathways (e.g., threonine biosynthesis) were identified in
the urine of calcium oxalate stone patients.ConclusionOur results showed
significantly different urinary microbiota structure and several
enriched functional pathways in calcium oxalate stone patients, which
provide new insight into the pathogenesis of calcium oxalate stones.</p>

dual-branch deep residual squeeze and excitation monkeypox
classification network with attention mechanism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>While the world struggles to recover from the devastation wrought by
the widespread spread of COVID-19, monkeypox virus has emerged as a new
global pandemic threat. In this paper, a high precision and lightweight
classification network MpoxNet based on ConvNext is proposed to meet the
need of fast and safe detection of monkeypox classification. In this
method, a two-branch depth-separable convolution residual Squeeze and
Excitation module is designed. This design aims to extract more feature
information with two branches, and greatly reduces the number of
parameters in the model by using depth-separable convolution. In
addition, our method introduces a convolutional attention module to
enhance the extraction of key features within the receptive field. The
experimental results show that MpoxNet has achieved remarkable results
in monkeypox disease classification, the accuracy rate is 95.28%, the
precision rate is 96.40%, the recall rate is 93.00%, and the F1-Score is
95.80%. This is significantly better than the current mainstream
classification model. It is worth noting that the FLOPS and the number
of parameters of MpoxNet are only 30.68% and 31.87% of those of
ConvNext-Tiny, indicating that the model has a small computational
burden and model complexity while efficient performance.</p>

spectrum and drug resistance of bloodstream infection in patients with
acute myeloid leukaemia: a single centre retrospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBloodstream infection (BSI) represent a prevalent
complication in haematological malignancies (HMs). Typically, Patients
with BSI usually undergo empirical treatment pending pathogen
identification. The timely and effective management of BSIs
significantly influences patient prognosis. However, pathogen
distribution in BSIs exhibits regional variation. In this study, we
investigated the clinical characteristics, pathogen spectrum, drug
resistance, risk factors of short-term prognosis and long-term
prognostic factors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with BSI at
Zhejiang Provincal People’s Hospital.MethodsFrom 2019 to 2021, a total
of 56 AML patients with BSI were treated in the Department of
Haematology at Zhejiang Province People’s Hospital. Data regarding
pathogen spectrum and drug resistance were collected for analysis. The
patients were stratified into non-survivor cohort and survivor cohort
within 30 days after BSI, and the predictors of 30-days mortality were
identified through both univariate and multivariate Logistic regression
analyses. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression
analysis were employed to ascertain the risk factors associated with
poor prognosis in AML patients complicated by BSI.ResultsA total of 70
strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 56 AML patients with
BSI. Gram-negative bacteria constituted the predominant pathogens
(71.4%), with Klebsiella pneumoniae being the most prevalent (22.9%).
Gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 22.9% and 5.7%,
respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed significant
differences in total protein, albumin levels, and the presence of septic
shock between the non-survivor cohort and the survior cohort 30 days
post-BSI. COX regression analysis showed that agranulocytosis duration
exceeding 20 days (HR:3.854; 95% CI: 1.451–10.242) and septic shock
(HR:3.788; 95% CI: 1.729–8.299) were independent risk factors for poor
prognosis in AML patients complicated by BSI. Notably, the mortality
rate within 30 days after Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection was up
to 71.4%.ConclusionsIn this study, Gram-negative bacteria, predominantly
Klebsiella pneumoniae, constituted the primary pathogens among AML
patients with BSIs. Serum albumin levels and the presence of septic
shock emerged as independent risk factors for mortality within 30 days
among AML patients with BSI. In terms of long-term prognosis, extended
agranulocytosis duration exceeding 20 days and septic shock were
associated with elevated mortality rates in AML patients with BSI.
Additionally, in our centre, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection was
found to be associated with a poor prognosis. Early intervention for
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection in our centre could potentially
improve patient outcomes.</p>

metal-organic frameworks as an antibacterial agent</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionWidespread opportunistic pathogens pose a serious threat
to global health, particularly in susceptible hospital populations. The
escalating crisis of antibiotic resistance highlights the urgent need
for novel antibacterial agents and alternative treatment approaches.
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and its compounds have deep roots in
the treatment of infectious diseases. It has a variety of active
ingredients and multi-target properties, opening up new avenues for the
discovery and development of antimicrobial drugs.MethodsThis study
focuses on assessing the efficacy of the Shensheng-Piwen changed
medicinal powder (SPC) extracts against opportunistic pathogen
infections by broth microdilution and agar disc diffusion methods.
Additionally, biofilm inhibition and eradication assays were performed
to evaluate the antibiofilm effects of SPC extracts.ResultsMetabolite
profiles were analyzed by LC-MS. Furthermore, the potential synergistic
effect between SPC and Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) was investigated by
bacterial growth curve analysis. The results indicated that the SPC
extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against S. aureus, with a
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 7.8 mg/mL (crude drug
concentration). Notably, at 1/2 MIC, the SPC extracts significantly
inhibited biofilm formation, with over 80% inhibition, which was
critical in tackling chronic and hospital-acquired infections.
Metabolomic analysis of S. aureus revealed that SPC extracts induced a
notable reduction in the levels of various metabolites, including
L-proline, L-asparagine. This suggested that the SPC extracts could
interfere with the metabolism of S. aureus. Meanwhile, the growth curve
experiment proved that SPC extracts and MOFs had a synergistic
antibacterial effect.DiscussionIn conclusion, the present study
highlights the potential of SPC extracts as a novel antibacterial agent
against S. aureus infections, with promising biofilm inhibition
properties. The observed synergistic effect between SPC extracts and
MOFs further supports the exploration of this combination as an
alternative treatment approach.</p>

activity of vaginal fluids: new evidence from an in vitro model</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionWe assessed the in vitro anti-chlamydial activity of
fresh vaginal secretions, deciphering the microbial and metabolic
components able to counteract Chlamydia trachomatis
viability.MethodsForty vaginal samples were collected from a group of
reproductive-aged women and their anti-chlamydial activity was evaluated
by inhibition experiments. Each sample underwent 16S rRNA metabarcoding
sequencing to determine the bacterial composition, as well as 1H-NMR
spectroscopy to detect and quantify the presence of vaginal
metabolites.ResultsSamples characterized by a high anti-chlamydial
activity were enriched in Lactobacillus, especially Lactobacillus
crispatus and Lactobacillus iners, while not-active samples exhibited a
significant reduction of lactobacilli, along with higher relative
abundances of Streptococcus and Olegusella. Lactobacillus gasseri showed
an opposite behavior compared to L. crispatus, being more prevalent in
not-active vaginal samples. Higher concentrations of several amino acids
(i.e., isoleucine, leucine, and aspartate; positively correlated to the
abundance of L. crispatus and L. jensenii) lactate, and 4-aminobutyrate
were the most significant metabolic fingerprints of highly active
samples. Acetate and formate concentrations, on the other hand, were
related to the abundances of a group of anaerobic opportunistic bacteria
(including Prevotella, Dialister, Olegusella, Peptostreptococcus,
Peptoniphilus, Finegoldia and Anaerococcus). Finally, glucose,
correlated to Streptococcus, Lachnospira and Alloscardovia genera,
emerged as a key molecule of the vaginal environment: indeed, the
anti-chlamydial effect of vaginal fluids decreased as glucose
concentrations increased.DiscussionThese findings could pave the way for
novel strategies in the prevention and treatment of chlamydial
urogenital infections, such as lactobacilli probiotic formulations or
lactobacilli-derived postbiotics.</p>

id="characteristics-of-the-gut-microbiota-and-serum-metabolites-in-postmenopausal-women-with-reduced-bone-mineral-density">Characteristics
of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites in postmenopausal women with
reduced bone mineral density</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionEmerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is
closely associated with bone homeostasis. However, little is known about
the relationships among the bone mineral density (BMD) index, bone
turnover markers, and the gut microbiota and its metabolites in
postmenopausal women.MethodsIn this study, to understand gut microbiota
signatures and serum metabolite changes in postmenopausal women with
reduced BMD, postmenopausal individuals with normal or reduced BMD were
recruited and divided into normal and OS groups. Feces and serum samples
were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, liquid chromatography
coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics and integrated
analysis.ResultsThe results demonstrated that bacterial richness and
diversity were greater in the OS group than in the normal group.
Additionally, distinguishing bacteria were found among the two groups
and were closely associated with the BMD index and bone turnover
markers. Metabolomic analysis revealed that the expression of serum
metabolites, such as etiocholanolone, testosterone sulfate, and
indole-3-pyruvic acid, and the corresponding signaling pathways,
especially those involved in tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid
degradation and steroid hormone biosynthesis, also changed
significantly. Correlation analysis revealed positive associations
between normal group-enriched Bacteroides abundance and normal
group-enriched etiocholanolone and testosterone sulfate abundances; in
particular, Bacteroides correlated positively with BMD. Importantly, the
tryptophan-indole metabolism pathway was uniquely metabolized by the gut
bacteria-derived tnaA gene, the predicted abundance of which was
significantly greater in the normal group than in the control group, and
the abundance of Bacteroides was strongly correlated with the tnaA
gene.DiscussionOur results indicated a clear difference in the gut
microbiota and serum metabolites of postmenopausal women. Specifically
altered bacteria and derived metabolites were closely associated with
the BMD index and bone turnover markers, indicating the potential of the
gut microbiota and serum metabolites as modifiable factors and
therapeutic targets for preventing osteoporosis.</p>

id="early-immune-response-to-toxoplasma-gondii-lineage-iii-isolates-of-different-virulence-phenotype">Early
immune response to Toxoplasma gondii lineage III isolates of different
virulence phenotype</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionToxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite of
importance to human and veterinary health. The structure and diversity
of the genotype population of T. gondii varies considerably with respect
to geography, but three lineages, type I, II and III, are distributed
globally. Lineage III genotypes are the least well characterized in
terms of biology, host immunity and virulence. Once a host is infected
with T.gondii, innate immune mechanisms are engaged to reduce the
parasite burden in tissues and create a pro-inflammatory environment in
which the TH1 response develops to ensure survival. This study
investigated the early cellular immune response of Swiss-Webster mice
post intraperitoneal infection with 10 tachyzoites of four distinct
non-clonal genotypes of lineage III and a local isolate of ToxoDB#1. The
virulence phenotype, cumulative mortality (CM) and allele profiles of
ROP5, ROP16, ROP18 and GRA15 were published previously.MethodsParasite
dissemination in different tissues was analyzed by real-time PCR and
relative expression levels of IFNγ, IL12-p40, IL-10 and TBX21 in the
cervical lymph nodes (CLN), brain and spleen were calculated using the
ΔΔCt method. Stage conversion was determined by detection of the BAG1
transcript in the brain.ResultsTissue dissemination depends on the
virulence phenotype but not CM, while the TBX21 and cytokine levels and
kinetics correlate better with CM than virulence phenotype. The earliest
detection of BAG1 was seven days post infection. Only infection with the
genotype of high CM (69.4%) was associated with high T-bet levels in the
CLN 24 h and high systemic IFNγ expression which was sustained over the
first week, while infection with genotypes of lower CM (38.8%, 10.7% and
6.8%) is characterized by down-regulation and/or low systemic levels of
IFNγ. The response intensity, as assessed by cytokine levels, to the
genotype of high CM wanes over time, while it increases gradually to
genotypes of lower CM.DiscussionThe results point to the conclusion that
the immune response is not correlated with the virulence phenotype
and/or allele profile, but an early onset, intense pro-inflammatory
response is characteristic of genotypes with high CM. Additionally, high
IFNγ level in the brain may hamper stage conversion.</p>

sequence type 307 strain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundConvergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) pathotypes has
been increasingly reported in recent years. These pathogens combine
features of both multidrug-resistant and hypervirulent KP. However,
clinically used indicators for hypervirulent KP identification, such as
hypermucoviscosity, appear to be differentially expressed in convergent
KP, potential outbreak clones are difficult to identify. We aimed to
fill such knowledge gaps by investigating the temperature dependence of
hypermucoviscosity and virulence in a convergent KP strain isolated
during a clonal outbreak and belonging to the high-risk sequence type
(ST)307.MethodsHypermucoviscosity, biofilm formation, and mortality
rates in Galleria mellonella larvae were examined at different
temperatures (room temperature, 28°C, 37°C, 40°C and 42°C) and with
various phenotypic experiments including electron microscopy. The
underlying mechanisms of the phenotypic changes were explored via qPCR
analysis to evaluate plasmid copy numbers, and
transcriptomics.ResultsOur results show a temperature-dependent switch
above 37°C towards a hypermucoviscous phenotype, consistent with
increased biofilm formation and in vivo mortality, possibly reflecting a
bacterial response to fever-like conditions. Furthermore, we observed an
increase in plasmid copy number for a hybrid plasmid harboring
carbapenemase and rmpA genes. However, transcriptomic analysis revealed
no changes in rmpA expression at higher temperatures, suggesting
alternative regulatory pathways.ConclusionThis study not only elucidates
the impact of elevated temperatures on hypermucoviscosity and virulence
in convergent KP but also sheds light on previously unrecognized aspects
of its adaptive behavior, underscoring its resilience to changing
environments.</p>

<p>ObjectiveTo assess the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the
epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and the antibiotic resistance profiles
of pathogens involved.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study analyzed
infants diagnosed with culture-proven sepsis at the neonatal department
of a tertiary children’s hospital in East China from January 2016 to
December 2022. We compared the clinical and microbiological
characteristics of neonatal sepsis cases between the pre-pandemic Phase
I (2016–2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic Phase II
(2020–2022).ResultsA total of 507 infants with 525 sepsis episodes were
included, with 343 episodes in Phase I and 182 in Phase II. The
incidence of early-onset sepsis (EOS) was significantly lower during
Phase II (p &lt; 0.05). Infants in Phase II had lower gestational ages
and birth weights compared to Phase I. Clinical signs such as mottled
skin, severe anemia, thrombocytopenia were more prevalent in Phase II,
alongside a higher incidence of complications. Notably, necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC) (p &lt; 0.05) and meningitis (p &lt; 0.1) occurred
more frequently during Phase II. Escherichia coli (E. coli) and
Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) were the predominant pathogens
isolated from infants of death and cases with complications. A
significant decrease in the proportion of K. pneumoniae was observed in
Phase II, alongside increased antibiotic resistance in both E. coli and
K. pneumoniae. The period of the COVID-19 pandemic (Phase II) was
identified as an independent risk factor for complications in infants
with neonatal sepsis.ConclusionCOVID-19 pandemic response measures
correlated with a decrease in EOS and an increase in neonatal sepsis
complications and antibiotic resistance.</p>

<p>Candida species comprise a ubiquitous pathogenic fungal genus
responsible for causing candidiasis. They are one of the primary

N-butylphthalimide (NBP) was the most potent, with a minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of 100 µg/ml and which dose-dependently inhibited
biofilm at sub-inhibitory concentrations (10–50 µg/ml) in both the
fluconazole-resistant and fluconazole-sensitive Candida albicans and
Candida parapsilosis. NBP also effectively inhibited biofilm formation
in other pathogens including uropathogenic Escherichia coli,
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio
parahaemolyticus, along with the polymicrobial biofilms of S.
epidermidis and C. albicans. NBP markedly inhibited the hyphal formation
and cell aggregation of C. albicans and altered its colony morphology in
a dose-dependent manner. Gene expression analysis showed that NBP
significantly downregulated the expression of important hyphal- and
biofilm-associated genes, i.e., ECE1, HWP1, and UME6, upon treatment.
NBP also exhibited mild toxicity at concentrations ranging from 2 to 20
µg/ml in a nematode model. Therefore, this study suggests that NBP has
anti-biofilm and antifungal potential against various Candida
strains.</p>

microbes improve prognosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae pulmonary infection
through the lung-gut axis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe gut microbiota plays a vital role in the development of
sepsis and in protecting against pneumonia. Previous studies have
demonstrated the existence of the gut-lung axis and the interaction
between the gut and the lung, which is related to the prognosis of
critically ill patients; however, most of these studies focused on
chronic lung diseases and influenza virus infections. The purpose of
this study was to investigate the effect of faecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) on Klebsiella pneumoniae-related pulmonary
infection via the gut-lung axis and to compare the effects of FMT with
those of traditional antibiotics to identify new therapeutic
strategies.MethodsWe divided the mice into six groups: the blank control
(PBS), pneumonia-derived sepsis (KP), pneumonia-derived sepsis +
antibiotic (KP + PIP), pneumonia-derived sepsis + faecal microbiota
transplantation(KP + FMT), antibiotic treatment control (KP+PIP+PBS),
and pneumonia-derived sepsis+ antibiotic + faecal microbiota
transplantation (KP + PIP + FMT) groups to compare the survival of mice,
lung injury, inflammation response, airway barrier function and the
intestinal flora, metabolites and drug resistance genes in each
group.ResultsAlterations in specific intestinal flora can occur in the
gut of patients with pneumonia-derived sepsis caused by Klebsiella
pneumoniae. Compared with those in the faecal microbiota transplantation
group, the antibiotic treatment group had lower levels of
proinflammatory factors and higher levels of anti-inflammatory factors
but less amelioration of lung pathology and improvement of airway
epithelial barrier function. Additionally, the increase in opportunistic
pathogens and drug resistance-related genes in the gut of mice was
accompanied by decreased production of favourable fatty acids such as
acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, decanoic acid, and secondary
bile acids such as chenodeoxycholic acid 3-sulfate, isodeoxycholic acid,
taurodeoxycholic acid, and 3-dehydrocholic acid; the levels of these
metabolites were restored by faecal microbiota transplantation. Faecal
microbiota transplantation after antibiotic treatment can gradually
ameliorate gut microbiota disorder caused by antibiotic treatment and
reduce the number of drug resistance genes induced by
antibiotics.ConclusionIn contrast to direct antibiotic treatment, faecal
microbiota transplantation improves the prognosis of mice with
pneumonia-derived sepsis caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae by improving
the structure of the intestinal flora and increasing the level of
beneficial metabolites, fatty acids and secondary bile acids, thereby
reducing systemic inflammation, repairing the barrier function of
alveolar epithelial cells, and alleviating pathological damage to the
lungs. The combination of antibiotics with faecal microbiota
transplantation significantly alleviates intestinal microbiota disorder,
reduces the selection for drug resistance genes caused by antibiotics,
and mitigates lung lesions; these effects are superior to those
following antibiotic monotherapy.</p>

the double helix: the multifaceted landscape of extracellular DNA in
Staphylococcus aureus biofilms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Staphylococcus aureus forms biofilms consisting of cells embedded in
a matrix made of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and extracellular
DNA (eDNA). Biofilm-associated infections are difficult to treat and can
promote antibiotic resistance, resulting in negative healthcare
outcomes. eDNA within the matrix contributes to the stability, growth,
and immune-evasive properties of S. aureus biofilms. eDNA is released by
autolysis, which is mediated by murein hydrolases that access the cell
wall via membrane pores formed by holin-like proteins. The eDNA content
of S. aureus biofilms varies among individual strains and is influenced
by environmental conditions, including the presence of antibiotics. eDNA
plays an important role in biofilm development and structure by acting
as an electrostatic net that facilitates protein-cell and cell-cell
interactions. Because of eDNA’s structural importance in biofilms and
its ubiquitous presence among S. aureus isolates, it is a potential
target for therapeutics. Treatment of biofilms with DNase can eradicate
or drastically reduce them in size. Additionally, antibodies that target
DNABII proteins, which bind to and stabilize eDNA, can also disperse
biofilms. This review discusses the recent literature on the release,
structure, and function of eDNA in S. aureus biofilms, in addition to a
discussion of potential avenues for targeting eDNA for biofilm
eradication.</p>

clinical isolates of non-carbapenemase producing Pseudomonas
aeruginosa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCeftazidime/avibactam (CZA) is indicated against
multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, particularly those that are
carbapenem resistant. CZA resistance in P. aeruginosa producing PER, a
class A extended-spectrum β-lactamase, has been well documented in
vitro. However, data regarding clinical isolates are scarce. Our aim was
to analyze the contribution of PER to CZA resistance in
non-carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa clinical isolates that were
ceftazidime and/or carbapenem non-susceptible.MethodsAntimicrobial
susceptibility was determined through agar dilution and broth
microdilution, while blaPER gene was screened through PCR. All
PER-positive isolates and five PER-negative isolates were analyzed
through Whole Genome Sequencing. The mutational resistome associated to
CZA resistance was determined through sequence analysis of genes coding
for PBPs 1b, 3 and 4, MexAB-OprM regulators MexZ, MexR, NalC and NalD,
AmpC regulators AmpD and AmpR, and OprD porin. Loss of blaPER-3 gene was
induced in a PER-positive isolate by successive passages at 43°C without
antibiotics. ResultsTwenty-six of 287 isolates studied (9.1%) were
CZA-resistant. Thirteen of 26 CZA-resistant isolates (50%) carried
blaPER. One isolate carried blaPER but was CZA-susceptible.
PER-producing isolates had significantly higher MICs for CZA, amikacin,
gentamicin, ceftazidime, meropenem and ciprofloxacin than
non-PER-producing isolates. All PER-producing isolates were ST309 and
their blaPER-3 gene was associated to ISCR1, an insertion sequence known
to mobilize adjacent DNA. PER-negative isolates were classified as ST41,
ST235 (two isolates), ST395 and ST253. PER-negative isolates carried
genes for narrow-spectrum β-lactamases and the mutational resistome
showed that all isolates had one major alteration in at least one of the
genes analyzed. Loss of blaPER-3 gene restored susceptibility to CZA,
ceftolozane/tazobactam and other β-lactamsin the in vitro evolved
isolate. DiscussionPER-3-producing ST309 P. aeruginosa is a successful
multidrug-resistant clone with blaPER-3 gene implicated in resistance to
CZA and other β-lactams.</p>

novel pathogenic species of genus Stenotrophomonas: Stenotrophomonas
pigmentata sp. nov</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionStenotrophomonas is a prominent genus owing to its dual
nature. Species of this genus have many applications in industry and
agriculture as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and microbial
biological control agents, whereas species such as Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia are considered one of the leading gram-negative
multi-drug-resistant bacterial pathogens because of their high
contribution to the increase in crude mortality and significant clinical
challenge. Pathogenic Stenotrophomonas species and most clinical
isolates belong to the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia complex (SMc).
However, a strain highly homologous to S. terrae was isolated from a
patient with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), which aroused our interest, as
S. terrae belongs to a relatively distant clade from SMc and there have
been no human association reports.MethodsThe pathogenicity,
immunological and biochemical characteristics of 610A2T were
systematically evaluated.Results610A2T is a new species of genus
Stenotrophomonas, which is named as Stenotrophomonas pigmentata sp. nov.
for its obvious brown water-soluble pigment. 610A2T is pathogenic and
caused significant weight loss, pulmonary congestion, and blood
transmission in mice because it has multiple virulence factors,
haemolysis, and strong biofilm formation abilities. In addition, the
cytokine response induced by this strain was similar to that observed in
patients with TB, and the strain was resistant to half of the anti-TB
drugs.ConclusionsThe pathogenicity of 610A2T may not be weaker than that
of S. maltophilia. Its isolation extended the opportunistic pathogenic
species to all 3 major clades of the genus Stenotrophomonas, indicating
that the clinical importance of species of Stenotrophomonas other than
S. maltophilia and potential risks to biological safety associated with
the use of Stenotrophomonas require more attention.</p>

bacteria can modulate immune responses to paratuberculosis
vaccination</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) is the etiological
agent of paratuberculosis (PTB), a chronic intestinal inflammatory
disease that causes high economical losses in dairy livestock worldwide.
Due to the absence of widely available preventive or therapeutical
treatments, new alternative therapies are needed. In this study, the
effect of a probiotic alone or in combination with a commercial vaccine
has been evaluated in a rabbit model. Vaccination enhanced the humoral
response, exerted a training effect of peripheral polymorphonuclear
neutrophils (PMNs) against homologous and heterologous stimuli,
stimulated the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by gut-associated
lymphoid tissue (GALT) macrophages, and reduced the bacterial burden in
GALT as well. However, the administration of the probiotic after
vaccination did not affect the PMN activity, increased metabolic demand,
and supressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, although humoral response and
bacterial burden decrease in GALT was maintained similar to vaccination
alone. The administration of the probiotic alone did not enhance the
humoral response or PMN activity, and the bacterial burden in GALT was
further increased compared to the only challenged group. In conclusion,
the probiotic was able to modulate the immune response hampering the
clearance of the infection and was also able to affect the response of
innate immune cells after vaccination. This study shows that the
administration of a probiotic can modulate the immune response pathways
triggered by vaccination and/or infection and even exacerbate the
outcome of the disease, bringing forward the importance of verifying
treatment combinations in the context of each particular infectious
agent.</p>

evaluation of droplet digital PCR in the early identification of
suspected sepsis patients in the emergency department: a prospective
observational study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRapid and accurate diagnosis of the causative agents is
essential for clinical management of bloodstream infections (BSIs) that
might induce sepsis/septic shock. A considerable number of suspected
sepsis patients initially enter the health-care system through an
emergency department (ED), hence it is vital to establish an early
strategy to recognize sepsis and initiate prompt care in ED. This study
aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical value of
droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay in suspected sepsis patients in the
ED.MethodsThis was a prospective single-centered observational study
including patients admitted to the ED from 25 October 2022 to 3 June
2023 with suspected BSIs screened by Modified Shapiro Score (MSS) score.
The comparison between ddPCR and blood culture (BC) was performed to
evaluate the diagnostic performance of ddPCR for BSIs. Meanwhile,
correlative analysis between ddPCR and the inflammatory and
prognostic-related biomarkers were conducted to explore the relevance.
Further, the health economic evaluation of the ddPCR was
analyzed.Results258 samples from 228 patients, with BC and ddPCR
performed simultaneously, were included in this study. We found that
ddPCR results were positive in 48.13% (103 of 214) of episodes, with
identification of 132 pathogens. In contrast, BC only detected 18
positives, 88.89% of which were identified by ddPCR. When considering
culture-proven BSIs, ddPCR shows an overall sensitivity of 88.89% and
specificity of 55.61%, the optimal diagnostic power for quantifying BSI
through ddPCR is achieved with a copy cutoff of 155.5. We further found
that ddPCR exhibited a high accuracy especially in liver abscess
patients. Among all the identified virus by ddPCR, EBV has a
substantially higher positive rate with a link to immunosuppression.
Moreover, the copies of pathogens in ddPCR were positively correlated
with various markers of inflammation, coagulation, immunity as well as
prognosis. With high sensitivity and specificity, ddPCR facilitates
precision antimicrobial stewardship and reduces health care
costs.ConclusionsThe multiplexed ddPCR delivers precise and quantitative
load data on the causal pathogen, offers the ability to monitor the
patient’s condition and may serve as early warning of sepsis in
time-urgent clinical situations as ED.ImportanceEarly detection and
effective administration of antibiotics are essential to improve
clinical outcomes for those with life-threatening infection in the
emergency department. ddPCR, an emerging tool for rapid and sensitive
pathogen identification used as a precise bedside test, has developed to
address the current challenges of BSI diagnosis and precise treatment.
It characterizes sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and absolute
quantifications without a standard curve. ddPCR can detect causative
pathogens and related resistance genes in patients with suspected BSIs
within a span of three hours. In addition, it can identify polymicrobial
BSIs and dynamically monitor changes in pathogenic microorganisms in the
blood and can be used to evaluate antibiotic efficacy and survival
prognosis. Moreover, the copies of pathogens in ddPCR were positively
correlated with various markers of inflammation, coagulation, immunity.
With high sensitivity and specificity, ddPCR facilitates precision
antimicrobial stewardship and reduces health care costs.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCandida albicans (C. albicans) can form biofilms; a
critical virulence factor that provides effective protection from
commercial antifungals and contributes to public health issues. The
development of new antifungal therapies, particularly those targeting
biofilms, is imperative. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate
the antifungal and antibiofilm effects of Lactobacillus salivarius (L.
salivarius), zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) and nanocomposites (ZnNCs) on C.
albicans isolates from Nile tilapia, fish wash water and human fish
sellers in Sharkia Governorate, Egypt.MethodsA cross-sectional study
collected 300 samples from tilapia, fish wash water, and fish sellers
(100 each). Probiotic L. salivarius was immobilized with ZnNPs to
synthesize ZnNCs. The study assessed the antifungal and antibiofilm
activities of ZnNPs, L. salivarius, and ZnNCs compared to amphotericin
(AMB).ResultsCandida spp. were detected in 38 samples, which included C.
albicans (42.1%), C. glabrata (26.3%), C. krusei (21.1%), and C.
parapsilosis (10.5%). A total of 62.5% of the isolates were resistant to
at least one antifungal agent, with the highest resistance to nystatin
(62.5%). However, 75% of the isolates were highly susceptible to AMB.
All C. albicans isolates exhibited biofilm-forming capabilities, with 4
(25%) isolates showing strong biofilm formation. At least one
virulence-associated gene (RAS1, HWP1, ALS3, or SAP4) was identified
among the C. albicans isolates. Probiotics L. salivarius, ZnNPs, and
ZnNCs displayed antibiofilm and antifungal effects against C. albicans,
with ZnNCs showing significantly higher inhibitory activity. ZnNCs, with
a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 10 µg/mL, completely reduced
C. albicans biofilm gene expression. Additionally, scanning electron
microscopy images of C. albicans biofilms treated with ZnNCs revealed
asymmetric, wrinkled surfaces, cell deformations, and reduced cell
numbers.ConclusionThis study identified virulent, resistant C. albicans
isolates with strong biofilm-forming abilities in tilapia, water, and
humans, that pose significant risks to public health and food
safety.</p>

<p>BackgroundThe Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is strongly
associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors, but the
relationship with blood pressure (BP) remains unclear.ObjectivesTo
assess the association between HCV infection status and BP in US
adults.MethodsData for the study were obtained from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2012. The
association of HCV infection status (including HCV infection, current
HCV infection, and past HCV infection) with hypertension, systolic blood
pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were explored using
logistic or linear regression analyses respectively.ResultsA total of
25,850 participants (age≥18 years) were enrolled in the current study,
including 14,162 participants with hypertension. After adjusting for all
covariates, HCV infection/current HCV infection was not associated with
hypertension and SBP compared to participants with non-HCV infection
(OR: 1.34,95% CI 0.96–1.87/1.31 95% CI 0.91,1.91, β: -0.92, 95% CI
-2.7–0.86/-0.35 95% CI -2.51,1.81, respectively). HCV infection/current
HCV infection was only associated with elevated DBP (β: 4.1,95% CI
2.57–5.63/4.24,95% CI 2.27–6.21). However, there was no correlation with
past HCV infection in participants with hypertension, SBP, and DBP
compared to those with non-HCV infection (OR: 1.23,95% CI 0.59–2.54; β:
-3.79, 95% CI -7.67–0.08 and 2.28 95% CI -0.36–4.92,

found that both HCV infection and current HCV infection were
independently linked to higher DBP. However, there was no association
between past HCV infection and DBP.</p>

microbiome: new insights into bronchiectasis’ outcome</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The present treatments for bronchiectasis, which is defined by
pathological dilatation of the airways, are confined to symptom relief
and minimizing exacerbations. The condition is becoming more common
worldwide. Since the disease’s pathophysiology is not entirely well
understood, developing novel treatments is critically important. The
interplay of chronic infection, inflammation, and compromised
mucociliary clearance, which results in structural alterations and the
emergence of new infection, is most likely responsible for the
progression of bronchiectasis. Other than treating bronchiectasis caused
by cystic fibrosis, there are no approved treatments. Understanding the
involvement of the microbiome in this disease is crucial, the microbiome
is defined as the collective genetic material of all bacteria in an
environment. In clinical practice, bacteria in the lungs have been
studied using cultures; however, in recent years, researchers use
next-generation sequencing methods, such as 16S rRNA sequencing.
Although the microbiome in bronchiectasis has not been entirely
investigated, what is known about it suggests that Haemophilus,
Pseudomonas and Streptococcus dominate the lung bacterial ecosystems,
they present significant intraindividual stability and interindividual
heterogeneity. Pseudomonas and Haemophilus-dominated microbiomes have
been linked to more severe diseases and frequent exacerbations, however
additional research is required to fully comprehend the role of
microbiome in the evolution of bronchiectasis. This review discusses
recent findings on the lung microbiota and its association with
bronchiectasis.</p>

on the antiviral potential of zinc and magnesium salts against
chikungunya virus: implications for therapeutics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundChikungunya virus (CHIKV), which causes chikungunya fever,
is an arbovirus of public health concern with no approved antiviral
therapies. A significant proportion of patients develop chronic
arthritis after an infection. Zinc and magnesium salts help the immune
system respond effectively against viral infections. This study explored
the antiviral potential of zinc sulphate, zinc acetate, and magnesium
sulphate against CHIKV infection.MethodsThe highest non-toxic
concentration of the salts (100 µM) was used to assess the prophylactic,
virucidal, and therapeutic anti-CHIKV activities. Dose-dependent
antiviral effects were investigated to find out the 50% inhibitory
concentration of the salts. Entry bypass assay was conducted to find out
whether the salts affect virus entry or post entry stages. Virus output
in all these experiments was estimated using a focus-forming unit assay,
real-time RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence assay.ResultsDifferent time-
and temperature-dependent assays revealed the therapeutic antiviral
activity of zinc and magnesium salts against CHIKV. A minimum exposure
of 4 hours and treatment initiation within 1 to 2 hours of infection are
required for inhibition of CHIKV. Entry assays revealed that zinc salt
affected virus-entry. Entry bypass assays suggested that both salts
affected post-entry stages of CHIKV. In infected C57BL6 mice orally fed
with zinc and magnesium salts, a reduction in viral RNA copy number was
observed.ConclusionThe study results suggest zinc salts exert anti-CHIKV
activity at entry and post entry stages of the virus life cycle, while
magnesium salt affect CHIKV at post entry stages. Overall, the study
highlights the significant antiviral potential of zinc sulphate, zinc
acetate, and magnesium sulphate against CHIKV, which can be exploited in
designing potential therapeutic strategies for early treatment of
chikungunya patients, thereby reducing the virus-associated persistent
arthritis.</p>

<p>PurposeRaoultella spp. is a genus of bacteria that is known to be
closely related to Klebsiella. It has been debated whether Raoultella
should be reclassified as a subgroup of Klebsiella. The aim of this
study is to compare clinical aspects of Raoultella and Klebsiella
oxytoca, a species of Klebsiella that is known to be bacteriologically
similar to Raoultella spp.MethodsUsing data collected at a tertiary care
hospital in the United States, we identified 43 patients with Raoultella
infection and 1173 patients with Klebsiella oxytoca infection. We
compared patient demographics (age and sex), hospitalization status,
isolation sites and antibiotic resistance profiles between the two
species.ResultsThere was no significant difference in patient
demographics between the two bacteria species. The proportions of
intensive care unit (ICU) admission were higher among patients with
Raoultella infection (p=0.008). The most common site of isolation was
urine for both species (39.5% of all patients with Raoultella spp.
vs. 59.3% for K. oxytoca). The second most common site of isolation was
blood stream for Raoultella spp. (23.3%) and respiratory tract for K.
oxytoca (10.8%). Except for the high proportion of resistant isolates of
Raoultella spp. for Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, the antibiotic
susceptibility profiles were similar between the two bacteria species.
Both were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and meropenem.ConclusionWhile
there are no significant differences in the patient demographics and
antibiotic susceptibility profiles between Raoultella spp. and K.
oxytoca, Raoultella may cause more serious infection requiring ICU
admissions. Also, Raoultella may cause blood stream infection more
frequently than K. oxytoca.</p>

gut microbiota–blood and urine metabolite correlations in early
sepsis-induced acute kidney injury: insights from targeted KEGG
analyses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe interplay between gut microbiota and metabolites in the
early stages of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is not yet
clearly understood. This study explores the characteristics and
interactions of gut microbiota, and blood and urinary metabolites in
patients with SA-AKI.MethodsUtilizing a prospective observational
approach, we conducted comparative analyses of gut microbiota and
metabolites via metabolomics and metagenomics in individuals diagnosed
with SA-AKI compared to those without AKI (NCT06197828). Pearson
correlations were used to identify associations between microbiota,
metabolites, and clinical indicators. The Comprehensive Antibiotic
Resistance Database was employed to detect antibiotic resistance genes
(ARGs), while Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
informed on metabolic processes and microbial resistance
patterns.ResultsOur study included analysis of four patients with SA-AKI
and five without AKI. Significant disparities in bacterial composition
were observed, illustrated by diversity indices (Shannon index: 2.0 ±
0.4 vs. 1.4 ± 0.6, P = 0.230; Simpson index: 0.8 ± 0.1 vs. 0.6 ± 0.2, P
= 0.494) between the SA-AKI group and the non-AKI group. N6, N6,
N6-Trimethyl-L-lysine was detected in both blood and urine metabolites,
and also showed significant correlations with specific gut microbiota
(Campylobacter hominis and Bacteroides caccae, R &gt; 0, P &lt; 0.05).
Both blood and urine metabolites were enriched in the lysine degradation
pathway. We also identified the citrate cycle (TCA cycle) as a KEGG
pathway enriched in sets of differentially expressed ARGs in the gut
microbiota, which exhibits an association with lysine
degradation.ConclusionsSignificant differences in gut microbiota and
metabolites were observed between the SA-AKI and non-AKI groups,
uncovering potential biomarkers and metabolic changes linked to SA-AKI.
The lysine degradation pathway may serve as a crucial link connecting
gut microbiota and metabolites.</p>

of Group A streptococcus frequently assayed virulence genes in invasive
disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionIt is currently unclear what the role of Group A
streptococcus (GAS) virulence factors (VFs) is in contributing to the
invasive potential of GAS. This work investigated the evidence for the
association of GAS VFs with invasive disease.MethodsWe employed a broad
search strategy for studies reporting the presence of GAS VFs in
invasive and non-invasive GAS disease. Data were independently extracted
by two reviewers, quality assessed, and meta-analyzed using
Stata®.ResultsA total of 32 studies reported on 45 putative virulence
factors [invasive (n = 3,236); non-invasive (n = 5,218)], characterized
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (n = 30) and whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) (n = 2). The risk of bias was rated as low and moderate, in 23 and
9 studies, respectively. Meta-,analyses of high-quality studies (n = 23)
revealed a significant association of speM [OR, 1.64 (95%CI, 1.06;
2.52)] with invasive infection. Meta-analysis of WGS studies
demonstrated a significant association of hasA [OR, 1.91 (95%CI, 1.36;
2.67)] and speG [OR, 2.83 (95%CI, 1.63; 4.92)] with invasive GAS (iGAS).
Meta-analysis of PCR studies indicated a significant association of speA
[OR, 1.59 (95%CI, 1.10; 2.30)] and speK [OR, 2.95 (95%CI, 1.81; 4.80)]
with invasive infection. A significant inverse association was observed
between prtf1 [OR, 0.42 (95%CI, 0.20; 0.87)] and invasive
infection.ConclusionThis systematic review and genomic meta-analysis
provides evidence of a statistically significant association with
invasive infection for the hasA gene, while smeZ, ssa, pnga3, sda1, sic,
and NaDase show statistically significantly inverse associations with
invasive infection. SpeA, speK, and speG are associated with GAS
virulence; however, it is unclear if they are markers of invasive
infection. This work could possibly aid in developing preventative
strategies.</p>

the role of brain-derived extracellular vesicles in viral infections:
from pathological insights to biomarker potential</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound vesicles secreted by
all cell types that play a central role in cell-to-cell communication.
Since these vesicles serve as vehicles of cellular content (nucleic
acids, proteins and lipids) with the potential to cross biological
barriers, they represent a novel attractive window into an otherwise
inaccessible organ, such as the brain. The composition of EVs is
cell-type specific and mirrors the physiological condition of the
cell-of-origin. Consequently, during viral infection, EVs undergo
significant changes in their content and morphology, thereby reflecting
alterations in the cellular state. Here, we briefly summarize the
potential of brain-derived EVs as a lens into viral infection in the
central nervous system, thereby: 1) uncovering underlying
pathophysiological processes at play and 2) serving as liquid biopsies
of the brain, representing a non-invasive source of biomarkers for
monitoring disease activity. Although translating the potential of EVs
from research to diagnosis poses complexities, characterizing
brain-derived EVs in the context of viral infections holds promise to
enhance diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, offering new avenues for
managing infectious neurological diseases.</p>
