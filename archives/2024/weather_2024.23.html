Mesoscale Discussion 1188
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 PM CDT Fri Jun 07 2024

Areas affected...north central into central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071754Z - 072030Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Rapid thunderstorm development, including or two
intensifying supercells, appears increasingly probable through 2-4
PM CDT.  This activity will pose a risk for producing large hail in
excess of 2 inches in diameter, locally strong surface gusts and
perhaps a tornado or two.

DISCUSSION...Within deepening lee surface troughing, continuing
insolation and northward advection of low-level moisture on
southerly low-level flow are contribute to rapid boundary-layer
destabilization and weakening inhibition across the Nebraska
Sandhills vicinity.  This is occurring beneath broadly anticyclonic,
but moderate to strong flow near the northeastern periphery of
large-scale mid/upper ridging.  However, forcing for ascent
associated with weak perturbations progressing through this regime
is in the process of spreading eastward across the Nebraska
Panhandle.  This lift is likely providing support for the ongoing
high-based convective development approaching the Sandhills.

As surface dew points continue to rise into and through the lower
60s, and temperatures warm into the mid 80s, forecast soundings
suggest that convective temperatures will be approached.  It appears
that this will coincide with strengthening deep-layer lift, aided by
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection initially becoming focused to
northwest and west of the Thedford/Ainsworth vicinities by 19-21Z.  

One or two rapidly developing and intensifying supercells appears
possible, in the presence of thermodynamic profiles characterized by
steep mid-level lapse rates with CAPE increasing in excess of 2000
J/kg and strongly sheared deep-layer westerly mean flow increasing
to around 30 kt.  As the stronger storms mature, they will tend to
propagate southeastward accompanied by increasing risk for large
hail, and at  least some potential for producing a tornado or two.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1243 PM CDT Fri Jun 07 2024

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN
COLORADO EASTWARD ACROSS WESTERN AND SOUTH-CENTRAL KANSAS AND
ADJACENT NORTHERN OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong/locally severe storms -- and attendant hail/wind risk -- are
expected from afternoon through the evening from the High Plains of
Colorado southeastward to the south-central Kansas vicinity. 
Isolated severe storms will also be possible across the lower
Missouri and Mid-Mississippi Valley vicinity.

...Central High Plains southeastward to south-central
Kansas/northern Oklahoma...
Afternoon heating/destabilization is forecast across the central
High Plains -- particularly eastern Colorado and far southeastern
Wyoming -- in a post-frontal, upslope-flow environment expected
across the area.  Isolated storms should develop over the Front
Range during the afternoon, and with a rather deep/dry boundary
layer that is expected, initially sparse convection should tend to
grow gradually upscale through the afternoon.  

As a cold pool evolves, and given background west-northwesterly
mid-level flow atop a developing southerly low-level jet, upscale
growth into an east-southeastward-moving MCS appears probable.  As
such, risk for locally damaging winds, and hail, warrants upgrade to
SLGT risk across portions of eastern Colorado and across western and
south-central Kansas, reflective of this mainly evening
severe-weather potential.  Storms will eventually diminish in
intensity overnight as the low-level jet veers through the end of
the period.

...Southern High Plains...
Isolated/high-based afternoon storms are expected to develop over
eastern New Mexico and into the Texas Panhandle and South Plains
region, near a weak lee trough/dryline, as daytime heating/mixing
results in modest CAPE atop the deeply mixed boundary layer.  Storms
should remain isolated, but evaporative effects within the dry
sub-cloud layer could support locally strong/damaging wind gusts
with one or two of the strongest storms.  Convection should diminish
rather rapidly into the early evening, coincident with evening
stabilization of the boundary layer.

...Ozarks/Mid-Mississippi Valley area...
Ongoing convection/cloud cover is expected early in the period, as a
decaying MCS is forecast to be moving southeastward across Missouri.
 Near and north of an associated west-to-east outflow boundary that
should lie across the Ozarks during the afternoon, some potential
for warm-advection-induced, isolated storm redevelopment appears
possible.  Conditionally, the environment would support risk for
organized/potentially rotating storms, but with a likely-to-be
convectively contaminated boundary layer, and questions regarding
storm coverage, will maintain only MRGL risk for severe weather
across this area.

A few storms may develop nearer the outflow over the southeastern
Missouri during the afternoon, and spread across the Mid-Mississippi
Valley, but a less-favorable thermodynamic environment with eastward
extent should limit severe-weather potential.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1159 AM CDT Fri Jun 07 2024

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...Update...
A few minor changes were made to the Elevated areas for today. The
latest NWP trends suggest a broader area of near critical wind
speeds spreading into portions of far southern UT and south central
NM. Similarly, dry south-southwest sustained surface winds near 20
mph or slightly greater will precede an area of showers and
thunderstorms moving into the TX panhandle early this evening. ERC
percentiles across both of the aforementioned regions are beginning
to approach or exceed 80-85, and will overlap these hot, dry, and
breezy conditions. Yesterday's rainfall across the TX Panhandle,
however, has only resulted in a small extension of the Elevated area
to the northeast.

A small Critical area was considered near and east of the Black
Mountains of AZ and Lake Mead region where localized funneling of
south winds may occur, but slightly less receptive fuels have
precluded the need for this addition. No changes were made to the
IsoDryT area, and lightning is already being observed over far
southwestern and western NM. Please see the previous discussion for
more details concerning thunderstorm potential over the Southwest.

Finally, shower and thunderstorm chances will continue to increase
over the Florida Peninsula today. Lightning strikes away from
heavier precipitation cores could produce fire ignitions, especially
over the western-south half of the peninsula, although recent
rainfall is beginning to slowly result in relatively less receptive
fuels.

..Barnes.. 06/07/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Fri Jun 07 2024/

...Synopsis...
Along the western periphery of a mid/upper-level ridge centered over
the southern Plains, diurnal heating amid a warm/dry antecedent air
mass will yield 10-15 percent RH across much of the Southwest and
southern High Plains. Over portions of northern/central AZ into
southern NV, a glancing midlevel shortwave trough will promote 15-20
mph sustained south-southwesterly surface winds -- favoring elevated
fire-weather conditions (given receptive fuels). Farther east over
east-central NM into far west TX, breezy/gusty southerly surface
winds will develop in response to a deepening lee cyclone over the
central High Plains, which will also contribute to elevated
fire-weather conditions during the afternoon.

Additionally, a plume of midlevel moisture will remain in place atop
the dry/deeply mixed boundary layer across much of the Southwest
into the southern High Plains -- with sufficient instability for
isolated/widely scattered diurnally driven thunderstorms. Deep
inverted-V thermodynamic profiles will favor high-based
thunderstorms with limited precipitation potential. As a result,
isolated lightning-induced ignitions are possible over the receptive
fuels across the region.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across the central Plains
especially from mid/late afternoon through evening. Damaging winds
and large hail are the primary threats.

...Central Plains including Nebraska/Kansas to western Missouri...
Scattered elevated thunderstorms are ongoing across southern South
Dakota, and in a more isolated sense across central Nebraska. A
mid-level speed max/subtle shortwave trough over Wyoming and the
nearby north-central High Plains this morning will continue
east-southeastward, overspreading a warm sector later today that
will narrow northward across north-central Nebraska near a deepening
surface low and evolving triple point. This is where surface-based
thunderstorm development will become increasingly likely by
mid-afternoon (circa 20z across north-central Nebraska).

As surface dewpoints climb through the lower 60s F, upwards of
2000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE will reside in this corridor by peak heating.
Intense storm development including supercells can initially be
expected in the presence of 50+ kt effective shear, highlighted by
50-80 kt mid/high-level west-northwesterly flow. Instances of very
large hail (baseball size plausible) may occur, potentially also
with some tornado risk, although low-level winds/SRH will not be
overly strong diurnally (roughly pre-00z).

Storms are expected to merge/congeal through early evening as they
progress southeastward, likely growing upscale into a well-organized
MCS that will evolve across south-central/southeast Nebraska and
northern Kansas, and into western/northern Missouri and southwest
Iowa by late evening/overnight. Scenario will be aided by a
nocturnally strengthening southwesterly low-level jet and
increasingly robust warm/moist advection. A corridor of potentially
widespread damaging winds and wind-driven hail is expected.

...Southwest Kansas and Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles...
High-based thunderstorms are expected to develop through mid/late
afternoon near a south-central High Plains surface low and adjacent
surface trough/diffuse dryline. This development will be associated
with a hot/deeply mixed boundary layer with temperatures in the
90s/lower 100s F. These storms will progress into a region of
somewhat greater moisture and instability through early evening,
with storm organization potentially aided in proximity to moderately
strong northwesterly flow aloft. At least isolated severe storms can
be expected, with severe-caliber wind gusts and bouts of large hail
possible.

...Great Basin...
A shortwave trough is readily evident in water vapor imagery near
the western Nevada/California border vicinity at late morning. Ample
insolation and PW values between 0.50-1.00 inch may potentially
support upwards of 750-1000 J/kg MLCAPE this afternoon, especially
across a broad portion of northern/central Nevada into southern
Idaho and northern Utah. As thunderstorms diurnally increase in
coverage and intensity, and low-level lapse rates steepen, effective
shear generally 30-35 kt may allow for some sustained/organized
multicells, with severe-caliber wind gusts possible with the
strongest storms.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING FROM CENTRAL NEBRASKA SOUTHEASTWARD INTO NORTHEAST
KANSAS AND FAR WESTERN MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across the central Plains region
beginning mid afternoon. Damaging winds and large hail are the
primary threats.

...Central Plains...
The early morning water vapor imagery loop shows a broad upper ridge
across the southwest US, with a shortwave trough topping the ridge
over CO.  This feature will emerge into the high Plains by early
afternoon.  Southerly low-level winds are transporting rich moisture
rapidly northward, with 60s dewpoints now into southwest KS.  A few
hours of sunshine/mixing should result in a rapid jump of surface
dewpoints into much of KS/NE, where strong heating will occur.  This
should yield a corridor of moderate MLCAPE by mid-afternoon
(1500-2500 J/kg).  Present indications are that intense
thunderstorms will form over north-central NE by mid-afternoon in a
strongly sheared environment.  These supercell storms will pose a
risk of all hazards for a few hours, tracking southeastward and
organizing into a fast-moving MCS.  As the storms track into eastern
NE/KS and western IA/MO during the evening, model guidance suggests
the potential for rather widespread damaging winds and hail.  This
activity is expected to weaken overnight as it tracks into southeast
KS and southern MO.  Given the increasing confidence of this
scenario and the potential for a more widespread severe event, have
upgraded to ENH.

...Southwest KS and TX/OK Panhandles...
A low-level convergence/dryline boundary is expected to become
established late this afternoon from northeast NM into parts of the
TX/OK Panhandles and southwest KS.  Temperatures are expected to
rise into the 90s or low 100s in this area, where scattered
high-based afternoon thunderstorms will develop.  A deeply mixed
boundary-layer, strong southwesterly low/mid level winds, and
sufficient CAPE will result in a few severe storms through the early
evening.  Damaging wind gusts appear to be the main concern,
although some hail is also possible.

...Great Basin...
A well-defined shortwave trough is currently over central CA moving
eastward.  Lift associated with this trough, coupled with increasing
mid-level moisture across the Great Basin depicted in water vapor
imagery, will aid in the development of scattered thunderstorms over
central/eastern NV.  This activity will track eastward into parts of
UT during the peak heating period.  Forecast soundings show very
steep low and mid level lapse rates and sufficient CAPE for damaging
wind gusts in the more intense storms.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE UPPER MIDWEST...GREAT
LAKES...NORTHEAST...MID-ATLANTIC...PARTS OF SOUTHERN AND COASTAL
TEXAS...AND SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI...

...SUMMARY...
Strong storms are possible across portions of the Upper Midwest,
Great Lakes, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, parts of southern and coastal
Texas, and southern Mississippi.

...20z Update...

Minor adjustments were made to the MRGL areas across northern IN and
LA/MS where morning/afternoon thunderstorms have moved eastward. 

Marginal risks continue across portions of MN/WI to the
Mid-Atlantic, TX/LA/MS, and ME/NH. A few thunderstorms with
transient rotation have been observed across Central and Eastern
Virginia. See MCD 1175 for more information. 

Thunderstorm development is expected to increase in coverage across
portions of MN/WI through the rest of the afternoon. Daytime heating
has yielded MLCAPE around 500 J/kg as mid-level flow increases from
a speed max moving through the trough located across Canada into the
Great Lakes region. Deep layer shear will increase across the
region, mainly across southern MN into northern IA, which may allow
for a few more organized clusters capable of damaging winds and hail
through the afternoon. The Marginal Risk handles this threat well,
with no changes needed this afternoon.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1122 AM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024/

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery shows a mid-level shortwave trough over the
western Great Lakes/mid MS Valley with the primary vorticity lobe
rotating northeastward through the Upper Great Lakes through the
early evening.  A blocking pattern located over the Northeast into
Quebec will weaken as a mid-level speed max moves quickly from the
western Dakotas southeastward into the southern Great Lakes by early
Thursday morning.  In the low levels, a cold front will arc
southeastward into the Great Lakes from an occluded low over
Manitoba/western Ontario.  The trailing portion of the front will
progress eastward across the southern Great Lakes/OH Valley, while
the convectively augmented effective front stalls over the northwest
Gulf Coast states.

...MN/WI to the Mid-Atlantic this afternoon/evening...
Surface heating and lingering boundary-layer moisture will
contribute to weak-moderate buoyancy in an environment with
sufficient westerly deep-layer shear/hodograph length for scattered,
low-topped cells to produce isolated severe gusts and marginally
severe hail this afternoon across MN/WI.

Farther southeast over the southern Great Lakes/OH Valley, ascent
associated with the aforementioned Great Lakes mid-level disturbance
will aid in storm development this afternoon as heating weakens
convective inhibition.  Relatively moist low levels (surface
dewpoints 65-70 deg F) will contribute to MLCAPE around 1000 J/kg. 
Moderate deep-layer vertical shear (effective bulk shear 20-30 kt)
along with poor midlevel lapse rates around 6 C/km, will favor
mostly strong to locally severe multicells.  Isolated 50-65 mph
gusts and marginally severe hail are the primary hazards.  

Remnant, convectively enhanced midlevel troughs will move
east-northeastward from WV and AL, coincident with the diurnal
heating cycle near and east of the Appalachians.  Widely scattered
storm clusters will be possible this afternoon from GA into the
western Carolinas, but poor lapse rates and weak vertical shear will
limit any severe threat.  Though lapse rates will be similarly poor
into the Mid-Atlantic, there will be a zone of stronger low-level
shear/hodograph curvature across northern VA/MD in advance of the
MCV approaching from WV.  Here, a few weakly rotating storms could
produce isolated wind damage and a brief/weak tornado.

...TX/LA/MS...
Remnant MCS will continue to push southward through the middle TX
coast through early afternoon and offshore the southwest LA coast. 
Several observation sites late this morning recorded strong gusts
(40-45 kt) but the overall displacement of the gust front from the
thunderstorm cores will likely limit gust potential.  A few storms
may develop farther west this afternoon/evening along the trailing
outflow boundary in the area around DRT.  Large CAPE/steep lapse
rates will support both strong updrafts and downdrafts, though weak
vertical shear will generally limit storm longevity and the
magnitude of any hail/wind threat.  Farther east over LA/MS,
scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop near the residual
outflow.  An isolated hail/wind threat may develop with the stronger
storms as one or two clusters develops by mid-late afternoon and
early evening.

...ME/NH this afternoon...
Downstream of shortwave ridging in the midlevels, a weak northwest
flow regime will persist this afternoon over northern New England. 
Lingering low-level moisture, surface heating in cloud breaks
southeast of the higher terrain, and very subtle midlevel vorticity
maxima will support a few thunderstorms this afternoon across
southern/eastern ME and part of NH.  The latest forecast soundings
show MLCAPE of 1000-1500 J/kg and effective bulk shear near 25 kt
(with longer hodographs aloft) will be sufficient for semi-organized
storms capable of producing isolated wind damage and marginally
severe hail for a few hours this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1176
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0302 PM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Areas affected...much of central Minnesota into northwestern
Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 052002Z - 052200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm activity will continue to develop
and overspread the region through 5-7 PM CDT, accompanied by locally
strong to severe surface gusts.

DISCUSSION...Mid-level cooling and lift within the exit region of a
seasonably strong (70-90 kt around 500 mb) jet digging across the
northern Great Plains is contributing to steepening
lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates spreading east-southeast of the
Red River Valley through much of northern and central Minnesota. 
Beneath this regime, a deepening mixed boundary layer remains
sufficiently moist to support CAPE in excess of 500 J/kg, with an
increase in thunderstorm development ongoing in the wake of
preceding thunderstorm activity overspreading the Minnesota
Arrowhead through northwestern Wisconsin vicinity.  As thunderstorms
continue to slowly increase in number and intensify in the peak
afternoon heating, downward mixing of stronger momentum to the
surface will contribute to increasing potential for strong to widely
scattered severe gusts, particularly with storms overspreading
central Minnesota into northwestern Wisconsin through 22-00Z.

Mesoscale Discussion 1175
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Areas affected...Central and Eastern Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 051925Z - 052130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered afternoon thunderstorms are expected, with a
risk of isolated gusty/damaging winds or perhaps a brief tornado or
two.  Limited areal coverage and brief nature of risk suggests a
watch will not be needed.

DISCUSSION...A band of scattered showers and occasional
thunderstorms is spreading northeastward across eastern VA into
eastern MD.  In the wake of this activity, strong daytime heating is
leading to destabilization of a rather moist air mass across central
VA, where MLCAPE values have risen into the 1000-1500 J/kg range. 
Model guidance suggests the approach of a weak mid-level shortwave
trough, with an accompanied increase in low-level winds.  This will
result in some strengthening of shear profiles and a greater chance
of a few more organized or weak supercellular storms in the coming
hours.  Locally damaging wind gusts are the most likely concern, but
a brief tornado or two are also possible through the afternoon. 
Given the limited nature of the threat, a ww is not currently
anticipated.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 PM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains valid. Please see the discussion below
for additional details. It will remain hot and dry across the
Southwest, but relatively low sustained wind speeds will limit the
overall potential for elevated fire spread conditions. Some
localized, short-lived elevated conditions may develop late Thursday
afternoon in and around the Gila Mountains of AZ.

..Barnes.. 06/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will settle over the western CONUS as
northwesterly flow aloft becomes established across the eastern
CONUS. As the ridge continues to build, a weak cold front will
continue westward at the surface bringing moisture into parts of the
southern Rockies and High Plains. With weak surface winds and
increasing moisture, dry and windy fire-weather conditions appear
limited in coverage. However, some potential may exist for lightning
ignitions from high-based storms.

...Southwest Dry Thunderstorms...
As the backdoor cold front continues to weaken over eastern NM and
far west TX, low-level moisture will gradually move westward into
the southern Rockies beneath the upper ridge. While forcing aloft
appears very weak, with the majority of the upper flow displaced
north, orographic ascent and diurnal heating may be sufficient to
support isolated thunderstorm coverage from parts of eastern AZ to
northern NM. Model soundings show deep and well-mixed boundary
layers are present beneath weak buoyancy. This strongly suggests any
storms that do form will be high-based with little potential for
wetting rainfall. Dry lightning strikes with ignition potential
appear possible given the receptive nature of fuels over parts of NM
and AZ. However, height rises aloft and little to no forcing for
ascent casts considerable uncertainty on storm coverage.

Mesoscale Discussion 1173
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1038 AM CDT Wed Jun 05 2024

Areas affected...parts of southeastern lower Michigan...northwestern
Ohio...northeastern and central Indiana...southern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 051538Z - 051815Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Clusters of thunderstorms may continue to slowly
strengthen and organize while spreading east-northeastward across
the region accompanied by strong to, perhaps, occasionally severe
gusts.  While the overall severe threat still appears generally
marginal in nature, trends are being monitored and it might not be
out of the question that a severe weather watch could become
necessary for at least a portion of the area.

DISCUSSION...Convection has been slowly intensifying on the leading
edge of the convectively generated cold pool which trails a compact,
but well-defined mesoscale convective vortex currently migrating
east-northeastward through northern Indiana.  This appears to be
embedded within 30+ kt west-southwesterly deep-layer mean flow, near
the base of negatively tilted large-scale mid-level trough forecast
to continue slowly pivoting toward the lower Great Lakes region, and
through the Ohio Valley, into this afternoon.

A seasonably moist boundary-layer, including mid 60s to near 70F
surface dew points, is destabilizing to the east and south of the
convective outflow, and, as updraft inflow becomes characterized by
increasing CAPE, there appears potential for further intensification
of this convective cluster as it approaches the western Lake Erie
vicinity.  The trailing outflow has become quasi-stationary
southwestward and westward into central Illinois, where new
thunderstorm development appears to be occurring to the north of
Salem.  This appears supported by an area of favorable enhanced
mid/upper forcing for ascent, and the downstream environment appears
conducive to similar intensification and organization which has
occurred with the lead cluster.  

With continuing thunderstorm intensification, and modest further
steepening of low-level rates in advance of the convection with
continuing insolation, the potential for strong to widely scattered
severe surface gusts seems likely to increase through 17-19Z.  While
most peak gusts might remain near or below 50 kts, some might become
locally damaging.

Mesoscale Discussion 1165
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0455 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Areas affected...Southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 391...

Valid 042155Z - 042330Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 391
continues.

SUMMARY...A few damaging wind gusts up to 60-65 mph and localized
instances of marginally severe hail near 0.75-1.25" in diameter may
continue to accompany a linear complex of thunderstorms through this
evening.

DISCUSSION...Latest radar and satellite imagery show an MCS
progressing east-southeastward across portions of southern LA and
southern MS. A moderately unstable air mass remains in place ahead
of this system, where diurnal heating has resulted in surface
temperatures climbing into the upper 80s and 90s, with dewpoints
generally in the mid 70s. Recent trends from the POE VAD profiler
indicate westerly 0-3 km shear has increased to around 50 kt over
the past 30 minutes behind the system. This may support an
increasing opportunity for bowing segments, and damaging wind gusts,
oriented north-south on the eastern flank of the complex, and a
general eastward progression into south-central/southeastern MS over
the next 1-2 hours. In addition, brief instances of marginally
severe hail will be possible within any of the more robust updrafts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1164
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0413 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Areas affected...Portions of central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 042113Z - 042315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Rapid thunderstorm initiation is expected within the next
1-2 hours across portions of central Oklahoma. Large hail up to
1.50-2.50" in diameter, wind gusts exceeding 65-75 mph, and perhaps
a tornado or two are expected.

DISCUSSION...Latest visible satellite imagery trends indicate air
mass modification is continuing across north central and central OK
late this afternoon. A developing cumulus field is apparent near a
mesolow just north of I-40 and Clinton, OK. A surface trough and
dryline extend southward from this low into portions of southwestern
OK. An axis of extreme instability has developed within
southeasterly surface winds on the western edge of a residual cold
pool from earlier this morning. As destabilization continues, and
cooler mid-level temps accompany a mid-level trough slowly
progressing eastward over the northern half of OK early this
evening, rapid thunderstorm development is expected near the surface
low and convergence zones.

Although very modest mid to upper flow should limit persistent,
discrete storm organization, a few transient discrete supercells
will remain possible via veering and increasing flow within the
lowest 4 km of the troposphere. In addition, very large CAPE and
steep lapse rates (~8.5 C/km) within the hail growth zone could
support large hail with any of the discrete cells. Furthermore,
localized enhanced 0-1 km SRH is expected near and south of I-40
where surface 10-15 kt winds will likely remained backed increasing
the potential for a tornado or two before storms begin to build
upscale later this evening. Severe, damaging winds will become more
likely by this time. A severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
soon.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 392
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
455 PM CDT Tue Jun 4 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Western and Central Oklahoma

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon from 455 PM until Midnight
  CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to rapidly intensify late this
afternoon across west central Oklahoma and track east-southeastward
across the watch area.  Supercell storms capable of very large hail
and damaging winds are the main concern.  An isolated tornado or two
is also possible with the strongest cells.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 60 miles west southwest
of Enid OK to 60 miles south southeast of Chandler OK. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 389...WW 390...WW 391...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
29025.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
225 PM CDT Tue Jun 4 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Northeast Kansas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 225 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...A broken band of thunderstorms will probably continue to
pose a risk for large hail and severe gusts across parts of central
Kansas through the afternoon.  As this activity moves east, a severe
threat will possibly move into northeast portions of Kansas. 
Additional isolated thunderstorms over south-central Kansas may
develop later this afternoon into the evening and yield a threat for
large hail and severe gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 60 miles north of
Manhattan KS to 10 miles southwest of Wichita KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 PM CDT Tue Jun 04 2024

Valid 061200Z - 121200Z

An upper-level ridge will settle over the western CONUS as
northwesterly flow aloft becomes established across the eastern
CONUS through the remainder of the week into this weekend.
Thereafter, medium range guidance depicts a gradual breakdown of the
upper-level ridge into early next week, with perhaps a mid-level
trough developing over the southern Plains at the end of the period
(Day 8/Tuesday). The evolution of the aforementioned upper-air
pattern will support multiple rounds of potential meaningful
rainfall at several locales east of the Rockies, dampening fuel
receptiveness to wildfire spread in the process. However, prolonged
warm and dry conditions are expected from portions of the Lower
Colorado River Basin into the Great Basin. Medium range guidance
agreement on stronger surface winds overlapping the expected lower
RH is not overly strong, so no Critical probabilities have been
delineated this outlook. However, the prolonged dry conditions,
along with the lack of appreciable rainfall accumulations, should
support the continued curing of fuels over portions of the Interior
West.
