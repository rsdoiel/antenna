## It turns out cyclists actually should roll through stop signs. Here’s why

date: 2024-09-10, from: Electrek Feed

Encouraging increased cycling, whether on electric bikes or good old-fashioned acoustic bikes, has the <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/05/30/its-national-e-bike-day-heres-how-an-electric-bike-can-benefit-you/">biggest impact on reduced emissions</a> and the health and well-being of our society. But with safety at the top of the list of concerns for those switching to a two-wheeled commute, more studies are showing that the best way to protect cyclists at the most dangerous point on their rides is to simply let them blow through stop signs in what is commonly known as an “Idaho stop”.</p>
