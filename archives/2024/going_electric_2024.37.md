## It turns out cyclists actually should roll through stop signs. Here’s why

date: 2024-09-10, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/stop-sign-head.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>When it comes to greening up our transportation systems and reducing the massive carbon footprint left by our daily commutes, there’s a much better solution than trying to get everyone into an electric car. Encouraging increased cycling, whether on electric bikes or good old-fashioned acoustic bikes, has the <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/05/30/its-national-e-bike-day-heres-how-an-electric-bike-can-benefit-you/">biggest impact on reduced emissions</a> and the health and well-being of our society. But with safety at the top of the list of concerns for those switching to a two-wheeled commute, more studies are showing that the best way to protect cyclists at the most dangerous point on their rides is to simply let them blow through stop signs in what is commonly known as an “Idaho stop”.</p>
