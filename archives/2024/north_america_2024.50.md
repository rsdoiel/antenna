The study found that more than 75% of all land on Earth has become drier over the last three decades, and that during that time, drylands expanded by an area the size of the Australian continent to cover 40% of all the global land (excluding Antarctica). This is a very bad trend. Aridity is different from drought. While drought eventually recedes, aridity is “an unrelenting menace,” leading to land degradation, water scarcity, biodiversity decline, crop losses, and large-scale human migration. Human-caused climate change is the main cause of the aridity crisis. “If the world fails in efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions,” the UN warned, “another 3% of the world’s humid areas are projected to transform into drylands by the end of this century.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Syria is getting a new regime, but not a new economy

date: 2024-12-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The Assad family ruled Syria for more than half a century, and that dynasty has come to an end. The rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham, or HTS, is consolidating control and will inherit an economy devastated by a decade of brutal civil war that cost 500,000 lives. What could economic recovery look like? Then, China preps for a U.S. trade war under Trump, and global criminals utilize cryptocurrency to launder money.</p>

## Oil prices rise as the Syrian regime falls

date: 2024-12-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The price of oil has ticked up after a dramatic weekend in Syria. President Bashar al-Assad fled the country following a rebel offensive that took control of the capital, Damascus, ending his family&#8217;s 54-year rule. Then, after last week’s brief martial law declaration, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol narrowly survived an impeachment motion but economic uncertainty lingers. We&#8217;ll also hear more about the holiday supply chain.</p>

## 'Polarization' is Merriam-Webster's 2024 word of the year

date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA

The results of the 2024 U.S. presidential election rattled the country and sent shockwaves across the world — or were cause for celebration, depending on who you ask. Is it any surprise then that the Merriam-Webster word of the year is "polarization"?


"Polarization means division, but it's a very specific kind of division," said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement. "Polarization means that we are tending toward the extremes rather than toward the center."


The election was so divisive, many American voters went to the polls with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an existential threat to the nation. According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat concerned that Donald Trump's views — but not Harris' — were too extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris — but not Trump.


The Merriam-Webster entry for "polarization" reflects scientific and metaphorical definitions. It's most commonly used to mean "causing strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings."


Merriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in search and usage.


Last year's pick was "authentic." This year's comes as large swaths of the U.S. struggle to reach consensus on what is real.


"It's always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody," Sokolowski said. "It's a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news, alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word's meaning in the culture."


It's notable that "polarization" originated in the early 1800s — and not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about science, Sokolowski said. He called it a "pretty young word," in the scheme of the English language. "Polarized is a term that brings intensity to another word," he continued, most frequently used in the U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ideology.


"The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words," the Merriam-Webster editor continued. "We've had dictionaries of English for 420 years and it's only been in the last 20 years or so that we've actually known which words people look up."


"Polarization" extends beyond political connotations. It's used to highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends and other industries.


All the scrutiny over Taylor Swift's private jet usage? Polarizing. Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarizing. The International Olympic Committee's decision to strip American gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it: polarizing.


Even lighthearted memes — like those making fun of Australian breakdancer Rachael "Raygun" Gunn's performance — or the proliferation of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved polarizing.


Paradoxically though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word itself. Sokolowski cited its frequent use among people across the political spectrum, including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN.


"It's used by both sides," he said, "and in a little bit ironic twist to the word, it's something that actually everyone agrees on."


Rounding out Merriam-Webster's top 10 words of 2024:


Demure


TikToker Jools Lebron's 38-second video describing her workday makeup routine as "very demure, very mindful" lit up the summer with memes. The video has been viewed more than 50 million times, yielding "huge spikes" in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means reserved or modest.


Fortnight


Taylor Swift's song "Fortnight," featuring rapper Post Malone, undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks. "Music can still send people to the dictionary," Sokolowski said.


Totality


The solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico's Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully blot out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or aggregate amount — or wholeness.


Resonate


"Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of the word 'resonate,'" Sokolowski said. This may be because the word, which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional way, can add gravitas to writing. But, paradoxically, artificial intelligence "also betrays itself to be a robot because it's using that word too much."


Allision


The word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March, a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. "When you have one moving object into a fixed object, that's an allision, not a collision. You're showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in fact, in motion," Sokolowski said.


Weird


This summer on the TV news show "Morning Joe," Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Republican leaders "weird." It may have been what launched his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Though it's a word that people typically misspell — is it "ei" or "ie"? — and search for that reason, its rise in use was notable, Sokolowski said.


Cognitive


Whether the word was used to raise questions about President Joe Biden's debate performance or Trump's own age, it cropped up often. It refers to conscious intellectual activity — such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering.


Pander


Pander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said. "Conservative news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights supporters." Whereas Walz said Trump's visit to a McDonald's kitchen pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what someone — such as an audience — wants or demands even though it is not "good, proper, reasonable, etc."


Democracy


In 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make "democracy" its first word of the year. Since then, the word — which, of course, means a form of government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions, policies and laws — is consistently one of the dictionary's most looked up. "There's a poignancy to that, that people are checking up on it," Sokolowski said. "Maybe the most hopeful thing that the curiosity of the public shows, is that they're paying attention."

## Biden and Trump address regime collapse in Syria

date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA

Both U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump reacted Sunday to the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria. Given its strategic interests in the Middle East, the U.S. is expected to keep a close eye on what lies ahead in Syria. VOA’s Veronica Balderas Iglesias reports.

## Kennedy Center honors Coppola, the Grateful Dead, Raitt and Sandoval

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Celebrities, cultural icons and a few surprise guests are gathering for the annual Kennedy Center Honors celebration Sunday evening in Washington. 


This year's recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment are director and filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, the Grateful Dead, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, and singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt. In addition, the venerable Harlem theater The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, is being recognized. 


There will be personalized tributes with performances and testimonials from fellow artists during the gala at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Medallions were presented during the traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department. 


The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, "If I Could Turn Back Time." 


Several of the latest honorees have themselves participated in past tributes to friends and colleagues at the Kennedy Center. 


Coppola spoke during fellow director Martin Scorsese's induction in 2007. Sandoval performed in the tribute to his mentor, jazz trumpet legend Dizzy Gillespie. Raitt has taken part in tributes to Buddy Guy and Mavis Staples. Raitt even attended the Kennedy Center Honors in the 1970s when her father, Broadway performer John Raitt, was taking part in a tribute to composer Richard Rogers. 


The tribute to the Grateful Dead is expected to double as a memorial to the band's founding bass player Phil Lesh, who died in October at age 84. 


This could also be the last Kennedy Center Honors ceremony without political intrigue for a while. 


During Republican Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term. 


Democratic President Joe Biden is scheduled to host a reception for the honorees at the White House and plans to attend the Kennedy Center ceremony afterward. 


The show will air on CBS on Dec. 22.

## Biden: Assad’s Syrian collapse a ‘fundamental act of justice’

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden declared Sunday that the sudden demise of the Syrian government under Bashar Assad was a “fundamental act of justice,” but that it was “a moment of uncertainty” for the Mideast.


Biden, speaking at the White House, said the collapse of the decades-long iron rule by the Assad family was “the best opportunity in a generation for the Syrian people to forge their own destiny.”




Biden said that action by the U.S. and its allies over the last two years weakened Syria's backers — Russia, Iran and Iran-supported Hezbollah militants in Lebanon — to the extent that "for the first time" they could no longer defend the Assad government.


"Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East," Biden said, after a meeting with his national security advisers at the White House.




U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that Assad had fled his country, which his family had ruled for decades, because close ally Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, "was not interested in protecting him any longer."


Trump’s comments on his social media platform came a day after he decried the possibility that the U.S. might intervene militarily in Syria to aid the rebels as they moved to oust Assad, declaring, "THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT."


The Biden administration had no intention of intervening, according to Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.


The U.S has about 900 troops in Syria, including forces working with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group.


Biden said he intends for those troops to remain, adding that U.S. forces on Sunday conducted "dozens" of what he called "precision airstrikes" on Islamic State camps and operations in Syria.




Biden said the U.S. is "clear eyed" that ISIS will try to take advantage of the situation in Syria.


The Syrian opposition that brought down Assad is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The Biden administration has designated the group as a terrorist organization and says it has links to al-Qaida, although Hayat Tahrir al-Sham says it has since broken ties with al-Qaida.


"We will remain vigilant," Biden said. "Make no mistake, some of the rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human rights abuses." He added that the groups are "saying the right things now."


"But as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions," Biden said.




Trump, who takes office January 20, linked the upheaval in Syria and Russia's war in Ukraine, noting that Assad's allies in Moscow, as well as in Iran, the main sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah, "are in a weakened state right now."


Vice President-elect JD Vance, a veteran of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, wrote on his own social media Sunday to express skepticism about the insurgents.


"Many of 'the rebels' are a literal offshoot of ISIS. One can hope they've moderated. Time will tell," he said.


With the collapse of the Assad regime, the family of missing U.S. journalist Austin Tice renewed calls to find him.


"To everyone in Syria that hears this, please remind people that we're waiting for Austin," Tice's mother, Debra, said in comments that hostage advocacy groups spread on social media. "We know that when he comes out, he's going to be fairly dazed & he's going to need lots of care & direction. Direct him to his family please!"




Tice disappeared in 2012 outside Damascus.


“We've remained committed to returning him to his family," Biden told reporters. "We believe he's alive, we think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence to that yet. And Assad should be held accountable."


The president added: "We have to identify where he [Tice] is."

## Trump picks lawyer to serve as counselor to the president

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday that he had chosen Alina Habba, his personal attorney, to serve as counselor to the president.


Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, called Habba a “tireless advocate for justice.”


“She has been unwavering in her loyalty and unmatched in her resolve — standing with me through numerous ‘trials,’ battles and countless days in Court," Trump said. “Few understand the Weaponization of the ‘Injustice’ System better than Alina.”


Trump announced several other planned additions to his administration, including Christopher Landau as his choice to serve as deputy secretary of state. Landau was the U.S. ambassador to Mexico during Trump’s first term.


Trump also said former National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton will serve as the director of policy planning at the State Department, while Michael Needham will serve as counselor of the State Department.


Earlier Sunday, Trump vowed to make swift and sweeping changes as he takes office on January 20, deporting millions of migrants in the country illegally, imposing tariffs on imported goods that could raise consumer prices for Americans and pardoning rioters who tried to upend his 2020 reelection loss. 


Six weeks ahead of taking office for a new four-year tenure in the White House, Trump seemed emboldened by his victory last month, making him only the second American president elected to a second, nonconsecutive term after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.


“People like me now, you know?” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in an interview conducted Friday in New York and broadcast Sunday.


“It’s different than the first — you know, when I won the first time [in 2016], I wasn’t nearly as popular as this,” he said. “And one thing that’s very important, in terms of the election, I love that I won the popular vote, and by a lot,” with about a 2.3 million-vote margin in his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris out of the 155 million ballots that were cast.




But Trump, a Republican, also lapsed into familiar grievances, refusing as he has for four years to concede he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden because of unfounded claims of fraudulent balloting and vote counting. Asked by NBC anchor Kristen Welker how, in his view, Democrats were able to steal that election but not the one a month ago, Trump said, “Because I think it was too big to rig.”


Trump blamed Biden for the nation’s political divide and heaped insults on his perceived foes, including the nine-member House of Representatives committee that spent more than a year examining the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters trying to block lawmakers from certifying that Biden had won the 2020 election.


He called the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the investigative panel “political thugs and, you know, creeps. For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.”




Trump said that on his first day in office he would be “acting very quickly” to pardon many of the more than 1,200 people convicted of an array of offenses linked to the rioting at the Capitol. Many of them have already completed their prison sentences while others have years to go or have to be tried. He has characterized those imprisoned as “hostages” and called them “patriots.”


“These people are living in hell,” he said.




Yet Trump said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden. “I’m not looking to go back into the past,” he said. “Retribution will be through success.”


But he said that if the Senate confirms his choices of former Florida state attorney general, Pam Bondi, as attorney general, and loyal political supporter Kash Patel as FBI director, they would have autonomy in deciding what to investigate and prosecute. Trump described special counsel Jack Smith, who twice indicted him, as “very corrupt.”




Trump centered much of his campaign on closing the southwestern U.S. border with Mexico and said mass deportations will begin quickly. First will be convicted criminals, he said, while other incoming Trump officials have said those with deportation orders will also be among the first to be deported.


“I think you have to do it, and it’s a hard — it’s a very tough thing to do. It’s — but you have to have, you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally,” he said.


Trump made no exceptions for families with mixed immigration status, where some family members are in the U.S. legally and some illegally. “I don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back,” he declared.




Trump said the cost and logistical complexity of such a massive deportation plan does not faze him.


“You have no choice,” he said. “First of all, they’re costing us a fortune. But we’re starting with the criminals, and we’ve got to do it. And then we’re starting with the others, and we’re going to see how it goes.”


But he said he would attempt to work with Democratic lawmakers to exempt so-called “dreamers” from deportation, young children who were brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents and have little connection to their native countries.


He also said he will attempt to end birthright citizenship in the U.S., now embedded in the country’s Constitution, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of the legality of their parents being in the U.S.


Trump said he would keep a campaign promise to levy tariffs on imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada. He acknowledged that he could not “guarantee American families won’t pay more” as a result of his plan.


“I can’t guarantee anything,” Trump said. “I can’t guarantee tomorrow.”


He said he is actively trying to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, “if I can.” He said Kyiv may not get as much military assistance under his administration as it has under Biden. During a political debate in September, Trump declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war.

## ‘Moana 2’ cruises to another record weekend, $600 million globally

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

The Walt Disney Co.'s animated film “Moana 2” remained at the top of the box office in its second weekend in theaters as it brought in another record haul. 


The film added $52 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. That brings its domestic total to $300 million, surpassing the original, and its global tally to a staggering $600 million.


The amount set a record gross for a movie on the weekend following Thanksgiving weekend, unseating “Frozen II,” which earned $35.2 million in the same time frame in 2019. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation. Originally conceived as a Disney+ series, “Moana 2” has already broken into the top five highest grossing releases of the year. Its performance means Disney has three films in this year's top five, including “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool & Wolverine.” The studio also has another big movie on the way before the year ends: Barry Jenkins' “Mufasa," out Dec. 20.


The weekend also showcased several new releases, including A24’s horror comedy “Y2K” and the Jude Law crime thriller “The Order.” But nothing was ever going to present significant competition to the enticing Thanksgiving leftovers, “Moana 2,” “Wicked” and “Gladiator II.”


Second place at the box office was occupied by “Wicked,” which added $34.9 million, bringing its domestic total to $320.5 million in three weeks. Globally, the musical adaptation released by Universal is at $455.6 million. “Gladiator II” followed in third place with $12.5 million, while “Red One” came in fourth with $7 million.


“These holdovers are going to create the momentum that’s going to put an $8.5 billion-plus box office year on the horizon,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.


Pre-pandemic, $11 billion had become the annual norm for the movie business. Since then, the closest the industry has gotten to that number was last year, which cracked $9 billion. This year started off slow and up to a few months ago, Dergarabedian said, even hitting $8 billion for the year was in doubt. But in the two weeks since Thanksgiving, the deficit from last year has narrowed by over 5%. 


The newcomers struggled to make a significant impact. Even the 10th anniversary rerelease of Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar,” which played in only 165 theaters, did better than “Y2K” ($2.1 million) and “The Order” ($878,000) combined. Paramount reported that the science fiction epic starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway brought in an estimated $4.4 million. IMAX also noted that all the 70mm IMAX presentations of “Interstellar” were sold out through the weekend.


“I was thrilled so many moviegoers took advantage of the original IMAX experience of ‘Interstellar’ this weekend," Nolan said in a statement.


The biggest of the many newcomers was the Indian action pic “Pushpa: The Rule – Part 2,” which earned $4.9 million. Sony and Crunchyroll's anime release, “Solo Leveling – ReAwakening,” made $2.4 million. Fathom also released pop duo for KING + COUNTRY’s “A Drummer Boy Christmas” concert in theaters where it made $2.1 million.


“It’s a really diverse marketplace,” Dergarabedian said. “There's event cinema, international cinema, a rerelease of a 10-year-old film. It's easily one of the most eclectic and interesting lineups I’ve ever seen."


Next weekend theaters are in for another influx of bigger movies, with both Sony's comic book film “Kraven the Hunter” and the animated “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” opening in wide release. Awards contenders “Nickel Boys” and “September 5” will also open in a limited number of theaters.


Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.


1. “Moana 2,” $52 million. 


2. “Wicked,” $34.9 million. 


3. “Gladiator II,” $12.5 million. 


4. “Red One,” $7 million. 


5. “Pushpa: The Rule – Part 2,” $4.9 million. 


6. “Interstellar” rerelease, $4.4 million. 


7. “Solo Leveling – ReAwakening,” $2.4 million. 


8. “Y2K,” $2.1 million. 


9. “for KING + COUNTRY’S: A Drummer Boy Christmas,” $2.1 million. 


10. “The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,” $1.5 million.

The FBI is offering a 50-thousand-dollar reward for information that leads to the arrest of the assassin of a health-care CEO in New York City. Law enforcement took the unusual step of identifying a suspect without naming him as the search for the killer continues. VOA’s Arash Arabasadi has the story.

## Trump calls for 'immediate ceasefire' in Ukraine after meeting Zelenskyy in Paris

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

KYIV — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, shortly after a meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming Kyiv "would like to make a deal" to end the more than 1,000-day war. 


In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Moscow and Kyiv have both lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that "should never have started." 


"There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed," he said, as he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to act to bring the fighting to an end. 


Trump's remarks came after a meeting Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, that Zelenskyy later described as "constructive". 


Speaking to reporters later that day, Zelenskyy insisted that any peace deal "should be just" for Ukrainians, "so that Russia and Putin or any other aggressors will not have the opportunity to return." 


In a separate social media update Sunday, Zelenskyy asserted that Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since Moscow's all-out invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, while a further 370,000 have been wounded. 


Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to publish official casualty figures, but Western officials have said that the past few months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and wounded each month.

## World's oldest-known wild bird lays egg in Hawaii at age 74

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials said. 


The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week. 


Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate for life and lay one egg per year. But Akeakamai has not been seen for several years, and Wisdom began interacting with another male when she returned last week, officials said. 


“We are optimistic that the egg will hatch,” Jonathan Plissner, supervisory wildlife biologist at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, said in a statement. Every year, millions of seabirds return to the refuge to nest and raise their young. 


Albatross parents take turns incubating an egg for about two months. Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They spend most of their lives flying over the ocean and feeding on squid and fish eggs. 


Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956 and has raised as many as 30 chicks, Plissner said. 


The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 68 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

## As data centers proliferate, conflict with local communities follows

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA — Richard Andre Newman thought he would live the rest of his life in his quiet, leafy neighborhood in suburban Virginia. He was born and raised in Bren Mar Park, where children ride their bikes and neighbors wave hello.


But now, as he's approaching 60, he's considering selling his Fairfax County home and moving away. That's because he's getting a new neighbor: Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.


Newman feels helpless to stop it.


"I planned on staying here until I died," he said, "until this came up."


The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.


Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies. But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.


Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to homes.


"All that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn't run residents away from their homes," he said.


Dotting the hills in Northern Virginia


In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular Washington & Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation's capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro.


Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners association in the community.


The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction and electrical jobs to build the facility.


Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022, hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green space.


But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for the Plaza 500 project.


When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under the old rules.


Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.


A spokesperson for the firm declined to respond to questions for this story.


"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue," Ray said, "has any chance to go up against the data center industry."


Local leaders say data centers a financial boon


For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's existing data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech companies that own them in 2023.


For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs — often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000 residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.


Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.


"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture," Smith said. "Data centers are not going away."


Amazon data centers welcomed by some in Oregon 


On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.


Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another $1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023.


That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras, and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things.


Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals. Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint against them.


Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the relationships between the company and local officials, and raised eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers.


Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River.


The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a commissioner. "They said, 'Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what you need. Tell us what we can do for you,'" Doherty recalled. Other former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS didn't ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy.


"We engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a community's goals," said Kevin Miller, AWS' Vice President of global data centers. "This helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good neighbors."


Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of AWS-suited lawyers.


"We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off," said Lindsay. "But there were better deals to be made."


Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer and Police Chief Rick Stokoe say their direct line to AWS allows them to get the most out of the company.


"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS," said Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement. Both Keefer and Stokoe have been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks for AWS.


"These companies would not be here if they weren't getting some kind of incentive," Stokoe said. "There wouldn't be any money to talk about."

## White House on guard against Islamic State resurgence in Syria

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — The White House said Saturday that U.S. priorities in Syria now are to ensure the country's conflict does not encourage a resurgence of the Islamic State militant group or lead to a "humanitarian catastrophe."


U.S. President Joe Biden and his team are monitoring the "extraordinary events in Syria" are in touch with regional partners, the White House said on Saturday.


"President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with regional partners," the White House said in a statement.


Spillover "is a concern," said national security adviser Jake Sullivan, with particular worry about the so-called Islamic State, also known as ISIS.


In previous phases of Syria's long-running civil war, "at its worst, we saw the explosion of ISIS onto the scene," he said at a conference in Simi Valley, California run by the Reagan National Defense Forum.


The main priority is to ensure "that the fighting in Syria not lead to a resurgence of ISIS," Sullivan said. "We are going to take steps ourselves, directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds, to ensure that does not happen."


The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria, including U.S. forces working with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group, according to The Associated Press.


Gen. Bryan Fenton, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, told the AP he would not want to speculate on how the upheaval in Syria would affect the U.S. military’s footprint in the country. "It’s still too early to tell," he said.


What would not change is the focus on disrupting IS operations in Syria and protecting U.S. troops, Fenton said during a panel at the Reagan event.


Rebel forces are in the midst of a lightning offensive and say they have begun to encircle Syria's capital, Damascus.


Sullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure allies Israel, Jordan, Iraq and others in the region, "who would potentially face spillover effects from Syria, are strong and secure, and we're in touch with them every day."


Washington is also alert to stopping a "humanitarian catastrophe, both in terms of civilians, access to life-saving necessities, and in terms of the protection of religious and ethnic minorities in Syria," Sullivan said.


"Of course, an event like this happens and ISIS immediately looks to take advantage. We have seen reports of ISIS trying ... to reconstitute to a certain extent."


So the United States will seek to "contain the potential violence and instability," protect allies and ensure that ISIS not "get new oxygen out of this" that could lead them to threaten US or allies' interests, Sullivan added.


Sullivan's remarks come as Washington prepares for a transition of power next month back to former president Donald Trump, who defeated Biden in November's election.


Trump, who visited Paris on Saturday, warned against US involvement in Syria, saying the country is "a mess" and "not our friend."


"THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT," Trump said on his Truth Social platform.


Sullivan, addressing Trump's remarks, agreed, saying "the United States is not going to... militarily dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war."


Some material for this report came from The Associated Press.

## US House to vote to provide $3 billion to remove Chinese telecoms equipment

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote next week on an annual defense bill that includes just over $3 billion for U.S. telecom companies to remove equipment made by Chinese telecoms firms Huawei and ZTE 000063.SZ from American wireless networks to address security risks.


The 1,800-page text was released late Saturday and includes other provisions aimed at China, including requiring a report on Chinese efforts to evade U.S. national security regulations and an intelligence assessment of the current status of China's biotechnology capabilities.


The Federal Communications Commission has said removing the insecure equipment is estimated to cost $4.98 billion but Congress previously only approved $1.9 billion for the "rip and replace" program.


Washington has aggressively urged U.S. allies to purge Huawei and other Chinese gear from their wireless networks.


FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel last week again called on the U.S. Congress to provide urgent additional funding, saying the program to replace equipment in the networks of 126 carriers faces a $3.08 billion shortfall "putting both our national security and the connectivity of rural consumers who depend on these networks at risk."


She has warned the lack of funding could result in some rural networks shutting down, which "could eliminate the only provider in some regions" and could threaten 911 service.


Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan on Saturday praised the announcement, saying "funding is desperately needed to fulfill the mandate to remove and replace covered equipment and services while maintaining connectivity for tens of millions of Americans."


In 2019, Congress told the FCC to require U.S. telecoms carriers that receive federal subsidies to purge their networks of Chinese telecoms equipment. The White House in 2023 asked for $3.1 billion for the program.


Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said funding for the program and up to $500 million for regional tech hubs will be covered by funds generated from a one-time spectrum auction by the FCC for advanced wireless spectrum in the band known as AWS-3 to help meet rising spectrum demands of wireless consumers.

## Pearl Harbor survivors, ages 104 and 102, return to Hawaii for attack anniversary

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII — Ira "Ike" Schab, a 104-year-old Pearl Harbor attack survivor, was so determined to stand and salute during a remembrance ceremony honoring those killed in the Japanese bombing that thrust the U.S. into World War II some 83 years ago that he spent six weeks in physical therapy to build the strength to do so.


On Saturday, Schab gingerly rose from his wheelchair and raised his right hand, returning a salute delivered by sailors on a destroyer and a submarine passing by in the harbor. His son and a daughter supported him from either side.


"I was honored to do it. I’m glad I was capable of standing up," he said afterward. "I’m getting old, you know."


Schab is one of only two servicemen who lived through the attack who made it to an annual observance hosted by the U.S. Navy and National Park Service on a grass field overlooking the harbor. A third survivor had been planning to join them but had to cancel because of health issues.


The December 7, 1941, bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900 Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel.


Dozens of survivors once joined the event but their attendance has declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000 military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack.


Schab agreed when ceremony organizers asked him earlier this year to salute on behalf of all survivors and World War II veterans.


"He’s been working hard, because this is his goal," said his daughter Kimberlee Heinrichs, who traveled to Hawaii with Schab from their Beaverton, Oregon, home. "He wanted to be able to stand for that."


Schab was a sailor on the USS Dobbin at the time of the attack, serving as the tuba player in the ship's band. He had showered and put on a clean uniform when he heard the call for a fire rescue party.


He hurried topside to see Japanese planes flying overhead and the USS Utah capsizing. He quickly went back below deck to join a daisy chain of sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun topside.




Ken Stevens, 102, who served on the USS Whitney, joined Schab at the ceremony. USS Curtiss sailor Bob Fernandez, 100, was unable to come due to health issues.


Attendees observed a moment of silence at 7:54 a.m., the same time the attack began eight decades ago. F-22 jets in missing man formation flew overhead shortly after.


Fernandez, speaking in a phone interview from California, where he lives with his nephew in Lodi, recalled feeling shocked and surprised as the attack began.


"When those things go off like that, we didn’t know what’s what," Fernandez said. "We didn’t even know we were in a war."


Fernandez was a mess cook on the Curtiss and his job that morning was to bring sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast. Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly by.


Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing 12.7-centimeter, 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to the ship's guns.


He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above.


"I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going on," Fernandez said.


The ship's guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber that then slammed into the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command.


Fernandez's ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured.


Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn’t view himself that way.


"I’m not a hero," he said. "I’m just nothing but an ammunition passer."

## Garland’s ruby slippers from 'The Wizard of Oz' auctioned for $28M

date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA

MINNEAPOLIS — A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz and stolen from a museum nearly two decades ago fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday.


Heritage Auctions had estimated that they would fetch $3 million or more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55 million, or $1.91 million including the buyer's premium, a commission that the buyer pays, said Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the Dallas-based auction house. More than 800 people were tracking the slippers, and the company's web page for the auction had hit nearly 43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.


As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, The Ruby Slippers of Oz, puts it, the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen "more twists and turns than the Yellow Brick Road."


They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum’s door and display case.


Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.


His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off "one last score" after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence — a person who buys stolen goods — later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how.


The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty.


The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had lent them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, "There’s no place like home."


Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to help the museum purchase the slippers.


The Wizard of Oz story has gained new attention in recent weeks with the release of the movie Wicked, an adaptation of the megahit Broadway musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked Witch of the West.


The auction also included other memorabilia from The Wizard of Oz, such as a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked Witch of the West.
