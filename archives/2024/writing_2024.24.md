<p>For an author who once seemed an icon of the 1960s, Peter S. Beagle is quite a survi­vor. While on the one hand he’s revisited the beloved worlds of <strong>The Innkeeper’s Song </strong>and <strong>The Last Unicorn </strong>(most recently with last year’s <strong>The Way Home</strong>), he also has produced a series of extraordinarily graceful  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/06/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-im-afraid-youve-got-dragons-by-peter-s-beagle/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

**@Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky** (date: 2024-06-09, from: Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky)

For the record, while art is subjective, the Barry Windsor Smith inked pages of Jack Kirby's  Captain America's Bicentennial Battles are the most beautiful handful of comics pages of their era, combining Kirby's glorious power with BWS at his PRB Red Nails period best.

## LuxCon 2024

date: 2024-06-09, from: Locus Magazine

<p>LuxCon, which celebrated its tenth anniversary this year, is a large comicon-like festival in Luxembourg, Europe’s ‘‘seventh smallest country.’’ It did make me wish to visit a convention in Liechtenstein next, just for comparison! While the main attraction of the festival is its truly impressive cosplay display, it is also home to numerous roleplay­ing and board game en­thusiasts, with a large dealers’ room. Some of the merchandise, such as those  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/06/luxcon-2024/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>Malka Older follows up her cozy science fiction mystery <strong>The Mimicking of Known Successes </strong>with the equally cozy science fiction mystery <strong>The Imposition of Unnecessary Obstacles</strong>. Mossa and Pleiti are still together, although struggling just a bit with long distance due to Investigator Mossa’s job. Valdegeld University is still a bit of a hotbed  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/06/colleen-mondor-reviews-the-imposition-of-unnecessary-obstacles-by-malka-older/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
