## What Deadpool director Tim Miller transferred from Love, Death &#038; Robots to Secret Level

date: 2024-12-18, updated: 2024-12-17, from: Polygon Website

It’s hard to find a pat, elevator-pitch narrative in Tim Miller’s career. Is he best described as a visual effects guy who graduated to directing movies with Deadpool and Terminator: Dark Fate? Or an animator whose short projects got him into effects work on games? Or a studio founder who parlayed his video game experience [&#8230;]

## Sonic 3 is a speedrun through the franchise scrapyard, yet it works

date: 2024-12-18, updated: 2024-12-18, from: Polygon Website

Though the three Sonic the Hedgehog movies have charms of their own, they’ve also clearly benefited from a confluence of lucky breaks in order to reach their rarefied beloved-franchise status. The generally poor track record of previous video game adaptations; the release of the first movie before COVID closed theaters and the second one not [&#8230;]

## Fellow Helldivers 2 players, I think Super Earth might be fibbing about the Illuminate

date: 2024-12-17, updated: 2024-12-18, from: Polygon Website

It’s a tumultuous time to be a Helldiver. Not only are the cowardly Illuminate back after a century-long disappearance, but they’re kidnapping Super Earth citizens and turning them into horrifying monsters known as the Voteless.

## Secret Level’s Outer Worlds episode is missing a key part of the game

date: 2024-12-17, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Polygon Website

If The Outer Worlds could be summed up in three words, I’d go with “capitalism is bad.” That message is dressed up with silly mascot costumes, over-the-top advertising, and cheeky dialogue, but once you scratch at that silliness, the satire becomes quite clear. The Secret Level animated anthology spends one episode in this world, following [&#8230;]

Viper Napuatzi is a boss in Path of Exile 2’s third act. Located in Utzaal, Napuatzi deploys a variety of poison attacks in an extremely small arena, forcing you into a claustrophobic fight.

## Campaign board games are shrinking, and it’s for the better

Back in May of 2023, I wrote this editorial sharing a frustration with the board gaming trend of adopting extremely lengthy multi-session campaigns.

## ​​​​Windblown uses friendship to get around roguelike dread

Almost invariably, I reach a point with games like Balatro, Dead Cells, or Hades when, watching my playtime balloon, I feel the need to remove the temptation to play the game.
