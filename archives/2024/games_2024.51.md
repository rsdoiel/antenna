## The best new tabletop RPG books of 2024

date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Polygon Website

Dungeons &#38; Dragons celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, a major milestone not just for Wizards of the Coast but for the entire tabletop role-playing game industry. Even as Wizards sought to simultaneously take a victory lap and secure D&#38;D’s dominance by releasing new core rulebooks, other publishers looked back to the hobby’s history to [&#8230;]

## Campaign board games are shrinking, and it’s for the better

date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Polygon Website

Step Up is more than just the franchise that minted Channing Tatum as a star. It’s more, even, than a franchise that gave us a gem of a sequel subhed. It is also the movie that gave us Jon M. Chu, director of Crazy Rich Asians, In the Heights, and the recent box-office smash hit [&#8230;]

## J.R.R. Tolkien was fine with leaving War of the Rohirrim’s story untold

date: 2024-12-15, updated: 2024-12-13, from: Polygon Website

For Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, screenwriter Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Fran Walsh took on the task of translating three expansive novels into three live-action movies. With the anime movie The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, Boyens and her co-writers took on a radically different challenge: expanding two pages [&#8230;]

## The best audiobooks to listen to right now

date: 2024-12-15, updated: 2024-12-15, from: Polygon Website

Few things are better than settling down with a good book, but sometimes the settling is easier said than done. Between a long commute, making dinner, or just getting some fresh air outside, there are some times that a traditional book (or even an e-reader) just won’t cut it. For all those times, there’s no [&#8230;]

## ​​​​Windblown uses friendship to get around roguelike dread

date: 2024-12-15, updated: 2024-12-13, from: Polygon Website

I have a confession: I’m a rampant roguelike uninstaller. Almost invariably, I reach a point with games like Balatro, Dead Cells, or Hades when, watching my playtime balloon, I feel the need to remove the temptation to play the game. Roguelikes, almost by definition, pursue an addictive structure that reviewers often describe as the “one [&#8230;]
