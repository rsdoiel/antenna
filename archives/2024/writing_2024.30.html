<p>John and Craig finally become writing partners and edit the opening
to one chapter of the upcoming Scriptnotes book live on-air. They
wrestle with word choices, adapting the phrasing of a spoken
conversation and finding a unified voice as they pass the keyboard back
and forth. We also catch up Craig on what he’s missed […] The post

Much like time travel, the multiverse, as a scientifi­cally originated
but unproven theory, can be used as a narrative conceit with varying
degrees of rigour. For every <strong>Timescape </strong>a <strong>Doctor
Who</strong>; for every <strong>Anathem </strong>an <strong>Everything
Everywhere All at Once</strong>. I don’t think a work’s placement on
this spectrum is a predictor of its quality, but

I was surprised to discover that there are few novels, vintage or
contemporary, set on the Trans-Siberian Express. There are plenty of
memoirs and travel guides, but, unlike the Orient Express, with its
Agatha Christies and Graham Greenes, very little fiction. The irony is
that Sarah Brook’s eerie debut novel, <strong>The Cautious </strong>

Author Joma West explores the idea of parallel worlds in an unexpected
way in her science fic­tion novel, <strong>Twice Lived</strong>. Canna
and Lily are one person, a ‘‘shifter’’ who uncontrollably moves back and
forth between the two worlds. Her mothers detected her nature when they
were pregnant, as the fetus would disappear and reappear
