Americans consume at least some local crime news — but TV news watchers
probably see the most</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>When’s the last time you consumed local news about crime, and how did
it make you feel? For me, it was last Thursday, after a colleague shared
a Boston Globe story about a horrifying development in a horrifying
case. The lede alone, not to mention the damning details meticulously
reported by Laura Crimaldi and her…</p>

California’s local news agreement with Google is a win</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>If you’ve been following the great debate over how the state of
California should step in to aid its dwindling local news force — down

early 2023, now seems settled — by an actual legislation-avoiding
settlement agreed to by Google and Governor Gavin Newsom…</p>

a tech tax be a fair way to make Google and Meta pay for the news they
distribute and profit from?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>As the News Media Bargaining Code agreements in Australia start to
wind down, there is discussion about what will come next. Media academic
Andrea Carson calls the codes, passed in 2021, “world-first” legislation
because Australia was the first country to use competition law to get
Google and Meta to pay news publishers for the news…</p>
