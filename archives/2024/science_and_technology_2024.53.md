## Running NetBSD 10.1 on a 1998 Toshiba laptop

date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News

Here are my notes on running NetBSD 10.1 on my first personal laptop that I still keep, a 1998 i586 Toshiba Satellite Pro with 81Mb of RAM and a 1Gb IBM 2.5&#8243; IDE HD. In summary, the latest NetBSD runs well on this old hardware using an IDE to CF adapter and several changes to the i386 GENERIC kernel. ↫ Joel P. I don&#8217;t think the BSD world &#8211; and NetBSD in particular &#8211; gets enough recognition for supporting both weird architectures and old hardware as well as it does. This here is a 26 year old laptop running the latest version of NetBSD, working X11 server and all, while other operating systems drop support for devices only a few years old. So many devices could be saved from toxic landfills if only more people looked beyond Windows and macOS.

## It's only a matter of time before LLMs jump start supply-chain attacks

date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: The Register (UK I.T. News)

<h4>&#39;The greatest concern is with spear phishing and social engineering&#39;</h4> <p><strong>Interview</strong>  Now that criminals have realized there&#39;s no need to train their own LLMs for any nefarious purposes - it&#39;s much cheaper and easier to steal credentials and then jailbreak existing ones - the threat of a large-scale supply chain attack using generative AI becomes more real.…</p>
