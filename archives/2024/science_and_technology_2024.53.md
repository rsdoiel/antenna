## The First Ever Times Square Ball Drop Was Held Atop the New York Times Headquarters in 1907, Starting a Cherished Tradition

## Chimera Linux enters beta

date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News

We&#8217;ve talked about Chimera Linux before &#8211; it&#8217;s a unique Linux distribution that combines a BSD userland with the LLVM/Clang toolchain, and musl. Its init system is dinit, and it uses apk-tools from Alpine as its package manager. None of this has anything to do with being anti-anything; the choice of BSD&#8217;s tools and userland is mostly technical in nature. Chimera Linux is available for x86-64, AArch64, RISC-V, and POWER (both little and big endian). I am unreasonably excited for Chimera Linux, for a variety of reasons &#8211; first, I love the above set of choices they made, and second, Chimera Linux&#8217; founder and lead developer, q66, is a well-known and respected name in this space. She not only founded Chimera Linux, but also used to maintain the POWER/PowerPC ports of Void Linux, which is the port of Void Linux I used on my POWER9 hardware. She apparently also contributed quite a bit to Enlightenment, and is currently employed by Igalia, through which she can work on Chimera. With the description out of the way, here&#8217;s the news: Chimera Linux has officially entered beta. Today we have updated apk-tools to an rc tag. With this, the project is now entering beta phase, after around a year and a half. In general, this does not actually mean much, as the project is rolling release and updates will simply keep coming. It is more of an acknowledgement of current status, though new images will be released in the coming days. ↫ Chimera Linux&#8217;s website Despite my excitement, I haven&#8217;t yet tried Chimera Linux myself, as I figured its pre-beta stage wasn&#8217;t meant for an idiot like me who can&#8217;t contribute anything meaningful, and I&#8217;d rather not clutter the airwaves. Now that it&#8217;s entered beta, I feel like the time is getting riper and riper for me to dive in, and perhaps write about it here. Since the goal of Chimera Linux is to be a general-purpose distribution, I think I&#8217;m right in the proper demographic of users. It helps that I&#8217;m about to set up my dual-processor POWER9 machine again, and I think I&#8217;ll be going with Chimera Linux. As a final note, you may have noticed I consistently refer to it as &#8220;Chimera Linux&#8221;. This is very much on purpose, as there&#8217;s also something called ChimeraOS, a more standard Linux distribution aimed at gaming. To avoid confusion, I figured I&#8217;d keep the naming clear and consistent.

## Running NetBSD 10.1 on a 1998 Toshiba laptop

date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News

Here are my notes on running NetBSD 10.1 on my first personal laptop that I still keep, a 1998 i586 Toshiba Satellite Pro with 81Mb of RAM and a 1Gb IBM 2.5&#8243; IDE HD. In summary, the latest NetBSD runs well on this old hardware using an IDE to CF adapter and several changes to the i386 GENERIC kernel. ↫ Joel P. I don&#8217;t think the BSD world &#8211; and NetBSD in particular &#8211; gets enough recognition for supporting both weird architectures and old hardware as well as it does. This here is a 26 year old laptop running the latest version of NetBSD, working X11 server and all, while other operating systems drop support for devices only a few years old. So many devices could be saved from toxic landfills if only more people looked beyond Windows and macOS.
