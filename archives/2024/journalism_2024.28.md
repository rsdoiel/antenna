date: 2024-07-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In 2019, the four largest public radio stations in Texas teamed up with NPR to establish a collaborative statewide newsroom. When that collaboration was first announced, NPR specified reporting goals including “increas[ing] coverage of statewide issues and boost[ing] reporting from underserved regions.” But the vision for this experiment was always much bigger than Texas: By...

## The Copa, Euro, and Wimbledon finals collide on July 14. Here’s how The Athletic is preparing for its “biggest day ever.”

date: 2024-07-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

For fans of international sports, this has been the summer of decadence. June was bookended by the T20 Cricket World Cup, which — thanks in part to the U.S. team’s stunning upset over Pakistan — seemed to finally put the sport on Americans’ radars. The European Championship and Copa América kicked off halfway through the...

## Making sense of science: Using LLMs to help reporters understand complex research

date: 2024-07-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

During the news gathering process, reporters can often struggle with understanding complex, jargon-heavy documents, particularly in fields like science and technology. For instance, a tech reporter trying to write a story about a new study about AI may encounter difficulty making sense of specialized terms and concepts from the field. This can create friction during...

In the two years that The New York Times executive editor Joe Kahn has been on the job, there&#8217;s been a firehose flow of challenges to tackle.

## Are you willing to pay for CNN.com? Prepare to be asked before year’s end

date: 2024-07-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Paying for CNN is not something people are used to. Let me rephrase that: Directly paying for CNN is not something people are used to. For decades, an overwhelming majority of American households paid for cable or satellite service, and an opaque slice of that monthly charge — around $1 or so — found its...

## Errol Morris on whether you should be afraid of generative AI in documentaries

date: 2024-07-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Errol Morris is used to being called a liar, a trickster, and a manipulator. Over his storied four-decade career, Morris told me these insults have been hurled at him again and again — often, because of how he chooses to illustrate real life events. Today, The Thin Blue Line, Morris’ investigation into the shooting of...

One night in May, reporter Eddie Kim went for a walk in San Francisco. Kim, a news reporter for Gazetteer SF, wanted to retrace the steps of a tech company founder who tweeted that a two-mile walk from SoMa to Hayes Valley was “the sketchiest walk of my life.” (The tweet&#8217;s been viewed more than...

## “Poetjournalism” slouches forth from Michigan to be born

date: 2024-07-08, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

For Aaron Dworkin, poet, news is not that far from his butter and bread of verse. Instead, he says, they’re siblings, of a kind. Combined, they make a form anew, one which he calls (and here one must break the meter) “Poetjournalism.” “I was thinking I had another poetry collection in me, but I wanted...

## If Meta bans news in Australia, what will happen? Canada’s experience is telling

date: 2024-07-08, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

At an Australian parliamentary hearing last month, Meta once again suggested it could ban links to news on Facebook and Instagram in Australia. This would repeat the ban it enacted for more than a week in February 2021. That ban was in response to the introduction of the News Media Bargaining Code, an Australian law...
