viewing Hurricane Milton damage in Florida; Harris plans to go to church
in North Carolina</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday is surveying the
devastation inflicted on Florida’s Gulf Coast by Hurricane Milton as he
urges Congress to approve additional emergency disaster funding. Vice
President Kamala Harris will spend a second day in North Carolina,
hard-hit by Hurricane Helene, to attend a Black church and hold a
campaign rally.</p>
<p>Biden’s visit to the St. Petersburg area offers him another chance to
press House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for congressional approval of
more aid money before the Nov. 5 election. Johnson has said the issue
will be dealt with after then.</p>
<p>“I think Speaker Johnson is going to get the message that he’s got to
step up, particularly for small businesses,” Biden told reporters as he
and Harris met with aides on Friday to discuss the federal response to
Hurricanes Milton and Helene. Biden and Johnson have yet to discuss the
matter directly.</p>
<p>In Florida, Biden was set to announce $612 million for six Department
of Energy projects in areas affected by the hurricanes to improve the
resilience of the region’s electric grid, the White House said. The
funding includes $94 million for two projects in Florida: $47 million
for Gainesville Regional Utilities and $47 million for Switched Source
to partner with Florida Power and Light.</p>
<p>Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, visited Raleigh on
Saturday to meet with Black elected and religious leaders and help
volunteers package personal care items for delivery to victims of Helene
in the western part of the state.</p>
<p>She was spending Sunday in Greenville, with plans to speak during a
church service as part of her campaign’s “Souls to the Polls” effort to
help turn out Black churchgoers before Election Day. She was also
scheduled to hold a rally to talk about her economic plans and highlight
Thursday’s start of early voting in the state, her campaign said.</p>
<p>Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will spend the
coming week campaigning in the competitive states of Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina, according to a Harris campaign
official who was not authorized to publicly discuss details not yet made
public and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>With less than four weeks to go before Election Day, the hurricanes
have added another dimension to the closely contested presidential
race.</p>
<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said the Biden
administration’s storm response had been lacking, particularly in North
Carolina after Hurricane Helene. Biden and Harris have hammered Trump
for promoting falsehoods about the federal response.</p>
<p>Trump made a series of false claims after Helene struck in late
September, including incorrectly saying that the federal government is
intentionally withholding aid to Republican disaster victims. He also
falsely claimed the Federal Emergency Management Agency had run out of
money because all of it had gone to programs for immigrants in the
country illegally.</p>
<p>Biden said Trump was “not singularly” to blame for the spread of
false claims in recent weeks but that he has the “biggest mouth.”</p>
<p>The president is pressing for swift action by Congress to make sure
the Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to
get through hurricane season, which ends Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. He
said Friday that Milton alone had caused an estimated $50 billion in
damages.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said last week that
FEMA will be able to meet “immediate needs” caused by the two storms.
But he warned in the aftermath of Helene that the agency does not have
enough funding to make it through the hurricane season.</p>
<p>But Johnson has pushed back, saying the agencies have enough money
for the time being and that lawmakers will address the funding issue
during the lame-duck session after the election.</p>
<p>Also percolating in the background are tensions between Harris and
Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla. As Helene barreled toward Florida, the two
traded accusations that the other was trying to politicize the federal
storm response.</p>
<p>Harris’ office last week suggested that DeSantis was dodging her
phone calls. DeSantis responded that he was unaware she had called and
he grumbled that she hadn’t been involved in the federal government’s
response before she became the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>Biden, for his part, said he hoped to see DeSantis on Sunday, if the
governor’s schedule permitted.</p>
<p>“He’s been very cooperative,” Biden said about DeSantis. He added,
“We got on very, very well.”</p>
<p>DeSantis said Saturday that he had no details about the president’s
visit.</p>
<p>Biden was scheduled to survey damage during an aerial tour between
Tampa and St. Pete Beach, where he will be briefed on the storm by
federal, state and local officials. He also will residents and first
responders.</p>
<p>Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida as a Category 3 storm on
Wednesday evening. At least 10 people were killed and hundreds of
thousands of residents remain without power.</p>
<p>Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for widespread
evacuations. The still-fresh devastation wrought by Helene just two
weeks earlier probably helped compel many people to flee.</p>

id="nasas-europa-clipper-spacecraft-will-scour-jupiter-moon-for-ingredients-for-life">NASA’s
Europa Clipper spacecraft will scour Jupiter moon for ingredients for
life</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A NASA spacecraft is ready to set sail for
Jupiter and its moon Europa, one of the best bets for finding life
beyond Earth.</p>
<p>Europa Clipper will peer beneath the moon’s icy crust where an ocean
is thought to be sloshing fairly close to the surface. It won’t search
for life, but rather determine whether conditions there could support
it. Another mission would be needed to flush out any microorganisms
lurking there.</p>
<p>“It’s a chance for us to explore not a world that might have been
habitable billions of years ago, but a world that might be habitable
today — right now,” said program scientist Curt Niebur.</p>
<p>Its massive solar panels make Clipper the biggest craft built by NASA
to investigate another planet. It will take 5 1/2 years to reach Jupiter
and will sneak within 16 miles (25 kilometers) of Europa’s surface —
considerably closer than any other spacecraft.</p>
<p>Liftoff is targeted for this month aboard SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy
rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Mission cost: $5.2 billion.</p>
<p>Europa, the superstar among Jupiter’s many moons</p>
<p>One of Jupiter’s 95 known moons, Europa is almost the size of our own
moon. It’s encased in an ice sheet estimated to be 10 miles to 15 miles
or more (15 kilometers to 24 kilometers) thick. Scientists believe this
frozen crust hides an ocean that could be 80 miles (120 kilometers) or
more deep. The Hubble Space Telescope has spotted what appear to be
geysers erupting from the surface. Discovered by Galileo in 1610, Europa
is one of the four so-called Galilean moons of Jupiter, along with
Ganymede, Io and Callisto.</p>
<p>Seeking conditions that support life</p>
<p>What type of life might Europa harbor? Besides water, organic
compounds are needed for life as we know it, plus an energy source. In
Europa’s case that could be thermal vents on the ocean floor. Deputy
project scientist Bonnie Buratti imagines any life would be primitive
like the bacterial life that originated in Earth’s deep ocean vents. “We
will not know from this mission because we can’t see that deep,” she
said. Unlike missions to Mars where habitability is one of many
questions, Clipper’s sole job is to establish whether the moon could
support life in its ocean or possibly in any pockets of water in the
ice.</p>
<p>Supersized spacecraft</p>
<p>When its solar wings and antennas are unfurled, Clipper is about the
size of a basketball court — more than 100 feet (30 meters) end to end —
and weighs nearly 13,000 pounds (6,000 kilograms). The supersized solar
panels are needed because of Jupiter’s distance from the sun. The main
body — about the size of a camper — is packed with nine science
instruments, including radar that will penetrate the ice, cameras that
will map virtually the entire moon and tools to tease out the contents
of Europa’s surface and tenuous atmosphere. The name hearkens to the
swift sailing ships of centuries past.</p>
<p>Circling Jupiter to fly by Europa</p>
<p>The roundabout trip to Jupiter will span 1.8 billion miles (3 billion
kilometers). For extra oomph, the spacecraft will swing past Mars early
next year and then Earth in late 2026. It arrives at Jupiter in 2030 and
begins science work the next year. While orbiting Jupiter, it will cross
paths with Europa 49 times. The mission ends in 2034 with a planned
crash into Ganymede — Jupiter’s biggest moon and the solar system’s
too.</p>
<p>Europa flybys pose huge radiation risk</p>
<p>There’s more radiation around Jupiter than anywhere else in our solar
system, besides the sun. Europa passes through Jupiter’s bands of
radiation as it orbits the gas giant, making it especially menacing for
spacecraft. That’s why Clipper’s electronics are inside a vault with
dense aluminum and zinc walls. All this radiation would nix any life on
Europa’s surface. But it could break down water molecules and, perhaps,
release oxygen all the way down into the ocean that could possibly fuel
sea life.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, NASA was in a panic that the spacecraft’s many
transistors might not withstand the intense radiation. But after months
of analysis, engineers concluded the mission could proceed as
planned.</p>
<p>Other visitors to Jupiter and Europa</p>
<p>NASA’s twin Pioneer spacecraft and then two Voyagers swept past
Jupiter in the 1970s. The Voyagers provided the first detailed photos of
Europa but from quite a distance. NASA’s Galileo spacecraft had repeated
flybys of the moon during the 1990s, passing as close as 124 miles (200
kilometers). Still in action around Jupiter, NASA’s Juno spacecraft has
added to Europa’s photo album. Arriving at Jupiter a year after Clipper
will be the European Space Agency’s Juice spacecraft, launched last
year.</p>
<p>Ganymede and other possible ocean worlds</p>
<p>Like Europa, Jupiter’s jumbo moon Ganymede is thought to host an
underground ocean. But its frozen shell is much thicker — possibly 100
miles (160 kilometers) thick — making it tougher to probe the
environment below. Callisto’s ice sheet may be even thicker, possibly
hiding an ocean. Saturn’s moon Enceladus has geysers shooting up, but
it’s much farther than Jupiter. Ditto for Saturn’s moon Titan, also
suspected of having a subterranean sea. While no ocean worlds have been
confirmed beyond our solar system, scientists believe they’re out there
— and may even be relatively common.</p>
<p>Messages in a cosmic bottle</p>
<p>Like many robotic explorers before it, Clipper bears messages from
Earth. Attached to the electronics vault is a triangular metal plate. On
one side is a design labeled “water words” with representations of the
word for water in 104 languages. On the opposite side: a poem about the
moon by U.S. poet laureate Ada Limon and a silicon chip containing the
names of 2.6 million people who signed up to vicariously ride along.</p>

<h2 id="amazon-wants-to-be-everything-to-everyone">Amazon wants to be
everything to everyone</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mount Juliet, United States — Amazon is bolstering its e-commerce
empire while continuing a march deeper into people’s lives, from robots
to healthcare and entertainment.  </p>
<p>Innovations unveiled in recent days by the Seattle-based tech titan
included a delivery van computer system to shave time off deliveries by
its speed-obsessed logistics network.   </p>
<p>Amazon Stores boss Doug Herrington said that the technology enables
vans to recognize stops and signal which packages to drop off.  </p>
<p>“When we speed up deliveries, customers shop more,” Herrington
said.  </p>
<p>“For 2024, we’re going to have the fastest Prime delivery speeds
around the world,” he added, referring to Amazon’s subscription
service.  </p>
<p>On top of that, according to Herrington, Amazon last year managed to
cut 45 cents off the cost per unit shipped, a huge savings when
considering the massive volume of sales.  </p>
<p>Prime is the ‘glue’  </p>
<p>Amazon last year recorded profit of more than $30 billion on revenue
of $575 billion, powered by its online retail operation and its AWS
cloud computing division.  </p>
<p>“They have this whole flywheel model with Amazon Prime membership in
the middle,” said eMarketer analyst Suzy Davidkhanian.  </p>
<p>“That’s the glue that keeps everything together.”  </p>
<p>Businesses include retail, advertising, cloud computing and streamed
movies and music.  </p>
<p>But that very model has the 30-year-old company facing a US
government lawsuit, accused of expanding an illegal monopoly and
otherwise harming competition.   </p>
<p>Amazon makes money from data gathered about consumers, either by
targeting ads or through insights into what products they might like,
Davidkhanian said.  </p>
<p>That was why Amazon paid for expensive rights to stream NFL American
football games on Prime Video in a move that promises to help it
pinpoint fans of the sport.  </p>
<p>Amazon’s digital assistant Alexa can order items on command and has
been even built into appliances such as washing machines to let them
automatically buy supplies like laundry soap as needed.  </p>
<p>A ‘pocket pharmacy’  </p>
<p>Amazon showed off enhancements to its virtual health care service
called One Medical.  </p>
<p>For $9 a month Prime members are promised anytime access to video
consultations with health care professionals, along with record keeping
and drug prescriptions.  </p>
<p>An Amazon Pharmacy takes advantage of the company’s delivery network
to get prescriptions to patients quickly, striving for speeds of less
than 24 hours for 45 percent of customers by the end of next year.  </p>
<p>“We’re building a pharmacy in your pocket that offers rapid delivery
right to your door,” Amazon Pharmacy chief Hannah McClellan said,
referring to the option of using a smartphone app.  </p>
<p>The healthcare market promises to be lucrative for Amazon, which is
“trying to be the platform that has everything for everyone,” said
analyst Davidkhanian.  </p>
<p>Real world wrinkles  </p>
<p>Amazon has suffered setbacks when it comes to brick-and-mortar stores
but it continues to strive for a winning strategy.  </p>
<p>The company next year will open its first “automated micro warehouse”
in Pennsylvania, next to a Whole Foods Market organic grocery shop, the
chain it bought in 2017.  </p>
<p>People will be able to pick up certain items selected online, with
orders filled by robots, after shopping next door for fresh produce and
groceries.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amazon is ramping up use of artificial intelligence at its
online store with tools helping sellers describe and illustrate
products.  </p>
<p>Product labels will change according to the user, displaying terms
likely to catch their attention such as “strawberry flavor” for some and
“gluten-free” for others.   </p>
<p>“The things that Amazon is doing with AI are to make sure that you go
from researching something to making the purchase as quickly as
possible,” Davidkhanian said.  </p>
<p>At the logistics center near Nashville, robotic arms deftly placed
packages in carts that autonomously made their way to trucks.  </p>
<p>Logistics center automation improves safety and frees up workers for
more interesting tasks, according to Amazon robotics manager Julie
Mitchell.  </p>
<p>However, critics cite delivery speed pressure and other factors as
making Amazon warehouses more dangerous than the industry average.</p>

id="determination-to-rebuild-follows-floridas-hurricanes-with-acceptance-that-storms-will-come-again">Determination
to rebuild follows Florida’s hurricanes with acceptance that storms will
come again</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>VENICE, Fla — No sooner had residents of the Bahia Vista Gulf
condominium complex dug out and from Hurricane Helene than they were
faced with the same daunting cleanup from new damage inflicted by
Hurricane Milton.</p>
<p>The beachfront units had been gutted, treated and dried out after
Hurricane Helene and mounds of sand that had blown in from the beach had
been removed. Then, less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton barreled
in and undid all the progress.</p>
<p>“They’ve got to start the whole process over, cleaning, sanitizing,
bringing in drying equipment, getting them all dried and prepped for
renovations,” lamented Bill O’Connell, a board member at the complex in
Venice, about an hour’s drive south of Tampa. The second hurricane
“brought all the sand back on our property.”</p>
<p>Some longtime Floridians have grown accustomed to the annual cycle of
storms that can shatter and upend lives in a state known mostly for its
balmy weather, sunshine and beaches.</p>
<p>“It’s the price you pay to live in paradise,” O’Connell said. “If you
want to live here with this view, beautiful sunsets, be able to go out
on your boat, enjoy what Florida has to offer, you have to be willing to
accept that these storms are going to come.”</p>
<p>The devastation of the back-to-back storms is still being tallied as
a swath of the state comes to terms with damage from the unusual dual
strike of storms in such close proximity. Many residents, some returning
home after evacuating, spent much of Saturday searching for gas as a
fuel shortage gripped the state.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden planned to visit the Gulf Coast on Sunday.</p>
<p>Hurricane Milton killed at least 10 people after it made landfall as
a Category 3 storm, tearing across central Florida, flooding barrier
islands and spawning deadly tornadoes. Officials say the toll could have
been worse if not for the widespread evacuations. Overall, more than a
thousand people were rescued in the wake of the storm.</p>
<p>Disaster hits twice</p>
<p>In the fishing village of Cortez, a community of 4,100 southwest of
Tampa, Catherine Praught said she and her husband, Mark, felt “pure
panic” when Hurricane Milton menaced Cortez so soon after Helene,
forcing them to pause their cleanup and evacuate. Fortunately, their
home wasn’t damaged by the second storm.</p>
<p>“This is where we live,” Catherine Praught said of their low-lying
home of 36 years that had to be emptied, gutted and scrubbed after
Helene. “We’re just hopeful we get the insurance company to help
us.”</p>
<p>Residents of the community’s modest, single-story wood and
stucco-fronted cottages were working Saturday to remove broken furniture
and tree limbs, stacking the debris in the street much like they did
after Hurricane Helene.</p>
<p>A similar scene could be found in Steinhatchee, west of Gainsville,
where enormous piles of debris lined the streets.</p>
<p>Melissa Harden lives less than a block from a restaurant and
neighborhood bar that were reduced to rubble. Her house is on 16-foot
(4.9-meter) pilings, but 4 feet (1.2 meters) of water still flooded in.
When Milton was forecast, she feared Steinhatachee would be hit by the
third hurricane in 14 months.</p>
<p>“Personally, I thought, if it comes, we’re already evacuated and our
home is pretty messed up,” she said as friends and relatives helped with
the cleanup, removing bathroom fixtures and pulling out damaged boards.
“Of course we didn’t want it! No more storms!”</p>
<p>Moody’s Analytics on Saturday estimated economic costs from the storm
will range from $50 billion to $85 billion, including upwards of $70
billion in property damage and an economic output loss of up to $15
billion.</p>
<p>Widespread fuel shortage</p>
<p>In St. Petersburg, scores of people lined up at a station that had no
gas Saturday, hoping it would arrive soon. Among them was Daniel
Thornton and his 9-year-old daughter Magnolia, who arrived at 7 a.m. and
were still waiting four hours later.</p>
<p>“They told me they have gas coming but they don’t know when it’s
going to be here,” he said. “I have no choice. I have to sit here all
day with her until I get gas.”</p>
<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Saturday morning that the state
opened three fuel distribution sites and planned to open several more.
Residents can get 10 gallons (37.8 liters) each, free of charge, he
said.</p>
<p>“Obviously as power gets restored … and the Port of Tampa is open,
you’re going to see the fuel flowing. But in the meantime, we want to
give people another option,” DeSantis said.</p>
<p>Officials were replenishing area gas stations with the state’s fuel
stockpiles and provided generators to stations that remained without
power.</p>
<p>Rising rivers among the remaining safety threats</p>
<p>As the recovery continues, DeSantis has warned people to be cautious,
citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing
water. Some 1.1 million Floridians were still without power Saturday
night, according to Poweroutage.us.</p>
<p>National Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Close said rivers will
“keep rising” for the next several days and result in flooding, mostly
around Tampa Bay and northward. Those areas were hit by the most rain,
which comes on top of a wet summer that included several earlier
hurricanes.</p>
<p>“You can’t do much but wait,” Close said of the rivers cresting. “At
least there is no rain in the forecast, no substantial rain. So we have
a break here from all our wet weather.”</p>

<h2 id="hot-days-and-methamphetamine-are-now-deadlier-mix-in-us">Hot
days and methamphetamine are now deadlier mix in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX — On just one sweltering day during the hottest June on
record in Phoenix, a 38-year-old man collapsed under a freeway bridge
and a 41-year-old woman was found slumped outside a business. Both had
used methamphetamine before dying from an increasingly dangerous mix of
soaring temperatures and stimulants.</p>
<p>Meth is showing up more often as a factor in the deaths of people who
died from heat-related causes in the U.S., according to an Associated
Press analysis of data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Death certificates show about one in five heat-related
deaths in recent years involved methamphetamine. In Arizona, Texas,
Nevada and California, officials found the drug in nearly a third of
heat deaths in 2023.</p>
<p>Meth is more common in heat-related deaths than the deadly opioid
fentanyl. As a stimulant, it increases body temperature, impairs the
brain’s ability to regulate body heat and makes it harder for the heart
to compensate for extreme heat.</p>
<p>If hot weather has already raised someone’s body temperature,
consuming alcohol or opioids can exacerbate the physical effects, “but
meth would be the one that you would be most concerned about,” said Bob
Anderson, chief of statistical analysis at the National Center for
Health Statistics.</p>
<p>The trend has emerged as a synthetic drug manufactured south of the
border by Mexican drug cartels has largely replaced the domestic version
of meth fictionalized in the TV series Breaking Bad. Typically smoked in
a glass pipe, a single dose can cost as little as a few dollars.</p>
<p>At the same time, human-caused climate change has made it much easier
to die from heat-related causes in places like Phoenix, Las Vegas and
California’s southeastern desert. This has been Earth’s hottest summer
on record.</p>
<p>Phoenix baked in temperatures topping 37.7 Celsius for 113 straight
days and hit 47.2 Celsius in late September — uncharacteristic even for
a city synonymous with heat. The searing temperatures have carried into
October. </p>
<p>“Putting on a jacket can increase body temperature in a cold room. If
it’s hot outside, we can take off the jacket,” explained Rae Matsumoto,
dean of the Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy at the University of
Hawaii in Hilo. But people using the stimulant in the outdoor heat
“can’t take off the meth jacket.”</p>
<p>These fatalities are particularly prevalent in the Southwest, where
meth overdoses overall have risen since the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>In Maricopa County, America’s hottest major metropolitan area,
substances including street drugs, alcohol and certain prescription
medicines for psychiatric conditions and blood pressure control were
involved in about two-thirds, or 419 of the 645 heat-related deaths
documented last year. Meth was detected in about three-quarters of these
drug cases and was often the primary cause of death, public health data
show. Fentanyl was found in just under half of them.</p>
<p>In Pima County, home to Tucson, Arizona’s second most populous city,
methamphetamine was a factor in one-quarter of the 84 heat-related
deaths reported so far this year, the medical examiner’s office
said.</p>
<p>In metro Las Vegas, heat was a factor in 294 deaths investigated last
year by the Clark County coroner’s office, and 39% involved illicit and
prescription drugs and alcohol. Of those, meth was detected in
three-fourths.</p>
<p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration notes in its 2024 National
Drug Threat Assessment that 31% of all drug-related deaths in the U.S.
are now caused by stimulants that speed up the nervous system, primarily
meth. More than 17,000 people in the U.S. died from fatal overdoses and
poisonings related to stimulants in the first half of 2023, according to
preliminary CDC data.</p>
<p>Although overdoses have been more associated with opiates like
fentanyl, medical professionals say overdosing on meth is possible if a
large amount is ingested. Higher blood pressure and a quickened heart
rate can then provoke a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>“All of your normal physiological ways of coping with heat are
compromised with the use of methamphetamines,” said Dr. Aneesh Narang,
an emergency medicine physician at Banner University Medical Center in
downtown Phoenix.</p>
<p>Narang, who sits on a board that reviews overdose fatalities, said
the “vast majority” of the heat stroke patients seen in his hospital’s
emergency department this summer had used street drugs, most commonly
methamphetamine.</p>
<p>Because of its proximity to the U.S.-Mexico border, Phoenix is
considered a “source city” where large amounts of newly smuggled meth
are stored and packaged into relatively tiny doses for distribution,
said Det. Matt Shay, a narcotics investigator with the Maricopa County
Sheriff’s Office.</p>
<p>“It’s an amazing amount that comes in constantly every day,” Shay
said. “It’s also very cheap.”</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized about 74,000 kilograms of
meth at the U.S.-Mexico border this last fiscal year ending September
30, up from the 63,500 kilograms captured in the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>And sellers often target homeless people, Shay said.</p>
<p>“It’s a customer base that is easy to find and exploit,” Shay said.
“If you’re an enterprising young drug dealer, all you need is some type
of transportation and you just cruise around and they swarm your
car.”</p>
<p>Jason Elliott, a 51-year-old unemployed machinist, said he’s heard of
several heat-related deaths involving meth during his three years on the
streets in Phoenix.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty typical,” said Elliot, noting that stimulants enable
people to stay awake and alert to prevent being robbed in shelters or
outdoors. “What else can you do? You have stuff; you go to sleep, you
wake up and your stuff is gone.”</p>
<p>Dr. Nick Staab, assistant medical director of the Maricopa County
Department of Public Health, said brochures were printed this summer and
distributed in cooling centers to spread the word about the risk of
using stimulants and certain prescription medicines in extreme heat.</p>
<p>But it’s unclear how many are being reached. People who use drugs may
not be welcomed at some cooling centers. A better solution, according to
Stacey Cope, capacity building and education director for the harm
reduction nonprofit Sonoran Prevention Works, is to lower barriers to
entry so that people most at risk “are not expected to be absent from
drugs, or they’re not expected to leave during the hottest part of the
day.”</p>

hate against South Asian Americans rises steadily, report says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Online hate against Americans of South Asian ancestry
has risen steadily in 2023 and 2024 with the rise of politicians from
that community to prominence, according to a report released Wednesday
by nonprofit group Stop AAPI Hate.</p>
<p>Why it’s important</p>
<p>Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris is
of Indian descent, as are former Republican presidential candidates
Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy. Republican vice presidential candidate
JD Vance’s wife, Usha Vance, is also Indian American.</p>
<p>Harris faces Republican former President Donald Trump in the 2024
U.S. elections.</p>
<p>There has been a steady rise in anti-Asian hate in extremist online
spaces from January 2023 to August 2024, the report said.</p>
<p>The nonprofit group blamed the rise on a “toxic political climate in
which a growing number of leaders and far-right extremist voices
continue to spew bigoted political rhetoric and disinformation.”</p>
<p>Key quotes</p>
<p>“Online threats of violence towards Asian communities reached their
highest levels in August 2024, after Usha Vance appeared at the
Republican National Convention and Kamala Harris was declared a
presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention,” Stop AAPI
Hate said.</p>
<p>“The growing prevalence of anti-South Asian online hate … in 2023 and
2024 tracks with the rise in South Asian political representation this
election cycle,” it added.</p>
<p>By the numbers</p>
<p>Among Asian American subgroups, South Asian communities were targeted
with the highest volume of anti-Asian online hostility, with 60% of
slurs directed at them in that period, according to the report.</p>
<p>Anti-South Asian slurs in extremist online spaces doubled last year,
from about 23,000 to more than 46,000, and peaked in August 2024.</p>
<p>There are nearly 5.4 million people of South Asian descent living in
the United States, comprising of individuals with ancestry from nations
including India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p>

id="volunteers-bring-solar-power-to-hurricane-helenes-disaster-zone">Volunteers
bring solar power to Hurricane Helene’s disaster zone</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BAKERSVILLE, North Carolina — Nearly two weeks after Hurricane Helene
downed power lines and washed out roads all over North Carolina’s
mountains, the constant din of a gas-powered generator is getting to be
too much for Bobby Renfro.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to hear the nurses, neighbors and volunteers flowing
through the community resource hub he has set up in a former church for
his neighbors in Tipton Hill, a crossroads in the Pisgah National Forest
north of Asheville. Much worse is the cost: he spent $1,200 to buy it
and thousands more on fuel that volunteers drive in from Tennessee.</p>
<p>Turning off their only power source isn’t an option. This generator
runs a refrigerator holding insulin for neighbors with diabetes and
powers the oxygen machines and nebulizers some of them need to
breathe.</p>
<p>The retired railroad worker worries that outsiders don’t understand
how desperate they are, marooned without power on hilltops and down in
“hollers.”</p>
<p>“We have no resources for nothing,” Renfro said. “It’s going to be a
long ordeal.”</p>
<p>More than 43,000 of the 1.5 million customers who lost power in
western North Carolina still lacked electricity on Friday, according to
Poweroutage.us. Without it, they can’t keep medicines cold or power
medical equipment or pump well water. They can’t recharge their phones
or apply for federal disaster aid.</p>
<p>Crews from all over the country and even Canada are helping Duke
Energy and local electric cooperatives with repairs, but it’s slow going
in the dense mountain forests, where some roads and bridges are
completely washed away.</p>
<p>“The crews aren’t doing what they typically do, which is a repair
effort. They’re rebuilding from the ground up,” said Kristie Aldridge,
vice president of communications at North Carolina Electric
Cooperatives.</p>
<p>Residents who can get their hands on gas and diesel-powered
generators are depending on them, but that is not easy. Fuel is
expensive and can be a long drive away. Generator fumes pollute and can
be deadly. Small home generators are designed to run for hours or days,
not weeks and months.</p>
<p>Now, more help is arriving. Renfro received a new power source this
week, one that will be cleaner, quieter and free to operate. Volunteers
with the nonprofit Footprint Project and a local solar installation
company delivered a solar generator with six 245-watt solar panels, a
24-volt battery and an AC power inverter. The panels now rest on a
grassy hill outside the community building.</p>
<p>Renfro hopes his community can draw some comfort and security,
“seeing and knowing that they have a little electricity.”</p>
<p>The Footprint Project is scaling up its response to this disaster
with sustainable mobile infrastructure. It has deployed dozens of larger
solar microgrids, solar generators and machines that can pull water from
the air to 33 sites so far, along with dozens of smaller portable
batteries.</p>
<p>With donations from solar equipment and installation companies as
well as equipment purchased through donated funds, the nonprofit is
sourcing hundreds more small batteries and dozens of other larger
systems and even industrial-scale solar generators known as “Dragon
Wings.”</p>
<p>Will Heegaard and Jamie Swezey are the husband-and-wife team behind
Project Footprint. Heegaard founded it in 2018 in New Orleans with a
mission of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of emergency responses.
Helene’s destruction is so catastrophic, however, that Swezey said this
work is more about supplementing generators than replacing them.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Swezey said as she stared at a
whiteboard with scribbled lists of requests, volunteers and equipment.
“It’s all hands on deck with whatever you can use to power whatever you
need to power.”</p>
<p>Down near the interstate in Mars Hill, a warehouse owner let Swezey
and Heegaard set up operations and sleep inside. They rise each morning
triaging emails and texts from all over the region. Requests for
equipment range from individuals needing to power a home oxygen machine
to makeshift clinics and community hubs distributing supplies.</p>
<p>Local volunteers help. Hayden Wilson and Henry Kovacs, glassblowers
from Asheville, arrived in a pickup truck and trailer to make deliveries
this week. Two installers from the Asheville-based solar company
Sundance Power Systems followed in a van.</p>
<p>It took them more than an hour on winding roads to reach Bakersville,
where the community hub Julie Wiggins runs in her driveway supports
about 30 nearby families. It took many of her neighbors days to reach
her, cutting their way out through fallen trees. Some were so desperate
they stuck their insulin in the creek to keep it cold.</p>
<p>Panels and a battery from Footprint Project now power her small
fridge, a water pump and a Starlink communications system she set up.
“This is a game changer,” Wiggins said.</p>
<p>The volunteers then drove to Renfro’s hub in Tipton Hill before their
last stop at a Bakersville church that has been running two generators.
Other places are much harder to reach. Heegaard and Swezey even tried to
figure out how many portable batteries a mule could carry up a mountain
and have arranged for some to be lowered by helicopters.</p>
<p>They know the stakes are high after Heegaard volunteered in Puerto
Rico, where Hurricane Maria’s death toll rose to 3,000 as some mountain
communities went without power for 11 months. Duke Energy crews also
restored infrastructure in Puerto Rico and are using tactics learned
there, like using helicopters to drop in new electric poles, utility
spokesman Bill Norton said.</p>
<p>The hardest customers to help could be people whose homes and
businesses are too damaged to connect, and they are why the Footprint
Project will stay in the area for as long as they are needed, Swezey
said.</p>
<p>“We know there are people who will need help long after the power
comes back,” she said.</p>

id="widespread-fuel-shortage-hampers-floridas-hurricane-milton-cleanup">Widespread
fuel shortage hampers Florida’s Hurricane Milton cleanup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CORTEZ, Florida — Floridians recovering from Hurricane Milton, many
of whom were journeying home after fleeing hundreds of miles to escape
the storm, spent much of Saturday searching for gas as a fuel shortage
gripped the state.</p>
<p>In St. Petersburg, scores of people lined up at a station that had no
gas, hoping it would arrive soon. Among them was Daniel Thornton and his
9-year-old daughter Magnolia, who arrived at the station at 7 a.m. and
were still waiting four hours later.</p>
<p>“They told me they have gas coming but they don’t know when it’s
going to be here,” he said. “I have no choice. I have to sit here all
day with her until I get gas.”</p>
<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters Saturday morning that the state
opened three fuel distribution sites and planned to open several more.
Residents can get 37.85 liters each, free of charge, he said.</p>
<p>“Obviously as power gets restored … and the Port of Tampa is open,
you’re going to see the fuel flowing. But in the meantime, we want to
give people another option,” DeSantis said.</p>
<p>Officials were replenishing area gas stations with the state’s fuel
stockpiles and provided generators to stations that remained without
power.</p>
<p>Disaster hits twice</p>
<p>Those who reached home were assessing the damage and beginning the
arduous cleaning process. Some, like Bill O’Connell, a board member at
Bahia Vista Gulf in Venice, had thought they were done after the condo
association hired companies to gut, treat and dry the units following
Hurricane Helene. Milton undid that work and caused additional damage,
O’Connell said.</p>
<p>“It reflooded everything that was already flooded, brought all the
sand back on our property that we removed,” O’Connell said. “And also
did some catastrophic wind damage, ripped off many roofs and blew out a
lot of windows that caused more damage inside the units.”</p>
<p>The two hurricanes left a ruinous mess in the fishing village of
Cortez, a community of 4,100 along the northern edge of Sarasota Bay.
Residents of its modest, single-story wood and stucco-fronted cottages
were working to remove broken furniture and tree limbs, stacking the
debris in the street much like they did after Hurricane Helene.</p>
<p>“Everything is shot,” said Mark Praught, a retired street sweeper for
Manatee County, who saw 1.2-meter storm surges during Helene. “We’ll
replace the electrical and the plumbing and go from there.”</p>
<p>Praught and his wife, Catherine, have lived for 36 years in a
low-lying home that now looks like an empty shell. All the furniture had
to be discarded, the walls and the brick and tile floors had to be
scrubbed clean of muck, and drywall had to be ripped out.</p>
<p>Catherine Praught said they felt “pure panic” when Hurricane Milton
menaced Cortez so soon after Helene, forcing them to pause their cleanup
and evacuate. Fortunately, their home wasn’t damaged by the second
storm.</p>
<p>“This is where we live,” Catherine Praught said. “We’re just hopeful
we get the insurance company to help us.”</p>
<p>In Bradenton Beach, Jen Hilliard scooped up wet sand mixed with rocks
and tree roots and dumped the mixture into a wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>“This was all grass,” Hilliard said of the sandy mess beneath her
feet. “They’re going to have to make 500 trips of this.”</p>
<p>Hilliard, who moved to Florida six months ago and lives further
inland, said she was happy to pitch in and help clean up her friend’s
home a block from the shore in Bradenton Beach.</p>
<p>Furniture and household appliances sat outside alongside debris from
interior drywall that was removed after Helene sent several feet of
storm surge into the house. Inside, walls were gutted up to 1.2 meters,
exposing the beams underneath.</p>
<p>“You roll with the punches,” she said. “Community is the best part,
though. Everybody helping each other.”</p>
<p>Milton killed at least 10 people after it made landfall as a Category
3 storm, tearing across central Florida, flooding barrier islands and
spawning deadly tornadoes. Officials say the toll could have been worse
if not for the widespread evacuations.</p>
<p>Overall, more than a thousand people had been rescued in the wake of
the storm as of Saturday, DeSantis said.</p>
<p>Property damage and economic costs in the billions</p>
<p>On Sunday, President Joe Biden will survey the devastation inflicted
on Florida’s Gulf Coast by the hurricane. He said he hopes to connect
with DeSantis during the visit.</p>
<p>The trip offers Biden another opportunity to press Republican House
Speaker Mike Johnson to call lawmakers back to Washington to approve
more funding during their preelection recess. It’s something Johnson
says he won’t do.</p>
<p>Biden is making the case that Congress needs to act now to ensure the
Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to get
through hurricane season, which stretches through November in the
Atlantic.</p>
<p>DeSantis welcomed the federal government’s approval of a disaster
declaration announced Saturday and said he had gotten strong support
from Biden.</p>
<p>“He basically said, you know, you guys are doing a great job. We’re
here for you,” he said when asked about his conversations with Biden.
“We sent a big request and we got approved for what we wanted.”</p>
<p>Moody’s Analytics on Saturday estimated economic costs from the storm
will range from $50 billion to $85 billion, including upwards of $70
billion in property damage and an economic output loss of up to $15
billion.</p>
<p>Safety threats remain, including rising rivers</p>
<p>As the recovery continues, DeSantis has warned people to be cautious,
citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing
water. Some 1.3 million Floridians were still without power by Saturday
afternoon, according to poweroutage.us.</p>
<p>National Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Close said rivers will
“keep rising” for the next four or five days resulting in river
flooding, mostly around Tampa Bay and northward. Those areas were hit by
the most rain, which comes on top of a wet summer that included several
earlier hurricanes.</p>
<p>“You can’t do much but wait,” Close said of the rivers cresting. “At
least there is no rain in the forecast, no substantial rain. So we have
a break here from all our wet weather.”</p>

id="holding-super-bowl-outside-us-is-possible-says-nfls-commissioner">Holding
Super Bowl outside US is possible, says NFL’s commissioner</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>london — The National Football League’s aggressive international
growth plan could include holding a Super Bowl outside the United States
for the first time, Commissioner Roger Goodell said on Saturday. </p>
<p>Goodell has shot down the idea in the past, but he told a fan forum
in London that it’s a possibility. </p>
<p>“We’ve always traditionally tried to play a Super Bowl in an NFL city
— that was always sort of a reward for the cities that have NFL
franchises,” he said in response to a question about moving the
neutral-site game internationally. “But things change. It wouldn’t
surprise me at all if that happens one day.” </p>
<p>Goodell floated the idea as he outlined a plan that could include
playing 16 international games every year if the regular season expands
to 18 games. </p>
<p>He added that he has “no doubt” that Ireland will host a game soon.
He named Rio de Janeiro as a likely new host and said the Jacksonville
Jaguars are considering increasing the number of games they play in
London during their stadium renovations at home. </p>
<p>This season’s Super Bowl — the 59th edition — will be played in New
Orleans. In 2026, Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, will host,
followed by SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, in 2027. Kansas
City’s 25-22 overtime victory over San Francisco in the last Super Bowl
was the most-watched program in U.S. television history. </p>
<p>Team owners already have authorized up to eight international games,
but Goodell said they could double that number — creating a scenario
where all 32 teams could play an international game each year. </p>
<p>The key is expanding the regular season by one game and reducing the
number of preseason games to two. </p>
<p>“If we do expand our season — our regular season — to an 18-and-two
structure, I see us going to 16 of those games being in international
markets,” Goodell said. </p>
<p>He added that the plan could include a second bye week in the
schedule. </p>
<p>“A lot of that depends on — can we continue to make the game safer,
can we continue to modify the way we conduct the offseason as well as
the training camp and as well as the season, so that these guys feel
comfortable being able to play that period of time,” Goodell said. </p>
<p>Under that scenario, he said, the season would start around Labor Day
and conclude around Presidents Day — the third Monday of February. </p>
<p>Moving to an 18th game is seen as inevitable. The players union has
indicated it is open to an agreement before the current labor deal
expires after the 2030 season. </p>
<p>There are five international games this season, and Goodell said the
league wants to increase to eight “quickly.” </p>
<p>Dublin has been seen as the next likely host — after Madrid gets its
first game in 2025. </p>
<p>“I have no doubt that we’re going to be playing in Ireland. I don’t
know if it will be next year, but it’s coming soon,” Goodell said at
Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. </p>
<p>He cited Rio de Janeiro as the possible host of the next Brazil game
— Sao Paulo staged one this season. </p>
<p>London, which could get a night game at some point, has hosted
regular-season games since 2007 and Germany since 2022. </p>
<p>“We’re looking at other markets in the other direction, toward Asia,”
he said. “There’s probably more interest than we can handle.” </p>
<p>Kickoff update </p>
<p>Goodell expects some offseason tweaks to the new kickoff rules but on
the whole said “it’s working.” </p>
<p>The new rules have made kickoffs relevant again, he said, and the
early data on injuries is promising. </p>
<p>Just over 30% of kickoffs have been returned this season compared
with 20% last season, he said. </p>
<p>“With that increase in returns, it’s giving us more data to determine
whether we can do it more safely. It actually is incredibly promising.
We’re seeing lower impacts that have led to less severe injuries and
less number of injuries. So, I think it’s working,” Goodell said. </p>
<p>On average, kickoffs drives are starting just past the 29-yard line,
compared with just past the 24 previously, he said. </p>
<p>“I think what we’ll see ultimately is a change in the offseason,”
Goodell said. “Once we know it’s a safer play, it will encourage more
kickoffs. That could happen in a couple of ways. You could move the
kickoff line back, so that they can’t kick it out as easily. You could
also say the penalty for kicking it out is going to go to the 35 instead
of where we’re at, the 30.” </p>
<p>He said the “great thing” about the new system is “one little crease
develops and that guy is gone. That’s what I’m looking for is that long
kickoff return to return to the game. I think we had four or five last
year. We’re already at that number at Week 6. That’s pretty good.”</p>

id="floridians-evacuated-for-hurricane-milton-make-their-way-back-home">Floridians
evacuated for Hurricane Milton make their way back home</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BRANDON, FLORIDA — Florida residents who fled hundreds of miles to
escape Hurricane Milton made slow trips home on crowded highways, weary
from their long journeys and the cleanup work awaiting them but also
grateful to be coming back alive.</p>
<p>“I love my house, but I’m not dying in it,” Fred Neuman said Friday
while walking his dog outside a rest stop off Interstate 75 north of
Tampa.</p>
<p>Neuman and his wife live in Siesta Key, where Milton made landfall
Wednesday night as a powerful Category 3 hurricane. Heeding local
evacuation orders ahead of the storm, they drove nearly 800 kilometers
to Destin on the Florida Panhandle. Neighbors told the couple the
hurricane destroyed their carport and inflicted other damage, but Neuman
shrugged, saying their insurance should cover it.</p>
<p>Nearby, Lee and Pamela Essenburm made peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches at a picnic table as cars pulling off the slow-moving
interstate waited for parking spaces outside the crowded rest stop.
Their home in Palmetto, on the south end of Tampa Bay, had a tree fall
in the backyard. They evacuated, fearing the damage would be more severe
and worrying Milton might hit as a catastrophic Category 4 or 5
storm.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t going to take a chance on it,” Lee Essenbaum said. “It’s
not worth it.”</p>
<p>Milton killed at least 10 people when it tore across central Florida,
flooding barrier islands, ripping the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays′
baseball stadium and spawning deadly tornadoes.</p>
<p>Officials say the toll could have been worse if not for the
widespread evacuations. The still-fresh devastation wrought by Hurricane
Helene just two weeks earlier probably helped compel many people to
flee.</p>
<p>“Helene likely provided a stark reminder of how vulnerable certain
areas are to storms, particularly coastal regions,” said Craig Fugate,
who served as the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s administrator
under President Barack Obama. “When people see firsthand what can
happen, especially in neighboring areas, it can drive behavior change in
future storms.”</p>
<p>In the seaside town of Punta Gorda, Mayor Lynne Matthews said
rescuers had to save three people from floodwaters after Milton passed,
compared with 121 rescues from Helene’s flooding.</p>
<p>“So, people listened to the evacuation order,” Matthews told a news
conference Friday, noting that local authorities ensured residents heard
them. “We had teams out with the megaphones going through all of our
mobile home communities and other places to let people know that they
needed to evacuate.”</p>
<p>As of Saturday morning, the number of Floridians still without power
had dropped to less than 1.6 million, according to poweroutage.us.
St. Petersburg’s 260,000 residents were told to boil water before
drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth, until at least Monday.</p>
<p>Traffic crawled along stretches of I-75 as evacuees’ vehicles crowded
alongside a steady stream of utility trucks heading south toward Tampa.
While the densely populated city and surrounding Hillsborough County
accounted for nearly one-fourth of the remaining power outages, Milton
spared Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists
feared never materialized.</p>
<p>On Sunday, President Joe Biden will survey the devastation inflicted
on Florida’s Gulf Coast by the hurricane. He said he hopes to connect
with Governor Ron DeSantis during the visit.</p>
<p>The trip to Florida offers Biden another opportunity to press
Republican Speaker Mike Johnson to call lawmakers back to Washington to
approve further funding during their pre-election recess. It’s something
the top House lawmaker says he won’t do.</p>
<p>Biden is making the case that Congress needs to act now to ensure the
Small Business Administration and FEMA have the money they need to get
through hurricane season, which stretches through the end of November in
the Atlantic. The president said Friday that Hurricane Milton caused $50
billion in estimated damages.</p>
<p>As the recovery continues, DeSantis has warned people to be cautious,
citing ongoing safety threats, including downed power lines and standing
water that could hide dangerous objects.</p>
<p>“We’re now in the period where you have fatalities that are
preventable,” DeSantis said Friday. “You have to make the proper
decisions and know that there are hazards out there.”</p>
<p>National Weather Service Meteorologist Paul Close said rivers will
“keep rising” for the next four or five days resulting in river
flooding, mostly around Tampa Bay and northward. Those areas were hit by
the most rain, which comes on top of a wet summer that included earlier
hurricanes.</p>
<p>“You can’t do much but wait,” Close said of the rivers cresting. “At
least there is no rain in the forecast, no substantial rain. So, we have
a break here from all our wet weather.”</p>
<p>In coastal Pinellas County, the sheriff’s office used high-water
vehicles to shuttle people back and forth to their homes in a flooded
Palm Harbor neighborhood where waters continued to rise.</p>

id="harris-doctor-reports-vice-president-is-in-excellent-health">Harris’
doctor reports vice president is in ‘excellent health’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is in “excellent
health” and “possesses the physical and mental resiliency” required to
serve as president, her doctor said in a letter released Saturday that
summarizes her medical history and status.</p>
<p>Dr. Joshua Simmons, a U.S. Army colonel and physician to the vice
president, wrote that Harris, 59, maintains a healthy, active lifestyle
and that her most recent physical, in April, was “unremarkable.”</p>
<p>She “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to
successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as
Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,” he wrote in a
two-page letter.</p>
<p>Harris’ campaign hopes to use the moment to draw a contrast with
Republican Donald Trump, who has released only limited information about
his health over the years, and raise questions about his fitness to
serve, according to a campaign aide who spoke on condition of anonymity
to discuss sensitive matters.</p>
<p>Trump has released very little health information, including after
his ear was grazed by a bullet during an assassination attempt in
July.</p>
<p>Simmons, who said he has been Harris’ primary care physician for the
past 3½ years, said the vice president has a history of allergies and
urticaria, also known as hives, for which she has been on allergen
immunotherapy for the past three years.</p>
<p>Simmons said Harris’ latest blood work and other test results were
“unremarkable.”</p>
<p>Also in the report: Harris wears contact lenses for mild
nearsightedness; her family history includes maternal colon cancer; she
is up to date on preventive care recommendations, including having a
colonoscopy and annual mammograms.</p>
<p>As Harris’ office released the medical report, her campaign
highlighted recent media reports raising questions about Trump’s health
and mental acuity and his failure to provide information about health
status and medical history.</p>
<p>Trump, 78, eagerly questioned President Joe Biden’s health when the
81-year-old president was seeking reelection. Since Biden was replaced
on the ticket with Harris, Trump’s own health has drawn more
attention.</p>
<p>Last November, Trump marked Biden’s birthday by releasing a letter
from his physician that reported the former president was in “excellent”
physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The letter, posted on Trump’s social media platform, contained no
details to support its claims — measures such as weight, blood pressure
and cholesterol levels, or the results of any test.</p>

airstrikes target multiple militant camps in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIRUT — A series of U.S. airstrikes targeted several camps run by
the Islamic State group in Syria in an operation the U.S. military said
will disrupt the extremists from conducting attacks in the region and
beyond.</p>
<p>The U.S. Central Command said the airstrikes were conducted Friday,
without specifying in which parts of Syria. About 900 U.S. troops have
been deployed in eastern Syria alongside the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led
Syrian Democratic Forces that were instrumental in the fight against IS
militants.</p>
<p>Despite their defeat, attacks by IS sleeper cells in Iraq and Syria
have been on the rise over the past years, with scores of people killed
or wounded.</p>
<p>The Islamic State group seized territory at the height of its power
and declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014 but
was defeated in Iraq in 2017. In March 2019, the extremists lost the
last sliver of land they once controlled in eastern Syria.</p>
<p>The U.S. military said the strikes will disrupt the ability of the
Islamic State group to plan, organize and conduct attacks against the
United States, its allies and partners, as well as civilians throughout
the region and beyond.</p>
<p>It said battle damage assessments were underway and there were no
civilian casualties.</p>
<p>Last month, Iraq’s military said that Iraqi forces and American
troops killed a senior IS commander who was wanted by the United States,
as well as several other prominent militants.</p>
<p>At its peak, the group ruled an area half the size of the United
Kingdom where it enforced its extreme interpretation of Islam, which
included attacks on religious minority groups and harsh punishment of
Muslims deemed to be apostates.</p>

lovers try to counter the deadly risk of Chicago high-rises for
migrating birds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>chicago — With a neon-green net in hand, Annette Prince briskly walks
a downtown Chicago plaza at dawn, looking left and right as she
goes.</p>
<p>It’s not long before she spots a tiny yellow bird sitting on the
concrete. It doesn’t fly away, and she quickly nets the bird, gently
places it inside a paper bag and labels the bag with the date, time and
place.</p>
<p>“This is a Nashville warbler,” said Prince, director of the Chicago
Bird Collision Monitors, noting that the bird must have flown into a
glass window pane of an adjacent building. “He must only weigh about two
pennies. He’s squinting his eyes because his head hurts.”</p>
<p>For rescue groups like the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, this
scene plays out hundreds of times each spring and fall after migrating
birds fly into homes, small buildings and sometimes Chicago’s
skyscrapers and other hulking buildings.</p>
<p>A stark sign of the risks came last fall, when 1,000 migrating birds
died on a single night after flying into the glass exterior of the
city’s lakefront convention center, McCormick Place. This fall, the
facility unveiled new bird-safe window film on one of its glass
buildings along the Lake Michigan shore.</p>
<p>The $1.2 million project installed tiny dots on the exterior of the
Lakeside Center building, adorning enough glass to cover two football
fields.</p>
<p>Doug Stotz, senior conservation ecologist at the nearby Field Museum,
hopes the project will be a success. He estimated that just 20 birds
have died after flying into the convention’s center’s glass exterior so
far this fall, a hopeful sign.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a lot of data since this just started this fall, but
at this point, it looks like it’s made a huge difference,” Stotz
said.</p>
<p>But for the birds that collide with Chicago buildings, there is a
network of people waiting to help. They also are aiming to educate
officials and find solutions to improve building design, lighting and
other factors in the massive number of bird collision deaths in Chicago
and worldwide.</p>
<p>Prince said she and other volunteers walk the streets downtown to
document what they can of the birds that are killed and injured.</p>
<p>“We have the combination of the millions of birds that pass through
this area because it’s a major migratory path through the United States,
on top of the amount of artificial lighting that we put out at night,
which is when these birds are traveling and getting confused and
attracted to the amount of glass,” Prince said.</p>
<p>Dead birds are often saved for scientific use, including by Chicago’s
Field Museum of Natural History. Rescued birds are taken to local
wildlife rehabilitation centers to recover, such as the DuPage Wildlife
Conservation Center in suburban Illinois.</p>
<p>On a recent morning, veterinarian Darcy Stephenson at DuPage gave a
yellow-bellied sapsucker anesthetic gas before taping its wings open for
an X-ray. The bird arrived with a note from a rescue group: “Window
collision.”</p>
<p>Examining the results, she found the bird had a broken ulna — a bone
in the wing.</p>
<p>The center takes in about 10,000 species of animals annually and 65%
of them are avian. Many are victims of window collisions and during peak
migration in the fall, several hundred birds can show up in one day.</p>
<p>“The large chunk of these birds do actually survive and make it back
into the wild once we’re able to treat them,” said Sarah Reich, head
veterinarian at DuPage. “Fractures heal very, very quickly in these guys
for shoulder fractures. Soft tissue trauma generally heals pretty well.
The challenging cases are going to be the ones where the trauma isn’t as
apparent.”</p>
<p>Injured birds go through a process of flight testing, then get a full
physical exam by the veterinary staff and are rehabilitated before being
set free.</p>
<p>“It’s exciting to be able to get these guys back out into the wild,
especially some of those cases that we’re kind of cautiously optimistic
about or maybe have an injury that we’ve never treated successfully
before,” Reich said, adding that these are the cases “clinic staff get
really, really excited about.”</p>

id="louisianas-cajun-and-creole-heritage-will-be-celebrated-at-50th-annual-festival">Louisiana’s
Cajun and Creole heritage will be celebrated at 50th annual
festival</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new orleans, louisiana — Louisiana’s Cajun and Creole heritage takes
center stage this weekend when the Festivals Acadiens et Creoles marks a
half-century of honoring and celebrating the culture through music,
arts, food and community. </p>
<p>What started as a one day concert in 1974 to entertain 150
French-speaking journalists gathered in Lafayette — considered the heart
of Cajun country — has grown into a three-day event and possibly one of
the largest Cajun and Zydeco festivals in the world, organizers said.
And, they note, the entire event is free. </p>
<p>Barry Jean Ancelet, one of the event’s organizers, said when the idea
formed 50 years ago, nobody knew if anyone would even come to hear the
music. </p>
<p>“Cajun music at that time was largely considered ‘old people’s
music,’” he said. “You’ve got to remember, we were in the throes of Rock
‘n’ Roll at the time. The people here loved it when they encountered it
in dance halls, but this concert was designed to call attention to the
music in a different way, to point out its value. They had to sit — not
dance — and pay attention. And they ended up hearing it in a different
way. It was so successful. We ended up turning it into an annual event
where we could call positive attention to this important asset and get
people to consider it.” </p>
<p>The festival, now held annually in Lafayette’s Girard Park, brings
together multi-generations of musicians and artists who annually fight
to preserve a culture that continues to evolve. </p>
<p>“We’ve always been about celebrating the past and handing it off to
the future,” Ancelet said. “If you value and respect evolution, the
culture will produce things that will continue to surprise you. It all
comes out in the wash. What’s good will last and what’s not,
won’t.” </p>
<p>Festival co-founder Pat Mould said the festival is a
“self-celebration of who we are, how we live, what we eat, the music and
how we speak.” </p>
<p>“If you know nothing and want to learn about the culture, this one
weekend out of the year allows you to find out everything. Everything
you want to know is represented at the festival. It’s a quick study of
Cajun and Creole living,” he said. </p>
<p>Event features homegrown talent</p>
<p>On tap musically for the Friday through Sunday event are performances
by 60 musicians — all homegrown talent — including Steve Riley and the
Mamou Playboys, Wayne Toups, CJ Chenier, Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas,
Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp Band, The Revelers, Beausoleil avec
Michael Doucet and The Lost Bayou Ramblers. </p>
<p>On Friday, contemporary artists will pay tribute to the 1974 concert
house band that included Zydeco pioneer Clifton Chenier, Cajun accordion
maker Marc Savoy, the Balfa Brothers, a Cajun music ensemble of five
brothers, Cajun accordion players Nathan Abshire and Blackie Forrester,
and Jimmy C. Newman, a country music and Cajun singer-songwriter and
long-time star of the Grand Ole Opry. </p>
<p>“Get ready for Louisiana pure fun,” said Carrier, who’s scheduled to
perform with his band on Sunday. “Get ready to eat some really good food
and have the time of your life.” </p>
<p>“People all over the word have these dates circled on their
calendar,” he continued. “It’s an event that helps the younger
generations continue the traditions. I’m a third generation Zydeco
musician. This is a family oriented festival that brings people together
of all ages.” </p>
<p>A ‘celebration of everything Cajun’</p>
<p>Riley, who’s been performing at this festival since 1988, said he
keeps returning for several reasons but especially because it helps
preserve the culture. </p>
<p>“It’s important to see us on stage, singing and speaking in French.
That has an effect on people who come to see us and helps them fall in
love with the culture,” he said. </p>
<p>“There are a lot of events leading up to the weekend that focuses on
the importance of the language, the culture, the food and, of course,
the music. There’s none other that celebrates it like this one. I think
it’s the biggest complete celebration of everything Cajun. It’s also
inclusive of different generations, bands with lineage. That’s key,” he
said. </p>
<p>Riley, now 55, said he’s very proud that his three children play
music. </p>
<p>“It’s a beautiful thing for my family and others like mine,” he said.
“Having your kids play with you is awesome. Most kids don’t want to have
anything to do with what their parents do. Mine think what I do is fun
and it is.” </p>
<p>Riley said when he first started there weren’t too many young bands
playing Cajun music. </p>
<p>“There was real fear that the music would die off and dissipate like
the language,” he said. “The opposite has happened. More young folks are
preserving and playing this music than ever. The Zydeco scene down here
is packed with young people. It’s super vibrant and alive. The same with
the Cajun scene as well.”</p>

Monet artwork returned to family generations later</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS — On the eve of World War II, Nazis in Austria seized a
pastel by renowned impressionist artist Claude Monet, selling it off and
sparking a family’s decadeslong search that culminated Wednesday in New
Orleans.</p>
<p>At an FBI field office, agents lifted a blue veil covering the Monet
pastel and presented Adalbert Parlagi’s granddaughters with the artwork
over 80 years after it was taken from their family. Helen Lowe said she
felt that her grandfather would be watching and that he would be “so, so
proud of this moment.”</p>
<p>Monet’s 1865 Bord de Mer depicts rocks along the shoreline of the
Normandy coast, where Allied forces stormed the beaches of Nazi-occupied
France during D-Day in 1944, marking a turning point in the war. The
Monet pastel is one of 20,000 items recovered by the FBI Art Crime Team
out of an estimated 600,000 artworks and millions of books and religious
objects stolen by the Nazis.</p>
<p>“The theft was not random or incidental, but an integral part of the
Nazis’ plan to eliminate all vestiges of Jewish life in Germany and
Europe, root and branch,” U.S. State Department Holocaust adviser Stuart
E. Eizenstat said in a March speech.</p>
<p>After Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Adalbert Parlagi, a
successful businessman and art lover, and his wife, Hilda, left behind
almost everything they owned and fled Vienna, using British license
plates to drive across the border, their granddaughters said. Though the
Parlagis hadn’t identified as Jewish for years and baptized their
children as Protestants, they were still considered Jewish under Nazi
laws, according to Austrian government records. Other relatives were
killed in concentration camps.</p>
<p>The Parlagis attempted to ship their valuable carpets, porcelain and
artworks out of Vienna to London, but found out later that their
property had been seized and auctioned off by the Gestapo to support the
Third Reich.</p>
<p>Multiple international declarations decried trading in Nazi-looted
art, beginning with Allied forces in London in 1943. The 1998 Washington
principles, signed by more than three dozen countries, reiterated the
call and advocated for the return of stolen art.</p>
<p>Yet Adalbert Parlagi’s efforts were stonewalled by the Vienna
auctioneer who had bought and sold the Monet pastel and another artwork
owned by Parlagi. The records were lost after the fighting in Vienna,
the auctioneer told Adalbert in a letter shortly after World War II,
according to an English translation of a document prepared by an
Austrian government body reviewing the Parlagi family’s art restitution
claims.</p>
<p>“I also cannot remember two such pictures either,” the auctioneer
said.</p>
<p>Many survivors of World War II and their descendants ultimately give
up trying to recover their lost artwork because of the difficulties they
face, said Anne Webber, co-founder of the London-based nonprofit
Commission for Looted Art in Europe, which has recovered more than 3,500
looted artworks.</p>
<p>“You have to just constantly, constantly, constantly look,” Webber
said.</p>
<p>Adalbert Parlagi and his son Franz kept meticulous ownership and
search records. After Franz’s death in 2012, Françoise Parlagi stumbled
upon her father’s cache of documents, including the original receipt
from her grandfather’s purchase of the Monet pastel. She reached out to
Webber’s commission for help in 2014.</p>
<p>The commission’s research team reviewed archives and receipts,
contacted museums and art experts and scoured the internet, but
initially found “absolutely no trace,” Webber said. Then, in 2021, the
team discovered online that a New Orleans dealer acquired the Monet in
2017 and sold it to a Louisiana-based doctor and his wife.</p>
<p>The FBI investigated the commission’s research and, earlier this
year, a federal court ruled the pastel should be returned to the
Parlagis’ descendants.</p>
<p>“There was never a question” of returning the art to the rightful
owners after learning of its sordid history, said Bridget Vita-Schlamp,
whose late husband had purchased the Monet pastel.</p>
<p>“We were shocked, I’m not going to lie,” she said.</p>
<p>The family recovered another work in March from the Austrian
government but there are still six more artworks missing, including from
acclaimed artists Camille Pissarro and Paul Signac. The U.S. is likely
the “largest illegal art market in the world,” said Kristin Koch,
supervisory special agent with the FBI’s Art Crime Program.</p>
<p>The art world has a greater responsibility to investigate the origins
of artworks and a moral obligation to return looted works to their
rightful owners, Webber said.</p>
<p>“They represent the life and the lives that were taken,” Webber said.
“They represent the world that they were exiled from.”</p>
<p>The granddaughters of Adalbert and Hilda Parlagi say they are
grateful for what they have already gotten back. Françoise Parlagi, a
broad smile on her face, said she hoped to hang a copy of the pastel in
her home. She said the moment felt “unreal.”</p>
<p>“So many families are in this situation. Maybe they haven’t even been
trying to recover because they don’t believe, they think this might not
be possible,” she said. “Let us be hope for other families.”</p>

id="us-voting-systems-targets-of-conspiracy-theories-get-tested-for-accuracy-security">US
voting systems, targets of conspiracy theories, get tested for accuracy,
security</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA — Voting machines have been at the center of a web of
conspiracy theories after the 2020 U.S. election, with false claims that
they were manipulated to steal the presidency from Donald Trump.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of widespread fraud or rigged voting machines
in the election, and multiple reviews in the battleground states where
the Republican president disputed his loss to Democrat Joe Biden
confirmed the results as accurate. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay
Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest voting machine companies,
$787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit.</p>
<p>In the years since his loss, Trump and his allies have continued to
sow doubts about voting equipment. State and local election officials
have tried to push back by explaining the layers of protection that
surround voting systems and the measures they have in place to conduct
fair and accurate elections.</p>
<p>In November’s presidential election, nearly every ballot cast will
have a paper record that can be used to obtain an accurate count even if
there are errors or cyberattacks.</p>
<p>What is a voting machine?</p>
<p>Election officials rely on various pieces of technology. Every office
does things a little bit differently.</p>
<p>Officials rely on a voter registration system that is a database of
registered voters and have an election management system that workers
use to create, issue and track ballots. They also use an election-night
reporting system that reports unofficial results. Many jurisdictions use
electronic pollbooks to check in voters at polling locations.</p>
<p>All this depends on software and computers, a reliance that carries
risks that officials work to identify and address. For example, election
officials often will isolate critical systems from the internet and use
storage devices, such as secured USB sticks, to transfer data. They
limit access to sensitive equipment to only those who need it and have
logs that track and monitor the devices.</p>
<p>When an internet connection is needed, election officials will often
use private networks to limit the risk of malicious activity and take
other steps to scan their systems for potential vulnerabilities and
threats.</p>
<p>Voters in much of the country fill out ballots by hand, and then that
ballot will be scanned and counted electronically. A few places, mostly
small towns in the Northeast, will count their ballots by hand.</p>
<p>In some areas, voters use a computer to mark their ballots
electronically and then get a printout of their choices that they insert
into a scanner for counting. In other cases, the ballot is cast
electronically, and a paper record is printed that summarizes the votes
cast. That record is then available if a hand count is needed.</p>
<p>Are voting machines connected to the internet?</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, no. There are some jurisdictions in a few
states that allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit
unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has
ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies
have been removed.</p>
<p>Election officials who allow this say it provides for faster
reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the
paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results
during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to
a recount if one was needed.</p>
<p>Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and
should be prohibited.</p>
<p>Are voting machines secure?</p>
<p>Election officials say they have worked extensively to shore up
security around their voting equipment after an effort by Russia to scan
state voter registration systems for vulnerabilities in 2016.</p>
<p>There was no evidence then that any data was changed or deleted, but
it led the federal government to declare the nation’s election systems
as critical infrastructure. That allows the U.S. Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency to provide free cybersecurity reviews and
vulnerability testing to election offices nationwide.</p>
<p>“Today, eight years later, because of all the incredible work by
election officials to strengthen the security and resiliency of our
election process, election infrastructure has never been more secure,
and the election stakeholder community has never been stronger,” the
agency’s director, Jen Easterly, told reporters in September.</p>
<p>Computer security experts have called for more to be done and for
election officials to limit the use of certain technology, specifically
machines that mark ballots for voters. A long-running court battle in
Georgia has sought to compel the state to get rid of these machines in
favor of hand-marked paper ballots.</p>
<p>Experts have also raised particular concern about a series of
security breaches that occurred after the 2020 election as Trump allies
sought access to voting systems in Georgia and elsewhere as they tried
to prove their unsubstantiated claims. The experts have warned that the
public release of critical election software because of the breaches has
raised “serious threats” and have called for a federal
investigation.</p>
<p>How do election officials ensure accuracy?</p>
<p>Election officials say there are safeguards in place to ensure that
voting systems are not manipulated. That begins with physical security,
such as locked rooms with limited access and the use of tamper-evident
seals. In addition, voting equipment is tested before the election, a
process that includes running test ballots through the equipment to
ensure votes are being counted correctly.</p>
<p>Postelection reviews are conducted to identify any mistakes or errors
that may have occurred.</p>
<p>Around 98% of all ballots cast in this year’s election will include a
paper record, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice
based on data collected by Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that
tracks voting equipment in the U.S. Officials say that’s important for
ensuring that any error or cyberattack will not prevent officials from
producing an accurate record of the vote.</p>

id="florida-residents-slog-through-aftermath-of-hurricane-milton">Florida
residents slog through aftermath of Hurricane Milton</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LITHIA, Florida — Florida residents slogged through flooded streets,
gathered up scattered debris and assessed damage to their homes on
Friday after Hurricane Milton smashed through coastal communities and
spawned a barrage of deadly tornadoes.</p>
<p>At least 10 people were dead, and rescuers were still saving people
from swollen rivers, but many expressed relief that Milton wasn’t worse.
The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the
lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized.</p>
<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis warned people to not let down their guard, however,
citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing
water that could hide dangerous objects.</p>
<p>“We’re now in the period where you have fatalities that are
preventable,” DeSantis said. “You have to make the proper decisions and
know that there are hazards out there.”</p>
<p>As of Friday night, the number of customers in Florida still without
power had dropped to 1.9 million, according to poweroutage.us.
St. Petersburg’s 260,000 residents were told to boil water before
drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth, until at least Monday.</p>
<p>Also Friday, the owner of a major phosphate mine disclosed that
pollution spilled into Tampa Bay during the hurricane.</p>
<p>The Mosaic Company said in a statement that heavy rains from the
storm overwhelmed a collection system at its Riverview site, pushing
excess water out of a manhole and into discharges that lead to the bay.
The company said the leak was fixed Thursday.</p>
<p>Mosaic said the spill likely exceeded a 66,245-liter minimum
reporting standard, though it did not provide a figure for what the
total volume might have been.</p>
<p>Calls and emails to Mosaic seeking additional information about
Riverview and the company’s other Florida mines received no response, as
did a voicemail left with the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection.</p>
<p>The state has 25 such stacks containing more than 1 billion tons of
phosphogypsum, a solid waste byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer
mining industry that contains radium, which decays to form radon gas.
Both radium and radon are radioactive and can cause cancer.
Phosphogypsum may also contain toxic heavy metals and other carcinogens,
such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel.</p>
<p>Florida’s vital tourism industry has started to return to normal,
meanwhile, as Walt Disney World and other theme parks reopened. The
state’s busiest airport, in Orlando, resumed full operations Friday.</p>
<p>Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene,
Milton flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays ’
baseball stadium and toppled a construction crane.</p>
<p>Crews from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Friday were
assisting with rescues of people, including a 92-year-old woman, who
were stranded in rising waters along the Alafia River. The river is 40
kilometers long and runs from eastern Hillsborough County, east of
Tampa, into Tampa Bay.</p>
<p>In Pinellas County, deputies used high-water vehicles to shuttle
people back and forth to their homes in a flooded Palm Harbor
neighborhood where waters continued to rise.</p>
<p>Ashley Cabrera left with her 18- and 11-year-old sons and their three
dogs, Eeyore, Poe and Molly. It was the first time since Milton struck
that they had been able to leave the neighborhood, and they were now
headed to a hotel in Orlando.</p>
<p>“I’m extremely thankful that we could get out now and go for the
weekend somewhere we can get a hot meal and some gas,” Cabrera said. “I
thought we’d be able to get out as soon as the storm was over. These
roads have never flooded like this in all the years that I’ve lived
here.”</p>
<p>Animals were being saved, too. Cindy Evers helped rescue a large pig
stuck in high water at a strip mall in Lithia, east of Tampa. She had
already rescued a donkey and several goats after the storm.</p>
<p>“I’m high and dry where I’m at, and I have a barn and 9 acres (3.6
hectares),” Evers said, adding that she will soon start to work to find
the animals’ owners.</p>
<p>In the Gulf Coast city of Venice, Milton left behind dozens of
centimeters of sand in some beachfront condos, with one unit nearly
filled. A swimming pool was packed full of sand, with only its handrails
poking out.</p>
<p>Some warnings were heeded and lessons learned. When 2.4 meters of
seawater flooded Punta Gorda during Hurricane Helene last month, 121
people had to be rescued, Mayor Lynne Matthews said. Milton brought at
least 1.5 meters of flooding, but rescuers only had to save three
people.</p>
<p>“So people listened to the evacuation order,” Matthews said.</p>
<p>Heaps of fruit were scattered across the ground and trees toppled
over after both Milton and Hurricane Helene swept through Polk County
and other orange-growing regions, Matt Joyner of trade group Florida
Citrus Mutual said Friday.</p>
<p>Milton arrived at the start of the orange growing season, so it is
still too early to evaluate the full scope of the damage.</p>
<p>Florida has already seen orange production diminish over the years,
with the industry still recovering from hurricanes of years past while
also waging an ongoing battle against a deadly greening disease. Milton
could be the knockout punch for some growers, Joyce said.</p>
<p>In the western coastal city of Clearwater, Kelvin Glenn said it took
less than an hour early Thursday for water to rise to his waist inside
his apartment. He and seven children, ranging in age from 3 to 16, were
trapped in the brown, foul floodwaters for about three hours before an
upstairs neighbor opened their home to them.</p>
<p>Later that day, first responders arrived in boats to ferry them away
from the building.</p>
<p>“Sitting in that cold, nasty water was kind of bad,” Glenn said.</p>
<p>Short-term survival is now turning into long-term worries. A hotel is
$160 a night. Everything inside Glenn’s apartment is gone. And it can
take time to get assistance.</p>
<p>“I ain’t going to say we’re homeless,” Glenn said. “But we’ve got to
start all over again.”</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency has enough money to deal with
the immediate needs of people impacted by Helene and Milton but will
need additional funding at some point, FEMA administrator Deanne
Criswell said Friday.</p>
<p>The disaster assistance fund helps pay for the swift response to
hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. Congress recently
replenished the fund with $20 billion — the same amount as last
year.</p>

removes fake accounts in Moldova ahead of presidential election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM — Meta Platforms said on Friday that it had removed a
network of group accounts targeting Russian speakers in Moldova ahead of
the country’s October 20 election, for violation of the company’s policy
on fake accounts.</p>
<p>Authorities in Moldova, an ex-Soviet state lying between Romania and
Ukraine, said they had blocked dozens of Telegram channels and chat bots
linked to a drive to pay voters to cast “no” ballots in a referendum on
European Union membership held alongside the presidential election.</p>
<p>Pro-European President Maia Sandu is seeking a second term in the
election and called the referendum on joining the 27-member bloc as the
cornerstone of her policies.</p>
<p>The fake Meta accounts posted criticism of Sandu, pro-EU politicians
and close ties between Moldova and Romania, and supported pro-Russia
parties in Moldova, the company said.</p>
<p>The company said its operation centered on about a dozen fictitious,
Russian-language news brands posing as independent entities with
presence on multiple internet services, including Meta-owned Facebook
and Instagram, as well as Telegram, OK.ru and TikTok.</p>
<p>Meta said it removed seven Facebook accounts, 23 pages, one group and
20 accounts on Instagram for violating its “coordinated inauthentic
behavior policy.”</p>
<p>About 4,200 accounts followed one or more of the 23 pages and about
335,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts, Meta
said.</p>
<p>In Chisinau, the National Investigation Inspectorate said it had
blocked 15 channels of the popular Telegram messaging app and 95 chat
bots offering voters money. Users were told the channels “violated local
laws” on political party financing.</p>
<p>It had traced the accounts to supporters of fugitive businessman Ilan
Shor — members of the banned party bearing his name or the “Victory”
electoral bloc he had set up in its place from his base of exile in
Moscow.</p>
<p>Moldovan police said on Thursday that they searched homes of leaders
linked to Shor as part of a criminal investigation into
election-meddling. Police have said tens of thousands of voters were
paid off via accounts in a Russian bank to derail the vote.</p>
<p>Shor was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia last year in
connection with the 2014 disappearance of $1 billion from Moldovan
banks. He denies allegations of trying to bribe voters.</p>
<p>Sandu accuses Moscow of trying to topple her government while Moscow
has accused her of fomenting “Russophobia.”</p>

sues Virginia over alleged violation of federal election law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday that it had
sued the state of Virginia for violating the federal prohibition on
systematic efforts to remove voters within 90 days of an election.</p>
<p>On August 7, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed an executive
order requiring the commissioner of the Department of Elections to
certify that the department was conducting “daily updates to the voter
list” to remove, among other groups, people who are unable to verify
that they are citizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens who were identified and notified and did not affirm
their citizenship within 14 days would be removed from the list of
registered voters, the Justice Department said. It said this practice
has led to citizens having their voter registrations canceled ahead of
the November 5 election.</p>
<p>“By canceling voter registrations within 90 days of Election Day,
Virginia places qualified voters in jeopardy of being removed from the
rolls and creates the risk of confusion for the electorate,” said
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke.</p>
<p>“Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period
restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too
often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Clarke added.</p>
<p>The department said it was seeking injunctive relief that would
restore the ability of affected eligible voters to cast their votes
unimpeded on Election Day and would prohibit future violations.</p>
<p>Youngkin called the move politically motivated and an attempt to
interfere in the election.</p>
<p>“With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these
common sense steps that we are legally required to take with every
resource available to us,” he said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>Republicans across the U.S. have pushed against noncitizen voting,
which is already illegal, ahead of the November election. Some election
officials have warned that the move could penalize eligible voters.</p>

id="experts-future-of-us-south-korea-defense-cost-sharing-deal-remains-uncertain">Experts:
Future of US-South Korea defense cost-sharing deal remains
uncertain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. national security experts say it is unclear whether
a new cost-sharing agreement with South Korea, hailed by the State
Department as “a significant accomplishment,” will survive if former
President Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.</p>
<p>Concluded last week and effective from 2026, the five-year Special
Measures Agreement, or SMA, requires South Korea to raise its
contribution to the cost of stationing of U.S. troops in the country by
8.3% to $1.47 billion in the first year.</p>
<p>The two allies reached the agreement earlier than expected, a move
widely seen as key for Seoul and Washington to clinch before the U.S.
presidential election in November, in which Trump is the Republican
Party candidate.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department hailed the agreement as a “a significant
accomplishment for both sides” in a statement released on October 4.</p>
<p>But Trump, both in office and as a candidate, has consistently
demanded that South Korea contribute significantly more to the cost of
supporting U.S. forces in Korea. Most recently in April, Trump told Time
magazine that “I want South Korea to treat us properly,” adding that
Seoul is “paying virtually nothing for” the U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea.</p>
<p>‘Trump factor’</p>
<p>John Bolton, a former White House national security adviser during
the Trump administration, told VOA Korean by phone on Friday that “it’s
very likely that Trump would ask to renegotiate it.”</p>
<p>“I know that the administration [of President Joe Biden] here tried
to rush the coming-to-an-agreement on it, so that Trump couldn’t meddle
with it, but that won’t slow him down at all,” said Bolton, who also
served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005-06.</p>
<p>“He never thinks his predecessors make good enough deals, and in
part, it’s not just the question of economics, but he doesn’t understand
collective defense alliances,” Bolton said.</p>
<p>“He thinks that not just with respect to the Republic of Korea, but
also with NATO or Japan or whatever that we’re defending, these
countries don’t pay us enough money.” The Republic of Korea is South
Korea’s formal name.</p>
<p>Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the
Heritage Foundation, pointed out the pact is “an executive agreement,”
which makes it easier for Trump to undo since it does not require
approval from Congress.</p>
<p>“We really don’t know whether he would just see it as a done deal, or
if he will seek to renegotiate it upward, where South Korea would pay
much more,” Klingner said.</p>
<p>“If you take a step back, it’s in our strategic interest to have
allies, it’s in our strategic interest to have our forces stationed
overseas, because actually, they’re less costly to the United States
when they’re stationed overseas than when they’re stationed
domestically.”</p>
<p>Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean
last week that he was concerned that the agreement wouldn’t pass muster
with a Trump administration should the former president win a second
term in November.</p>
<p>“Given his demands and expectations of U.S. allies with respect to
security burden sharing, my strong fear is that he will seek to
renegotiate today’s agreement with a much higher number in mind,” said
Rapson, who was directly involved in the two sets of SMA negotiations in
2013-14 and in 2019-21.</p>
<p>Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told VOA Korean on Thursday via
email that he suspected there was “considerable dissatisfaction with the
recently concluded SMA agreement in the Trump camp,” knowing how
strongly the former president feels about the burden-sharing issue.</p>
<p>Revere said he could not rule out the possibility that Trump will
come up with “a demand to reopen talks on the SMA issue, and toward that
end, he might make major new demands of Seoul” if he takes office
again.</p>
<p>‘It’s in our interest’</p>
<p>Other former government officials, like Klingner, believe it is too
early to predict whether Trump will try to revise the cost-sharing
agreement between the U.S. and South Korea.</p>
<p>Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the
George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on Wednesday on the
phone, “He might try, but let’s not get fearful about this too
soon.”</p>
<p>“If he comes to the White House, he will have a secretary of state,
defense, national security adviser, et cetera, who may have slightly
different views and can help moderate Mr. Trump.”</p>
<p>“Seoul and Washington understand that Trump is very transactional,”
Armitage said. “But American soldiers are not Hessians. We’re not for
rent. We’re in Korea because it’s in our interest.”</p>
<p>VOA Korean contacted the Trump campaign this week and asked what
Trump’s stance was on the newly reached agreement, but did not receive a
reply by the time this article was published.</p>
<p>Joeun Lee contributed to this report, which originated in VOA’s
Korean Service.</p>

for attempting to help the Islamic State conduct a deadly ambush of U.S.
troops, the Department of Justice said on Friday.</p>
<p>Cole Bridges, also known as Cole Gonzales, 24, will undergo
supervised release for 10 years following his release from prison, the
department said.</p>
<p>Bridges, who was a private first class at the time of his arrest, was
charged in 2021 with giving “military advice and guidance on how to kill
fellow soldiers to individuals he thought were part of ISIS,” the
department said.</p>
<p>Bridges pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in June 2023. He joined
the Army in 2019.</p>
<p>Before joining, according to the department, he began researching and
consuming online propaganda “promoting jihadists and their violent
ideology, and began to express his support for ISIS and jihad on social
media.”</p>

lawyers argue for settlement opposed by relatives of those killed in 737
Max crashes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>fort worth, Texas — Relatives of passengers who died in two crashes
of Boeing 737 Max planes came to a federal court in Texas on Friday to
listen as their lawyers asked a judge to throw out a plea agreement that
the aircraft manufacturer struck with prosecutors and put the company on
trial.</p>
<p>Their lawyers argued that Boeing’s punishment — mainly a fine
amounting to about $244 million — would be too light for misleading
regulators about a flight-control system that malfunctioned before the
crashes. They accused Boeing and the Justice Department of airbrushing
facts and ignoring that 346 people died in the crashes.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor asked a Boeing lawyer why he should
accept the prepackaged plea deal and a sentence negotiated by a
defendant.</p>
<p>The Boeing lawyer, Ben Hatch, said Boeing “is a pillar of the
national economy and the national defense” and needs to know the
punishment before it agrees to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit
fraud, a felony. Otherwise, he said, the company could be disbarred from
federal contracting.</p>
<p>“All the employees of the company, the shareholders of the company
and a global and national supply chain … all of those are put into doubt
if the sentencing” isn’t known, possibly for months, Hatch said.</p>
<p>The answer stunned and angered relatives of the victims.</p>
<p>“Boeing is too important for the economy — they’re too big to jail.
That’s what he’s saying,” Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in
the second crash, said after the hearing. “It allows them to kill people
with no consequences because they’re too big and because their
shareholders won’t like it.”</p>
<p>The government joined Boeing in asking the judge to accept the deal
that they struck in July.</p>
<p>Sean Tonolli, senior deputy chief of the Justice Department’s fraud
section, said the conspiracy count is the most serious crime prosecutors
can bring — they can’t prove that Boeing’s deception of regulators
caused the crashes. And, he said, going to trial is risky.</p>
<p>“We are confident in our case, but we don’t take for granted that we
might not win,” he said.</p>
<p>The judge, who had received written arguments from all sides before
the hearing in Fort Worth, asked questions but gave no indication if he
is leaning one way or the other. He has expressed sympathy for the
passengers’ families before, writing in a 2023 ruling about “Boeing’s
egregious criminal conduct.”</p>
<p>“You have given me a lot to think about,” O’Connor said to all the
lawyers as Friday’s hearing ended. “I’ll get a ruling out just as soon
as I can.”</p>
<p>In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of
conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly deceiving Federal Aviation
Administration regulators who were writing pilot-training requirements
for the Max.</p>
<p>The FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737
pilots before they could fly the Max, the latest version of the 737.
That helped Boeing by avoiding the need for training in flight
simulators, which would have raised the cost for airlines to operate the
Max.</p>
<p>Airlines began flying the Max in 2017. The first crash occurred in
Indonesia in October 2018, followed in March 2019 by the second, in
Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The plea agreement calls for Boeing to pay a fine of up to $487.2
million, but the fine would be cut in half by giving the company credit
for $243.6 million it paid as part of a $2.5 billion settlement in 2021
to avoid prosecution. The Justice Department decided in May that Boeing
violated terms of that settlement, leading to the new plea deal.</p>
<p>Boeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, would also invest $455
million in compliance and safety programs, and be placed on probation
for three years.</p>
<p>The case is among a host of issues with which the manufacturer most
contend.</p>
<p>Talks broke down this week with striking factory workers who assemble
some of the company’s best-selling planes. The company withdrew its
offer and S&amp;P Global Ratings put it on its credit watch list, citing
increased financial risk because of the labor unrest.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the company filed a complaint over what it calls unfair
labor practices against the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers. Boeing in its complaint with the National Labor
Relations Board said that the union’s public narrative is misleading and
has made it difficult to reach a resolution.</p>

id="us-expands-sanctions-against-irans-oil-industry-after-attack-on-israel">US
expands sanctions against Iran’s oil industry after attack on
Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States hit Iran’s oil and petrochemicals
sectors with fresh sanctions Friday in response to Tehran’s October 1
attack against Israel, designating dozens of new companies and firms.
 </p>
<p>In a statement Friday, the Treasury Department said it was going
after Iran’s so-called “shadow fleet” of ships involved in selling
Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions, designating 10
companies and 17 vessels as “blocked property” over their involvement in
“shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products.” </p>
<p>The State Department announced it was sanctioning an additional six
firms and six ships for “knowingly engaging in a significant transaction
for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of
petroleum or petroleum products from Iran.” </p>
<p>The sanctions form part of the U.S. response to Iran’s attack, in
which it launched some 200 ballistic missiles against Israel in
retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders and a
general from Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. </p>
<p>Israel has said its response to Iran’s second direct attack against
its territory this year would be “deadly, precise, and surprising.” </p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that Israel should
consider “other alternatives than striking oil fields,” amid reports it
was planning to do so.  </p>
<p>“In response to Iran’s attack on Israel, the United States is taking
decisive action to further disrupt the Iranian regime’s ability to fund
and carry out its destabilizing activity,” Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen said in a statement. </p>
<p>“Today’s sanctions target Iranian efforts to channel revenues from
its energy industry to finance deadly and disruptive activity —
including development of its nuclear program, the proliferation of
ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles,” she added.  </p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had made clear
after the October 1 attack that Tehran would face consequences. </p>
<p>“To that end, we are taking steps today to disrupt the flow of
revenue the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program and missile
development, support terrorist proxies and partners, and perpetuate
conflict throughout the Middle East,” he said in a statement.</p>

<h2 id="as-disasters-strike-investors-turn-to-adaptation-tech">As
Disasters Strike, Investors Turn to Adaptation Tech</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwNTYzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4OTk4Mjk2M30.kuVlX3L_fl1HJr5V87YQw1GAt-KaSOW4MQ_WIl7l2rQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As the southeastern U.S. recovers from hurricanes Helene and Milton, the
destruction the storms have left behind serves to underline the obvious:
The need for technologies that support climate change adaptation and
resilience is both real and urgent. And while nearly all the money in
climate finance still flows into mitigation tech, which seeks to lower
emissions to alleviate tomorrow’s harm, at long last, there are signs
that interest and funding for the adaptation space is picking up.
</p>
<p>
The emergence and success of climate resilience advisory and investment
firms such as Tailwind Climate and The Lightsmith Group are two signs of
this shift. Founded just last year, Tailwind recently published
<a href="https://www.tailwindclimate.com/taxonomy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
taxonomy</u></a> of activities and financing across the various sectors
of adaptation and resilience solutions to help clients understand
opportunity areas in the space. Next year, the firm’s co-founder Katie
MacDonald told me, Tailwind will likely begin raising its first fund.
It’s already invested in one company, UK-based
<a href="https://www.cryogenx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cryogenx</u></a>,
which makes a portable cooling vest to rapidly reduce the temperature of
patients experiencing heatstroke.
</p>
<p>
As for Lightsmith, the firm held the final close of its
<a href="https://lightsmithgp.com/news-posts/lightsmith-group-closes-inaugural-186-million-growth-equity-climate-fund-the-first-to-focus-on-climate-resilience-and-adaptation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$186
million growth equity fund</u></a> for climate adaptation solutions in
2022, which co-founder and managing director Jay Koh told me is one of
the first, if not <em><em>the</em></em> first fund with a climate
resilience focus. As Koh sees it, the evolution of climate adaptation
and resilience technologies can be broken up into three stages, the
first being “reactive and incremental.” That’s largely where we’re at
right now, he said — think rebuilding a dam higher after it’s been
breached in a flood, or making a firebreak broader after a destructive
wildfire. Where he’s seeing interesting companies emerge, though, is in
the more proactive second stage, which often involves anticipating and
preparing for extreme weather events. “Let’s do a lot more data and
analytics ahead of time. Let’s deploy more weather satellites. Let’s
look at
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-fire-prevention" target="_self"><u>deploying
artificial intelligence</u></a> and other technologies
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/brightband-ai-weather-forecasts" target="_self"><u>to
do better forecasting</u></a>,” Koh explained to me.
</p>
<p>
The third and final stage, he said, could be categorized as “systemic or
transcendent adaptation,” which involves systems-level changes as
opposed to incremental improvements. Source Global, one of Lightsmith’s
portfolio companies which makes solar-powered hydropanels that produce
affordable drinking water, is an example of this. As Koh told me, “It’s
not simply improving the efficiency of desalination filters by 5% or
10%. It’s saying, listen, we’re going to pull water out of the air in a
way that we have never done before.”
</p>
<p>
But while the activity and interest around adaptation tech may be
growing, the money just isn’t there yet. “We’re easily $50 [billion] to
$60 billion below where we need to be today,” MacDonald told me. “And
you know, we’re on the order of around $150 [billion] to $160 billion
below where we need to be by 2030.” Everyone else I spoke with echoed
the sentiment. “The latest statistics are that less than 5% of total
climate finance tracked on planet Earth is attributable to adaptation
and climate resilience,” Koh said. “Of that, less than 2% is private
investment.”
</p>
<p>
There’s a few reasons why early-stage investors especially may be
hesitant to throw their weight behind adaptation tech despite the clear
need in the market. Amy Francetic, co-founder and managing general
partner at Buoyant Ventures, which focuses on early-stage digital
solutions for climate risk, told me that the main customer for
adaptation solutions is often a government entity. “Municipalities and
other government contracts, they’re hard to win, they’re slow to win,
and they don’t pay that much, either, which is the problem.” Francetic
told me. “So it’s not a great customer to have.”
</p>
<p>
One of Buoyant’s portfolio companies, the now defunct StormSensor,
reinforced this lesson for Francetic. The company used sensors to track
water flow within storm and sewage systems to prevent flooding and was
able to arrange pilot projects with plenty of water agencies — but few
of them converted into paying contracts. “The municipalities were
willing to spend money on an experiment, but not so many of them had a
larger budget.” Francetic told me. The same dynamic, she said, is also
at play in the utility industry, where you often hear about new tech
succumbing to “death by pilot.”
</p>
<p>
It’s not all doom and gloom, though, when it comes to working with
larger, risk-averse agencies. AiDash, another of Lightsmith’s portfolio
companies that uses artificial intelligence to help utilities assess and
address wildfire risk, has five utility partnerships, and earlier this
year
<a href="https://www.aidash.com/news/aidash-closes-its-oversubscribed-series-c-funding-round-at-58-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>raised
$58.5 million</u></a> in an oversubscribed Series C round. Francetic and
MacDonald both told me they’re seeing the conversation around climate
adaptation evolve to include more industry stakeholders. In the past,
Francetic said, discussing resilience and adaptation was almost seen as
a form of climate doomerism. “They said, oh, why are you doing that? It
shows that you’re giving up.” But now, MacDonald told me that her
experience at this year’s climate week in New York was defined by
productive conversations with representatives from the insurance
industry, banking sector, and venture capital arena about injecting more
capital into the space.
</p>
<p>
Bill Clerico, the founder and managing partner of the venture firm
Convective Capital, is also deeply familiar with the tricky dynamics of
climate adaptation funding. Convective, founded in 2022, is solely
dedicated to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-fire-prevention" target="_self"><u>wildfire
tech</u></a> solutions. The firm’s portfolio companies span a range of
technologies that address suppression, early identification, prevention,
and insurance against damages, and are mainly looking to work with
utilities, governments, and insurance companies. When I talked to
Clerico back in August, he (understatedly) categorized these
establishments as “not necessarily the most fast-moving or innovative.”
But the bleak silver lining, he told me, is that extreme weather is
forcing them to up their tempo. “There is so much destruction happening
so frequently that it’s forcing a lot of these institutions to think
about it totally differently and to embrace newer, more novel solutions
— and to do it quickly.”
</p>
<p>
People, it seems, are starting to get real. But investors and startups
alike are also just beginning to define exactly what adaptation tech
encompasses and what metrics for success look like when they’re less
measurable than, say, the tons of carbon sucked out of the atmosphere
via direct air capture, or the amount of energy produced by a fusion
reactor.
</p>
<p>
“Nobody wakes up in the morning and buys a loaf of adaptation. You don’t
drive around in an adaptation or live in an adaptation,” Koh noted.
“What you want is food, transport, shelter, water that is resilient and
adapted to the effects of climate change.” What Koh and the team at
Lightsmith have found is that many of the companies working on these
solutions are hiding in plain sight. “They call themselves business
continuity or water efficiency or agricultural precision technologies or
supply chain management in the face of weather volatility,” Koh
explained.
</p>
<p>
In this way, the scope of adaptation technology balloons far beyond what
is traditionally climate-coded.
<a href="https://lightsmithgp.com/news-posts/lightsmith-leads-16-6-million-investment-round-in-digital-health-leader-beep-saude-supporting-climate-resilience-in-healthcare/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lightsmith
recently invested</u></a> in a Brazil-based digital health company
called Beep Saude, which enables patients to get rapid, in-home
diagnostics, vaccination services, and infusion therapies. It falls
under the umbrella of climate adaptation tech, Koh told me, because
rising temperatures, increased rainfall, and deforestation in the
country have led to a rapid increase in mosquitoes spreading diseases
such as dengue fever and the Zika virus.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, measuring the efficacy of solutions that span such a vast
problem space means a lot of customization. “Your metric might be, how
many people have asked for water in a drought-prone area?” MacDonald
told me. “And with health, it might be, how many children are safe from
wildfire smoke during fire season? And for ecosystems, it might be, how
many hectares of ecosystem have been saved as a means to reduce storm
surge?” Insurance also brings up a host of additional metrics. As
Francetic told me, “we measure things like lives and livelihoods covered
or addressed. We measure things like losses covered or underwriting
dollars spent on this.”
</p>
<p>
No matter how you categorize it or measure it, the need for these
technologies is not going away. “The drivers of adaptation and climate
resilience demand are physics and time,” Koh told me. “Whoever develops
climate resilience and adaptation technology will have a competitive
advantage over any other company, any other society, and the faster that
we can scale it up, and the smarter and more equitable we are about
deploying it, the better off we will all be.”

id="biden-again-blasts-disinformation-after-second-hurricane-batters-south">Biden
again blasts disinformation after second hurricane batters South</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — During a briefing Friday on recovery efforts after
Hurricane Milton at the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden again
warned about the spread of “disgusting” and “dangerous” misinformation
and disinformation about the federal government’s response to recent
storms.</p>
<p>Responding to a reporter’s question, Biden said that misleading
information hurts people who need the most help. “Widowers, people in
hospitals, people who are by themselves and they don’t know, and they
lose contact, and they get scared to death,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re breaking through with it. We’re breaking through with the
truth,” he said, noting that Republican governors and mayors have
supported his call to stop the spread of disinformation.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee,
has been spreading disinformation about the government’s response,
including that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is
limiting payouts to disaster survivors to $750, and that funding for
Americans who are affected by the disaster was used up to provide
housing for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>“I think those who have been spreading these lies to try to undermine
the opposition are going to pay a price for it,” Biden said, adding that
Trump is not solely to blame but has the “biggest mouth.”</p>
<p>Biden provided an update on the federal government’s response to
hurricanes Milton and Helene flanked by his top aides, including
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and Secretary of Homeland Security
Alejandro Mayorkas. He was joined virtually by Vice President Kamala
Harris from her campaign stop in Arizona.</p>
<p>Harris again warned companies against taking advantage of the storms
to increase profit.</p>
<p>“Any company or individual that is using this crisis to jack up
prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at the gas
pump, the airport or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring, and there
will be a consequence,” she said.</p>
<p>Milton deaths</p>
<p>Authorities in Florida said Friday that Hurricane Milton was
responsible for at least 16 deaths, and that more than 2 million people
remained without power as evacuees returned to their homes to assess the
damage and begin cleaning up from the storm.</p>
<p>As of midday Friday, the website poweroutage.us reported 2.3 million
people remained without power. Late Thursday, Biden said more than
50,000 line workers and 1,000 federal personnel were on the ground to
respond.</p>
<p>The storm made landfall late Wednesday near Siesta Key in Sarasota
County as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 205
kilometers per hour. It carved a path of destruction across central
Florida, affecting many communities still cleaning up from Hurricane
Helene two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>While the state’s western coast felt the direct hit from the storm,
Milton also spawned tornados that affected the southeastern part of the
state. Local media reported more than 19 tornadoes touched down even
before the hurricane made landfall. Tornadoes are believed responsible
for several deaths.</p>
<p>State government officials and the Florida National Guard reported
more than 1,000 people were rescued since the storm made landfall.</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard reported one of its aircrews rescued a man
Wednesday clinging to a cooler floating in the Gulf of Mexico 48
kilometers off the Florida coast. It said the man was later taken to
Tampa General Hospital for medical treatment.</p>
<p>State officials said while total damage assessments are still being
made, the storm could have been much worse. The population center of
Tampa was spared a direct hit, and the predicted record-setting storm
surge did not materialize.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scientists said climate change made Hurricane Milton
stronger and more dangerous.</p>
<p>In a report issued Friday, the nonprofit group Weather Attribution
said Milton went through an “explosive intensification” from a tropical
storm to a Category 5 hurricane in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The group said the rapid intensification was driven and sustained by
very high sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from Reuters, The Associated
Press and Agence France-Presse.</p>

racial disparities in stock market investments persist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Stocks are increasingly an important source of household wealth. Thanks
to the booming stock market, U.S. household wealth surged to a record
high last year, per Federal Reserve data. But there are continued racial
differences in stock ownership, which has big implications for the
racial wealth gap. We’ll learn more. Also on the show: producer prices
remain tame, and business travel spending rebounds.

After the storm, we rebuild. That’s the mantra repeated by residents,
businesses and elected officials after any big storm. Hurricane Milton
may have avoided the worst case scenario of a direct hit on the Tampa
Bay area, but communities south of Tampa experienced heavy flooding just
a couple weeks after being hit by Hurricane Helene.
</p>
<p>
While the damage is still being assessed in Sarasota County’s barrier
islands, homes that require extensive renovations will almost certainly
run up against what is known as the 50% rule — or, in Southwest Florida,
the
“<a href="https://www.swflappraisals.com/fema-fifty-percent-rule/#:~:text=And%20the%2050%25%20rule%20states,most%20recent%20flood%20prevention%20regulations." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dreaded</u></a>
50% rule.”
</p>
<p>
In flood zone-situated communities eligible to receive insurance from
the National Flood Insurance Program, any renovations to repair
“substantial damage” — defined as repairs whose cost exceeds 50% of the
value of the structure (not the land, which can often be quite valuable
due to its proximity to the water) — must bring the entire structure
“into compliance with current local floodplain management standards.” In
practice, this typically means elevating the home above what FEMA
defines as the area’s
“<a href="https://www.fema.gov/about/glossary/base-flood-elevation-bfe#:~:text=The%20elevation%20of%20surface%20water,%2C%20V1%E2%80%93V30%20and%20VE." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>base
flood elevation</u></a>,” which is the level that a “100-year-flood”
would reach, plus some amount determined by the building code.
</p>
<p>
The rule almost invites conflict. Because just as much as local
communities and homeowners want to restore things to the way they were,
the federal government doesn’t want to insure structures that are simply
going to get destroyed. On Siesta Key, where Milton made landfall, the
base flood elevation ranges from 7 feet to 9 feet, meaning that
elevating a home to comply with flood codes could be beyond the means —
or at least the insurance payouts — of some homeowners.
</p>
<p>
“You got a 1952 house that’s 1,400 square feet, and you get 4 feet of
water,” Jeff Brandes, a former state legislator and president of the
Florida Policy Project, told me on Wednesday, explaining how the rule
could have played out in Tampa. “That means new kitchens and new
bathrooms, all new flooring and baseboards and drywall to 4 or 5 feet.”
That kind of claim could easily run to $150,000, which might well
surpass the FEMA threshold. “Now all of the sudden you get into the 50%
rule that you have the entire house up to current code levels. But then
you have to do another half-a-million above what [insurance] paid you.”
</p>
<p>
Simple probability calculations show that a 100-year flood (which is
really a flood elevation that has a 1-in-100 chance of occurring every
year) has a more than 25% chance of occurring during the lifetime of a
mortgage. If you browse Siesta Key real estate on Zillow, much of it is
given a 100% chance of flooding sometime over the course of a 30-year
mortgage, according to data analysis by First Street.
</p>
<p>
Sarasota County as a whole has around 62,000 NFIP policies with some
$16.6 billion in total coverage (although more than 80% percent of
households have
<a href="https://www.harrisinsurance.com/sarasota-fl-flood-insurance-coverage/#:~:text=Not%20acquiring%20flood%20insurance%20in,do%20not%20have%20flood%20insurance." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no
flood insurance at all)</u></a>. Considering that flood insurance is

in high-risk areas for federally-backed mortgages and for new homeowners

by Florida’s state backed property insurer of last resort</u></a>,
Citizens, FEMA is likely to take a close interest in whether communities
affected by Milton and Helene are complying with its rules.<br/>
</p>
<p>
If 2022’s Hurricane Ian is any indication, squabbles over the 50% rule
are almost certain to emerge — and soon.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year,
<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/04/lee-county-fema-flood-zone-construction-50-percent-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FEMA
told Lee County</u></a>, which includes Fort Myers and Cape Coral, that
it was rescinding the discount its residents and a handful of towns
within it receive on flood insurance because, the agency claimed, more
than 600 homeowners had violated the 50% rule after Hurricane Ian.
Following an outcry from local officials and congressional
representatives,
<a href="https://winknews.com/2024/07/19/cape-coral-keeps-fema-flood-discount/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FEMA
restored the discount</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In their efforts to avoid triggering the rule, homeowners are hardly
rogue actors. Local governments often actively assist them.
</p>
<p>
FEMA had initiated a similar procedure in Lee County the year before,
threatening to drop homeowners from the flood insurance program for
using possibly inaccurate appraisals to avoid the 50% rule before
<a href="https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2023/02/22/fema-50-percent-rule-lee-county-florida-appraiser-property-values-allowed-hurricane-ian/69933389007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>eventually
relenting</u></a>. The <em><em>Fort Myers News Press</em></em> reported
that the appraisals were provided by the county, which was deliberately
“lowering the amount that residents could use to calculate their repairs
or rebuilds” to avoid triggering the rule.
</p>
<p>
Less than a month after Ian swept through Southwest Florida, Cape Coral
advised residents to
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CityofCapeCoral/posts/pfbid0213LAr9too6BDBe24yDiDhdMiKPU3z9Eehk99eLPGQLpcco58oXeN8DinvYFzRG3Sl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delay
and slow down repairs</u></a> for the same reason, as the rule there
applied to money spent on repairs over the course of a year. Some
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=treasury+island+lookback+period&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS940US940&oq=treasury+island+lookback+period&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgcIBRAhGKsCMgcIBhAhGKsCMgcIBxAhGKsC0gEINTE2OGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=Belleair%20Beach%20homeowners,news%20%E2%80%BA%20local%20%E2%80%BA%20pinellascounty" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>highly
exposed coastal communities</u></a> in Pinellas County have been
adjusting their “lookback rules” — the period over which repairs are
totaled to see if they hit the 50% rule — to make them shorter so
homeowners are less likely to have to make the substantive repairs
<a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/local/pinellascounty/homes-lookback-period-repair/67-15fadaa0-bf77-4399-9a1c-f65f285b3b49" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>required</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
This followed similar actions by local governments in Charlotte County.
As the <em><em>Punta Gordon Sun</em></em> put it, “City Council members
learned the federal regulation impacts its homeowners — and they decided
to do something about it.” In the Sarasota County community of North
Port, local officials
<a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/venice/2022/11/23/hurricane-ian-recovery-north-port-eases-rules-rebuild-floods/10761279002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scrapped
a rule</u></a> that added up repair costs over a five-year period to
make it possible for homeowners to rebuild without triggering elevation
requirements.
</p>
<p>
When the 50% rule “works,” it can lead to the communities most affected
by big storms being fundamentally changed, both in terms of the
structures that are built and who occupies them. The end result of the
rebuilding following Helene and Milton — or the next big storm to hit
Florida’s Gulf Coast — or the one after that, and so on — may be
wealthier homeowners in more resilient homes essentially serving as a
flood barrier for everyone else, and picking up more of the bill if the
waters rise too high again.
</p>
<p>
Florida’s Gulf Coast has long been seen as a place where the middle
class can afford beachfront property. Elected officials’ resistance to
the FEMA rule only goes to show just how important keeping a lid on the
cost of living — quite literally, the cost of legally inhabiting a
structure — is to the voters and residents they represent.
</p>
<p>
Still, said Brandes, “There’s the right way to come out of this thing.
The wrong way is to build exactly back what you built before.”

<h2 id="what-happens-to-a-landfill-in-a-hurricane">What Happens to a
Landfill in a Hurricane?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDIxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjQ2OTkyN30.2B4I1U8C-uMyLHuj5ZYyPuRmBDBztHHT_wPNFkCoTPc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In the coming days and weeks, as Floridians and others in storm-ravaged
communities clean up from Hurricane Milton, trucks will carry all manner
of storm-related detritus — chunks of buildings, fences, furniture, even
cars — to the same place all their other waste goes: the local landfill.
But what about the landfill itself? Does this gigantic trash pile take
to the air and scatter Dorito bags and car parts alike around the
surrounding region?
</p>
<p>
No, thankfully. As Richard Meyers, the director of land management
services at the Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County, assured me,
all landfill waste is covered with soil on “at least a weekly basis,”
and certainly right before a hurricane, preventing the waste from being
kicked up. “Aerodynamically, [the storm is] rolling over that covered
waste. It’s not able to blow six inches of cover soil from the top of
the waste.”
</p>
<p>
But just because a landfill won’t turn into a mass of airborne dirt and
half-decomposed projectiles doesn’t mean there’s nothing to worry about.
Because landfills — especially large ones — often contain more advanced
infrastructure such as gas collection systems, which prevent methane
from being vented into the atmosphere, and drainage systems, which
collect contaminated liquid that’s pooled at the bottom of the waste
pile and send it off for treatment. Meyers told me that getting these
systems back online after a storm if they’ve been damaged is “the most
critical part, from our standpoint.”
</p>
<p>
A flood-inundated gas collection system can mean more methane escaping
into the air, and storm-damaged drainage pipes can lead to waste liquids
leaking into the ground and potentially polluting water sources. The
latter was a
<a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/news-release/usda-rural-development-awards-municipality-juncos-grant-23693000-repair-landfill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major
concern in Puerto Rico</u></a> after Hurricane Maria destroyed a
landfill’s waste liquid collection system in the Municipality of Juncos
in 2017.
</p>
<p>
As for methane, calculating exactly how much could be released as a
result of a dysfunctional landfill gas collection system requires
accounting for myriad factors such as the composition of the waste and
the climate that it’s in, but the back of the envelope calculations
don’t look promising. The
<a href="https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/service/facilityDetail/2022?id=1003560&ds=E&et=&popup=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Southeast
County Landfill near Tampa</u></a>, for instance, emitted about 100,000
metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2022, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency (although a Harvard engineering study from earlier
this year suggests that this may be a
<a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2024/05/epa-underestimates-methane-emissions-landfills-urban-areas#:~:text=Research%20highlights%20importance%20of%20high%2Dresolution%20methane%20accounting&text=The%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency%20(EPA,27%25%20higher%20than%20EPA%20estimates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>significant
underestimate</u></a>). The EPA estimates that gas collection systems
are about 75% effective, which means that the landfill generates a total
of about 400,000 metric tons of CO2-worth of methane. If Southeast
County Landfill’s gas collection system were to go down completely for
even a day, that would mean extra methane emissions of roughly 822
metric tons of CO2 equivalent. That difference amounts to the daily
emissions of more than 65,000 cars.
</p>
<p>
That’s a lot of math. But the takeaway is: Big landfills in the pathway
of a destructive storm could end up spewing a lot of methane into the
atmosphere. And keep in mind that these numbers are just for
<em><em>one</em></em> hypothetical landfill with a gas collection system
that goes down for <em><em>one</em></em> day. The emissions numbers, you
can imagine, start to look much worse if you consider the possibility
that floodwaters could impede access to infrastructure for even longer.
</p>
<p>
So stay strong out there, landfills of Florida. You may not be the star
of this show, but you’ve got our attention.

harder for homeowners and insurers to estimate each one’s impact — and
likely drive up recovery costs. Also in this episode: Corporate bonds

a Fight over Cables Could Kill Offshore Wind in New Jersey</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDA2Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDY0NzEwNn0.Efdy9fizQg1lk5y2dKa_fBs4bfZQASn9LqsyUIisWiA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
One of the biggest threats to American offshore wind is a handful of
homeowners on the south Jersey shoreline spouting unproven theories
about magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
Within a year of forming, the activist group “Stop The High-Risk Cables”
has galvanized local politicians against the transmission infrastructure
being planned for wind turbines off the coast of New Jersey known as the
<a href="https://bpuoffshorewind.nj.gov/prebuild-solicitation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Larrabee
Pre-built Infrastructure</u></a>. The transmission route, which will run
a few miles from the beaches of Sea Girt, New Jersey, to a substation
nearby, is expected to be a crucial landing zone for power from major
offshore wind projects in south Jersey waters, including Atlantic
Shores, a joint venture between EDF Renewables and Shell that received
final permits from federal regulators last week.
</p>
<p>
The only problem: while state regulators have been busy planning the
route for the transmission and selecting who will build it, opponents
have managed to win the war of public opinion. Activists have clearly
turned their neighbors against the plan, pushing the mayors of the four
boroughs targeted for Pre-Built Infrastructure to come out against the
project. And this weekend Jack Ciattarelli – who narrowly lost the race
for the governor’s mansion last year and is running again in 2025 –
joined activists rallying against the project and is
<a href="https://x.com/Jack4NJ/status/1842963189891563676" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
campaigning</u></a> on ending the project and cable landings like it.
</p>
<p>
Since federal regulators control the waters, what this means is, unless
Democrats hit the electoral jackpot over the next year, offshore wind in
New Jersey could be screwed – even if Kamala Harris wins the White
House.
</p>
<p>
What makes this more dire is, this isn’t any ol’ transmission. For other
offshore wind projects like Empire Wind, states have forced developers
to design and construct their own transmission landings, creating a
somewhat disorganized situation resembling electrical spaghetti. New
Jersey’s offshore wind transmission meanwhile has been studied for years
and is supposed to minimize development on the shoreline. This means the
combat over this cabling could decide the fates of multiple offshore
wind projects – and the first major proactive plan to reduce beach-level
environmental impacts that stymie offshore wind in the first place.
</p>
<p>
So I decided to dive deep into the campaign against the so-called
“high-risk” cables. After a series of interviews with organizers and a
mayor critical of the state’s processes, I’ve been left feeling this
relatively small transmission project represents a true test for
democracy’s role in climate action. Could a small band of organized
individuals be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/wind-farm-protests-leah-stokes-pnas" target="_self"><u>all
it takes</u></a> to hold back decarbonization at the pace scientists say
is necessary, no matter how many climate laws are passed?
</p>
<h3>
The Magnetic Fields
</h3>
<p>
Sea Girt resident Kimberly Paterson remembers when she first heard about
the cables. Someone had left a postcard on her door about the project.
Before that, the professional executive leadership trainer had devoted
her activism to preserving maritime forests on the beach. Once made
aware of the transmission cables though, she and her small coterie of
environmentally-conscious neighbors got active.
</p>
<p>
Paterson said they also started getting looped in with an existing
network of activists concerned about offshore wind infrastructure. Those
activists included familiar characters to the fight over New Jersey
offshore wind development.
</p>
<p>
People like Mike Dean of Save the East Coast and Cindy Zipf of Clean
Ocean Action, who’ve spread theories without evidence about a spate of
whale deaths being tied to pile drivers for offshore wind. She says her
group’s work is focused on the cables, not offshore wind, despite the
close allyship with these other actors. As she simply put it, “There’s a
circle of people that you meet.”
</p>
<p>
“We do like to work with others, and communicate with others, but we’re
not officially tied to any of those other groups.”
</p>
<p>
The group also started canvassing, making signage for homeowners, and
holding public events. As calls for action grew, so too did the
political focus on the area, as state legislators and members of
Congress took up the issue.
</p>
<p>
“We have created an absolute firestorm here,” Paterson told me. ’It is
unbelievable what we’ve accomplished.”
</p>
<p>
The group is focused on what they believe to be the health risks of
simply being near high-voltage power lines.
</p>
<p>
To understand their fears, think of an electric current going through a
wire. The more current goes through a wire, the higher likelihood of
electrical waves emanating from the current’s pathway. That’s where
“electro-magnetic fields” come into play. These fields are all around us
and even Earth emits them. It’s the result of an excess of energy.
<br/><br/>The World Health Organization
<a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/electromagnetic-fields" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>classifies
even</u></a> low amounts of electromagnetic fields as a possible
carcinogen, citing studies around exposure and childhood leukemia rates.
But as many environmental and health
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/radtown/electric-and-magnetic-fields-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>experts
note</u></a>, studies to date have not really linked cancer occurrences
to prolonged exposure to these fields. The Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management
<a href="https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/BOEM-Electromagnetic-Fields-Offshore-Wind-Facilities_1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>says
the</u></a> electro-magnetic fields created by cables for offshore wind
“are well below the recommended threshold values for human exposure.” So
like whales and wind, it’s something to watch out for, but there’s no
evidence to date of a danger here.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, seeking to calm any resident’s fears of magnetic fields,
the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities last week convened their first
public hearing within the planned development area.<br/>
</p>
<p>
At the event, numerous officials came and spoke to the project’s safety,
including the executive director of the Board. They even played a long
explanatory video from a consultant they hired to review the
electro-magnetic fields that would come from the cables. The full
presentation laid out numerous examples of what they said were similar
underground and underwater transmission lines with magnetic emissions
that had no discernable impact on public health, including lines in the
New Jersey-New York region.
</p>
<p>
One person moved by the presentation’s efforts on magnetic fields was
Mike Mangan, mayor of Manasquan, one of the boroughs that may be
selected to host some of the transmission infrastructure. Mangan told me
he joined with other mayors to press the state for more transparency on
the cables at the behest of concerned constituents. But he didn’t know
what the state knew about the magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll just be candid — I was ignorant on a lot of that,” he
acknowledged. Mangan said he still has “a few very serious concerns” but
“I think they addressed some of the bigger concerns,” including the
magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
I’ll admit, I felt the same. So far in The Fight, we’ve chronicled
examples where there are at least somewhat reasonable concerns about
renewable energy development – stuff like batteries
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/hecate-energy-acton-mike-garcia" target="_self"><u>sited
in wildfire risk areas</u></a> and solar farms
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/center-biological-diversity-tortoise-solar" target="_self"><u>in
imperiled tortoise habitat</u></a>. But in this case, I watched the
entire presentation online and left thinking this was essentially a
non-issue.
</p>
<p>
Yet Paterson says she was unconvinced by the presentation. The projects
they’re citing aren’t comparable, she claims. And then she has a laundry
list of other complaints about the potential cables.
</p>
<p>
Hearing her talk about the transmission, you’d think she just doesn’t
want this built under any circumstances. So I asked her if, given her
allies, the goal is to stop offshore wind. An avid wildlife painter, she
says no, and that she’s “very strongly in support of alternative
energy.”
</p>
<p>
Well, okay. Maybe it’s political or partisan then? I asked her who she’s
voting for in this year’s presidential election. “I don’t like anyone in
the election to be quite honest,” she confessed, self-identifying simply
as a “libertarian.” She then added: “I love the idea of Robert F.
Kennedy [Jr.] revolutionizing our health-care system. That makes me very
excited.”
</p>
<h2>
Tug of war over power lines
</h2>
<p>
Last week, Heatmap published a risk index of the top 10 renewable energy
projects worth watching for potential cancellation or major blowback to
the energy transition.
</p>
<p>
We listed Atlantic Shores in the top five, primarily citing the
project’s current role as a focal point for opponents to offshore wind
up and down the Atlantic coastline. Hours after the risk index was
published, Atlantic Shores received its final approval from the Bureau
of Ocean Energy Management.
</p>
<p>
Despite that win, we’re leaving the project on the index because the
cables have to be built too – and that stands to be a more stressful
fight.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t supposed to be hard. In 2021, New Jersey passed a law granting
the Board of Public Utilities the authority to supersede local
governments opposing easements and other permits for offshore wind
transmission cables. But that law’s permissibility under the state
constitution hasn’t been tested yet, thanks to the cancellation of
Orsted’s Ocean Wind project, which was set to be the
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-state-government-phil-murphy-climate-and-environment-utilities-b23542107c4369a1b842dae985e0e7a0" target="_blank"><u>likeliest
battleground over cables</u></a> before Atlantic Shores.
</p>
<p>
State officials are expected in the coming weeks to lay out who will
actually build the transmission infrastructure and the route it’ll take
from Sea Girt to the Larrabee substation. Between the day of that
announcement and the completion of construction, a lot can go awry.
Donald Trump could win the presidency and, as opponents of offshore wind
expect, revisit permitting decisions for projects like Atlantic Shores.
Or a Republican like Jack Ciattarelli could win the governor’s mansion,
and that person could take any number of steps to undermine the cables
like leaving the local control law undefended in state court if it’s
challenged.
</p>
<p>
All this risk to the energy transition, started by a handful of actors
with unfounded claims about magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
I asked Atlantic Shores for comment on the opposition movement. They did
not get back to me.
</p>
<p>
However, I did hear from the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, a
consortium of developers trying to build offshore wind off the state
coast. “While we are advocates of civil discourse and engagement from
communities, we urge residents to be mindful of prevalent
misinformation,” said Paulina O’Connor, executive director of the
alliance, in a statement sent to me Tuesday evening.
</p>
<p>
“By following best practices in environmental science and engineering,
such as proper siting, minimizing disruption during construction, and
adherence to all state and federal regulations, this infrastructure can
be safely and responsibly integrated into our communities and local and
regional power grids to provide resilient and reliable power to New
Jersey homes,” O’Connor continued.
</p>
<p>
I also heard from Anjuli Ramos-Busot, executive director of Sierra
Club’s New Jersey chapter, who contacted me last night after Atlantic
Shores and the offshore wind alliance brought my reporting to their
attention.
</p>
<p>
“Let us be clear, the microwave in your kitchen emits more
electromagnetic currents than cables buried deep underground covered by
insulation and concrete,” Ramos-Busot said in a statement. “This
technology is vetted, goes through rigorous permitting standards, and is
safe and responsible for both the environment and local communities.”
</p>
<p>
Candidly, I’m holding my breath on whether Sierra Club’s words will win
over these concerned shore residents.

<p class="drop-caps">
Maybe Sharpiegate wasn’t so funny after all.
</p>
<p>
You’ll recall the micro-controversy from 2019, when then-President
Donald Trump said that Hurricane Dorian was headed toward Alabama (which
it wasn’t), and officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration were
<a href="https://time.com/5775953/trump-dorian-alabama-sharpiegate-noaa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pressured</u></a>
to back up Trump’s mistake. It culminated in Trump presenting a map in
the Oval Office on which someone drew a bubble atop the projected path
of the storm so it would stretch into Alabama, apparently with a
Sharpie.
</p>
<p>
At the time it was troubling but comical, a representation of how the
cult-like adoration Trump demanded would distort the work of government
in idiotic ways. Five years later, with a storm surge of misinformation
pouring over the country in response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, it
looks more like a harbinger of things to come.
</p>
<p>
In any crisis, some measure of confusion is inevitable. Rumors spread
and misunderstandings proliferate, fed by fear and desperation. The most
extravagant varieties of misinformation are often either short-lived or
confined to a minority of the population. That has not been true,
however, when it comes to Helene, and it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-milton-misinformation" target="_self"><u>looks
like</u></a> Milton will repeat the same pattern. This time, the
misinformation is more explicitly partisan than ever before, and it
portends a disturbing future in which every natural disaster could
become not just a challenging task of rescue and cleanup but a
simultaneous fight against falsehoods and conspiracy theories.
</p>
<p>
It’s not that disasters have never been political; presidents are often
judged by how they react (anyone over 40 knows what the phrase

you’re doing a heckuva job</u></a>” refers to), with politicians
discredited or elevated by how they performed and the opposition taking
the opportunity to criticize the administration’s competence. But Trump
has given that familiar criticism a particularly venomous cast, claiming
not just that the disaster response is falling short but that President
Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are
<em><em>intentionally</em></em> ignoring the victims because of who they
are.
</p>
<p>
Trump has focused in particular on
<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/376982/trump-hurricane-helene-fema-lies-debunked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three
falsehoods</u></a>: First, that the federal government is abandoning
hurricane victims in areas where there are lots of Republican voters;
<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/10/trumps-false-claim-of-stolen-disaster-relief-funds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>second</u></a>,
that funds for recovery are unavailable because the Biden administration
gave them to undocumented immigrants (“they stole the FEMA money, just
like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal
immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season”); and
third, that the $750 distributed immediately to survivors to enable them
to obtain food and other basics, known as Serious Needs Assistance, is
all the aid anyone will get.
</p>
<p>
It was like a bat-signal: As soon as Trump set the terms, conservative
media and influencers
<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/right-wing-media-are-falsely-claiming-fema-spent-their-resources-migrants-instead-helping" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>swung
into action</u></a>, repeating Trump’s bogus
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/charlie-kirk-elon-musk-hurricane-helene-fema-misinformation-x-twitter.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claims</u></a>
to their audiences. And then things took a strange turn.
</p>
<p>
To bring a conspiracy theory into the mainstream, you need individuals
and outlets who serve as disinformation linkages, connecting the crazier
people and ideas to those with legitimacy. In this case, Representative
Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, played a key role, and
she had a message: The weather is being manipulated by a shadowy
conspiracy with powerful technologies at its disposal. “Yes they can
control the weather,” she
<a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1842755981312196688" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted
on X</u></a> to her 3.7 million followers. “Anyone who says they don’t,
or makes fun of this, is lying to you.”
</p>
<p>
As evidence, Greene and her allies offer the fact that many people have
<em><em>proposed</em></em> geoengineering as a solution to a warming
planet, which in their eyes means it must already be taking place, and
that’s why these hurricanes came to the Southeast. And who is “They”? It
might be the government, but to many, it’s obviously the Jews.
</p>
<p>
Antisemitic conspiracy theories around the hurricanes are swirling on
the fetid sewer of right-wing hate and misinformation controlled by the
world’s richest individual. As the <em><em>Washington Post</em></em>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/08/hurricane-helene-antisemitic-misinformation-x/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>,
“The attacks, which include wild claims that Jewish officials are
conspiring to orchestrate the disasters, sabotage the recovery or even
seize victims’ property, are being fomented largely on Elon Musk’s X.”
</p>
<p>
The tide of misinformation can be partly explained by the calendar.
“What’s different about this natural disaster is the timing,” says
Danielle Lee Tomson of the Center for an Informed Public at the
University of Washington. “We’ve never had such an incredible,
devastating natural disaster within weeks of a presidential election
that has impacted two swing states,” North Carolina and Georgia. That
gives purchase to the claims that there are conspiracies afoot to change
the outcome of the election.
</p>
<p>
In 2024, it may have been inevitable that a disaster would be tied,
however implausibly, to the “one narrative to rule them all this
election cycle, which is that of non-citizen voting,” Tomson notes.
</p>
<p>
Disaster makes people search for answers that give order to chaos and
suffering. Even answers that describe a world of sinister forces can be
weirdly comforting, by assuring their adherents that they are among a
select group who understand the reality most people miss. Amidst the
chaos, you can grasp onto whatever bizarre belief you choose.
</p>
<p>
In the future, we might expect that any climate-linked disaster —
hurricanes, floods, heat waves, droughts — will become fodder for this
kind of misinformation, not just passed around from person to person but
driven from the top of the political food chain.
</p>
<p>
In effect, this is the inverse of the kind of climate misinformation
we’re more used to, which goes under the heading of “denial”: denying
that temperatures are increasing, or that carbon pollution is a problem,
or that human activity drives climate change. Since the occurrence of a
hurricane or fire or other observably extreme event can’t be denied,
this new kind of misinformation actually posits not just that the
effects of climate change are real, but that they’re
<em><em>worse</em></em> than you realize. It isn’t just that people have
lost their lives or their homes due to a disaster, but that the disaster
was engineered by sinister forces (including but not limited to the
government) to accomplish a nefarious political goal.
</p>
<p>
So yesterday’s climate denier could become tomorrow’s climate obsessive,
seeing in every disaster the hidden hand of the same global conspiracy
that is creating all the world’s problems. “Climate change is the new
covid,”
<a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1843432743163834722" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
Congresswoman Greene; “Ask your government if the weather is manipulated
or controlled.” It’s not fake, it’s a plot, one getting worse with each
upward tick in global temperatures.
</p>
<p>
Of course, misinformation comes in a variety of forms — some
<a href="https://x.com/florida_grand/status/1843641980523557185?s=46" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>downplayed</u></a>
Milton as a way of arguing that the elites are trying to frighten you —
and even debunkings can be a path to elevated social media clout when so
much focus is on these events.
</p>
<p>
It may be, as Tomson argues, that it takes something like an impending
election to turn conspiracy theorizing around disasters up to 11. “We’ve
never seen such an opportune moment to repackage disaster for political
gain,” she told me. But the effects of climate change will only grow
more intense and dramatic, and there will be political actors looking to
turn them against their opponents — and frightened people ready to
believe the worst.

<p>
<strong>1. Nantucket County, Massachusetts</strong> – A new group –
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/keepnantucketwild/" target="_blank"><u>Keep
Nantucket Wild</u></a> – is mobilizing opposition to the Vineyard Wind
offshore wind project, seeking to capitalize on the recent blade
breakage to sever the town of Nantucket’s good neighbor agreement with
project developer Avangrid.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Keep Nantucket Wild was started weeks ago by raw bar restaurateur Jesse
Sandole and yoga studio owner Evie O’Connor. The group already has
amassed
<a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/petition-for-the-nantucket-select-board-to-withdraw-from-the-good-neighbor-agreement-enact-a-moratorium-on-all-future-offshore-wind-projects-off-our-shores?source=twitter&" target="_blank"><u>more
than 1,000 signatures</u></a> on a petition to the town select board to
pull out of the good neighbor agreement.<br/>

company payment into a community fund and promises to reduce nighttime
visual impacts.

</ul>
<p>
<strong>2. East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana</strong> – One lowkey
local election this fall may decide the future of Louisiana’s
renewables: the swing seat on the state’s Public Service Commission,
which is being vacated this year by a retiring moderate Republican.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Only 3% of Louisiana’s power generation came
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=LA#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20coal%20fueled%20about,of%20Louisiana's%20total%20electricity%20generation." target="_blank"><u>from
renewables</u></a> last year but that’s poised for significant growth
thanks to offshore wind development
<a href="https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/gulf-mexico-activities" target="_blank"><u>in
the Gulf</u></a> and the PSC’s decision over the summer to let Entergy
expand its solar capacity in the state
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/entergy-louisiana-psc-solar-procurement/716944/" target="_blank"><u>by
3 GW</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
State Sen. J.P. Coussan is one of the leading candidates for the opening
on the PSC. A Republican, he said at an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO7Y_6rBiQI" target="_blank"><u>event
last month</u></a> that he’s open to more solar but is worried about
“losing the farmland” that could be used by the sugar business. He also
believes renewables will ultimately make up “lower than overall 10% of
the power matrix.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
There are two other candidates for the open seat: Republican former
state Sen. Julie Quinn, who is a dyed-in-the-wool conservative and
opposes renewables, and Democrat Nick Laborde, who deeply supports
renewables but has never served in public office and currently works in
human resources.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. Logan County, Ohio </strong>– Invenergy’s Fountain Point
solar project cleared a hurdle with the Ohio Power Siting Board last
month. But the 280 megawatt proposal may face a lengthy appeals process,
according to Mike Yoder, a county commissioner who had recently served
as an ad hoc member of the OPSB.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Yoder, whose county is where the project is proposed, told
<a href="https://www.peakofohio.com/local-news/listen-up-commissioner-mike-yoder" target="_blank"><u>local
radio</u></a> on Monday that the project is not affected by a recent law
empowering counties against solar and wind as challenges to the project
began before the law was passed.<br/>
</li>
<li>
But discussing potential challenges to the state Supreme Court, Yoder
said he expects construction is still “well down the road.”
</li>
<li>
“I know that we got some emails from folks who were concerned we would
be voting on it and moving forward and everything happened in two or
three days and that’s not really the way it’s going to be,” he said.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>4. Riverside County, California </strong>– The federal
government is now taking
<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2030262/510" target="_blank">public
comment</a> on a 100+ megawatt solar farm proposed in the California
desert in an area demarcated as a priority for energy development.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Sapphire Solar project, which was proposed by EDF Renewables, has
also been

<strong>Transmissions on transmission </strong>– The Energy Department
last week
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-transmission-planning-study" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released
a must-read</a> national planning study for transmission to connect
renewables to the grid through 2040.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The takeaway? We could reduce billions of tonnes of CO2 emissions with
interregional transmission and constraining development would require
new nuclear and hydrogen energy to meet emission reduction targets,
instead of solar, wind, and batteries.<br/>
</li>
<li>
The lengthy report didn’t go into the permitting challenges at all
though and the mapping does read aspirational if you know the context.

regulations, meaning at least two Biden regulatory tailwinds for
renewables developers remains in play.

This means those challenges will have to weave their way through the

There’s still an outstanding request for the high court to stay EPA’s

<p>
This week we chatted with Jason Kaminsky, CEO of renewables insurance
data firm kWh Analytics. Kaminsky has been laser focused on the real
risks of physical damage solar and battery projects face – and the fears
host communities feel about them. We talked about how those risks
compare to fossil fuels and whether innovation could cure this industry
ailment.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The following is an edited version of our conversation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are fossil fuel projects more or less insurable than the
renewable projects you cover? </strong>
</p>
<p>
On the whole, renewables are more exposed to natural catastrophe risk.
You’re putting glass out onto a field that has hail or fire or what have
you, and you see more exposure to natural events than you would [even] a
spinning turbine that’s surrounded by steel. When we were getting to
insuring property, the first risk that came onto our radar screen was
hail risk. The industry had shifted development into Texas for a variety
of reasons and the insurance companies at that point in time were not
recalibrating their models for the fact there’s actually quite
significant hail in Texas. And we were seeing significant losses.
</p>
<p>
It’s not uncommon to have multiple $50 million loss events in any given
year for solar projects due to hail, typically in Texas, Oklahoma.
That’s the zone of hail. And we don’t see that with a gas facility
particularly because, well, it’s in a building.
</p>
<p>
But it’s way more distributed than a single fossil fuel facility, so
even if you have a $50 million loss, that does not have an impact on the
ability of the grid to generate.
</p>
<p>
The part of the facility that is not damaged will continue to produce
power and put power onto the grid. You get many more partial loss events
versus a gas facility where the turbine goes and you basically have a
total loss. Your ability to distribute your risk is much greater with
renewables, which is a very strong pro from an insurance underwriting
perspective.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are new technologies helping with renewables’ insurability?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
In the last few years, there’s been a lot of innovation. At RE+ you walk
among the floor of battery providers and they all have very impressive
fire management capabilities, and it’s at the forefront of how they
market their technology. You also see that with solar modules some have
said, <em><em>we’re hail resistant</em></em>. The way they’re putting
sensors onto cells, the way they’re running controls on cooling devices,
the way thermal management systems and battery management systems have
abilities to vent for heat… they’ve made a lot of improvements.
</p>
<p>
But it’s interesting – I was at an asset management conference in March
and I’d been going to that conference for 10 years, and it was the first
time I’d heard at that conference about the social license to operate.
They’re seeing these quasi-local thought leader groups that all seem to
be using the same talking points that oppose large scale solar in their
communities, and they push local regulatory rules to reduce the ability
to develop solar in their backyards. It was encouraging to see a
discussion around it and an acknowledgement that as an industry we need
to go into these communities and spend time talking to the local
communities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fascinating. Do you think discussions like these are enough to
mean progress in dealing with project opposition? </strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s not historically been in the DNA of our industry to do that. I’d
say today the opposition is much more organized than many renewable
energy developers today so it’s been this interesting phenomenon. The
local opposition says <em><em>we don’t want this industrial
solar</em></em>. It’s proven to be effective at killing some of these
utility scale deals.
</p>
<p>
We still have a long way to go in educating communities and getting them
comfortable with the land stewardship that happens at these facilities.
The solar industry manages a ton of land. It’s not my core focus but
I’ve been exposed to those challenges around the community engagement
piece and I think most developers are still building the muscle in how
to do that effectively.

Milton Crashes Into Tampa’s Development Boom</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
In around 12 hours, Hurricane Milton is set to make landfall within
miles of Tampa Bay, a region that is home to
<a href="https://stateoftheregion.com/our-region/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 5 million</u></a> people. Once a sleepy retirement community, the
area has seen a major development boom in recent years fueled by
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tampa-why-gen-z-and-millennial-tourists-are-flocking-to-this-retirement-mecca-1e2be027" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Millennials
and Gen Zers</u></a> seeking the perks of coastal living; it was
<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/tampa-bay/2024/05/28/fastest-growing-cities-florida-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
11th fastest-growing city</u></a> of its size in the U.S. as of this
spring and has been expected to continue to grow at nearly twice the
rate of the rest of the country over the next five years. A
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/tampa-florida-hurricane-milton-vulnerabilities-2febd205" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third</u></a>
of those residents, including many of the newcomers, live in low-lying
neighborhoods now under urgent evacuation notices due to the threat of
“unsurvivable” storm surge, which could rise up to 15 feet.
</p>
<p>
The development boom that has made Tampa Bay so desirable is also why
it’s particularly vulnerable. In an analysis of Hurricane Ian — the most
expensive storm in Florida’s history, which struck just south of
Milton’s projected track in 2022 — the re-insurance company Swiss Re
<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/hurricane/2023/09/29/florida-home-storm-damage-building-codes-population-boom/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that if the storm had struck in the 1970s, it would have caused a third
to a half as much damage. Simply put: You can’t adapt your way out of a
hurricane problem.
</p>
<p>
If there is anyone to talk to about the vulnerabilities unique to Tampa
Bay, it’s Stephen M. Strader, an associate professor and hazard
geographer at Villanova University. Our conversation has been edited and
condensed for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You shared
</strong><a href="https://x.com/StephenMStrader/status/1843282278996398432" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>an
image on Twitter</strong></u></a><strong> of the explosive growth in the
Tampa Bay area between 1940 and 2024. Why does this make the region
vulnerable to a storm like Milton? Is it just about there being more
people there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
When we think about disasters, we think of the intersection of three
components: a violent event, like what we have with Milton;
vulnerability, or what types of people could be in the path, which could
be related to racial divides, age, and gender norms; and what a lot of
my work focuses on, exposure.
</p>
<p>
Exposure is just the number of people or things that we care about —
businesses, schools, and things like that — that are subject to losses
if an event occurs. Florida is a great example of rapid urbanization
since the 1900s, and it’s rapid development in a very hazard-prone
region.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It can be easy for outsiders to sit back and wonder why anyone
would buy a house on the water or on a barrier island near
Tampa.</strong>
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of factors that come into play when you think about
where we develop and why we develop certain locations. One of the
biggest pressures that we see is that it’s desirable land: In the short
term, people want to live near the water. It’s beautiful! People don’t
think necessarily about the risk that comes with it because they’re too
focused on their dream, which is to live near the ocean.
</p>
<p>
The other side of that is, from an economic standpoint, people see it as
an opportunity to have businesses and to build condos. Developers see
the land and think, “How much could I buy this for and sell it for with
homes on it?” This really started back with Carl Fisher, who was famous
for building the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He was a thrill-seeker,
but also a businessman and developer, and he loved to go to South
Florida — which is now Miami Beach, and then was swamps and mangroves
and not developed at all. And he thought, <em><em>Hmm, this would be a
great place for people to visit for vacations and experiences.
</em></em>He slowly started filling in the wetlands with sand. And
that’s the history of Florida’s development: It continued because this
was very valuable land.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of socioeconomic pressure to develop in these areas, but
we’re also starting to see it change. Those pressures are lessening
because you have insurance industries now and events like this year
after year.
</p>
<p>
<strong>There is another issue in Southwest Florida, which is that many
of the homes were constructed before building codes were
</strong><a href="https://x.com/MarkCBove/status/1843396247039950940" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>updated</strong></u></a><strong>,
right?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I tend to do a lot more work on the manufactured housing side. Before
1974, all manufactured homes were called mobile homes, and there wasn’t
really a standard. Then, in 1974, the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development came in and said, “We need to increase the
standards,” and they did.
</p>
<p>
Fast-forward to 1992 and Hurricane Andrew, and they realized these codes
were not strong enough. Many people lived in manufactured homes that
were destroyed by Andrew, which was a very windy hurricane. We think
hurricanes are wind threats because of Andrew, but hurricanes are water
threats, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024#:~:text=90%25%20of%20hurricane%20fatalities%20result%20from%20water" target="_self"><u>most
deaths occur because of that water</u></a>. Andrew was the opposite.
</p>
<p>
Between 1992 and 1994, they updated building codes for manufactured
housing, and actually, along the coastline, Florida has some of the
strongest codes for manufactured homes in the country. A lot of the
areas that will be affected by Milton will have those strong standards.
But many homes were also grandfathered in if they were built before that
time.
</p>
<p>
That’s just one type of housing. My guess is that when you have a lot of
rapid development since the 1990s — well, I have some questions about
structural integrity since building codes can be strong but they might
not be followed. And we sometimes don’t know until afterwards. A lot of
what is being built are condos or McMansions — it’s basically,
<em><em>How fast can you build them, how cheap can you build them, and
how high can you sell them? </em></em>And they look great until their
performance is put into question.
</p>
<p>
Insurance companies are starting to see this and ask, “How do we
retrofit structures?” Structure-wise, though, I think Tampa is in a
decent spot. The problem is, the water is so powerful that it’s not
going to matter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What kinds of conversations do you think Floridians should be
having about development or potential redevelopment after
Milton?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m a huge proponent of resisting the urge to build right back — the
reason being that’s how you get repetitive losses. The hard part is,
with a lot of insurance, if you have it, you only get provisions to
build back the way you were. You don’t have the ability to improve. So
what I end up telling people is, sometimes these disasters provide an
opportunity to assess what we need to do from a planning standpoint.
This is unsustainable development, and not just because of hurricanes,
but because of rising sea levels and the stress on the environment. And
unfortunately, a lot of these developments were built on top of wetlands
and marshes and mangroves that used to protect the island areas as
natural barriers.
</p>
<p>
The hard part is that people’s emotions are very strong after disasters,
and they immediately want to return to how things were. That’s why you
see people picking up the pieces the day after a storm, sometimes even
when they’re injured. So we have to resist the urge as a group, and say,
maybe this isn’t the time to think about rebuilding here.
</p>
<p>
Many wetland restoration projects in Florida are doing that very thing:
reclaiming the environments that protected people inland. But on the
other side you have developers and builders and local economies that
rely on people coming to these areas, and that pressures people to come
right back. Then you end up with a situation of repetitive losses and
that’s why FEMA has been losing money over the years — it’s not so much
that we’re putting money toward disasters but that we’re not getting
value out of it, because it’s so much more likely for there to be
impacts because<em> </em>of that exposure growth. Look at what happened
after Helene and what’s going to happen with Milton: We’re splitting
resources between the two. But we’re doing the best with the tools we
have when there’s pressure on both sides, and considerations both
economic and safety.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there anything else people should know about the geography of
Tampa or the development risk there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
This storm is going to be different than other storms, and that’s
because of the direction and intensity of it. The one thing we have to
remember is that all that development — and everybody, for the most
part, who isn’t 100 years old — has not experienced a hurricane of this
magnitude in their life. That means everyone has the cognitive bias to
say, “I’ve been through hurricanes before and was fine.” That is
probably not going to be the case with this event; no one has been
through this before.
</p>
<p>
What’s worrisome to me is that the trajectory of the hurricane is
changing. A subtle shift north or south by 20 miles could mean a big
difference for the Tampa region — if you have the right side of the
hurricane push water into the Bay, it’s no different than 10 people
jumping into a hot tub. The water level goes up and forces all that
water into a smaller region, which is going to lead to more storm surge
in Tampa Bay, Clearwater, and the St. Pete area. I don’t want to call it
a “perfect storm,” but if you push all that water in there, you’re going
to flood people in a way that hurricanes they’ve been through before
never got close to. And I worry, if it goes south, about Fort Myers and
the areas that were hit hard by Hurricane Ian. So it’s multilayered.
</p>
<p>
The good news that I’ll bring up is that we’re reeling from Helene,
which means people have it in their brains about how bad this can be,
which is probably causing more people to evacuate than normal. We have a
problem with disaster amnesia in places where a hurricane hasn’t
happened in a long time so “it’s not going to happen again.” And we
forget. I remember Hurricane Katrina and what it did to New Orleans. It
still has effects, but the students I’m teaching now weren’t even alive
when it hit. These memories are short, and many people in Florida today
weren’t there 30 years ago or 20 years ago. The only good thing to come
out of Helene is that people are now aware of what can happen.

Is Threatening to Strike Again — This Time Over Shelved EV Plans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc4ODY4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDIwMzg0N30.fvCBqOQxa0MZph8enStUc6Rx40I1jHHb_IA7PE3RrfE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
One of the biggest wins the United Auto Workers’ secured in its historic
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/the-electric-vehicle-revolution-is-still-non-union" target="_blank">negotiations
with the Big Three automakers</a> last year was a commitment from
Stellantis to reopen and expand its shuttered factory in Belvidere,
Illinois. Now the company is shelving those plans, which included
retooling the factory to produce electric vehicles and EV batteries, and
suing the union for threatening to strike in response.
</p>
<p>
The dispute illustrates a new turn in the EV transition. Whereas last
year auto workers were wary of the transition and fighting to keep their
jobs intact, now their jobs are dependent on that transition actually
happening, and happening soon. The UAW is
<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2024/08/20/stellantis-uaw-belvidere-assembly-plant-strike-reopening/74869725007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concerned
that the company will delay the plant’s reopening</u></a> until 2028 —
after the union’s contract expires.
</p>
<p>
Stellantis idled the Belvidere plant, which previously produced Jeep
Cherokees, in February 2023, laying off more than 1,300 workers. But
under its agreement with the UAW, the company said it would spend nearly
$5 billion to restart the factory. The contract includes commitments to
opening a parts distribution hub there this year, producing a new
mid-size truck there by 2027, and building an electric vehicle battery
plant at the site by 2028. Not only would jobs at Belvidere be restored,
but the battery plant was expected to employ an additional 1,300 people.
Former Belvidere employees would also be reclassified as temporary
layoffs and receive partial pay and full healthcare benefits until
operations started up again.
</p>
<p>
President Joe Biden celebrated Belvidere as a “great comeback story” in
his
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>State
of the Union speech</u></a> in March. “Instead of an auto factory
shutting down, an auto factory is reopening and a new state-of-the-art
battery factory is being built to power those cars,” he said. “Instead
of a town being left behind it’s a community moving forward again!”
</p>
<p>
In July, plans to turn Belvidere into an EV hub seemed to be taking
shape when the Department of Energy selected Stellantis for a $335
million grant to transition the plant’s assembly lines to be able to
produce electric vehicles. The
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/mesc/domestic-manufacturing-conversion-grant-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>grant
website</u></a> says the project was anticipated to incorporate
“significant upgrades” to the plant’s infrastructure and re-employ about
“1,450 unionized and highly skilled employees.” Stellantis, however, did
not issue any press releases about the grant. In a
<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/07/11/stellantis-grant/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>statement
to the </u><u><em><em>Chicago Tribune</em></em></u></a>, the company
said it was “an important step in continuing to work toward finalizing a
sustainable solution” for Belvidere.
</p>
<p>
About a month later, the narrative around Belvidere started to shift.
UAW president Shawn Fain
<a href="https://x.com/UAW/status/1824547479074775502" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted
a video</u></a> on social media claiming something was “rotten” at
Stellantis and accused the company of “putting the brakes” on its plans
to reopen the plant. On August 20,
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26081&mid=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Stellantis
confirmed</u></a> that “plans for Belvidere will be delayed,” though it
“firmly stands by its commitment” to reopen the plant. The company’s
explanation for the decision was vague and did not include a new
timeline. “To ensure the Company’s future competitiveness and
sustainability,” it said, “it is critical that the business case for all
investments is aligned with market conditions and our ability to
accommodate a wide range of consumer demands.”
</p>
<p>
As it stands, the business is not exactly in a sustainable place. In
July, Stellantis reported that its U.S. revenues were down 16% compared
to the first half of last year. Declining sales have left dealerships
with a glut of inventory. Fain blames the company’s poor performance on
its CEO Carlos Tavares, questioning how “market conditions” could be
holding back investments in Belvidere when Tavares took a 56% raise last
year, “making him the highest paid auto executive outside of Tesla.”
</p>
<p>
In response, the company
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26271&mid=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published
a fact check of the union’s claims,</u></a> which notes that “there is
indisputable volatility in the market, especially as the industry
transitions to an electrified future. Over the past year, numerous
companies across the industry have announced investment and product
delays as well as outright product cancellations.” Stellantis currently
sells just one EV in the U.S., the Fiat 500e, which it
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=25708&mid=351" target="_blank">manufactures
in Italy</a>; in September, the company announced it had suspended
production due to
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-pauses-production-electric-fiat-500-due-poor-demand-2024-09-12/" target="_blank"><u>poor
sales</u></a>, though it still has several new EV models slated to
launch later this year.
</p>
<p>
More than a dozen local UAW units all over the country filed grievances
against Stellantis in August, arguing that the company’s “failure to
plan for, fund and launch these programs constitute a violation” of its
contract. The union has threatened to strike if the grievances are not
addressed, citing its “right to strike over product and investment
commitments” — another provision of the 2023 contract.
</p>
<p>
Stellantis denies that it has violated the contract and thrown the
accusation back at UAW, noting that the agreement included a clause that
says it is understood that the investments are “contingent upon plant
performance, changes in market conditions, and consumer demand.” It has
since
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-files-new-suits-against-united-auto-workers-union-2024-10-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed
eight lawsuits</u></a> against the union and several of its locals for
threatening to strike.
</p>
<p>
The company has also not completely abandoned its plans for the EV
transition. A few weeks ago, it
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26153" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
it would invest more than $406 million to prepare three Michigan
factories for EV production. During a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urAJ4gmSqZE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>livestream</u></a>
in September, Fain wrote off those investments as representing just a
small portion of what the company committed to.
</p>
<p>
In response to questions about why investment in Belvidere was delayed,
whether the company would still pursue the federal grant, or what the
new timeline for the plant was, a representative from Stellantis sent me
bullet points from the previously published fact check.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Energy did not answer questions about the status or
timeline for the factory conversion grant.

<li>IEA: Renewable capacity growth not enough to triple by 2030
</h3>
<p>
There are several big energy reports out this week, and taken together,
their findings tell a nuanced story of an energy transition that’s well
underway, but still moving too slowly. Let’s start with the big one: The
International Energy Agency’s
<a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/88a07dd9-42fe-4232-842e-9015b4b647f8/Renewables2024.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Renewables
2024</a> report, published this morning. It says that the world is on
track to add 5,500 gigawatts of new clean energy capacity by 2030, 80%
of which will come from solar PV alone. That means renewables will
account for half of global electricity generation by the end of the
decade.

<p>
While this is huge progress (the report notes that 5,500 GW is roughly
equal the power capacity of China, the European Union, India, and the
U.S. combined), it is not enough to meet the COP28 goal of tripling
renewable capacity by 2030. But! The IEA stresses that it is “entirely
possible” to meet this target if governments can get their acts
together, set bold new emission reduction targets in the coming months,
and work together to lower the energy transition costs for poorer
countries. “The market can deliver on renewables, and now governments
need to prioritize investing in storage, grids, and other forms of clean
flexibility to enable this transformation,” said Dave Jones, director of
global insights at energy think tank Ember. “The next half decade is
going to be one heck of a ride.”
</p>
<p>
So, that’s renewables. Let’s look at what all this means for emissions
and, most importantly, warming.

An energy transition

published this morning from Norwegian risk management company DNV
concludes, rather remarkably, that energy-related emissions are set to
peak this year and begin a steady decline thanks to the plummeting costs
of solar and batteries, especially in China. “Emissions peaking is a
milestone for humanity,” said Remi Eriksen, group president and CEO of
DNV. However, the projected rate of emission reduction is only enough to
limit warming to <strong>2.2 degrees Celsius </strong>by 2100. “We must
now focus on how quickly emissions decline and use the available tools
to accelerate the energy transition,” Eriksen added.

Outlook 2024</a> report, out yesterday, concluded that there is a less
than 7% chance of the world limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius
“if current trends in policy and technology development continue.” In
fact, it projected a “very likely” increase between<strong> 2 degrees
Celsius</strong> and <em>gulp</em> <strong>3.7 degrees Celsius
</strong>by century’s end. However, odds of limiting warming to 2
degrees jump to 96% if all countries can get to net-zero emissions by
2070. To date, 149 countries (representing 88% of global emissions) have
made net-zero or carbon neutrality commitments, though it remains to be
seen if and when they’ll meet those goals.

<p>
The cost of “green” hydrogen – that which is produced with clean energy
– is likely to remain “prohibitively expensive,” according to a new
<a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/abstract/S2542-4351(24)00421-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2542435124004215%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" target="_blank">study</a>
published yesterday in the journal <em>Joule</em>. The fuel is seen as
key to curbing emissions from hard-to-abate sectors (industry, for
example), and many are banking on the price of production falling. But
the researchers say the high storage and distribution costs are often
overlooked. Taking those costs into consideration, carbon capture and
storage is cheaper than green hydrogen when it comes to curbing
emissions, the researchers found. “Even if production costs decrease in
line with predictions, storage and distribution costs will prevent
hydrogen being cost-competitive in many sectors,”

<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
In a time of fraught political polarization, it’s hard for companies to
decide whether to take political stands or remain quietly on the
sidelines. Today, as a continuation of
<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/collection/office-politics/">our
Office Politics series</a>, we’ll hear why some places that once mixed
business and politics may be keeping a lower profile now. Then, nearly a
month into a strike, negotiations between aerospace giant Boeing and its
union members have broken off. We hear why.

How can you fight climate change in your daily life? Last month, Heatmap
published our attempt at answering that question: Called Decarbonize
Your Life, it’s a series of stories and guides to help you make better,
smarter decisions to nudge the energy system away from fossil fuels. We
consulted studies, ran our own analysis (with a little help from some
friends), and used our expert judgment to arrive at six big,
high-leverage actions you can take to fight climate change and cut
carbon pollution.
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Jesse and Rob speak with Heatmap’s
deputy editor Jillian Goodman and founding staff writer Emily Pontecorvo
about what those six big actions are, how the guide came together, and
why big choices matter so much more than small ones. Shift Key is hosted
by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse
Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton
University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>So it’s more than just the carbon impact
which is the key here, right? This systemic leverage point that you’re
trying to make is that you’re trying to think about — beyond just
reducing emissions, which is important — how is that actually having
some kind of systemic impact on reorienting the global capitalist
system, right? That we all live in, towards where we want to go, towards
what a net zero emissions lifestyle and society looks like.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>And instead of every dollar you spend
going to the task of taking oil out of the ground, and the task of
building more internal combustion cars, it’s going to the task of
building more EVs and harvesting electricity. Anyway, Jillian, I
interrupted you.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jillian Goodman: </strong>I was just
going to add — and again, I’m just paraphrasing you — every time you
drive, it’s a marginal impact. Every single time you use the device. Not
only are you emitting less in the short term, you’re emitting less in
the long term. And as the grid gets cleaner, every time you drive your
EV, your EV will get cleaner, as well.<br/> <br/> <strong>Emily
Pontecorvo:</strong> One other thing that we were thinking about a
little bit is thinking about these actions in terms of, which ones are
you, as an individual, you’re literally the one who’s burning the fossil
fuels. When you drive your car, you are burning the gas. When you’re
lighting your stove, you’re burning natural gas. And not to put it all
on the individual, but you’re the one who has the power to say,
<em><em>Okay, I’m not gonna burn fossil fuels in my home
anymore.</em></em> And whereas with a few other actions — like with
rooftop solar, with efficiency improvements — those are extremely
important, and those are very high on our list for other reasons. But
they’re more indirect.

<p>
Contrary to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-milton-misinformation" target="_self"><u>recent
rumor</u></a>, the U.S. government cannot direct major hurricanes like
Helene and Milton toward red states. According to two new rapid
attribution studies by World Weather Attribution and
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/hurricane-rapid-intensification?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024&utm_content=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024+CID_5a4c73076a532c0cb91ebd2b7e99e07f&utm_source=Climate%20Central%20Email%20Campaign%20Monitor&utm_term=extreme%20rapid%20intensification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Climate
Central</u></a>, however, human actors almost certainly made the storms
a lot worse through the burning of fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
A storm like Hurricane Helene, which has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>killed
at least 227 people so far</u></a> and caused close to
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/business/property-damange-hurricane-helene-47-billion/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$50
billion in estimated property losses</u></a> across the southeast, is
about two-and-a-half times more likely in the region today compared to
what would be expected in a “cooler pre-industrial climate,” WWA found.
That means Helene, the kind of storm one would expect to see once every
130 years on average, is now expected to develop at a rate of about once
every 53 years. Additionally, WWA researchers determined that extreme
rainfall from Helene was 70% more likely and 10% heavier in the
Appalachians and about 40% more likely in the southern Appalachian
region, where many of the deaths occurred, due to climate change.
</p>
<p>
“Americans shouldn’t have to fear hurricanes more violent than Helene —
we have all the knowledge and technology needed to lower demand and
replace oil, gas, and coal with renewable energy,” Friederike Otto, the
lead of WWA and a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College
London, said in a statement. “But vitally, we need the political will.”
Alarmingly, the attribution study found that storms could drop an
additional 10% or more rain on average as soon as the 2050s if warming
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/year-warming-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>reaches</u></a>
2 degrees Celsius.

<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/helene-rainfall-boosted-human-driven-climate-change-studies-find-rcna173608" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not
the first</a> to be released on Hurricane Helene, but it was still
produced incredibly quickly and has not been peer reviewed. Just a few
weeks ago, the group issued a correction on a report estimating the
contribution of climate change to recent

Separately, Climate Central looked at Hurricane Milton, which already
has the distinction of being

fifth strongest</u></a> Atlantic storm on record. The nonprofit’s
findings show that Milton’s rapid intensification — one of

fastest and most powerful</u></a> instances of the phenomenon in history
— is primarily due to high
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_self"><u>sea
surface temperatures</u></a> in the weeks before Milton developed, which
was made at least 400 times more likely by climate change and up to 800
times more likely. (WWA relied on Climate Central’s Climate Shift Index
for oceans for its research, but found “climate change made the
unusually hot sea surface temperature about 200-500 times more likely.”)
</p>
<p>
Attribution science is incredibly tricky, especially for a storm system
like a hurricane that has variables ranging from wind shear to the El
Niño–Southern Oscillation to ocean temperatures and jet stream
variations. When
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>I
spoke to a member of the WWA team earlier this year</u></a>, I was told
the organization specifically avoids attributing the intensification of
any <em><em>individual</em></em> hurricane — in theory, one of the more
straightforward relationships — to climate change because of the
relatively limited historical modeling available. Even something like
rainfall “is not necessarily correlated to the magnitude of the floods
that you see because there are other factors,” WWA’s Clair Barnes
previously told me — for example, the steep-sided mountains and hollows
of western North Carolina, which served as funnels for rainfall to an
especially devastating effect.
</p>
<p>
But regarding the relationship between hurricanes and climate change
more generally, “We’re relatively confident that storms will get more
intense” in a warming world, Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton geoscientist,
explained on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-hurricane-helene" target="_self"><u>a
recent episode of Heatmap’s Shift Key</u></a> podcast. “And we’re
<em><em>really </em></em>confident that storms will get wetter.”
</p>
<p>
Helene and Milton hammer that point home: once-in-a-generation storms
can now arrive on back-to-back weekends. You can almost understand the
impulse to devise a zany explanation as to why. Only, the truth is far
simpler than cloud seeding or
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-maui-fire-photos-misrepresented-conspiracy-555091357957" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>space
lasers</u></a>: a warmer atmosphere makes for warmer oceans, which make
for wetter, more intense storms. And while hurricane seasons
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/2024-hurricane-season-helene#:~:text=a%20couple%20of%20named%20storms%20in%20November%2C" target="_self"><u>eventually

stopped going up</u></a>. That, perhaps, is the more terrifying subtext
of the attribution studies: There will be more Miltons and Helenes.

Natural disaster recovery is often expensive, but this season is shaping
up to be particularly costly and painful. The Southeast is reeling from
Hurricane Helene, and Hurricane Milton is expected to inflict more
damage starting tomorrow night. Disaster preparedness can reduce the
economic burden of recovery, but not all localities can afford to be
prepared. Also in this episode: The Fed’s interest rate cut raised
business owners’ optimism and China invites more young Americans to

<p class="drop-caps">
There’s a familiar script when it comes to hurricanes: The high winds
snap tree branches and even tree trunks and whip around anything else
that’s light enough or not bolted down — including power lines and
distribution poles. While this type of damage can lead to large-scale
outages, it’s also relatively straightforward to fix. In many cases the
power comes back on relatively quickly, more like days rather than weeks
or months.
</p>
<p>
But when it comes to flooding, especially in areas that do not regularly
deal with big storms, the damage can be more severe, long-lasting, and
difficult to repair. This is largely because what’s at risk in these
scenarios is not power lines but substations. These messes of
transmission and distribution lines that channel high voltage power to
homes and businesses are vulnerable to rising water, and repairs can’t
begin until the floodwaters recede. Often they have to be replaced
entirely, which is expensive and can lead to further delays as

a nationwide shortage</u></a> of transformers. Just one substation can
support thousands of homes — a single point of failure that, when it
floods, takes all its customers down with it.
</p>
<p>
Duke Energy, whose grid in the Carolinas was pummeled by Hurricane
Helene,
<a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energys-hurricane-helene-recovery-restores-power-to-nearly-1-1-million-in-the-carolinas-downed-trees-blocked-roadways-damaged-power-equipment-impeding-efforts-in-the-n-c-mountains-and-s-c-upstate-region" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
said</u></a> the damage to its system encompasses “submerged
substations, thousands of downed utility poles, and downed transmission
towers,” and noted that much of the affected area is “inaccessible due
to mudslides, flooding and blocked roads, limiting the ability to assess
and begin repairing damages.” In an update published Saturday, it stated
that while more than 2 million customers had seen their power
<a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-restores-90-of-carolinas-customers-capable-of-receiving-power-following-helene" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>restored</u></a>,
about 250,000 customers across North and South Carolina remained without
electricity more than a week after the storm.
</p>
<p>
Workers are “encountering more severe damage on a larger scale than
we’ve ever experienced,” Duke Energy storm director Jason Hollifield
said in a statement. (Duke didn’t respond to my request for comment.)
One Duke employee
<a href="https://abc11.com/post/helene-power-outages-wnc-duke-energy-substation-extensive-damage-biltmore-swannanoa-river/15392801/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
the local television station</u></a> in Asheville, North Carolina, which
saw more than three months’ worth of rain fall over three days, that a
local substation would have to be completely rebuilt, a process that
could take months. In Western North Carolina, the area’s Representative
Chuck Edwards has
<a href="https://edwards.house.gov/media/press-releases/hurricane-helene-update-10-congressman-edwards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated</u></a>
that 117,000 customers still lack electricity, and that while some of
them will likely get it back by Sunday, others “whose properties are
inaccessible or not able to receive power may be without electricity for
an extended period of time as Duke Energy works to rebuild critical
infrastructure.”
</p>
<p>
To prepare for the onrushing Hurricane Milton, Duke
<a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-florida-increases-resource-count-to-16-000-encourages-customers-to-take-appropriate-safety-measures-prior-to-hurricane-miltons-landfall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
staging thousands o</u></a>f “line technicians, vegetation workers,
damage assessors and support personnel” in Florida, the company said.
The same problem remains, however: Line technicians will not prevent
substations from flooding.
</p>
<p>
While the exact effect of climate change on hurricanes and other storm
categories is an area of intense debate among climate scientists and
meteorologists, there’s a rough consensus that
<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/10/29/why-are-big-storms-bringing-so-much-more-rain-warming-yes-also-winds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warming
will cause the storms to be wetter</u></a>. That means utilities will
have to update their old disaster response playbooks, or else prolonged
outages when an especially wet storm arrives over a flood plain.
</p>
<p>
In most hurricanes, utilities are able to pre-position workers to
restore power quickly, working on knocked down poles and wires,
explained Jordan Kern, an assistant professor engineering at North
Carolina State University. “When trees fall on distribution lines, those
are, in normal situations, easy to repair,” he told me. But, Kern said,
“If the substations are flooded, you can’t do anything until the flood
waters go down. They can be without power for a long time.”
</p>
<p>
Wetter hurricanes will likely mean more severe and less predictable
flooding happening far away from the coasts, bringing with it risks that
utilities and local governments may be less prepared to face, with costs
that will ultimately be born by anyone who pays for electricity, as
expensive repairs and hardening of electrical infrastructure will likely
be born by ratepayers.
</p>
<p>
“Rates will necessarily rise” to deal with the higher costs of
adaptation and repairing infrastructure more complex than a wooden pole,
Tyler Norris, a PhD student at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the
Environment, told me while driving towards Asheville to help out family
impacted by the storm.
</p>
<p>
While Helene has been an especially damaging storm, the risks of wetter
storms and inland flooding away from the coastal areas that are prepared
for frequent hurricanes have become more apparent in recent years. While
Hurricane Irene in 2011 made landfall on Long Island, its
<a href="https://www.weather.gov/gyx/Irene_Anniversary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
devastating effects were felt inland</u></a> due to heavy rains,
especially in Vermont.
</p>
<p>
North Carolina in particular has seen a rash of nasty hurricanes in the
past 10 years or so, giving Duke ample recent experience with big storms
— and some indication of what a warming world could bring.
</p>
<p>
During 2018’s Hurricane Florence, which knocked out power for around a
million Duke customers, “at least 10 substations required
de-energization due to flooding or flood risk where heavy rainfall and
resulting inland flooding,”
<a href="https://www.duke-energy.com/-/media/pdfs/our-company/carolinasresiliencetransmissiondistributionstudy.pdf?rev=035db100f60b4c6a8b81e5a3a4d1e74c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to a 2022 Duke climate resiliency report</u></a>. The report was meant
to look at the effects of climate change to the Duke system by 2050
under two emissions scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, one assuming emissions start falling by 2040, the other
assuming continued (some might say
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00177-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unrealistically</u></a>)
high emissions.
</p>
<p>
Under the extreme scenario, the “overall vulnerability priority of Duke
Energy substations to climate-driven changes in precipitation and inland
flooding is high,” the report said, while under the “middle of the road”
projection, “transmission infrastructure faces a medium priority
vulnerability.”
<a href="https://www.duke-energy.com/-/media/pdfs/our-company/carolinasresiliencetransmissiondistributionstudy.pdf?rev=035db100f60b4c6a8b81e5a3a4d1e74c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In
both cases, however</u></a>, “without adaptation planning … substations
are at the highest potential risk, with extreme heat and flooding being
the greatest concerns for existing assets.”
</p>
<p>
Duke said at the time that it had “implemented permanent flood
protection measures at new substations located in flood plains and
substations with a prior history of flooding.” For its existing fleet,
priority was being given to those substations considered particularly
“at-risk,” however the flood protection plan had “not yet been
universally implemented at all existing substations in the flood plain.”
</p>
<p>
“What they characterized there falls significantly short of what we just
saw,” Norris said. While he noted that Duke had listed risk to
substations from inland flooding as high (albeit only under the extreme
scenario), it had listed the risk to the distribution of power,
i.e. poles and wires, as “low” under both scenarios. “There’s been a
dramatic misestimate of risk here,” Norris said.
</p>
<p>
For Duke customers, especially in the more isolated parts of Western
North Carolina, they may simply have to wait for workers and parts to
arrive. Repairs that could normally happen quickly will likely happen
slowly as workers struggle to reach areas whose roads have been washed
away. Duke said that it’s now focusing on restoring the “backbone” of
the transmission and distribution system, and then is moving on to
restoring fallen poles in less densely populated areas.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>And it will likely happen again. Kern noted that inland
flooding especially is notoriously hard to predict compared to coastal
flooding from hurricanes. “Flooding is so idiosyncratic,” he said. “It’s
hard for anyone to predict how flooding will affect a region. Let alone
electric utilities.”

9% of FEMA workers available to respond to disasters as of Monday, as

Raises $12 Million to Unlock New Sources of Lithium</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc3NjgxNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MjMyOTk5OH0.exGku9nm_j6mce4_sNIyc8Cn-Otl-VU_sff6sqpwwuE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
With the markets for electric vehicles and battery energy storage
systems on the come-up, energy market analysts predict that the world is
hurtling towards a global lithium shortage by the 2030’s. Lithios, a
Massachusetts-based startup with a novel method of lithium extraction,
is aiming to help by unlocking previously untapped lithium resources
around the world.
</p>
<p>
The company just raised a $12 million seed round to help fund this
mission, led by Clean Energy Ventures with support from Lowercarbon
Capital, among others. The round included $10 million in venture funding
and $2 million in venture debt loans from Silicon Valley Bank.
</p>
<p>
It’s not as if the world actually lacks for lithium, the energy dense
mineral that is the primary component in lithium-ion batteries. It’s
just that many current reserves are too low-grade to be economically
exploited, and traditional extraction methods are land-intensive,
inefficient, and often controversial with local communities. Chile,
Australia, and China dominate the market, while the U.S. contributes
less than 2% of the world’s annual supply.
</p>
<p>
Lithios aims to make it more economical and environmentally friendly to
extract lithium from salty groundwater deposits, a.k.a. brines. The
company’s CEO, Mo Alkhadra, told me that while about two-thirds of the
world’s lithium is contained in brine rather than hard rock, only about
15% to 20% of these brines are currently worth mining. Lithios, he said,
will get that number up to around 80% to 85%, in theory. “The vision
with Lithios’ tech is to enable access to these lower-grade resources at
a similar or maybe slightly higher cost structure relative to the
highest grade deposits that are mined today,” Alkhadra explained.
</p>
<p>
The normal lithium brine extraction process involves pumping saline
water from underground reservoirs to the surface, where it’s then moved
through a series of
<a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/144393/where-batteries-begin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>large,
wildly colored evaporation ponds</u></a>, often located in the middle of
vast salt deserts. Over a period of about 18 months, the sun slowly
evaporates the brine, leaving behind increasingly high concentrations of
lithium. But Lithios’ tech avoids these ponds altogether. Instead, the
brine is pumped to the surface and delivered directly to the company’s
refrigerator-sized electrochemical reactors, which contain stacks of
electrodes that capture the lithium.
</p>
<p>
While the company wouldn’t disclose the electrodes’ exact chemistry,
Alkhadra told me they are made from “inorganic compounds which have
geometries that fit basically only lithium and none of the other larger
ions that you would find in these brine mixtures.” After lithium is
extracted, the company produces a purified lithium concentrate and sends
that off for refining into battery chemicals. The final batteries could
end up in EVs, energy storage systems, or even just plain old portable
consumer electronics.
</p>
<p>
Lithios’ tech comes at a good time, as the Inflation Reduction Act’s
domestic content requirements for EVs incentivizes manufacturers to
source critical minerals from the U.S. and countries that the U.S. has
free trade agreements with. Alkhadra told me that Lithios could open up
opportunities for brine mining in the Smackover formation, which spans a
number of southern states including Texas and Arkansas,
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/04/the-salton-sea-could-produce-the-worlds-greenest-lithium.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Salton Sea area</u></a>, which has been dubbed “Lithium Valley,” as well
as deposits in Utah and Nevada. More areas in Canada and Europe could
also be in play. (The company said it couldn’t talk yet about any
specific partnership agreements.)
</p>
<p>
While there are a number of other companies such as
<a href="https://lilacsolutions.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lilac
Solutions</u></a> and
<a href="https://energyx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EnergyX</u></a>
that are also pursuing more efficient and less land-intensive
brine-based extraction methods, they rely on a different, purely
chemical process known as direct lithium extraction, which uses
technology adapted from the water treatment industry. “The core thesis
around what we’re building at Lithios stems from that work,” Alkhadra
told me, explaining that electrifying these chemical processes makes
them “much more selective, energy efficient, and water efficient” —
resulting in “modest to significant cost reduction.”
</p>
<p>
Lithios’ new funding will help the company scale its research and
development efforts as well as build out a pilot facility in Medford,
Massachusetts, with initial production to begin in the first quarter of
next year. At first, output will be limited to just “several battery
packs” per year, Alkhadra told me, scaling up to commercial production
“in the coming years.”
</p>
<p>
Alkhadra is excited to see investors and the federal government alike
beginning to express interest in the upstream, “dirtier” portions of the
battery supply chain, which he told me have generally been overlooked in
favor of downstream sectors such as battery manufacturing and cell
production. “I think the U.S. departments of both energy and defense,
and investors too, are coming to realize that the real bottlenecks in
battery manufacturing and EV production are on the resource side.”

Is Already Swirling Around Hurricane Milton</h2>

The “Meteorologists” Facebook page has 51,000 followers, an iffy grasp
of grammar rules, and outsized confidence in the United States’ weather
engineering capabilities. “They are Aiming this KILLER Monster Hurricane
Right at FLORIDA!” one user said of Hurricane Milton on Sunday morning,
shortly before sharing purported photos of dinosaurs living on Mars.
</p>
<p>
By Monday afternoon, Milton had strengthened into a
<a href="https://x.com/philklotzbach/status/1843398813027053696" target="_blank">Category
5 storm</a>, and the internet conspiracies were intensifying, too.
People shared videos of themselves
<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gammieluvs4/video/7422816848955051307" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asking
their Alexas</u></a>, “What kind of hurricane was Hurricane Milton?” and
getting answers in the past tense — proof, surely, that the government
orchestrated the whole storm. “Never ever seen a hurricane form in the
western Gulf and head directly EAST… It is not right,” other users mused
in the comment sections of their local weather channels. A search for
“<a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=cloud%20seeding%20hurricane%20milton" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cloud
seeding</u></a>” on Facebook further turned up dozens of posts tracking
flight paths for planes belonging to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and sharing photos of ominous-looking clouds
as evidence that the “government is involved.”
</p>
<p>
Hoaxes and misinformation reliably follow extreme weather events.
Pictures of
<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hurricane-shark" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hurricane
Shark</u></a> have circulated on social media after pretty much every
major flood since 2011, and a
<a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2012/10/29/awesome-hurricane-sandy-photo-statue-liberty-fake/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>photoshopped
image</u></a> of a storm cell over the Statue of Liberty resurfaces
anytime there is bad weather in New York. In the aftermath of a major
disaster, it’s especially tempting for bad actors to
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/02/1126480393/after-the-storm-the-scams-lies-and-misinformation-flood-in" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exploit</u></a>
the desperation for news and images.
</p>
<p>
But Hurricane Helene — which devastated
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>swaths
of Florida</u></a> up into the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hurricane-helene-appalachia-tennessee" target="_self"><u>Appalachians</u></a>
just over a week ago — revealed how far this has spun out of control.
For one thing, hoaxes are simpler than ever for the average person to
disseminate,
<a href="https://x.com/O_Rob1nson/status/1841433705186804145" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>thanks
to the availability of AI image-making tools</u></a> and the degradation
of content moderation on
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/elon-musk-twitter-blue-natural-disaster-crisis-emergency-response/673209/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disaster-response
platforms like Twitter</u></a>. These conspiracies may also then be
reinforced and amplified by people with an interest in making the
government’s response look bad — such as
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/politics/fact-check-trump-helene-response-north-carolina/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Republican candidate for president of the United States</u></a>, a
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/marjorie-taylor-greene-hurricane-helene" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Georgia
congressperson</u></a>, and

Musk</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
While some lies — like Deep State cloud seeding — are relatively easy to
see through, many rumors are much more difficult to fact-check when
power, cell service, and internet are limited. Nicole McNeill, the
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-death-toll-asheville-north-carolina-34d1226bb31f79dfb2ff6827e40587fc#:~:text=The%20city%20of%20Asheville%2C%20in%20the%20western%20mountains%20of%20North%20Carolina%2C%20was%20particularly%20battered." target="_blank">Asheville,
North Carolina</a>-based director of storytelling of Climate Power, told
me she and many of her neighbors fell for
<a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/10/01/is-another-hurricane-coming-to-wnc-tropical-storm-kirk-impact/75466027007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
widespread rumor</u></a> that a second storm was going to hit the
western part of the state immediately after Helene. The panic the rumor
sparked risked lives: She saw a fight break out in a gas line between
two men who were frantically trying to get out of town, and a young
couple who were renting a home nearby tried to flee and ended up on a
road that was closed. “We heard later that people had to sleep in their
cars,” McNeill told me. “Local police had to be diverted from emergency
response to direct traffic to clear the roads so emergency vehicles
could pass. Misinformation made a desperate situation worse.” McNeill
herself suffered a panic attack while trying to fix the holes in her
roof from trees that had fallen during Helene, all in preparation for
the second storm that would never come.
</p>
<p>
While there was no merit to those manufactured claims, the truth is in
some ways even more alarming: Milton is looking like a worst-case
scenario storm as it bears down on Tampa Bay, and at this point, the
only thing anyone <em><em>can</em></em> control is getting good
information to the people whose lives will depend on hearing it.
Forecasters are doing a great job of that already, like South Florida
hurricane specialist John Morales, who
<a href="https://x.com/brianstelter/status/1843362454321115138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>let
his emotions show on air</u></a> and connected the storm’s
intensification to climate science.
</p>
<p>
Milton isn’t due to make landfall until Wednesday, but the
misinformation already circulating online will make it more challenging
for early warnings from the government and local experts to be heard and
trusted. That job doesn’t get any easier after a storm. To fellow
hurricane survivors, McNeill warned, “If you have patchy internet and
you’re at 30% battery and worried about your phone running out, you’re
often making split-second decisions. That’s where misinformation gets
people.”

Bilingual Window-Breaking Drones Save New Yorkers From the Next

<p class="drop-caps">
Last week, I took a train and two buses to an abandoned tuberculosis
sanatorium on Staten Island, where I watched first responders pretend
another Hurricane Sandy had just struck New York City.
</p>
<p>
For the sake of the drill, organizers kept many of the details of the
fictional scenario the same as they’d been then: Emergency Management
officials were told to respond as if a supercharged storm was causing
devastating floods and stranding people in life-threatening situations.
But the dry run also featured a major difference from the disaster that
hit 12 years ago this month and left
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>more
than</u></a> 43 New Yorkers dead.
</p>
<p>
This time, the city has drones.
</p>
<p>
It has drones with cameras that can read the logo on your jacket from
400 feet in the air and drones with sophisticated mapping software that
can estimate how deep a flooded intersection is. It has drones that come
on little leashes tethered to NYPD cruisers for continuous power and
drones that are so small they can fly under beds and into closets and
sound like dentist drills when they’re operating. It has drones that can
transmit messages in 80 languages, drones with thermal sensors, and
drones that can drop flotation devices into the ocean. It even has a
drone that can break a window — the highlight of the morning for the
members of the local press and the top brass of the New York Police
Department, Fire Department, and NYCEM (New York City Emergency
Management, pronounced “Nee-chim,” newly rebranded from the more generic
Office of Emergency Management) who’d gathered to observe the exercise,
which was touted as the largest-known municipal unmanned aerial system
drill in history.
</p>
<p>
“Breach drones,” as I’ve since learned, look a little like crudely drawn
mosquitos. Held aloft by four rotary wings, the
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/the-nypd-is-using-drones-3-times-more-than-it-did-last-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$87,750</u></a>
contraptions are affixed with rods on their fronts that resemble an
insect’s proboscis but function essentially like a battering ram. Given
the drone’s unsteady, bobbing flight and the way it repeatedly banged
itself against the window to chip a hole in the pane big enough to fly
through, I found the whole demonstration to be surprisingly
<em><em>entomological</em></em> for what New York City’s first
responders claim is the bleeding edge of its extreme weather response.
</p>
<p>
“We’re really just scraping the first layer” of what is possible, Louis
Font, a citywide interagency coordinator, told me during the drill. As
he put it, drones are “the Swiss army knife of the public safety world.”
</p>
<p>
There is a small problem, though: New Yorkers really, really hate
drones. Actually, they hate <em><em>all</em></em> autonomous gadgets
that give off a whiff of Big Brother. A security robot deployed in the
Times Square subway station over the winter had to be
<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/696-23/transcript-mayor-adams-makes-public-safety-related-announcement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>guarded
by two human officers</u></a> around the clock to prevent it from being
vandalized, and the cheeky New York City news blog <em><em>Hell Gate
</em></em><a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/eric-adams-robocop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed</u></a>
that bots like the NYPD’s crime-fighting “Digidog” are “the city’s most
expensive punching bags” and teased, “we’re excited to watch as the
situation unfolds.” Even the local <em><em>wildlife</em></em> seems
willing to take matters into its own talons, with birds
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/nyregion/nyc-beaches-drones-angry-birds.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attacking</u></a>
drones deployed to Rockaway Beach over the summer.
</p>
<p>
The city acquired its first set of drones in 2018 and is now one of
about
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/nyregion/nypd-drones.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>900
U.S. municipalities</u></a> that have begun using unmanned aerial
systems in its crime- and emergency-related responses. But with a police
budget
<a href="https://reason.com/2011/11/30/michael-bloomberg-i-have-my-own-army-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bigger</u></a>
than many nations’ entire military outlay and
<a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-new-technology-hasnt-worked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
techno-optimist mayor</u></a>, New York quickly became one of the
premier drone-wielding cities in the world.
</p>
<p>
It hasn’t been an entirely smooth journey, though. Plans to use drones
to monitor
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/drones-labor-day-eric-adams-nypd-jouvert-c2787e87bcad8fa87aa8d34b454ee6cf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>private
backyard Labor Day parties</u></a> last year spurred privacy concerns
rooted in
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nypd-drone-czar-surveillence-post-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
history</u></a> of the NYPD abusing surveillance technologies and
prompted pushback from local civil liberties groups. “We’ve got so many
discredited examples of this mayor searching for high-tech gimmicks to
solve real-world problems and leaving New Yorkers out to dry,” Albert
Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology
Oversight Project, a.k.a. STOP, told me. “We end up spending a huge
amount of money on largely unvetted vendors to buy products that simply
just don’t fit the needs of our city.”
</p>
<p>
The question I wanted to answer on Staten Island was whether drones
might be able to<em> </em>meet the needs of a city after a storm like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-helene-florida-size" target="_self"><u>Hurricane
Helene</u></a> or Hurricane Sandy. The overwhelming impression I left
with, though, was of agencies that are in the awkward stage of a growth
spurt — eager to use technology that will one day be indispensable but,
for the time being, presents the risk of overcomplicating situations
that would otherwise benefit from a more old-fashioned,
boots-on-the-ground approach, with potentially both comic and tragic
results.
</p>
<p>
Much of this is simply because of the physical limitations of drones.
For one thing, they can’t fly in winds of more than about 20 to 30 miles
per hour, making them pretty much useless during an actual storm (or
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nypd-drone-czar-surveillence-post-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
a Manhattan wind tunnel</u></a>, for that matter). That narrows their
use to two main categories: before a storm, as early warning systems,
and after, in search-and-rescue operations.
</p>
<p>
It’s easy to understand the appeal of the former use. Scientists expect
New York will get about 25% more annual rainfall by 2100
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>due
to climate change</u></a>, and the city has over 500 miles of coastline
vulnerable to storm surge, with
<a href="https://wordinblack.com/2024/04/nyc-floods-are-worst-for-those-who-can-least-afford-them/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over
half</u></a> of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/emily-raboteau-lessons-for-survival" target="_self"><u>its
environmental justice communities</u></a> living within its 100-year
floodplains. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, 11 people
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/ida-s-forgotten-victims-nearly-all-storm-s-basement-deaths-n1281670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drowned</u></a>
in flooded basement apartments, which are illegal under the city housing
code and often used as housing by low-income immigrant families. Making
matters worse, New York’s emergency alert system requires
<a href="https://a858-nycnotify.nyc.gov/notifynyc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
voluntary opt-in</u></a> and currently has just 1,281,938 subscribers —
roughly 15% of a city of 8.3 million. Last year, the city comptroller
further
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/nyregion/storm-response-nyc-adams.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claimed</u></a>
that the notification list for people living in basement apartments
reached less than 1% of its target population. (A spokesperson for NYCEM
told me there has been a 35% increase in their basement subscriber
numbers since the comptroller’s comments.)
</p>
<p>
The drones come in handy, then, because “not every New Yorker is on
Twitter, not every New Yorker is on Instagram or Facebook, not every New
Yorker reads <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>, the
<em><em>Post</em></em>, or the <em><em>Daily News</em></em>, not all of
them are tuned into our press conferences,” NYCEM Commissioner Zachary
Iscol told me. “And so especially for vulnerable populations and
immigrant communities, you’ve got to reach them where they are.”
</p>
<p>
This summer, NYCEM
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/nyregion/drones-eric-adams-flooding.html" target="_blank">piloted
a program</a> using drones to broadcast bilingual flood warnings in
low-lying neighborhoods ahead of storms — an idea Mayor Eric Adams had
after seeing hurricane sirens on telephone poles during a visit to
Puerto Rico, Iscol told me. The drones’ machine-generated Spanish
translations, however, were slammed as
“<a href="https://x.com/J__Velasquez/status/1820914162387558778" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>incomprehensible</u></a>”
by native speakers. (Font, the interagency coordinator, admitted the
translations are still crude since “they’re robots” and told me the
agencies are working to improve the messages.)

<p>
Carolina Salguero, the founder and executive director of PortSide
NewYork, which works with the waterfront community in Red Hook, told me
she fears drone-delivered storm warnings could potentially alienate
their intended audiences. “Why would you believe the government if it’s
dissed the community for this long?” she said, recalling how some Red
Hook residents unwisely ignored warnings ahead of Sandy. (One can only
imagine the added element of distrust that would come from a
<em><em>drone</em></em> shouting those same warnings at you.). Cahn, of
STOP, was also skeptical of the message’s delivery system: “The idea
that you’re going to warn people with a fleet of drones is ludicrous.
It’d take hundreds of thousands of drones operating throughout the day
to reach the number of people that [NYCEM] can reach through a single
text message,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
That problem of scale is also true <em><em>after</em></em> a storm.
While I was impressed by the drones’ heat-seeking capabilities —
operators could quickly find human actors and mannequins heated to
lifelike temperatures during the Staten Island drill — the NYPD
<a href="https://www.police1.com/tech-pulse/nypd-to-start-drone-as-first-responder-program-allowing-uavs-to-respond-to-scenes-of-shootings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only
had 85 drones</u></a> in its arsenal as of this spring. Because
connectivity issues are common after major weather disasters, drones
cannot travel terribly far from human-toted hotspots, meaning the actual
ground drones can cover to look for stranded, trapped, hurt, or drowning
New Yorkers is relatively small. Drones also have a limited battery life
of about half an hour and must repeatedly return to handlers to have
their batteries swapped out as they conduct searches.
</p>

Sometimes it seems almost as if the city government is creating problems
for drones to solve. A scenario where a window-breaching drone would be
more beneficial than having a firefighter simply walk into a building
feels like an edge case, and while a drone can inform someone in
Mandarin that help is on the way, that “help” still ultimately takes the
form of human paramedics, police, or firefighters. Font told me that
drones helped supplement the rescue of “multiple drowning victims” in
the Rockaways this summer by providing an extra vantage, but the systems
were only deployed in the first place because of
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-treading-water-as-lifeguard-shortage-lingers-for-another-summer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
unresolved lifeguard shortage</u></a>. (Though there was excited chatter
at the Staten Island drill about drones one day being able to tow
distressed swimmers to shore, currently they can only bonk you with a
hotdog-sized floatation device that inflates to three feet long to buy
first responders some extra time — and that’s <em><em>if</em></em> you
manage to grab ahold of it while flailing about in rough waters.)
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the biggest problem the drone exercise appeared poised to
address was concerns about whether the city government could continue to
function adequately under Adams’ leadership. Though the drill had
reportedly been in the works for six months,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mounting
scandals</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2024/10/who-has-left-adams-administration/399800/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>resignations</u></a>
in the administration made the large-scale demonstration of interagency
cooperation conveniently timed. On Monday, less than a week after the
drill, Phil Banks — the deputy mayor for public safety whose
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/nyregion/phil-banks-resigns-eric-adams.html" target="_blank"><u>phone
was seized last month</u></a> as part of a federal bribery investigation
— resigned. His departure leaves a gaping hole in the office that is
<a href="https://a856-gbol.nyc.gov/GBOLWebsite/GreenBook/Details?orgId=7560" target="_blank"><u>tasked
with</u></a> coordinating the agencies involved in an extreme weather
response, including directly overseeing NYCEM and the FDNY. (Banks
<a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/10/07/philip-banks-resigned-eric-adams/" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a>
was also at the forefront of promoting the city’s use of “high-tech
devices, including drones.)
</p>
<p>
<span></span>When I asked Iscol — who has
<a href="https://x.com/zachiscol/status/1838336960512881149" target="_blank"><u>publicly
admitted</u></a> to having had his own conversations about leaving the
administration due to the ongoing turmoil — during the drill
(i.e. before Banks resigned) whether he was confident that there could
still be smooth operations between City Hall and its agencies in the
event of a near-term disaster, he told me firmly that he was. “There are
300,000 people that work for the city of New York, and they’re showing
up every day,” he told me. “It’s our job to show up and make sure they
have the resources and support and the guidance and direction they need
to be successful to deliver for New Yorkers.” He emphasized that “it’s
business as usual for the agencies,” despite how things look in the
headlines.
</p>
<p>
As for the drones, the commissioner seemed clear-eyed in assessing their
usefulness. “As you do things that are new and for the first time, it’s
an evolution — you’re always improving,” he told me. Drone advancements
are “iterative, kind of like an iPhone,” and he’s aware they’re not all
the way there yet. But “it’s not like we’re <em><em>only</em></em> using
drones,” he stressed. “We’re still taking a multi-channel approach.”
</p>
<p>
Concerned onlookers will often approach Font, the interagency
coordinator, to ask if he’s spying on them when they notice him flying a
drone. He told me that he is always eager to show regular New Yorkers
how the city is using the technology: “We’re a bunch of tech guys, so we
really love getting into the nuts and bolts of it,” he said.
</p>
<p>
He expects, though, that eventually the questions and suspicious looks
will start to taper off. The NYPD and FDNY already use drones in their
everyday operations throughout the city; companies like Amazon have also
started exploring the use of drones to deliver packages. Drones will
become increasingly commonplace as the years wear on. Boring, even! So
<em><em>of course</em></em> they’ll be used during extreme weather
events, too.
</p>
<p>
“This is the world we live in now,” he said.

Hurricane Milton is intensifying rapidly in the Atlantic and is expected

make landfall near Tampa Bay in Florida by Wednesday, less than two
weeks after Hurricane Helene tore through the area. It could bring a
foot of rain, possible more, and 10-15 feet of storm surge. “We expect
the storm surge to be worse than what many people experienced during

<li>Oil giants reportedly want Trump to keep the IRA

Some large fossil fuel companies have urged Republican presidential
candidate Donald Trump not to gut the Inflation Reduction Act if he
comes into power again in November, <em><em>The Wall Street
Journal</em></em>
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/big-oil-urges-trump-not-to-gut-bidens-climate-law-795dc597?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
The IRA, President Biden’s landmark climate law, provides tax credits
for renewable energy and carbon capture projects, including many that
these oil giants have heavily invested in. According to the
<em><em>Journal</em></em>, executives from Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66, and
Occidental Petroleum have been in discussions with the Trump campaign
and congressional allies to make the case for the law, which Trump has
called the “Green New Scam” and vowed to roll back. Political
strategists told the <em><em>Journal</em></em> that Trump may try to
“rebrand” the IRA given its popularity among Republican states. A recent

walked back their energy transition goals.

In case you missed it: Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum,
pledged last week to “boost renewable energies” to a 45% share of the
country’s total energy mix by 2030. Sheinbaum, who was inaugurated on
Tuesday, is a climate scientist, and her ascension has raised hopes
among environmentalists that Mexico could ramp up climate action.
Sheinbaum made many promises during her campaign but analysts have been
skeptical of their staying power because she also promised to carry on
the legacy of her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who doubled
down on fossil fuels. But the strong words during Sheinbaum’s first
speech as president “marks a sharp departure” from López Obrador,

her energy transition program focused on “the reduction of greenhouse
gases that cause climate change.” Mexico is the only G20 nation that

of Global Water Resources</a> report today. It found that more than half
of the world’s “river catchments” – watersheds or drainage basins – saw
unusual levels of water flow last year. Mostly, there was less water
than normal, with “large territories” of North, Central, and South
America especially dry and many river flows falling to all-time lows.
But in some places, like the Horn of Africa, the Philippines, and the
United Kingdom, there was much more water than normal. These extremes –
drought in some places and extreme flooding in others – were reflected
in the regional soil moisture and terrestrial water levels. Glaciers
lost more than 600 gigatons of water last year, the largest loss

<em>The Guardian</em>. “As a result of rising temperatures, the
hydrological cycle has accelerated. It has also become more erratic and
unpredictable, and we are facing growing problems of either too much or
too little water. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture which is
conducive to heavy rainfall. More rapid evaporation and drying of soils
worsen drought conditions.”
