Mesoscale Discussion 1998
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 PM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Areas affected...Portions of southern New England

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 648...

Valid 261826Z - 262030Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 648
continues.

SUMMARY...Large hail and isolated wind damage will remain possible
until storms move offshore. Should additional storms develop to the
north, the severe risk will likely be more marginal.

DISCUSSION...Scattered storms continue across parts of southern New
England. Thus far, 1-1.5 inch hail has been the primary observed
hazard over the past 90 minutes. The environment will remain
supportive of large hail and isolated wind damage before storms move
offshore within the next few hours. Given the position of the
greatest mid-level ascent on water vapor imagery, additional
development to the north of the current activity will likely be more
isolated in nature. With shear and buoyancy weaker with northern
extent, the severe threat should remain more marginal.

Mesoscale Discussion 1997
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1235 PM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Areas affected...Portions of central Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 261735Z - 261900Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Initial storm development in central Minnesota may be
elevated to marginally surface based and struggle against residual
capping. Should storms mature, large hail and wind damage are
possible. A watch is possible, but this will depend on trends in
convective evolution.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed in west-central Minnesota,
likely aided by weak warm advection at lower levels. This mornings
soundings from Aberdeen/Minneapolis showed a warm nose within the
850-700 mb layer. It appears that convection is struggling to
intensify/organize with this capping in place. Furthermore,
large-scale ascent is currently weak. Should this activity mature,
large hail and isolated wind damage would be possible.

Short-term guidance is not consistent in how this activity will
evolve, with some suggesting it will weaken in the next few hours
and others showing cold pool development that spurs new convection
farther south where greater buoyancy resides. From a large-scale
perspective, greater ascent/mid-level cooling is not expected until
later in the afternoon, though an MCV moving through eastern South
Dakota could potentially supplement ascent locally earlier. The most
probable scenario is that more robust convection will develop by
mid/late afternoon near an area of surface convergence in central
Minnesota. The need for a watch in the short term is uncertain;
however, trends will continue to be closely monitored this
afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1996
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1215 PM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Areas affected...northeast WY...southeast MT...western SD...and
western NE

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 261715Z - 261915Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorm potential will increase over the next
few hours across eastern Wyoming into far southeast Montana, western
South Dakota and western Nebraska. Large hail and severe wind gusts
possible with this activity. A severe thunderstorm watch will likely
be needed for portions of the region in the next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...A strong mid/upper trough will continue to eject
east/northeast across WY/MT this afternoon, providing ample
large-scale ascent for thunderstorm development. Boundary-layer
moisture will remain modest, but cool temperatures aloft/steep lapse
rates will foster MLCAPE from 1000-2000 J/kg. Effective shear
greater than 40 kt will favor organized updrafts, with a mix of
supercells and line segments possible. Elongated/straight hodographs
combined with a favorable thermodynamic and kinematic environment
will support large hail, with some potential for isolated hail
stones in the 2-3 inch diameter range in the strongest cells.
Additional heating will result in steepening low-level lapse rates,
enhancing severe gust potential, particularly across parts of
eastern WY into far southwest SD and northwest NE, where a few gusts
greater than 70 mph are possible. 

Some uncertainty exists on the north/east extent of severe potential
as morning convection across central SD has left lingering cloud
cover while reinforcing a more southward position of a surface
baroclinic zone near the SD/NE border. Nevertheless, a severe
thunderstorm watch will likely be needed for portions of the MCD
area within the next couple of hours.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1230 PM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER MUCH OF THE
GREAT LAKES REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible on Tuesday, primarily across
the Great Lakes region and portions of the Midwest.

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will progress steadily east across the Great
Lakes region on Tuesday as an associated cold front moves south
across the upper Midwest and western Great Lakes.  A strong upper
low will move across the Pacific Northwest, while an expansive
upper-level anticyclone remains centered in the vicinity of the
mid-Mississippi Valley.

...Great Lakes/Upper Midwest and portions of the OH
Valley/Northeast...
Thunderstorms may be in progress across portions of WI/MI Upper
Peninsula at 12z Tuesday, aided by low-level warm advection in
advance of the upper-level trough.  Substantial destabilization
(MLCAPE in excess of 2000 J/kg) is expected to develop by afternoon
in advance of the cold front, reinforced by convective outflows from
early day storms.  Although the front should move south of the
stronger mid-level flow before becoming quasi-stationary, sufficient
shear should be in place to support organized storms including a mix
of multicell and supercell structures.

Thunderstorms are expected to develop or intensify across
eastern/southern WI/lower MI during the afternoon, as well as
farther south along the front across IA and eventually the northeast
KS vicinity.  Aided by modest southwest/west mid-level flow, storms
should move east and merge into one or more clusters with time
posing a risk for damaging gusts as the primary severe hazard.
Isolated instances of large hail will also be possible with the
strongest updrafts. The potential does exist for a corridor of
greater coverage of damaging winds Tuesday afternoon/evening, but
uncertainty remains on the location given the effects of early
storms and varied hi-res guidance solutions.  This potential will be
addressed in future outlooks.

Valid 261630Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTH-CENTRAL PLAINS AND UPPER MIDWEST...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHERN
NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm wind gusts, large to very large hail and a
couple of tornadoes are possible this afternoon through tonight
especially across parts of South Dakota, northern Nebraska,
central/southern Minnesota, and into Wisconsin.

...North-central Plains to Upper Midwest...
A relatively active severe-weather day is expected regionally,
especially late this afternoon through tonight, with multiple rounds
of severe storms possible potentially including eastern South Dakota
and parts of central/southern Minnesota into far western Wisconsin.

Strong to locally severe storms have already occurred this morning
across interior Wyoming, in relatively close proximity to the
northeastward-ejecting shortwave trough that will cross the northern
High Plains toward the Dakotas through tonight. This convection is
thought to be harbinger of a broader/increasing severe risk that
should develop this afternoon from far northeast/east-central
Wyoming into southwest South Dakota including the Black Hills/Pine
Ridge vicinities. Some initial supercells capable of large hail will
be possible, but these storms should organize into an MCS and
expand/intensify as activity proceeds into greater moisture,
instability and post-frontal low-level flow to the east. These
storms could persist eastward this evening across southern South
Dakota/far northern Nebraska, and all the way into southern
Minnesota/far northern Iowa overnight through the predawn hours.

Another area of potential severe thunderstorm development including
supercells will be across eastern South Dakota east-northeastward
into central Minnesota early as mid/late afternoon near the front,
where a very moist (middle to upper 70s F surface dewpoints) and
very unstable (4000+ J/kg MLCAPE) air mass will reside. This could
somewhat relate to ongoing thunderstorms across central South Dakota
at late morning, or perhaps more likely, ahead of it into central
Minnesota. While potentially intense severe storms/supercells are
plausible, some uncertainty exists regarding the diurnal extent of
deep convective development given the likelihood of residual
mid-level capping. Even if diurnally related development through
peak heating is more limited, severe-weather potential should
steadily increase from west-to-east across east/southeast South
Dakota, southern Minnesota/northern Iowa into western Wisconsin
tonight via likely upstream MCS development.

...Northeast States/Mid-Atlantic...
A belt of generally strengthening northerly flow aloft, along with
modestly cool mid-level temperatures, will reside across the region
on the western periphery on offshore-shifting upper-level trough.
Coincident with low/some middle 60s F surface dewpoints, moderate
destabilization (1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE) is expected this afternoon
across southern New England/eastern New York southwestward toward
the Delmarva/coastal Mid-Atlantic. Multiple corridors of at least
widely scattered south/southeastward-moving storms should evolve
this afternoon, including southern New England/southeast New York as
well as the Pennsylvania/Maryland/Virginia border vicinity. Isolated
severe wind and hail will be possible this afternoon through
early/mid-evening. For additional short-term information, see
Mesoscale Discussion 1995.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1142 AM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track. For details, see the previous
discussion below.

..Weinman.. 08/26/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0134 AM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough traversing the northern Rockies is poised to
eject into the Plains states while a second mid-level trough grazes
the Pacific Northwest today. Surface high pressure will dominate the
Intermountain West, while a surface lee trough will become
established to the east of the Cascades. The net result will be
relatively quiescent fire weather conditions across much of the
western CONUS, though locally dry and windy conditions could
manifest in terrain-favoring areas.

Mesoscale Discussion 1995
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1051 AM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Areas affected...portions of New England

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 261551Z - 261745Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms may produce gusty winds and hail
around 1-1.5 inch diameter through the afternoon. Trends are being
monitored for possible watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are gradually increasing in coverage and
intensity at midday as strong heating occurs across a seasonally
moist airmass. The 12z RAOB from ALB indicated modestly steep
midlevel lapse rates around 6.5-7 C/km amid 30 kt 0-6 km
northwesterly flow. Cool midlevel temperatures contributing modest
instability, and elongated/straight hodographs suggest large hail
will be possible with stronger cells. Effective shear magnitudes
will be somewhat marginal for longer-lived well-organized updrafts,
and convection may be somewhat pulse-like. As additional heating
occurs, steepening low-level lapse rates also may support sporadic
strong/locally damaging gusts. Convective trends are being monitored
for possible watch issuance for portions of the MCD area, with
somewhat greater watch potential focused across southern New England
this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1994
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0958 AM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Areas affected...portions of central WY

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 261458Z - 261630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms may sporadically produce large hail
to near 1.25 inch diameter and strong gusts to 65 mph into early
afternoon across portions of central Wyoming.

DISCUSSION...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms have developed
this morning within strong ascent associated with an upper shortwave
trough now ejecting east/northeast across western WY. The 12z RAOB
from RIW showed very steep midlevel lapse rates and cold
temperatures aloft amid increasing south/southwesterly mid/upper
level flow. This vertical wind profile will maintain
elongated/straight hodographs as the system continues to progress
east/northeast into early afternoon. This environment will remain
favorable for marginally severe hail over the next few hours. As
stronger heating occurs with eastward extent, steepening low-level
lapse rates and only modest boundary layer moisture may foster
isolated strong gusts as well. Given limited coverage and overall
marginal nature of the severe risk over the next few hours, a watch
is not expected.

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  34
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
500 AM HST Mon Aug 26 2024
 
Gilma still has a well-defined eye, seen on GOES-18 infrared and 
proxy-vis satellite imagery.  The latest subjective intensity 
estimates are T-4.5/77 kt from TAFB and T-5.0/90 kt from SAB. Recent 
objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS such as the ADT and 
DPRINT are in the 80 to 85 kt range.  However, during the last 
couple of hours, the eye has warmed and the cloud tops in the 
eyewall have cooled, so the initial intensity is increased to 90 kt, 
in best agreement with the SAB Dvorak intensity estimate.

Gilma is likely currently experiencing 10 to 15 kt of westerly wind 
shear as it continues moving near and parallel to the 26C SST 
isotherm.  Fluctuations in intensity appear possible for the next 12 
h.  Beyond 12 to 18 h, the westerly shear is forecast to increase to 
the 15 to 20 kt range, and the SSTs are forecast to decrease 
slightly along the path beyond 36 h.  These factors, along with the 
relatively dry, stable environmental air mass that Gilma will be 
traversing for the remainder of its lifetime, are expected to lead 
to continued steady weakening.  The NHC intensity forecast is a bit 
higher than the previous official forecast at hour 12, and then is 
similar to the previous official forecast.  The NHC forecast is near 
the middle of the intensity guidance envelope.
 
Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 275/7 kt as
it continues moving along the southern periphery of a
mid-tropospheric subtropical ridge.  The models continue to be in
good cross-track agreement that the west to west-northwestward
motion will continue, although there are still some along-track
differences in the guidance.  The new NHC forecast lies very close
to, but perhaps a touch to the south of the previous official
forecast.  This forecast is close to the HCCA and TCVE consensus
aids.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  17
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Mon Aug 26 2024
 
Moderate westerly shear is continuing to take a toll on Hone. The 
low level circulation appears to be partly exposed and the center 
is likely near the western edge of an earlier burst of convection. 
PHFO and JTWC subjective intensities were 3.5, which agrees well 
with UW-CIMSS SATCON and AiDT. The initial intensity was lowered to 
55 kt with this advisory.

Hone continues to move just north of due west, 280/11, to the south 
of deep layer ridging. This general motion should persist for the 
next several days and the track guidance is still relatively 
tightly clustered. The current forecast is very similar to the 
previous forecast track. Although Hone will be moving over warmer 
sea surface temperatures, increasingly strong shear through the 
forecast period will continue to gradually weaken the tropical 
cyclone. Later in the forecast period, the low level trade wind 
flow will continue to take the shallow circulation of Hone on a 
westward journey. Most of the guidance shows a slightly slower 
forward speed prior to expected dissipation. The intensity forecast 
continues to be a blend of the statistical and dynamical guidance, 
and very similar to the previous forecast package. Hone should 
become a remnant low in about 4 days prior to dissipation as it 
approaches the International Date Line.

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
500 AM HST Mon Aug 26 2024

Microwave imagery continues to show evidence of northerly shear 
over the cyclone, with the mid-level center displaced a little to 
the south of the surface center.  However, the overall cloud 
pattern appears to be slightly better organized than it was 
yesterday with some evidence of banding features over the eastern 
portion of the circulation.  The advisory intensity has been 
increased a bit, to 45 kt, in agreement with subjective Dvorak 
Current Intensity Numbers from TAFB and SAB.
 
Center fixes from geostationary and microwave imagery give a 
westward motion at around 270/9 kt.  A weak low- to mid-level ridge 
is currently situated to the north of Hector, and the global 
models suggest that the ridge will build a little in a few days.  
The track guidance calls for a west-northwestward to westward 
heading with a slight increase in forward speed for the next 3-5 
days.  The official forecast is similar to the previous one and 
follows the dynamical model consensus predictions.

Although the vertical shear is not forecast to be very strong, 
Hector is expected to traverse marginal SSTs for the next few days 
while it moves over or near the oceanic wake of Hurricane Gilma.  
Also, the global models show the system encountering increasingly 
dry air at low- to mid-levels.  The intensity guidance does not 
call for much additional strengthening and the official 
forecast is at the high end of the model predictions.  With the
expected less favorable environment, a weakening trend is likely to 
begin in a couple of days.  Simulated satellite imagery from the 
ECMWF and GFS models show little or no deep convection associated 
with Hector by the end of the forecast period, so the official 
forecast calls for the system to become a remnant low at that time.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTH DAKOTA...EXTREME NORTHERN NEBRASKA...MINNESOTA...AND
WISCONSIN...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SURROUNDING THE
ENHANCED RISK...AND ACROSS PORTIONS OF NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm gusts, large to very large hail and a few
tornadoes are possible today and tonight across parts of South
Dakota, extreme northern Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a persistent and large anticyclone has shifted
its center across the southern Plains to the lower Missouri Valley,
with ridging northeastward across the Lake Superior and James Bay
regions.  The ridge will shift eastward across the Upper Great Lakes
and southern QC through the period.  This will occur in response to
these developments on either side:
1.  A broad but not very intense cyclone -- initially centered near
the western ME/QC border -- will pivot roughly eastward to the
adjoining parts and the Canadian Maritimes through the period.  As
this occurs, a shortwave trough/vorticity lobe -- now in the western
semicircle of the cyclone over the St. Lawrence Valley -- should dig
southward across eastern NY and extreme western New England today,
then weaken and move offshore from the southern New England Coast
tonight.
2.  A strong shortwave trough -- initially over western MT,
southeastern ID and northern UT -- should move to eastern MT and
central WY by 00Z, then to the western Dakotas within 12 more hours.
This will foster the northeastward ejection of two weak
perturbations, now apparent in moisture-channel imagery over the
western NE Panhandle/southeastern WY region into southwestern SD,
the other over central/eastern CO.  By 00Z, these features should
reach eastern ND and eastern/southern SD, respectively.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a low near FSD, with cold front
arching southwestward across the NE Sandhills then northwestward to
another low over east-central WY near CPR.  A quasistationary
frontal zone was drawn from the low northeastward over western/
northern MN.  The low should move slowly eastward today while the
poleward frontal extension moves little, and the cold front moves
southeastward into northwestern IA and eastern/central NE.  The
western segment of that front should hang up over northwestern NE
and east-central WY amid mass response to the approaching shortwave
trough, which also should induce a surface trough and perhaps
secondary/reinforcing baroclinic zone across the lee of the
north-central Rockies over eastern WY and into southeastern MT.

...North-central Plains to Upper Midwest...
Two main rounds of severe-thunderstorm potential are apparent today,
each crossing portions of the main risk area, which represents an
aggregated severe potential from both complexes.  From east to west:

1.  Strong-severe thunderstorms should develop over eastern SD near
or north/northwest of the surface low this afternoon -- perhaps
arising as early and far west as central SD during midday.  This
activity will be related to maximized low-level lift associated with
the low, and a plume of large-scale ascent preceding the weaker
shortwave troughs, and already supporting convection at this time
over western SD.  Whether the ongoing convection will be continuous
with later activity is uncertain.  In either event, this eastern
complex should intensify substantially over the southeastern
SD/southwestern MN/northwestern IA vicinity as it crosses the
low-level baroclinic zone and encounters a strongly unstable, richly
moist boundary layer, with upper 60s to mid 70s surface dewpoints. 
Beneath steep lower-middle-level lapse rates, this should contribute
to a corridor of 3500-5000 J/kg MLCAPE near I-90 from the FSD area
to near the Mississippi River, decreasing to a still-favorable
2000-4000 J/kg in central MN.  Supercells with destructive hail,
potentially significant-severe gusts, and a few tornadoes are
possible, though so is fairly quick upscale expansion.

2.  An area of convection may develop as early as late morning to
midday well behind the surface cold front, in higher terrain of
northern/central WY, initially with a marginal severe threat.  This
convection should be supported by at least modest low/middle-level
moisture, and strong cooling/destabilization aloft, related to the
swath of strong large-scale DCVA/ascent immediately preceding the
northern Rockies shortwave trough.  This activity may be an
outgrowth or extension of nonsevere thunderstorms now over extreme
western WY near the Star and Hams Fork Valleys and adjacent ranges. 
These thunderstorms should organize into an MCS and expand/intensify
as activity proceeds into greater moisture, instability and
storm-relative/post-frontal low-level flow to the east, on the High
Plains and near the Black Hills.

Northeasterly to easterly flow behind the front and near the trough,
beneath strengthening southwest flow aloft, will support 45-60 kt
effective-shear magnitudes.  Buoyancy will increase eastward as the
convection -- which may already have evolve into an outflow-dominant
arc by the time it gets into greater moisture east of the Black
Hills -- further intensifies into the northern part of a corridor of
1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE and still-favorable storm-relative boundary-
layer flow.  Some of this convection may be supercellular to the
extent it can remain at least somewhat discrete, with severe wind
and large to very large hail possible. With time, wind will dominate
as the main threat.  This activity should encounter the outflow from
the other complex somewhere over southeastern SD or southern MN
tonight.

Mesoscale uncertainty over the positioning and strength of the
outflow (and thus threat of severe to its poleward side) preclude
greater unconditional probabilities at this time.  Still, a focused
corridor of destructive winds remains a possibility across southern
parts of SD/MN, some of it potentially affecting areas struck by the
first complex.

...Northeastern CONUS...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms should develop over
portions of eastern NY and New England, as well as parts of
western/central PA and northwestern MD -- each moving southward to
southeastward through a favorable airmass for organized convection. 
Strong to locally severe gusts are possible, along with severe hail.

Over the New England part of the outlook, cold air aloft, overlying
low-level moisture represented by mid/upper 50s F surface dewpoints,
should combine with limited diurnal heating to remove MLCINH, and
support peak/preconvective MLCAPE ion the 1000-1500 J/kg range. 
Though low-level flow will be modest, relatively straight/lengthy
hodographs will support some hail potential.  Further southwest,
greater low-level moisture (dewpoints mostly mid/upper 60s to near
70 F at lower elevations) but weaker mid/upper-level lapse rates
will be present, yielding similar CAPE values but with different
vertical distribution of buoyancy (more skewed to low levels). 
Still, enough deep/speed shear will be present to support organized
multicells and at least transient/isolated supercells.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  16
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Hone appears quite disorganized on satellite and radar this 
evening. However, the earlier exposed low level circulation center 
is once again obscured by layered cloud, and a ragged band of deep 
convection has redeveloped around a portion of the low level 
circulation center. The current intensity has been reduced to 60 kt, 
which is a blend of the unanimous data-T numbers and current 
intensity estimates from the fix agencies. This could be generous, 
given Hone's messy appearance.

The initial motion is 280/12. Deep layer ridging to the north of 
Hone is expected to maintain the system on a westerly track the 
next few days. Later in the forecast period, Hone is expected to be 
increasingly steered by the low level tradewind flow to the south 
of a vast subtropical ridge spanning much of the Pacific. The track 
guidance remains tightly clustered and the latest official forecast 
is very similar to the previous.

The UW-CIMSS shear analysis shows Hone is already in an environment 
of moderate shear. Over the next few days, Hone will continue to 
skirt along the southern periphery of the subtropical jet, 
subjecting the system to increasing westerly shear. This should 
continue the weakening trend, despite a gradual increase in sea 
surface temperatures along the forecast track. The intensity 
forecast continues to agree well with the statistical and dynamical 
guidance, and dissipation is expected as a remnant low late in the 
week.

Mahalo to both the U.S. Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane 
Hunters for gathering much critical data from Tropical Cyclone Hone 
the last few days.

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
This evening's satellite presentation consists of a ragged
partially obscured eye with a small inner core open in the south
semi-circle.  Gilma's cloud pattern continues to deteriorate slowly
and has shed most of the associated convective bands with the
exception of fragmented curved band wrapping in from the south.
The initial intensity is lowered to 85 kt and is based on the
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB and a blend
of the UW-CIMSS ADT, AiDT, and DMINT objective estimates, yielding
83 kt.
 
Water vapor imagery and global model RH/700mb fields indicate that
the cyclone is moving toward a dry, stable air mass, indicative of
a large low-level stratocumulus cloud deck intruding from the
northwest in the GOES-18 Proxy-VIS images.  Subsequently, the
statistical GFS/ECMWF SHIPS indicated a mid-level/700-500mb RH of
42 percent.  This inhibiting thermodynamic contribution, along with
increasing west-to-west-southwesterly shear noted in the
statistical SHIPS intensity guidance, particularly beyond 36 hrs,
should cause Gilma to weaken at a quicker rate through day 5.
The NHC intensity forecast is a compromise of the Decay-SHIPS and
the IVCN intensity consensus and shows Gilma degenerating to a
post-tropical cyclone in 4 days.
 
Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 280/8 kt,
and is moving in the southern periphery of a mid-tropospheric
subtropical ridge extending westward across the tropical-eastern
Pacific from northwestern Mexico.  The global and regional models
are fairly clustered together and indicate a slightly to the right
of the initial track motion, or west-northwestward beyond the 60 hr 
period, and the official forecast follows suit.  Along-track 
differences continue to be a model inconsistency, but following the 
skilled TVCE and HCCA consensus models have been the best track 
forecast solution so far.
 
Gilma's 50 kt wind radii have been slightly adjusted based on a 
0559 UTC METOP-C ASCAT overpass.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify and traverse the northern Rockies
tomorrow (Tuesday), encouraging strong surface gradient winds over
the Pacific Northwest in response to a deepening surface lee trough.
Dry and windy conditions are likely along and to the lee of the
Cascades, where fuels are at least modestly receptive to wildfire
spread. Here, 15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds may overlap
with dry fuels and 15-25 percent RH for at least a few hours. As
such, Elevated highlights have been added to address the regionally
favorable wildfire-spread threat.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
None.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning remains in effect for...
* Hawaii County
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
Interests elsewhere in Hawaii should monitor the progress of Hone.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by the National Weather Service office in
Honolulu Hawaii.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 800 AM HST (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hone was located 
by Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 18.5 
North, longitude 156.6 West. Hone is moving toward the west near 8 
mph (13 km/h). This general motion is expected to continue the next 
couple of days, with some increase in forward speed.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher
gusts. Hone is expected to gradually weaken the next couple of 
days. 

Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115
miles (185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 990 mb (29.23 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO header WTPA41
PHFO, and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical Storm conditions will continue on the Big Island
through the morning hours. Winds are expected to be strongest
downslope of higher terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
RAINFALL: Hone is expected to produce an additional 3 to 6 inches 
of rainfall over mainly southeast and south facing slopes of the
Big Island. Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches will be possible 
over the smaller islands, mainly windward.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Hone are affecting portions of the 
Hawaiian islands, producing life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Mesoscale Discussion 1987
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1127 AM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Areas affected...parts of eastern Utah...adjacent northwestern
Colorado and southwestern Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251627Z - 251830Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying renewed thunderstorm development is possible
across much of eastern Utah by 1-2 PM MDT.  Widely scattered
stronger storms may pose a risk for severe hail and wind while
spreading northeastward and eastward through late afternoon.  While
it is still not yet certain that a severe weather watch will be
needed, trends are being monitored for this possibility.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of a seasonably vigorous short wave trough
slowly progressing east-northeastward through the Great Basin, a
narrow band of large-scale ascent continues to gradually spread east
of the Wasatch.  This is in the wake of initial low-level warm
advection driven convection now spreading spreading northeastward
through the Colorado and adjacent Wyoming Rockies, with insolation
across a relatively moist boundary layer over much of eastern Utah
contributing to increasing destabilization.

Through 18-20Z, models suggest that mixed-layer CAPE may increase to
500-1000 J/kg, coincident with further strengthening of south to
southwesterly mid/upper wind fields (including 30-70+ kt in the
700-300 mb layer).  As new thunderstorm development begins to
initiate, it appears that this regime will become potentially
conducive to evolution of isolated supercells.  In addition to
posing a risk for large hail, stronger storms may become capable of
producing locally severe wind gusts, particularly as they spread
across the more strongly heated and deeply mixed lower elevations
through late afternoon.

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
500 AM HST Sun Aug 25 2024

Over the last 6 hours, Gilma's eye has continued to be present on 
most of the infrared and proxy vis images. However, the eye has 
become a bit more cloud-filled, and the convection over the 
southwestern eyewall is slightly less robust. Although the CI 
numbers from TAFB and SAB are still T-6.0/115 kt, the respective 
Final T numbers are lower than that. Recent UW-CIMSS objective 
intensity estimates range from 84 to 113 kt. Based on a blend of the 
subjective and objective intensity estimates, the initial intensity 
is nudged down slightly to 110 kt for this advisory.

Gilma is currently moving very near the 26C isotherm and is located 
in an environment of low vertical wind shear. The middle troposphere 
is fairly dry in the environment surrounding Gilma, but the cyclone 
has been able to prevent the dry air from entraining into the center 
enough to significantly disrupt the hurricane. The environmental 
conditions are not forecast to become more conducive for 
strengthening. Westerly vertical wind shear is forecast to increase 
slightly by late tonight or early Monday. SSTs should decrease 
slightly along the path of Gilma by late Monday or Monday night. 
Based on these factors, only slow weakening is forecast for the next 
24 h followed by more steady weakening after that. The confidence in 
the intensity forecast seems slightly below average in the 
short-term while Gilma straddles the 26C SST isotherm and remains in 
relatively low shear. In the 24 to 96 h time frame, Gilma should be 
weakening, but the rate at which it weakens is a bit uncertain. By 
day 4, vertical wind shear increases to moderate to strong, making 
it likely that Gilma should be significantly weaker in the 4- to 
5-day time frame. Gilma is forecast to lose its convection and 
become a remnant low by day 5. The NHC intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous one, perhaps showing a slightly slower rate of 
weakening in the 36-72 h period, closer to the latest intensity 
consensus guidance.

Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 275/8 kt. A 
strengthening mid-tropospheric subtropical ridge situated to the 
north of the hurricane should steer Gilma on a westward to 
west-northwestward track through the forecast period. The official 
forecast is nearly unchanged from the previous advisory and is close 
to a blend of the TVCE and GFEX.

Hurricane Hone Discussion Number  13
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Hone is passing by around 40 nautical miles south of South Point on 
the Big Island of Hawaii this morning, where it is within radar 
range. Combined radar, and data from an Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft mission earlier this morning, support 
raising the initial intensity of Hone to 75 knots, keeping it a 
Category 1 Hurricane. Despite recent subjective Dvorak estimates 
suggesting a slightly lower intensity, the satellite presentation 
has evolved markedly overnight, with cold cloud tops near -75 C 
reinforcing the radar and aircraft-based intensities. The initial 
intensity is raised to 75 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion of Hone is set at 280/07. This westward 
trajectory is expected to persist over the coming days, influenced 
by a subtropical ridge to the north. However, as Hone remains near 
the Big Island through the early morning hours today, the 
mountainous terrain could influence local steering currents, 
potentially leading to localized and short-term deviations in the 
storm's motion and intensity. As we move into the early to mid 
portion of the week, Hone is projected to encounter increasing 
vertical wind shear, which is expected to weaken the storm and make 
it more shallow. This change in conditions will allow the low-level 
trade wind flow to steer the system toward the west-southwest. The 
official forecast track remains nearly identical to the previous 
advisory and is closely aligned with the tightly clustered consensus 
guidance.
 
Environmental conditions affecting Hone will remain steady over the 
next 12 to 24 h, with sea surface temperatures between 26 C and 27 
C, light to moderate vertical wind shear, and sufficient mid-level 
moisture. This supports maintaining a steady trend in intensity 
through the morning hours today. Although sea surface temperatures 
are forecast to rise to around 27 C tonight and beyond as Hone 
continues westward, increasing vertical wind shear will translate to 
a gradual weakening trend later today through the middle of the 
week. The intensity forecast closely follows dynamical consensus 
guidance.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm conditions will continue on the Big Island through 
the morning hours. Winds are expected to be strongest downslope of 
higher terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
2. Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 6 to 12
inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the Big
Island, with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall totals of 2
to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller islands,
mainly windward.
 
3. Swells generated by Hone will continue today as this system 
continues westward. Expect dangerous conditions with 
life-threatening surf and rip currents.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM HST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Hone was located 
near latitude 18.3 North, longitude 156.1 West. Hone is moving 
toward the west near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this motion is expected to 
continue through the middle of the week.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher 
gusts. Little change in strength is expected through the morning 
hours today, before a gradual weakening trend begins this afternoon 
onward. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Hone can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header TCDCP1 and WMO header WTPA41
PHFO, and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/HFOTCDCP1.shtml.
 
WIND: Tropical Storm conditions will continue on the Big Island
through the morning hours. Winds are expected to be strongest
downslope of higher terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
RAINFALL: Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 6 to
12 inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the
Big Island, with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall totals
of 2 to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller
islands, mainly windward.
 
SURF: Surf associated with large swells generated by Hone will
continue today as Hone tracks westward. Expect dangerous conditions 
with life-threatening surf and rip currents.
