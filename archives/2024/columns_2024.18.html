<h2 id="the-soundtrack-of-your-life">The soundtrack of your life</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’ve developed new appreciation for two musicians from my generation:
George Harrison and Bob Dylan, thanks to the encouragement of two
friends, both of whom have links to my childhood believe it or not, but
who are current friends in my
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dotage">dotage</a> and they’re
both on Facebook.
</p>
<p>
So my first friend said she likes
<a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison">George
Harrison</a> the best of all the Beatles, and I thought that’s weird
because it really was down to Paul and John, I thought – and then I
heard this interview with George asking why he didn’t explain in his
memoir how he worshipped John as a kid, and George took exception,
saying yeah in John’s mind that’s who I am, a kid who worshipped him,
which I never did (says George). So now I have gone back through his
music and see holy shit he really was as unique as either of the others,
and he was more of a collaborator in his later life than either (of
course we never got to find out how John would have evolved past 1980).
And he was never going to be taken seriously by the others, so he had to
get out of there to have the creative life he wanted.
</p>
<p>
About Dylan, the credit goes to my local friend and
<a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/song-173-all-along-the-watchtower-part-one-hes-not-the-messiah/">Andrew
Hickey</a>, who focused my attention on the <i>music</i> of Dylan’s
songs, when I had only been focusing on the lyrics. Silly of me. He only
ever wanted to be seen as a musician, not a leader of anything, and
that’s where the difficulty came from, and why I wasn’t really
interested, even though I had listened to all the Dylan songs many
times, and had a few of his albums growing up. So I just played
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangled_Up_in_Blue">Tangled Up in
Blue</a> and realized this has been rolling around in my mind for days,
and I wasn’t even aware of it.
</p>
<p>
Kind of like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower">All
Along the Watchtower</a> (another Dylan song) in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar
Galactica</a>, which I just heard is currently
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-1/dp/B000UU2YKE">on
Amazon</a>. I think it’s time for another binge of that. ;-)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, two doors open, and that’s always good. You know this is why you
pick your music when you’re young and stay with it, because it’s the
soundtrack of your life, and it has new relevance at every step of your
evolution. Sure I listen to other music, but – it’s the songs that were
big when I was little that matter most.

<p>BTW, there are plenty of relatively low priced
<a href="https://www.stubhub.com/indiana-pacers-indianapolis-tickets-5-10-2024/event/152902691/?quantity=2">tickets
available</a> at the Pacers arena for the May 10 game when the playoff
heads to Indiana. This is one of the Knicks fans’ favorite tactics.
Since there are so many New Yorkers, spread out all over the country,
and we’re pretty much all Knicks fans, this can create a demoralizing
effect for the opposition players who assume their hometown crowd will
be rooting for them, not the other team. It had a pretty adverse effect
on the Sixers a few days ago. I was chatting about this with fellow
Knicks fan
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=NakedJen">NakedJen</a> during
last night’s harrowing game, and said this might be a good tactic
somehow in the election, if every time the opposition had a rally they
discovered that most of the attendees were actually in favor of
democracy and abortion rights.</p>

round</a>, starting Monday, back in NYC, against the Indiana Pacers, an
excellent team this year. And Doc Searls, who is also a Knicks fan, now
lives in Indiana, so he is somewhat justified in believing the world
revolves around him. I’ve always had that sense about Doc.</p>

<p>Friends, From time to time, I share with you some of my personal
history so that you understand where my values come from. The late 1960s
was a time of experimentation — “sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll” and a
lot more. The giant baby-boom generation was heading out into the world
that seemed to many of us to be nuts. Some of us joined cults. Others,
urban communes. Others, utopian communities in the countryside.</p>

Thinking</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Nature, one of the world’s most prestigious journals,
had this jarring headline: The article explained this further:
“Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as the chatbot ChatGPT, have
become so advanced that they now very nearly match or exceed human
performance in tasks including reading comprehension, image
classification and competition-level mathematics, according to a new
report”.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
TL;DR: It’s gone – you can’t get <a href="http://1999.io/">there</a>.
Because it uses Twitter for identity. It and bingeworthy.io are the two
apps I miss the most.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io">1999
was a rewrite</a> of blogging software from the point of view of both
1999 and 2016. Both timeframes. I had learned a lot inbetween, and the
art of online interaction had moved forward a lot. I had become a user
of Facebook, and was impressed with how their software worked. I was
imploring them to turn it into a blogging system, it was achingly close.
When I realized they weren’t going to do it, I set out to do it myself,
how I imagined Facebook would do a blogging system. Of course I didn’t
have their source code, so I built it from scratch.
</p>
<p>
Because 1999 used Twitter for identity, I couldn’t use it. I also
couldn’t use Radio, because it ran on Windows and a now-obsolete version
of the Mac OS. It’s made me think that maybe in a few years or even
months you might not be able to use
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> or
<a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>. Then I thought about how I
can better future-safe them for users. And that led me to adding a
simple feature to FeedLand that will help if a FeedLand server you
depend on should go off the air. See the next post, below.

<h2 id="protecting-your-feedland-subscription-lists">Protecting your
FeedLand subscription lists</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-02, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First and foremost, you should keep a current backup copy of your
subscription list. It’s very easy to do.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>, choose <i>My feed
list</i> in the first menu.
</li>
<li>
Click on the white-on-orange XML icon, in the upper right corner of the
page.
</li>
<li>
That will open a standard OPML version of your subscription list. This
is the format that all feed reading software understands.
</li>
<li>
In your browser, choose the <i>Save Page As</i> command in the File menu
(or something like that, there are lots of browsers) and save it along
with your other backups.
</li>
<li>
You can also automate it if you can run a script that gets stuff over
the internet. Once a night would be fine, not a huge burden on the
server.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I added another way to preserve your feed list, using localStorage.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Every time you sign in FeedLand now saves a copy of your subscription
list in localStorage.
</li>
<li>
And if the FeedLand server you’re using should happen to disappear, if
you have not taken a backup in a while, if you have a tab open, you’ll
at least have a copy in localStorage.
</li>
<li>
If you want to see it – visit feedland.org or feedland.com, wherever you
have an account, and do a hard reload. Then open the JavaScript console,
and enter this line:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<code>console.log (localStorage.savedUserSubs)</code>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
If you have questions, here’s a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/240">thread</a>.

2024-04-22 Gopher, again
</h1>
<p>
Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to
be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept
thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> using a version
of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a
library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully
grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>,
the Gemini server I’m using, based on renderer code I found in the
<a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a>
that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Oddµ, I
figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable
Gopher pages.
</p>
<p>
It took some wrangling and it’s probably not great, but the main menu
matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site
is back as a gopher hole on port 70!
</p>
<p>
See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown
Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.

See my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/satellite.git">patched
Satellite</a> for the Gemini server code,
<a href="2023-11-03-other-ports">discussed back in 2023</a>.

And naturally I’m immediately annoyed by the lack of UTF-8 support in
this client I’m using.

has the added benefit of freeing up the top of the Pi 5 for other HAT

<p>My father taught me how to organize my thinking when I was trying to
figure out how something works. And that’s basically what I’ve spent my
life on, figuring out how things work. The most interesting and
gratifying was understanding things that didn’t exist until I pieced
their story together.</p>

Suck.com guys, everyone who was writing at Hotwired in 1995. I’ll think
of others, but those are the ones who come to mind. I have been a
constant reader since I was a little kid, so there’s a mix of writing
styles from authors I don’t immediately remember. I should also do one
of these lists for who inspired my software.</p>

have to admit I like
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tyrese+maxey">Tyrese Maxey</a>
of the Sixers, who
<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/40061591/amazing-maxey-late-burst-helps-76ers-stay-alive-ot-win-knicks">spoiled
a Knicks victory</a> last night that would have closed out the first
round of the playoffs. It felt like the Knicks had won the game when
Maxie single-handedly pulled the Sixers back into contention. Now the
Knicks are up 3-2 with the next game in Philadelphia tomorrow night.
But! I didn’t flip out this time like I did for the last game, and I
think it was because I was able to watch it on
<a href="https://www.msgnetworks.com/">local TV</a> with the familiar
play by play guy, Mike Breen, and the best color guy for any sport,
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+clyde+frazier">Walt Clyde
Frazier</a>. If he wasn’t flipping out why should I. One of the things I
love about his
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=clydisms">narration</a> is that
he uses words incorrectly, kind of like
<a href="https://thelastdrivein.com/2015/07/02/the-archie-bunker-malapropism-dictionary-of-mangled-english/">Archie
Bunker</a>. I keep wanting to
<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means">say</a>
“I do not think it means what you think it means,” but then I realized,
last night, for the first time, it’s freaking poetry! A lot of it even
rhymes. And it’s a poem that will go on as long as the Knicks do.
Unfortunately I don’t think the MSG crew is going to be doing the
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+schedule&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=nba+schedule&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i56i59j0i131i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512l3j0i512.30465j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11vwxq3z2y;3;/m/05jvx;dt;fp;1;;;">next
game</a>. And btw, they do a much better job of camera work than ESPN.
Maybe it’s because the TV people have been able to iterate the camera
setup the same way I iterate the UI of a piece of software. The same
company owns the TV network as owns the arena as owns the team. It’s all
totally horizontally integrated. At dinner the other night a friend
asked, if the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan">owner</a> of the
Knicks wasn’t a putz. I said of course, he’s the worst but, the Knicks
now are being well managed. So maybe he’s mellowed out a bit?</p>

<p>Last week I attended the 50<sup>th</sup>
<a href="https://amw.org/">Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop</a>. For a
crew of volunteers to keep a small, invitation-only, off-the-record
workshop going for half a century is an amazing achievement. A lot of
the credit goes to the late
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/11/john-wharton-rip.html">John H.
Wharton</a>, who chaired it from 1985 to 2017 with one missing year. He
was responsible for the current format, and the eclecticism of the
program’s topics.<br /> <br /> Brian Berg has written a short history of
the workshop for the IEEE entitled
<a href="https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/events/asilomar-microcomputer-workshop"><i>The
Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop: Its Origin Story, and Beyond</i></a>.
It was started by “Three Freds and a Ted” and one of the Freds, Fred
Coury has also written about it in
<a href="https://amw.org/a-short-history-of-amw-by-fred-coury/">here</a>.Six
years ago David Laws wrote
<a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/the-asilomar-microcomputer-workshop-and-the-billion-dollar-toilet-seat/"><i>The
Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop and the Billion Dollar Toilet
Seat</i></a> for the Computer History Museum.<br /> <br /> I have
attended almost all of them since 1987. I have been part of the
volunteer crew for many, including this one, and have served on the
board of the 501C3 behind the workshop for some years.<br /> <br /> This
year’s

off-the-record unless the speaker publishes it elsewhere, so I can’t
discuss the content of the talks.<br /> <br /></p>

<p>date: 2024-04-30, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>Note: This post is the summary of a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/30/weNeedMoreChange.m4a">podcast</a>.
</i>
</p>
<p>
When my mother died in 2018, it didn’t settle in that the context in
which I lived, my whole life, was gone.
</p>
<p>
She lived in the house I was raised in. Very little had changed in that
house. I hadn’t lived there since I went away to college, but it still
defined who I was, an adult who didn’t live in his childhood home. When
we sold the house, the last time I saw it, it was empty, and that was
when it hit me. That part of my life is over. I no longer have a home I
can return to.
</p>
<p>
The same is true with our understanding of who we are as adult American
citizens. Until now we felt we had a vote. But that is over, unless we
change our view of the country we live in. It’s not that it’s about to
change, which is what you hear in the news, and on social web – <i>it
has already changed. </i>
</p>
<p>
We now understand that Trump may be above the law but that masks a
bigger truth, the Supreme Court is already above the law. They take
bribes, openly. They cannot be prosecuted (just try it and see what
happens). They openly side with the insurrection, yet don’t recuse when
deciding issues of what to do with the insurrectionists. They imagine
the president is a monarch.
</p>
<p>
We’re already living in the authoritarian state we’re worried about. We
haven’t caught up with that reality yet.
</p>
<p>
Our government is more concerned about our right to own guns than it is
with our right to own our own bodies. Stop for a moment and let that
sink in. If I said you don’t own your own body, what would you think I’m
talking about? Answer: Slavery.
</p>
<p>
If we did catch up with that reality, we would start organizing now to
undo that mistake. We would not only re-elect Biden in a landslide, but
we’d insist that he expand the court to 100 members serving 10-year
terms each, retroactive. And thus we would eliminate one of the huge
problems in our system of government. Have they proved they need this
kind of correction? Yes, the overturning of Roe, and the lack of
prosecution of Trump for trying to overthrow the government are all the
proof we need.
</p>
<p>
And from then-on, no politician in any branch of government would take
us for granted.
</p>

has agreed to more funds for Ukraine, claiming it will expand the debt
even further. Can we just have some sanity here?</p>

don’t take the bait to make it about anything other than what happens on
the court, and to trust in the league to take care of players who don’t
play by the rules. And <i>of course</i> the Philadelphia arena was full
of Knicks fans. The tickets cost a lot less than NYC tickets, and it’s
only 2 hours away by car, and there’s good train service. If the series
goes back to Philadelphia, the same thing will happen. I feel sorry for

<h2 id="whale-song-code">Whale Song Code</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, updated: 2024-04-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
During the Cold War, the US Navy tried to make a
<a href="https://www.twz.com/8778/the-u-s-navy-tried-to-turn-whale-songs-into-secret-code">secret
code</a> out of whale song.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The basic plan was to develop coded messages from recordings of whales,
dolphins, sea lions, and seals. The submarine would broadcast the noises
and a computer—the Combo Signal Recognizer (CSR)—would detect the
specific patterns and decode them on the other end. In theory, this idea
was relatively simple. As work progressed, the Navy found a number of
complicated problems to overcome, the bulk of which centered on the
authenticity of the code itself.
</p>
<p>
The message structure couldn’t just substitute the moaning of a whale or
a crying seal for As and Bs or even whole words. In addition, the sounds
Navy technicians recorded between 1959 and 1965 all had natural
background noise. With the technology available, it would have been hard
to scrub that out. Repeated blasts of the same sounds with identical
extra noise would stand out to even untrained sonar operators…

<h2 id="thoughts-on-cosmotechnics">Thoughts on Cosmotechnics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
A fine post by Ethan Marcotte called
<a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-negotiation-cycle/"><em>The
negotiation cycle</em></a> led me to an incredible essay by Alan Jacobs
called
<a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/from-tech-critique-to-ways-of-living"><em>From
Tech Critique to Ways of Living</em></a>. It references an old idea
called “The
SCT<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>”
which is new to me but based on thinking by the likes of Ursula Franklin
and Neil Postman who I am familiar with. Neil Postman’s
<em>Technopoly</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
–which I read in March– was one of the best books on technology I’ve
ever read, so this is relevant for me.
</p>
<p>
Jacobs’ essay takes an unexpected yet welcome turn towards Daoism
linking to a heavier essay by Yuk Hui called
<a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/86/161887/cosmotechnics-as-cosmopolitics/"><em>Cosmotechnics
and Cosmopolitics</em></a>. I’m not smart enough to fully understand all
these philosophical (epistemological?)
arguments<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>,
but reading the word “cosmotechnics” felt like a beacon in the night for
a concept I’ve intuitively felt but never had a word to describe. In
Hui’s words:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Let me give you a preliminary definition of cosmotechnics: it is the
unification of the cosmos and the moral through technical activities,
whether craft-making or art-making.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I believe that science and technology are moral. Try as we may to
divorce a tool from an outcome, there is always an interplay. As a
contrived example, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component
and it would by itself be morally neutral. But if I make a
<code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that someone with a disability cannot use,
then I have made a moral decision through either action or inaction.
Similarly, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that puts a stuffed
animal in a digital shopping cart, that is morally neutral. But if that
stuffed animal is knowingly assembled with child labor and dropshipped
from afar with an immense carbon cost relative to the value of the item,
I have made an immoral <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code>. It’s not hard for
me to imagine that someone somewhere is making a
<code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component that launches a nuclear missile…
</p>
<p>
In the words of Dr. King from his sermon
<em><a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/06/the-three-evils-of-society/">The
Three Evils of Society</a></em>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“When scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided
missiles and misguided men.”<br /> – Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But if you believe technology is moral, then the next larger follow up
question is “Whose morals?”
</p>
<hr />
<p>
This question of “Whose morals?” permeates my thoughts, specifically in
regards to global challenges like climate change. Call me unpatriotic,
but I don’t think rugged American individualism is going to manifest
destiny our way out of the climate crisis. A technological breakthrough
seems unlikely. We need to rely on the knowledge and experiences of
African, Asian, and Indigenous societies who have a different ontology,
a different Dao (a code of behavior that is in harmony with the natural
order); one that prioritizes the group over the individual. In less
metaphysical terms, I believe we need to listen to societies built on
cooperation and sharing of limited resources over societies built on the
continuous expansion of dominion through exploitation of markets, labor,
and people.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We need a new language of cosmopolitics to elaborate this new world
order that goes beyond a single
hegemon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I agree with Hui that a singular perspective cannot and will not solve
the current crisis we are facing. Technology alone will not save us. We
need scientific power in the hands of moral-powered men and women. And
the longer we wait the more we risk erasing the communities and ancient
knowledge we need to find an equitable solution.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Climate change, geopolitical conflict, the rise of authoritarianism
brought about by social media companies… these are all large problems
that take governments decades to solve. That puts cosmotechnics far away
from me, a would-be practitioner. Hui thankfully provides a story from
the
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">Zhuangzi</a></em>;
the butcher Pao Ding.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pao Ding is excellent at butchering cows. He claims that the key to
being a good butcher doesn’t lie in mastering certain skills, but rather
in comprehending the Dao. Replying to a question from Duke Wen Huei
about the Dao of butchering cows, Pao Ding points out that having a good
knife is not necessarily enough; it is more important to understand the
Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the
bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter
into the gaps between them.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is the kind of web development I like. It agrees with me. I better
understand the <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao of web
design</a>. Our apps and websites are like water, flowing in and out of
viewports. Contextualizing themselves to the recipient’s limitations or
preferences. Those who find the easier paths through the gaps become
excellent butchers of websites.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pao Ding adds that a good butcher has to change his knife once a year
because he cuts through tendons, while a bad butcher has to change his
knife every month because he cuts through bones. Pao Ding, on the other
hand—an <em>excellent</em> butcher—has not changed his knife in nineteen
years, and it looks as if it has just been sharpened with a whetstone.
Whenever Pao Ding encounters any difficulty, he slows down the knife and
gropes for the right place to move further.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another translation I read phrased the bad butcher as “hacking” through
bones and what a serviceable metaphor we’ve found! The knife, a
technology. The medium, a cow or software. Our tools will last longer if
we learn how to slow down and understand the nature of the medium,
<a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">the
grain</a>, rather than hacking against it.
</p>
<p>
The hustle and bustle of capitalism and keeping up with the zeitgeist
makes this hard. There’s a pressure to keep up, lest you fall off the
cliff of irrelevance. After all, technology always only advances and
there’s always a better knife in the distance… right?
</p>
<p>
Over the years I’ve heard myself referred to as a “curmudgeon”, “old
guard”, “gatekeeper”, and “dinosaur”. That is due in part to my
loudmouthed punditry but also because I dislike a specific technology
from an
<a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">immoral
company</a> that does our industry, society, and users irreparable harm.
Moving fast and rethinking best practices spawned untold lifetimes worth
of human hours dedicated to knife swapping each year. And when tools
dull, we throw stones at each other.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always been overly cautious and considered in the tools I use but
I’ve never thought of the tools I use as a moral choice. Perhaps now I
will. I’m not a Daoist by any means, but this idea of
<em>cosmotechnics</em> begins to provide a mental framework for
expressing the relationship between technology and morality. From the
large scale of the cosmos to the small scale of the knife, I’m glad to
have vocabulary to think about future problems.

One nuanced point I disagree with Hui on is on who should hold the
leading power in this new cosmopolitical system. I fully agree we need
to grow out of our single hegemony (America), but I’ve heard this
“multipolar world’ philosophy echoed by Vladimir Putin before and I
don’t believe we should cede moral authority over to authoritarian
regimes that slaughter and demonize LGBTQ+ groups and ethnic minorities.
We shouldn’t use new technology to reinstate old Cold War era
superpowers of oppression. We need something entirely new. That said, I
sit in a comfortable seat of privilege and systemic power well within
the borders of the American Empire…
