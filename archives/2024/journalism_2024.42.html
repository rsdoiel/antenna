treatment practices are unsafe for patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-18, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>A family medicine physician at Los Angeles County Correctional Health
Services found himself in a difficult position last November. Dr. Yang,
who asked to be referred to only by his last name out of concerns about
retaliation, was troubled by a new CHS policy increasing the use of
opiate medications, namely Suboxone, as a treatment for opioid use
disorder.  The new CHS policy requires that all inmates entering the
reception area be screened for opioid use disorder and, if they meet the
criteria for it, immediately be prescribed Suboxone.</p>
