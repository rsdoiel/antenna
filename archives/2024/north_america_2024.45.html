recap, Nov. 3-9</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Editor’s note: Here is a look at immigration-related
news around the U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA
immigration team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com.</p>
<p>What to expect on immigration under a new Trump administration</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump put immigration at the front of his
campaign agenda, pledging to bring what he calls “unprecedented order”
to the southern border and launch the nation’s largest mass deportation
operation of undocumented immigrants on his first day in office. VOA
immigration reporter Aline Barros has more.</p>
<p>US judge rules against Biden legalization program for immigrant
spouses</p>
<p>A U.S. judge in Texas ruled Thursday against President Joe Biden’s
program offering a path to citizenship for certain immigrant spouses of
U.S. citizens, a blow that could keep the program blocked through
Biden’s final months in office. U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker
found the program exceeded Biden’s executive authority. The program
offers a path to citizenship to about 500,000 immigrants who entered the
U.S. illegally if they are married to U.S. citizens. Reuters
reports.</p>
<p>After election, Kenya-born legislator heads to Minnesota Capitol</p>
<p>Huldah Momanyi Hiltsley made history November 5 by becoming the first
Kenya-born immigrant elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives.
She describes her victory as a testament to resilience, determination
and the realization of the American dream. Standing in the State Capitol
for the first time on the morning of her orientation, Hiltsley told VOA
she was overwhelmed with emotions and eager to start her journey as an
elected official. Produced by Abdushakur Aboud.</p>
<p>Families separated by US-Mexico border reunite for a few precious
minutes</p>
<p>Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a stretch of the
U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with loved ones they
had not seen for years because they live in different countries. Tears
flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to reunite
for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to the U.S.
Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with their loved
ones. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>Immigration around the world</p>
<p>Migrant caravan of 3,000 heads north in Mexico</p>
<p>A caravan of approximately 3,000 migrants set off Tuesday from
southern Mexico, headed toward the United States on the day when U.S.
voters were deciding between U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris
and Donald Trump. Immigration has been a key issue in the U.S. election
campaign. Before heading northward, the migrants gathered in Tapachula,
the capital of the southern Chiapas state, carrying banners with
messages such as “NO MORE MIGRANT BLOOD” and images of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, an important religious and cultural symbol in Mexico,
according to witnesses. Reuters reports.</p>
<p>Ukrainian physicians find homes – and jobs – in Latvia</p>
<p>More than 160,000 Ukrainians fled their home country and headed to
the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania since the Russian
invasion. Physicians were among the 50,000 or so refugees who went to
Latvia. Vladislavs Andrejevs spoke with some of them in Riga. Anna Rice
narrates his story.</p>
<p>Israel notifies UN it will not cooperate with UN agency for
Palestinian refugees</p>
<p>Near-universal concern and condemnation have followed Israel’s formal
announcement to the United Nations that it will not cooperate with the
U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, after Israel’s parliament voted to
cut ties last week. In Washington, at the U.N. and on the ground,
officials and residents are raising alarms over the disintegrating
humanitarian situation in Gaza and elsewhere. VOA White House
correspondent Anita Powell reports from Washington.</p>
<p>News brief</p>
<p>— Former U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer Leonard Darnell
George, 42, of San Diego was sentenced in federal court Oct. 25 to 23
years in prison for accepting bribes to allow unauthorized migrants and
vehicles containing methamphetamine and other illicit drugs to pass
through the border into the U.S.</p>

schoolhouse for Black US children holds complicated history of slavery,
resilience</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia — A Virginia museum has nearly finished
restoring the nation’s oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children,
where hundreds of mostly enslaved students learned to read through a
curriculum that justified slavery. </p>
<p>The museum, Colonial Williamsburg, also has identified more than 80
children who lined its pinewood benches in the 1760s. </p>
<p>They include Aberdeen, 5, who was enslaved by a saddle and harness
maker. Bristol and George, 7 and 8, were owned by a doctor. Phoebe, 3,
was the property of local tavern keepers. </p>
<p>Another student, Isaac Bee, later emancipated himself. In newspaper
ads seeking his capture, his enslaver warned that Bee “can read.” </p>
<p>The museum dedicated the Williamsburg Bray School at a large ceremony
on Friday, with plans to open it for public tours this spring. Colonial
Williamsburg tells the story of Virginia’s colonial capital through
interpreters and hundreds of restored buildings. </p>
<p>‘An amazing mirror’</p>
<p>Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch told the crowd outside
the refurbished school that it was one of the most important historic
moments of the last decade. </p>
<p>“History is an amazing mirror,” Bunch added. “It’s a mirror that
challenges us and reminds us that, despite what we’ve achieved, despite
all our ideals, America still is a work in progress. But, oh, what an
amazing work it is.” </p>
<p>The Cape Cod-style home was built in 1760 and still contains much of
its original wood and brick. It will anchor a complicated story about
race and education, but also resistance, before the American
Revolution. </p>
<p>The school rationalized slavery within a religious framework and
encouraged children to accept their fates as God’s plan. And yet,
becoming literate also gave them more agency. The students went on to
share what they learned with family members and others who were
enslaved. </p>
<p>“We don’t shy away from the fact that this was a pro-slavery school,”
said Maureen Elgersman Lee, director of William &amp; Mary’s Bray School
Lab, a partnership between the university and museum. </p>
<p>But she said the school takes on a different meaning in the 21st
century. </p>
<p>“It’s a story of resilience and resistance,” Lee said. “And I put the
resilience of the Bray School on a continuum that brings us to
today.” </p>
<p>To underscore the point, the lab has been seeking descendants of the
students, with some success. </p>
<p>They include Janice Canaday, 67, who also is the museum’s African
American community engagement manager. Her lineage traces back to the
students Elisha and Mary Jones. </p>
<p>“It grounds you,” said Canaday, who grew up feeling little connection
to history. “That’s where your power is. And those are the things that
give you strength — to know what your family has come through.” </p>
<p>Franklin’s idea</p>
<p>The Bray School was established in Williamsburg and other colonial
cities at the recommendation of founding father Benjamin Franklin. He
was a member of a London-based Anglican charity that was named after
Thomas Bray, an English clergyman and philanthropist. </p>
<p>The Bray School was exceptional for its time. White leaders across
much of Colonial America forbade educating enslaved people, fearing
literacy would encourage them to seek freedom. </p>
<p>The white teacher at the Williamsburg school, a widow named Ann
Wager, taught an estimated 300 to 400 students, whose ages ranged from 3
to 10. The school closed with her death in 1774. </p>
<p>The schoolhouse became a private home before it was incorporated into
William &amp; Mary’s growing campus. The building was moved and expanded
for various purposes, including student housing. </p>
<p>Historians identified the structure in 2020 through a scientific
method that examines tree rings in lumber. Last year, it was transported
to Colonial Williamsburg, which includes parts of the original
city. </p>
<p>The museum and university have focused on restoring the schoolhouse,
researching its curriculum and finding descendants of former
students. </p>
<p>The lab has been able to link some people to the Jones and Ashby
families, two free Black households that had students in the school,
said Elizabeth Drembus, the lab’s genealogist. </p>
<p>But the effort has faced steep challenges: Most enslaved people were
stripped of their identities and separated from their families, so there
are limited records. And only three years of school rosters have
survived. </p>
<p>They ‘weren’t considered people’</p>
<p>Drembus is talking to people in the region about their family
histories and working backward. She also is sifting through 18th-century
property records, tax documents and enslavers’ diaries. </p>
<p>“When you’re talking about researching formerly enslaved people,
records were kept very differently because they weren’t considered
people,” Drembus said. </p>
<p>Researching the curriculum has been easier. The English charity
cataloged the books it sent to the schools, said Katie McKinney, an
associate curator of maps and prints at the museum. </p>
<p>Materials include a small spelling primer, a copy of which was
located in Germany, that begins with the alphabet and moves on to
syllables, such as “Beg leg meg peg.” </p>
<p>Students also received a more sophisticated speller, bound in
sheepskin, as well as the Book of Common Prayer and other Christian
texts. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the schoolhouse has been mostly restored. About 75% of the
original floor has survived, allowing visitors to walk where the
children and teacher placed their feet. </p>
<p>Canaday, whose familial roots include two Bray School students,
wondered on a recent visit if any of the children “felt safe in here,
whether they felt loved.” </p>
<p>Canaday noted that the teacher, Wager, was the mother of at least two
kids. </p>
<p>“Did some of her mothering bleed over into what she showed those
children?” Canaday said. “There are moments when we forget to go by the
rules and humanity takes over. I wonder how many times that happened in
these spaces.”</p>

id="with-holidays-approaching-us-stores-stock-more-supersize-tv-sets">With
holidays approaching, US stores stock more supersize TV sets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — For some television viewers, size apparently does
matter.</p>
<p>Forget the 165-centimeter TVs that were considered bigger than
average a decade ago. In time for the holidays, manufacturers and
retailers are rolling out more XXL screens measuring more than 2.4
meters diagonally. That’s wider than a standard three-seat sofa or a
king-size bed.</p>
<p>Supersize televisions only accounted for 1.7% of revenue from all TV
set sales in the U.S. during the first nine months of the year,
according to market research firm Circana. But companies preparing for
shoppers to go big for Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa have reason to
think the growing ultra category will be a bright spot in an otherwise
tepid television market, according to analysts.</p>
<p>The 38,100 televisions of at least 246 centimeters sold between
January and September represented a tenfold increase from the same
period last year, Circana said. Best Buy, the nation’s largest consumer
electronics chain, doubled the assortment of hefty TVs — the 19 models
range in price from $2,000 to $25,000 — and introduced displays in
roughly 70% of its stores.</p>
<p>“It’s really taken off this year,” Blake Hampton, Best Buy’s senior
vice president of merchandising, said.</p>
<p>Analysts credit the emerging demand to improved technology and much
lower prices. So far this year, the average price for TVs spanning at
least 246 centimeters was $3,113 compared to $6,662 last year, according
to Circana. South Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung introduced its
first 249-centimeter TV in 2019 with a hefty price tag of $99,000; it
now has four versions starting at $4,000, the company said.</p>
<p>Anthony Ash, a 42-year-old owner of a wood pallet and recycling
business, recently bought a 949-centimeter Sony for his
1,300-square-meter house in Bristol, Wisconsin. The device, which cost
about $5,000 excluding installation fees, replaced an 216-centimeter TV
in the great room off his kitchen. Ash now has 17 televisions at home
and uses some to display digital art.</p>
<p>“We just saw that the price was affordable for what we were looking
for and thought, ‘Why not?’” he said of deciding to upsize to the Sony.
“You get a better TV experience with a bigger TV. You’re sitting
watching TV with a person on TV that is the same size as you. You can
put yourself in the scene.”</p>
<p>The amount of time that many people spend staring at their cellphones
and tablets, including to stream movies and TV shows, is another factor
driving the growth of widescreen TV screens. Overall TV sales revenue
fell 4%, while the number of units sold rose 1% from the January through
September period, Circana said.</p>
<p>Most people only invest in a television every seven years, but when
they do, they typically choose bigger ones, according to Rick Kowalski,
the senior director of business intelligence at the Consumer Technology
Association. In the past 15 years, the size of flat-panel TVs that were
shipped to U.S. retailers and dealers grew an average of one inch a
year, Kowalski said.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the elongation trend as people
spent more time at home. In fact, screen sizes increased an average of 5
centimeters in both 2021 and 2022, and 216-centimeter TVs began gaining
traction with consumers, Kowalski said. Shipments of 249-centimeter TVs
to the U.S. are picking up pace this year, and models as huge as 279-292
centimeters are on the market right now, he said.</p>
<p>“You get better resolution over time,” Kowalski said. “You get better
picture quality. And so just over time, it’s easier to produce those
sets and improve the technology.”</p>
<p>Best Buy’s Hampton said a benefit of a colossal TV is the viewer can
watch multiple shows at once, an experience he described as
“incredible.”</p>
<p>“If you’re watching YouTube TV content or ’ NFL Sunday Ticket,’ you
can actually get four screens up, and that’s four 48-inch
(122-centimeter) screens on it,” he said.</p>
<p>Manufacturers are also adding new features. Samsung said it designed
its 249-centimeter lineup with a component that analyzes what the viewer
is watching to increase sharpness and reduce visible noise across every
scene.</p>
<p>James Fishler, senior vice president of the home entertainment
division of Samsung’s U.S. division, said the way people watch TV and
experience content is shifting.</p>
<p>“It’s even more so about watching TV as a shared experience,” Fishler
said. “They want to host a watch party and gather around their TV to
watch the big game, or set up a cinematic movie experience right at
home.”</p>
<p>Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, its Sam’s Club division, and
Chicago retailer Abt Electronics, also say they are expanding their TV
ranges to meet customer demand for supersize screens.</p>
<p>TV industry experts say these monster TVs are beginning to encroach
on home theater projectors, which create a 254- to 305-centimeter image
that is less sharp and require rooms with blackout curtains or without
windows.</p>
<p>“A dedicated viewing room for watching movies was exclusively the
purview of projectors,” Andrew Sivori, vice president in the
entertainment division of LG Electronics, another Korean manufacturer.
“But you can get a much better viewing experience with direct TV.”</p>
<p>Retailers and TV makers said the buyers trading up range from
millennials and members of Generation X to the tech-native Gen Z crowd.
But as Jon Abt, co-president of Abt Electronics said, “It’s still a
niche business.”</p>
<p>“A lot of people just don’t have the space to put one of those in,”
he added.</p>
<p>Before dreaming big for the holidays, shoppers therefore should make
sure a 249-centimeter TV will fit. Best Buy said its Geek Squad team
asks if stairwells and entry halls are large enough to accommodate
delivery and installation. An augmented reality feature on the Best Buy
app that allows customers to see if products are the right size has been
especially helpful for XXL TVs, the retailer said.</p>
<p>But for those worried about having the space for viewing, the good
news is that the recommended distance for a 249-centimeter TV is
actually just 1.8-3.6 meters feet from the seating area. The rule of
thumb is to multiple the diagonal length of the TV by 1.2 to determine
the ideal viewing distance, Samsung’s Fishler said.</p>
<p>If bigger is better in the TV department, how big can they go?</p>
<p>“I think we’ll have to wait and see,” Fishler said.</p>
<p><br></p>

id="a-texas-border-county-backed-democrats-for-generations-trump-won-it-decisively">A
Texas border county backed Democrats for generations; Trump won it
decisively</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas — Jorge Bazán’s family has lived on the
U.S.-Mexico border for generations and voted for Democrats as long as he
can remember.</p>
<p>He broke the family tradition this year and voted for Donald Trump
because he doesn’t trust the Democratic Party’s economic policies.</p>
<p>“I think they forgot about the middle class,” said Bazán, who works
for the utility company in Rio Grande City, seat of the most Hispanic
county in the nation. “People are suffering right now. Everything’s very
expensive.”</p>
<p>The South Texas region — stretching from San Antonio to the Rio
Grande Valley — has long been a Democratic stronghold. A slide toward
Trump in 2020 rattled Democrats in the predominately Hispanic area,
where for decades Republicans seldom bothered to field candidates in
local races. However, few Democrats expected the dramatic realignment
that happened Tuesday, when Trump flipped several counties along the
border including Hidalgo and Cameron, the two most populous counties in
the Rio Grande Valley.</p>
<p>In Starr County, where Bazán lives, voters backed a Republican
presidential candidate for the first time in a century. The
predominantly Hispanic and working-class rural county, with a median
household income of $36,000 that’s one of the lowest in the nation, gave
Trump a 16 percentage-point victory margin over Vice President Kamala
Harris. Roughly 2 million residents live at Texas’ southernmost point,
among vast tracts of farmland and many state and federal agents
patrolling the border.</p>
<p>Trump’s victories in the Rio Grande Valley starkly showed how
working-class voters nationwide are shifting toward Republicans. That
includes voters on the Texas border, where many Democrats long argued
that Trump’s promised crackdowns on immigration would turn off
voters.</p>
<p>“I was always a lifelong Democrat, but I decided to change to
Republican with the political landscape that it is now,” said Luis Meza,
a 32-year-old Starr County voter. “I felt that going Republican was the
better choice, especially with the issues of immigration and everything
like that that’s going on.”</p>
<p>Meza said that he was against Trump at first but noticed too few
changes under President Joe Biden to justify voting for Harris.</p>
<p>Biden won Hidalgo County by less than half the margin that Hillary
Clinton did in 2016. Since then, Republicans have invested millions of
dollars to persuade Hispanic and working-class voters soured by
Democratic policies.</p>
<p>A similar scenario played out in the state’s three most competitive
races in nearby counties. Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz claimed a
decisive victory in the 15th Congressional District. In the two other
races, seasoned Democratic incumbents barely held on to their seats.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar narrowly escaped defeat against a
political newcomer in the most competitive race of his two-decade
career. Cuellar, whose district includes Rio Grande City, was indicted
this year on bribery and other charges for allegedly accepting $600,000
from companies in Mexico and Azerbaijan. His support for abortion
restrictions makes him one of the most conservative Democrats in the
House.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez also narrowly escaped defeat by an
opponent he comfortably beat two years ago.</p>
<p>Nationally, Black and Latino voters appeared slightly less likely to
support Harris than they were to back Biden four years ago, according to
AP VoteCast data. More than half of Hispanic voters supported Harris,
but that was down slightly from the roughly 6 in 10 who backed Biden in
2020. Trump’s support among those groups appeared to rise slightly
compared to 2020.</p>
<p>In McAllen, Texas, Jose Luis Borrego said that inflation and the
promise of tougher border restrictions made him vote for a Republican
presidential candidate for the first time.</p>
<p>“I wanted to see change and that’s why I did vote for Trump. I did
vote red. I would not call myself a Republican” Borrego, 37, said. He
said that he voted for Hillary Clinton and Independent Sen. Bernie
Sanders in prior elections.</p>
<p>Borrego’s whole family voted Trump.</p>
<p>“We just (made) this choice, because we didn’t have another choice
that we felt comfortable with,” he said.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said he had months of visits to the region
during his campaign race against Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred. In a
victory speech on Election Day, Cruz said Hispanic voters are leaving
the Democratic Party because of immigration.</p>
<p>“They are coming home to conservative values they never left. They
understand something the liberal elites never will: There’s nothing
progressive about open borders,” Cruz said. “There is nothing Latino
about letting criminals roam free.”</p>
<p>Michael Mireles, the director of civil engagement for labor rights
group La Unión del Pueblo Entero, believes that Democrats did not engage
Hispanic voters enough about the issues that concern them.</p>
<p>“I think that folks on the Democratic side have been really slow to
have those conversations with Latino households and families.” Mireles
said in Hidalgo County after Election Day.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait for a big election to have those conversations. By
that point, it’s too late.”</p>

id="floridas-iconic-key-deer-face-uncertain-future-as-seas-rise">Florida’s
iconic Key deer face uncertain future as seas rise</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BIG PINE KEY, Florida — The world’s only Key deer, the smallest
subspecies of the white-tailed deer, are found in piney and marshy
wetlands bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico on the
Florida Keys. For years, their biggest threat was being struck by
vehicles speeding along U.S. Highway 1 or local roads.</p>
<p>But those waters surrounding the islands now pose the biggest
long-term risk for this herd of about 800 deer as sea rise jeopardizes
their sole habitat.</p>
<p>These charismatic diminutive deer have been listed as endangered for
almost 60 years after their numbers dipped to about 50 from hunting and
poaching long ago. Yet they’ve made a tremendous comeback, with a peak
population of about 1,000 in the mid-2010s before a deadly parasite and
Hurricane Irma took a heavy toll.</p>
<p>However, experts and wildlife advocates say this conservation success
story today is at risk of being undone by climate change. Sea level rise
is already altering the landscape of Big Pine Key and at least 20
smaller islands the deer call home.</p>
<p>The bulk of the deer live on Big Pine Key, a marshy island 48
kilometers from Key West. They roam neighborhoods where about 4,500
people live, browsing on lush gardens and drinking water from buckets
residents put out for them as natural freshwater supplies dwindle.</p>
<p>Key deer are far smaller than their North American counterparts, with
the biggest bucks standing less than 1 meter tall at the shoulder and
weighing around 34 kilograms.</p>
<p>“They were always vulnerable,” said Chris Bergh, the South Florida
program manager for the Nature Conservancy, who oversees sea level rise
projects and lives in Big Pine Key. “They’re much more vulnerable now.
And with the sea level rising and their habitat shrinking, they’re
becoming even more so.”</p>
<p>Highway deer deaths</p>
<p>On Big Pine Key, mom and pop bars and restaurants dot either side of
bustling U.S. 1, along with gas stations and small motels. The main
industry revolves around the water — charter boats, fishing, diving,
vacation rentals.</p>
<p>To protect the deer from being hit by vehicles, signs tell motorists
they’re entering deer habitat. A 3.2-kilometer stretch of U.S. 1 is
elevated and fenced, allowing deer to cross under the road. And speed
limits are strictly enforced, often frustrating tourists driving to Key
West.</p>
<p>Deer still are struck at an alarming rate. “The bottom line is that
some 90 to 120 deer are known to be killed by vehicles each year,” said
Jan Svejkovsky, chief scientist for Save Our Key Deer.</p>
<p>Wildlife officials have worked hard get out the message: Don’t feed
Key deer. They fear deer will approach cars and go near roadways for
handouts.</p>
<p>Even with the traffic deaths, the population has remained stable. But
a larger threat looms.</p>
<p>Climate change impacts on deer</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that by
2100, seas will rise 0.5 to 2 meters in parts of the Florida Keys. The
threat is greatest to low lying islands like Big Pine Key, where the
highest point is only about 2.4 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>Sea rise will continue to shrink freshwater and food sources Key deer
need to survive, experts say.</p>
<p>“So as the sea rises, that shrinks the amount of available
freshwater, the amount of available, palatable vegetation, the places
for bearing their young,” said Bergh of the Nature Conservancy. “It puts
them increasingly in conflict with people who are also occupying those
higher grounds.”</p>
<p>In addition to sea rise, climate change brings the threat of stronger
hurricanes, with storm surges that can damage deer habitat and
freshwater supplies.</p>
<p>Salt water intrusion also is responsible for killing many of the
Florida slash pines that gave Big Pine Key its name. Mangroves are
growing in their place in an ever-changing environment, choking deer
habitat even more.</p>
<p>Shrinking habitat drives deer to neighborhoods</p>
<p>Key deer on Big Pine Key move through neighborhoods, munching on
gardens. Some people even have names for ones that frequent their
yards.</p>
<p>“They are very gentle, very, very gentle,” said Connie Ritchie, who
sometimes sees about 30 deer a day. “And the longer you live here, the
more you want to protect them. Big time. Protect them because they’re so
innocent.”</p>
<p>“They have certain plants that they really love,” Ritchie said,
noting that the federal deer refuge here hosts events where it gives
away native plants. “So they’re trying to teach us to plant the plants
that the deer won’t eat.”</p>
<p>Development on Big Pine Key began in the 1970s and 1980s “when entire
swaths of land on islands that still held deer were developed into
planned subdivisions, complete with saltwater canal networks to provide
lot-buyers with direct water access,” said Svejkovsky of Save Our Key
Deer.</p>
<p>While the key remains mostly rural with modest Florida bungalows and
more palatial places, development has taken away some deer habitat.</p>
<p>“We have lots of people and the wildlife living in the same really
concentrated area,” said Katy Hosokawa, a park ranger at the National
Key Deer Refuge, established in 1957 on 3,457 hectares of Big Pine Key.
“So the more houses that we build, or the less lands that we have
protected, the less areas that they have that are safe.”</p>
<p>The deer have adapted to the humans and move freely between wild
spaces and the neighborhoods. “They roam, they spend their day grazing,”
Hosokawa said. “We don’t have a really nutritionally dense soil, so they
need to eat a lot of food to get what they need. But trust me, they’re
very good at it. If it’s soft and tender, they will try to eat it.”</p>
<p>Future of the deer</p>
<p>The future, while uncertain, looks grim.</p>
<p>Just 15 centimeters of sea rise, expected by 2030, would mean loss of
16% of the freshwater holes on Big Pine Key, said Nova Silvy, professor
emeritus with Texas A&amp;M University who has studied Key deer since
1968 and has lived here for several years.</p>
<p>By 2050, sea rise is expected to overtake about 84% of the 805
hectares of the preferred habitat on Big Pine Key — and “the deer will
already be gone,” Silvy said.</p>
<p>What happens if the deer can’t survive in the Keys?</p>
<p>Bergh said he prefers to buy more time to keep the deer viable here.
“And at some point, if that’s no longer possible, I personally think
zoos are the most responsible alternative,” he said. “But that’s a
terrible alternative. Who wants that for a wild animal?”</p>
<p>In rare instances, scientists have been allowed to relocate
endangered species threatened by climate change as a last resort. But
Silvy said, “The problem is if you take them any other place with deer,
they’re going to interbreed and then you’ve lost the Key deer.”</p>

<h2 id="why-ap-called-arizona-for-trump">Why AP called Arizona for
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Associated Press declared President-elect Donald
Trump the winner in Arizona on Saturday night after vote updates in
Maricopa and other counties added to his overall lead, putting the state
out of reach for Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>At the time the AP called the race at 9:21 p.m. ET, Trump led Harris,
52.6% to 46.4%, a margin of about 185,000 votes. Harris needed to win
about 7 out of every 10 votes of the roughly 443,000 uncounted ballots
remaining, a percentage that has steadily grown as additional votes were
counted.</p>
<p>Trump has now swept all seven of the hotly contested presidential
battlegrounds, winning 312 electoral votes, compared to 226 for Harris.
The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270.</p>
<p>In 2020, President Joe Biden carried the state narrowly over Trump,
but he won Maricopa County by a margin of 50 percentage points to 48. On
Saturday, Trump was leading Harris 52 to 47.</p>
<p>The AP only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing
candidate can’t close the gap and overtake the vote leader.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how the AP called this race:</p>
<p>Candidates: President: Harris (D) vs. Trump (R) vs. Chase Oliver
(Libertarian) vs. Jill Stein (Green).</p>
<p>Winner: Trump.</p>
<p>Poll closing time: 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. Arizona does not release votes
until all precincts have reported or one hour after all polls are
closed, whichever is first, usually 10 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>About the race: Both Harris and Trump crisscrossed this border state,
where immigration is a prominent issue, multiple times before Election
Day.</p>
<p>Trump put immigration at the center of his candidacy, promising to
deport people without legal documentation while Harris called for
pathways to citizenship as well as tighter security at the border.</p>
<p>Independent voters are the largest bloc in the state, followed by
Republicans, then Democrats, who have succeeded in winning Senate
contests and the governorship since 2018.</p>
<p>Biden became just the second Democrat to win the state in more than
70 years.</p>
<p>Both candidates made a play for vote-rich Maricopa County, which is
home to Phoenix, Mesa and Tempe. Trump carried the county by 3 points in
2016, while Biden won with a 2-point margin four years later. Arizona is
primarily an early voting state. In 2016, just over three-quarters of
the votes were cast early. In 2020, that climbed to nearly 90%.</p>
<p>Why AP called the race: In statewide elections going back a dozen
years, Democrats have always carried four counties in both winning and
losing campaigns: Apache, Coconino, Pima and Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Harris had large leads over Trump in all four counties, but she far
underperformed Biden’s showing from 2020.</p>
<p>She was trailing Trump in decisive Maricopa County, which Biden won
in 2020 and has been a must-win county for statewide Democratic
candidates in recent elections.</p>
<p>Although Harris very briefly led in the statewide vote count on
election night, Trump has consistently led since then.</p>
<p>The AP’s analysis of Arizona’s voting history and political
demographics at the county level showed there was no scenario that would
allow Harris to close the gap. The analysis also showed that even if
remaining updates showed vote swings in Harris’ favor, they would not be
enough to give her the lead.</p>

<h2 id="trump-completes-swing-state-sweep-by-taking-arizona">Trump
completes swing state sweep by taking Arizona</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Donald Trump won the state of Arizona in this week’s
U.S. presidential election, U.S. TV networks projected on Saturday,
completing the Republican’s sweep of all seven swing states.</p>
<p>After four days of counting in the southwest state with a large
Hispanic population, CNN and NBC projected Trump had obtained its 11
electoral votes as he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Outgoing President Joe Biden scored a narrow but crucial victory in
Arizona in 2020 that condemned Trump to defeat after his first term in
office.</p>
<p>The scale and strength of Trump’s comeback, which also saw the real
estate tycoon win the popular vote by a margin of around 4 million
votes, has sent shockwaves through the defeated Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The Republicans have already regained control of the Senate and look
well set to retain a majority in the House of Representatives thanks to
support from white working-class voters and a large share of
Hispanics.</p>
<p>CNN has called Republican victories for 213 seats in the House, with
218 needed for a majority in the lower chamber.</p>
<p>The networks’ figures show Democrats on 205 seats, although senior
party figures are still hoping they can pull off a slim victory that
would significantly curtail Trump’s powers.</p>
<p>NBC sees the Republicans with 212 seats so far, and 204 for the
Democrats.</p>
<p>The other six swing states won by Trump in the presidential race are
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada and
Georgia.</p>
<p>The latest good news for Trump came as the White House said Biden
would meet with the president-elect at the White House on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Trump – who never conceded his 2020 loss – sealed a remarkable
comeback to the presidency in the November 5 vote, cementing what is set
to be more than a decade of U.S. politics dominated by his hardline
right-wing stance.</p>
<p>This type of meeting between the outgoing and incoming presidents was
considered customary, but Trump did not invite Biden for one after
making unsubstantiated election fraud claims that culminated in the
January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.</p>
<p>Trump also broke with precedent by skipping Biden’s inauguration, but
the White House has said the Democratic president will attend the
upcoming ceremony.</p>
<p>Biden’s meeting with Trump will take place in the Oval Office, the
White House said Saturday, with the clock ticking down to the
ex-president’s return to power.</p>
<p>Trump, the 78-year-old ex-reality TV star, won wider margins than
before, despite a criminal conviction, two impeachments while in office
and warnings from his former chief of staff that he is a fascist.</p>
<p>Exit polls showed that voters’ top concerns remained the economy and
inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>The 81-year-old president, who dropped out of the White House race in
July over concerns about his age, health and mental acuity, called Trump
on Wednesday to congratulate him on the election win.</p>
<p>Trump 2.0</p>
<p>Democrats have been pointing fingers over who is to blame for Harris’
decisive loss after she replaced Biden at the top of the ticket roughly
100 days before the election.</p>
<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took aim at Biden, telling The New
York Times that “had the president gotten out sooner, there may have
been other candidates in the race.”</p>
<p>As the Democrats weigh what went wrong, Trump has begun to assemble
his second administration by naming campaign manager Susie Wiles to
serve as his White House chief of staff.</p>
<p>She is the first woman to be named to the high-profile role and the
Republican’s first appointment to his incoming administration.</p>
<p>Jockeying for jobs</p>
<p>Trump on Saturday ruled out re-appointing two senior figures from his
first administration, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former
U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.</p>
<p>Former Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell is seen as a
front-runner for the secretary of state position, as is Florida Senator
Marco Rubio who called Trump a “con artist” and the “most vulgar person
to ever aspire to the presidency” in 2016.</p>
<p>The other front-runners for a place in the Trump 2.0 administration
reflect the significant changes it is likely to implement.</p>
<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading figure in the anti-vaccine movement
for whom Trump has pledged a “big role” in health care, told NBC News on
Wednesday that “I’m not going to take away anybody’s vaccines.”</p>
<p>The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, could also be in line for a job
auditing government waste after the right-wing SpaceX, Tesla and X boss
enthusiastically backed Trump.</p>

<h2 id="trump-says-haley-pompeo-will-not-join-his-administration">Trump
says Haley, Pompeo will not join his administration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that former
Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and former Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo will not be asked to join his administration. </p>
<p>“I will not be inviting former Ambassador Nikki Haley, or former
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to join the Trump Administration, which
is currently in formation,” Trump posted on social media. “I very much
enjoyed and appreciated working with them previously, and would like to
thank them for their service to our country.” </p>
<p>Trump is meeting with potential candidates to serve in his
administration before his January 20 inauguration as president. Reuters
reported Friday that Trump met with prominent investor Scott Bessent,
who is a potential U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee. </p>
<p>Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations under Trump, endorsed Trump for president despite
having criticized him harshly when she ran against him in the party
primaries.  </p>
<p>Pompeo, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence
Agency under Trump, has been mentioned in some media reports as a
possible defense secretary and also had been seen a potential Republican
presidential candidate, before he announced in April 2023 he would not
run. </p>
<p>Haley and Pompeo could not immediately be reached for comment on
Saturday. </p>
<p>During his first term as president, Trump made some key personnel
announcements via social media posts. </p>
<p>Separately, Trump said the 2025 presidential inauguration will be
co-chaired by real estate investor and campaign donor Steve Witkoff and
former Senator Kelly Loeffler.</p>

<h2 id="record-13-women-will-be-governors-in-us-next-year">Record 13
women will be governors in US next year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The election of Republican Kelly Ayotte as New Hampshire’s governor
means 13 women will serve as a state’s chief executive next year,
breaking the record of 12 set after the 2022 elections.</p>
<p>Governors hold powerful sway in American politics, shaping state
policy and often using the experience and profile gained to launch
campaigns for higher offices.</p>
<p>“It matters to have women in those roles to normalize the image of
women in political leadership and even more specifically in executive
leadership, where they’re the sole leader, not just a member of a team,”
said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the Rutgers Center for
American Women and Politics.</p>
<p>Governor Gretchen Whitmer was floated as a potential Democratic
nominee for president after President Joe Biden exited the race.
Republican South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem was thought to be in the
running for President-elect Donald Trump’s vice presidential post.</p>
<p>Ayotte, a former U.S. senator, defeated the Democratic nominee Joyce
Craig, a former mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city.</p>
<p>Still, 18 states have never had a woman in the governor’s office.</p>
<p>“This is another side of political leadership where women continue to
be underrepresented,” Dittmar said. “Thirteen out of 50 is still
underrepresentation.”</p>
<p>With two women vying for governor in New Hampshire, a new record for
female governors was inevitable. The state has a long history of
electing women. As a senator, Ayotte was part of the nation’s first
all-female congressional delegation. It was also the first state to have
a female governor, state Senate president and House speaker at the same
time, and the first to have a female majority in its Senate. Ayotte will
be the state’s third woman to be governor.</p>
<p>“Being a woman isn’t really that critical to her political persona,”
Linda Fowler, professor emerita of government at Dartmouth College, said
of Ayotte.</p>
<p>Both Ayotte and Craig said their gender hasn’t come up on the
campaign trail although reproductive rights often took front and
center.</p>
<p>In her campaign, Craig attacked Ayotte’s record on abortion, and both
candidates released TV ads detailing their own miscarriages. Ayotte said
she will veto any bill further restricting abortion in New Hampshire
where it is illegal after 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p>When Ayotte is sworn in, five Republican women will serve as governor
at the same time, another new high. The other eight are Democrats.</p>
<p>New Hampshire’s was one of the few competitive gubernatorial races
among the 11 this year. More inroads or setbacks for women’s
representation could come in 2026 when 36 states will elect
governors.Most voters tend to cast their ballots based on party loyalty
and ideology rather than gender, Dittmar said. However, she noted female
candidates often face layers of scrutiny that male counterparts largely
avoid, with voters judging such things as a woman’s intelligence,
appearance and even dating history with a sharper lens.</p>
<p>The small gain for women in governor’s offices comes as Vice
President Kamala Harris failed in her effort to become the first female
president.</p>
<p>“I would not suggest to you that Kamala Harris lost a race because
she was a woman, because she was a Black and South Asian woman,” Dittmar
said. “We would also fail to tell the correct story if we didn’t
acknowledge the ways in which both gender and race shapes the campaign
overall, and also had a direct effect on how Kamala Harris was evaluated
by voters, treated by her opponents and even in the media and other
spaces.”</p>
<p>Executive roles, especially the presidency with its associations like
commander in chief, often carry masculine stereotypes that women must
work harder to overcome, Dittmar said.</p>
<p>Experts say women confront these perceptions more acutely in
executive races, such as for governor and president, than in state
legislatures, where women are making historic strides as leaders,
filling roles such as speaker and committee chairs.</p>
<p>“Sexism, racism, misogyny, it’s never the silver bullet. It’s never
why one voter acts one way or another,” said Erin Vilardi, CEO of Vote
Run Lead, a left-leaning group that supports women running for state
legislatures. “But we have so much of that built in to how we see a
leader.”</p>

in California, New Jersey make progress on wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Firefighters on two U.S. coasts were making progress Saturday on
wildfires in California and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Southern California firefighters were gaining ground on a wildfire
that destroyed more than 130 structures as gusty winds subsided Saturday
with favorable weather conditions expected through the weekend. </p>
<p>The Mountain Fire in Ventura County was held at about 83 square
kilometers and was 17% contained, Fire Operations Section Chief Clint
Swensen said. The fire broke out Wednesday and exploded in size thanks
in part to the arrival of dry, warm and gusty northeast winds, forcing
thousands of residents to flee and threatening 3,500 structures in
suburban neighborhoods, ranches and agricultural areas around the
community of Camarillo. </p>
<p>Red flag warnings indicating conditions for high fire danger expired
in most of the region Thursday. Smoky air hung over the area Saturday
thanks to light winds, the very conditions that were aiding
firefighters, said Ryan Kittell, a meteorologist with the National
Weather Service in Oxnard. </p>
<p>“It’s very favorable for the weekend,” Kittell said. “Good for
firefighting efforts but not great for air quality.” </p>
<p>Some forecasts showed winds returning to the area Tuesday but not to
the extent seen last week, Kittell said. </p>
<p>The region northwest of Los Angeles, California, has seen some of the
state’s most destructive fires over the years.  </p>
<p>Across the country in New Jersey, firefighters were reporting
“substantial progress” against a wildfire that was threatening dozens of
structures, one of a number of forest fires they are fighting in the
state. </p>
<p>The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection’s Forest Fire
Service said Saturday afternoon that the fire in the Pompton Lakes area
of Passaic County had been 50% contained. </p>
<p>The blaze is burning more than 65 hectares and is threatening 55
structures, although no evacuations have been ordered. Earlier, the
blaze prompted closure of the right lane of northbound Interstate 287,
officials said. </p>
<p>The Forest Fire Service was battling the blaze with fire engines and
ground crews and a helicopter capable of dropping 1,325 liters of water,
officials said. Structures were being protected by local fire companies,
they said. </p>
<p>Officials also reported fighting a new wildfire that has ignited
across more than 728 hectares near the New York-New Jersey border in
Passaic County’s West Milford and Orange County, New York. The Jennings
Creek wildfire was threatening two homes and eight buildings in the Long
Pond Ironworks Historic District. </p>
<p>An earlier wildfire in the Bethany Run area on the border of
Burlington and Camden counties in Evesham and Voorhees townships was
reported 90% contained. </p>
<p>A blaze along the Palisades Interstate Parkway in Englewood Cliffs in
Bergen County, across the Hudson River from New York, was reported 40%
contained and threatened no structures. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning, saying
gusty winds and low humidity could help spread fires quickly. </p>
<p>New Jersey has not received measurable precipitation in over a month,
the weather service said, setting a record.</p>

<h2 id="experts-release-new-guidelines-for-preventing-strokes">Experts
release new guidelines for preventing strokes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Most strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at
helping people and their doctors do just that.</p>
<p>Stroke was the fourth-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year. But up to
80% of strokes may be preventable with better nutrition, exercise and
identification of risk factors.</p>
<p>The first new guidelines on stroke prevention in 10 years from the
American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart
Association, include recommendations for people and doctors that reflect
a better understanding of who gets strokes and why, along with new drugs
that can help reduce risk.</p>
<p>The good news is that the best way to reduce your risk for stroke is
also the best way to reduce your risk for a whole host of health
problems — eat a healthy diet, move your body and don’t smoke. The bad
news is that it’s not always so easy to sustain.</p>
<p>Dr. Sean Duke, a stroke doctor at the University of Mississippi
Medical Center, blames the forces in society that keep people sedentary
and eating poorly, like cell phones and cheap, unhealthy food. “Our
world is stacked against us,” he said.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know about stroke and the new guidelines:</p>
<p>What is a stroke?</p>
<p>A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or
if a blood vessel in the brain bursts. That deprives the brain of oxygen
which can cause brain damage that can lead to difficulty thinking,
talking and walking, or even death.</p>
<p>How eating healthy can reduce your risk for stroke</p>
<p>Eating healthy can help control several factors that increase your
risk for stroke, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and
obesity, according to the heart association.</p>
<p>The group recommends foods in the so-called Mediterranean diet such
as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and olive oil, which can help keep
cholesterol levels down. It suggests limiting red meat and other sources
of saturated fat. Instead, get your protein from beans, nuts, poultry,
fish and seafood.</p>
<p>Limit highly processed foods and foods and drinks with a lot of added
sugar. This can also reduce your calorie intake, which helps keep weight
in check.</p>
<p>Moving your body can help prevent strokes</p>
<p>Getting up and walking around for at least 10 minutes a day can
“drastically” reduce your risk, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell, a neurologist
at Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was part of the group
that came up with the new guidelines. Among the many benefits: Regular
exercise can help reduce blood pressure, a major risk factor for
stroke.</p>
<p>Of course, more is better: The heart association recommends at least
150 minutes of moderate aerobic or 75 minutes of vigorous activity — or
some combination — per week. How you do it doesn’t matter so much,
experts said: Go to the gym, take a walk or run in your neighborhood or
use treadmills or stepper machines at home.</p>
<p>New tools to reduce obesity, a risk factor for stroke</p>
<p>Diet and exercise can help control weight, another important risk
factor for strokes. But a new class of drugs that can drastically reduce
weight have been approved by regulators, providing new tools to reduce
stroke risk since guidelines were last updated.</p>
<p>The guidelines now recommend that doctors consider prescribing these
drugs, including those sold under the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy,
Mounjaro and Zepbound, to people with obesity or diabetes.</p>
<p>But while those drugs can help, people still need to eat well and get
exercise, cautions Dr. Fadi Nahab, a stroke expert at Emory University
Hospital.</p>
<p>Guidelines help identify people who might be at higher risk</p>
<p>The new guidelines for the first time recommend doctors screen
patients for other factors that could increase stroke risk, including
sex and gender and non-medical factors such as economic stability,
access to health care, discrimination and racism. For example, the risk
for having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for Black adults in
the U.S. as it is for white adults, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>“If somebody doesn’t have insurance or they can’t get to a doctor’s
office because of transportation issues or they can’t get off work to
get health care … these are all things that can impact the ability to
prevent stroke,” Bushnell said.</p>
<p>Doctors may be able to point to resources for low-cost health care or
food, and can give ideas about how to be active without breaking the
bank for a gym membership.</p>
<p>The guidelines also now recommend doctors should screen for
conditions that could increase a woman’s risk for stroke, such as high
blood pressure during pregnancy or early menopause.</p>
<p>How do I know if I’m having a stroke and what do I do?</p>
<p>Three of the most common stroke symptoms include face weakness, arm
weakness and difficulty speaking. And time is important, because brain
damage can happen quickly and damage can be limited if a stroke is
treated quickly. Stroke experts have coined an acronym to help you
remember: FAST. F for face, A for arm, S for speech, and T for time. If
you think you or a loved one could be having a stroke, call 911 right
away.</p>

They had gathered expecting to celebrate a historic Kamala Harris

id="us-will-appeal-ruling-that-911-defendants-can-plead-guilty-avoid-death-penalty">US
will appeal ruling that 9/11 defendants can plead guilty, avoid death
penalty</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Defense Department will appeal a military
judge’s ruling that plea agreements struck by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,
the alleged mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks, and two of
his co-defendants are valid, a defense official said Saturday.</p>
<p>The ruling this past week voided Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s
order to throw out the deals and concluded that the plea agreements were
valid. The judge granted the three motions to enter guilty pleas and
said he would schedule them for a future date to be determined by the
military commission.</p>
<p>The department will also seek a postponement of any hearing on the
pleas, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly
discuss legal matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. Rear Admiral
Aaron Rugh, the chief prosecutor, sent a letter Friday to the families
of 9/11 victims informing them of the decision.</p>
<p>The ruling by the judge, Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall, allowed
the three 9/11 defendants to enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military
courtroom at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and would spare them the risk of the
death penalty. The pleas by Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa
al-Hawsawi would be a key step toward closing out the long-running and
legally troubled government prosecution in the attacks that killed
nearly 3,000 people.</p>
<p>Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense lawyers
under government auspices, and the top official for the military
commission at Guantanamo had approved the agreements. But the deals were
immediately slammed by Republican lawmakers and others when they were
made public this summer.</p>
<p>Within days, Austin issued an order saying he was nullifying them. He
said plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the
gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that
should only be decided by the defense secretary.</p>
<p>The judge had ruled that Austin lacked the legal authority to toss
out the plea deals.</p>
<p>The agreements, and Austin’s attempt to reverse them, have made for
one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays
and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings
to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants, given
their torture in CIA custody.</p>
<p>While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the
9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences,
legal experts say it is not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11
cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely
hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals.</p>
<p>The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations,
whether Austin’s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference
and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by
“clean teams” of FBI agents that did not involve violence.</p>

arrested in killing of American tourist in Budapest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BUDAPEST, HUNGARY — A 31-year-old American tourist was killed while
on vacation in Hungary’s capital, and the suspect, a 37-year-old Irish
man, has been arrested, Hungarian police said Saturday.</p>
<p>The victim, Mackenzie Michalski of Portland, Oregon, was reported
missing on November 5 after she was last seen at a nightclub in central
Budapest. Police launched a missing person investigation and reviewed
security footage from local nightclubs, on which they observed Michalski
with a man later identified as the suspect in several of the clubs the
night of her disappearance.</p>
<p>Police detained the man, an Irish citizen, on the evening of November
7. Investigators said that Michalski and the suspect met at a nightclub
and danced before leaving for the man’s rented apartment. The man killed
Michalski while they were engaged in an “intimate encounter,” police
said.</p>
<p>The suspect, whom police identified by the initials L.T.M., later
confessed to the killing but said it was an accident, police said,
adding that he attempted to cover up his crime by cleaning the apartment
and hiding Michalski’s body in a wardrobe before purchasing a suitcase
and placing her body inside.</p>
<p>He then rented a car and drove to Lake Balaton, around 150 kilometers
(90 miles) southwest of Budapest, where he disposed of the body in a
wooden area outside the town of Szigliget.</p>
<p>Video released by police showed the suspect guiding authorities to
the location where he had left the body. Police said the suspect had
made internet searches before being apprehended on how to dispose of a
body, police procedures in missing person cases, whether pigs really eat
dead bodies and the presence of wild boars in the Lake Balaton area.</p>
<p>He also made an internet search inquiring on the competence of
Budapest police.</p>
<p>Michalski’s parents are currently in Budapest, police told The
Associated Press.</p>
<p>According to a post by an administrator of a Facebook group called
“Find Mackenzie Michalski,” which was created on November 7, Michalski,
who went by “Kenzie,” was a nurse practitioner who “will forever be
remembered as a beautiful and compassionate young woman.”</p>

id="lithuanian-defense-minister-proposes-ways-for-smoother-relations-between-europe-trump">Lithuanian
defense minister proposes ways for smoother relations between Europe,
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PRAGUE — European nations should not repeat the mistake of creating a
barrier between them and President-elect Donald Trump but instead
cooperate on issues of common interest, Lithuania’s defense minister
said Saturday.</p>
<p>Assuming that Trump will again apply what Laurynas Kasciunas called
“his contract approach to our relations,” Kasciunas outlined areas where
Europe and the new president could join forces: more investment in
defense, European acquisition of American weapons and cooperation on
containing China and Iran.</p>
<p>“What we did a little bit wrong last time when he was elected [by
defeating] Hillary Clinton, and it was unexpected, we built against him
a moral wall,” Kasciunas told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>“I think it was not a correct way,” Kasciunas said. He was speaking
on the sidelines of a three-day gathering in Prague focusing on European
and transatlantic military capabilities.</p>
<p>During his first term, from 2017 to 2021, Trump pushed NATO’s
European members to spend more on defense, up to and beyond 2% of gross
domestic product, and to be less reliant on U.S. military.</p>
<p>That’s what the allies have been doing. A total of 23 members are
expected to meet the 2% target this year, compared with three 10 years
ago, according to NATO. Lithuania has already surpassed 2.5% with a goal
of reaching 4%, which would be more than the United States.</p>
<p>Europe’s defense industry managed to increase output of some products
after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but European
countries also donated their own weapons to Ukraine and “remain
dependent on the U.S. for some important aspects of their military
capability,” a report published by the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies at the Prague event said.</p>
<p>Lithuania, which borders Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave to the west and
Belarus to the east, remains the largest buyer of U.S. arms among the
three Baltic states.</p>
<p>The minister, whose country was in a spat with China over Taiwan,
also spoke in favor of European Union sanctions on Iran.</p>
<p>However, Russia’s war against Ukraine has been divisive.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly taken issue with U.S. aid to Ukraine, made vague
vows to end the war and has praised Russian President Vladimir
Putin.</p>
<p>Kasciunas insisted that Europe’s military aid to Ukraine must
continue and that Russia should not dictate the conditions for peace,
while a limited cease-fire would not make sense because it would only
help Russian troops recover from losses and strike again.</p>
<p>“We need a just peace, credible peace,” he said.</p>
<p>During his election campaign, Trump also threatened actions that
could have groundbreaking consequences for nations across Europe, from a
trade war with the EU to a withdrawal of NATO commitments.</p>

Trump will meet in Oval Office Wednesday, White House says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden will meet with President-elect
Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday after Biden pledged an
orderly transfer of power following the Republican’s decisive election
victory.    </p>
<p>Biden and Trump will meet at the Oval Office at 11:00 a.m., the White
House said Saturday, with the clock ticking down to the ex-president’s
return to power in January. </p>
<p>Trump sealed a historic comeback to the White House in the November 5
election, cementing what is set to be more than a decade of U.S.
politics overshadowed by his often divisive politics. </p>
<p>The 78-year-old won wider margins than before, despite a criminal
conviction and two impeachments while in office. </p>
<p>Exit polls showed that voters’ top concern remained the economy and
inflation that spiked under Biden in the wake of the COVID
pandemic. </p>
<p>Biden, who dropped out of the race in July over concerns about his
ability to continue at the age of 81, called Trump to congratulate him
after his election win.</p>

American activist defiant over Iranian plots to kill her, Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BERLIN — In the middle of a Berlin hotel cafe, Masih Alinejad raises
her voice and starts singing at the top of her lungs in Farsi, as
waiters and her three German government bodyguards turn to watch.</p>
<p>“I blossom through my wounds and my scars,” she translates the lyrics
as. “Because I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman.”</p>
<p>Alinejad was expressing her defiance and asserting her right to
express herself following the news of Iranian murder-for-hire plots to
kill her and Donald Trump that were disclosed by the U.S. Justice
Department. She said that some Iranian women had been jailed for
singing.</p>
<p>The Iranian American human rights activist, who was in Berlin on
Saturday to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin
Wall together with other human rights activists from around the globe,
told The Associated Press in an interview that despite the shock of the
news, she felt more determination than ever to continue fighting for
women’s rights in Iran.</p>
<p>“They want to get rid of me. When they want me dead, it means that
I’m doing something. I’m hurting them so bad,” said Alinejad, 48,
referring to the Iranian government. “I’m echoing the voice of powerful
women and that scares them.”</p>
<p>She raised her hand in a defiant fist repeatedly during the
interview.</p>
<p>On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said that it was charging a
man who said he had been tasked by a government official before this
week’s election with planning the assassination of Trump.</p>
<p>Investigators were told of the plan by Farhad Shakeri, an accused
Iranian government asset who spent time in American prisons for robbery
and who authorities say maintains a network of criminal associates
enlisted by Tehran for surveillance and murder-for-hire plots.</p>
<p>Shakeri is at large and remains in Iran. Two other men — identified
as Jonathan Loadholt and Carlisle Rivera by the U.S. Justice Department
— were arrested on charges that Shakeri recruited them to follow and
kill Alinejad, who has endured multiple Iranian murder-for-hire plots
foiled by law enforcement.</p>
<p>The Justice Department alleges that the two men spent months
conducting surveillance on her and, during their efforts to locate and
kill her, shared messages about their progress and photographs.</p>
<p>Around February, they traveled to Fairfield University in the U.S.
state of Connecticut, where Alinejad was scheduled to appear, and took
photos of the campus.</p>
<p>Around April, Shakeri sent Rivera a series of voice notes discussing
their efforts to locate and kill her, the Justice Department said in a
statement Friday.</p>
<p>In one voice note, Shakeri told Rivera that “you gotta wait and have
patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out or
following her out somewhere and taking care of it,” the statement
said.</p>
<p>“It’s scary. But at the same time, I was very pleased that the U.S.
law enforcement is protecting me,” Alinejad said, recounting her call
with American security officials.</p>
<p>“The same person who was trying to kill President Trump was assigned
to kill me as well. I mean, that’s a badge of honor.”</p>
<p>In Tehran, Esmail Baghaei, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson,
rejected the report and called it a plot by Israel-linked circles to
make Iran-U.S. relations more complicated, the official IRNA news agency
reported.</p>
<p>Alinejad is a prominent figure on Farsi-language satellite channels
abroad that critically view Iran, and she has worked as a contractor for
U.S.-funded Voice of America’s Farsi-language network since 2015. She
fled Iran following the country’s disputed 2009 presidential election
and became a U.S. citizen in October 2019.</p>
<p>Alinejad accused the Iranian government of continuing to oppress
women in Iran and make them wear the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, even
two years after the death of Mahsa Amini that sparked weekslong mass
protests.</p>
<p>The fact that the Iranian government has repeatedly tried to kill
her, she said, “makes me more determined to give voice to powerful women
inside Iran who are facing the same killers every single day.”</p>

<h2 id="iran-urges-trump-to-change-maximum-pressure-policy">Iran urges
Trump to change ‘maximum pressure’ policy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TEHRAN, IRAN — Iran signaled an openness toward Donald Trump
Saturday, calling on the president-elect to adopt new policies toward it
after Washington accused Tehran of involvement in a plot to kill
him.</p>
<p>Vice President for Strategic Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif urged Trump
to reassess the policy of “maximum pressure” he employed against the
Islamic republic during his first term.</p>
<p>“Trump must show that he is not following the wrong policies of the
past,” Zarif told reporters.</p>
<p>His remarks came after the United States accused Iran of conspiring
to assassinate Trump.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry described the American accusations Saturday as
“totally unfounded.”</p>
<p>Tehran and Washington severed diplomatic relations shortly after the
Islamic revolution in 1979.</p>
<p>2015 nuclear power accord</p>
<p>Zarif, a veteran diplomat who previously served as foreign minister,
helped to seal the 2015 nuclear accord between Iran and Western powers,
including the United States.</p>
<p>However, the deal was torpedoed in 2018 after the United States
unilaterally withdrew from the deal under Trump, who later reimposed
sanctions on Tehran.</p>
<p>In response, Iran rolled back its obligations under the deal and has
since enriched uranium up to 60%, just 30 percentage points lower than
nuclear-grade uranium.</p>
<p>Tehran has repeatedly denied Western accusations that it seeks to
develop a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>Zarif said Saturday that it was Trump’s political approach toward
Iran that led to the surge in enrichment levels.</p>
<p>“He must have realized that the maximum pressure policy that he
initiated caused Iran’s enrichment to reach 60% from 3.5% and increased
its centrifuges,” he said.</p>
<p>Provocations</p>
<p>“As a man of calculation, he should do the math and see what the
advantages and disadvantages of this policy have been and whether he
wants to continue or change this harmful policy,” Zarif said.</p>
<p>In December 2017, Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and
the following year moved the American embassy there.</p>
<p>Trump also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights,
which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 and later annexed.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump also ordered the killing of revered
Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, who led the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps foreign operations arm, the Quds Force.</p>
<p>Soleimani was killed in a drone strike while he was in the Iraqi
capital, Baghdad, in January 2020.</p>
<p>The Islamic Republic has not recognized its archnemesis Israel since
the U.S.-backed shah was toppled in 1979.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said he
hoped the president-elect’s return to power would allow Washington to
“revise the wrong approaches of the past,” although he avoided
mentioning Trump by name.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, election day in the United States, Trump told reporters
he was “not looking to do damage to Iran.”</p>
<p>“My terms are very easy. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I’d like
them to be a very successful country,” he said after casting his
ballot.</p>
<p>Iran insists that it uses nuclear technology for safe and civilian
purposes.</p>
<p>Trump’s election victory came after Iran and Israel attacked each
other directly, raising fears of a further regional spillover of the
conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon.</p>

id="after-election-kenya-born-legislator-heads-to-minnesota-capitol">After
election, Kenya-born legislator heads to Minnesota capitol</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA — Huldah Momanyi Hiltsley made history
November 5 by becoming the first Kenyan-born immigrant elected to the
Minnesota House of Representatives. She describes her victory as a
testament to resilience, determination and the realization of the
American dream.</p>
<p>Standing in the State Capitol for the first time on the morning of
her orientation, Hiltsley told VOA she was overwhelmed with emotions and
eager to start her journey as an elected official.</p>
<p>“I am super excited,” Hiltsley said. “Today is orientation day for
new legislators, and to be standing in this Capitol as an African
immigrant woman is a tremendous honor. I’m just overexcited right
now.”</p>
<p>She said this milestone did not come easily. Her path to the
Minnesota State Capitol was marked by struggles, including a fight
against an immigration system that nearly led to her family’s
deportation. She credits much of her success to the community support
and the intervention of the late U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone, whose
advocacy she said ultimately secured her family’s green cards and,
later, citizenship.</p>
<p>“Getting to this moment honestly is just a testament to the struggles
that my family has gone through to be in this country,” she said.</p>
<p>There has been a media frenzy surrounding Hiltsley’s victory and it
has captured the attention of Kenyan media, with celebrations taking
place in her hometown, Nyamemiso village, which is eight hours from
Nairobi, Kenya’s capital. Despite the attention, Hiltsley said she
remains humble. </p>
<p>“I’m that little girl from that little village somewhere in the
middle of Kenya, and now I’m in the spotlight of this media frenzy. And
so, I’m still trying to really appreciate the magnitude of the moment,”
she said.</p>
<p>Hiltsley said she has a desire to inspire others, particularly young
girls in Kenya and the United States.</p>
<p>“It is still surreal,” she said, adding that “if I can make it to
this point, I can be a role model to somebody to remind them that it is
possible that our wildest dreams are possible. And that would be
something that I would look back and say, wow, I’ve made a difference in
somebody’s life.”</p>
<p>Her legislative priorities</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Hiltsley said she is committed to championing issues
that matter to her constituents in Minnesota’s Legislative District 38A.
Her priorities include community-centered public safety policies,
affordable housing options, workers’ rights and support for small
businesses — many of which are run by African immigrants.</p>
<p>“The resources are out here,” she said, promising to empower her
community.</p>
<p>“It is my job to go back to my community and tell them, hey, there
are resources here. This is how this system works. Let’s work together
to mobilize and make sure that we are also taking a piece of the pie,”
she said.</p>
<p>As the first Kenyan American woman in Minnesota’s Legislature,
Hiltsley said she recognizes the weight and responsibility of her
position.</p>
<p>She described it as “an honor that I don’t take lightly.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be the last,” she, adding that she hopes “this
moment right here is a testimony that you can come to this country, work
hard, take care of business, know your craft, stick to it, be consistent
and get to where you want to.”</p>
<p>Her message to those who have yet to succeed in their political
campaigns is clear: Perseverance is key.</p>
<p>“Be consistent. Keep going. There’s enough space in this Legislature
for more people of color, especially immigrants, because that’s the
voice that is missing,” Hiltsley said.</p>
<p>Changing political scene</p>
<p>Hiltsley shared her thoughts on the changing political landscape in
Washington, particularly with the coming administration under
President-elect Donald Trump. While acknowledging the challenges, she
said she will stay focused on serving her constituents in Minnesota,
regardless of politics.</p>
<p>“We are here to serve the people, and it doesn’t matter if you are
Democrat or Republican,” she said. “We are here as legislators to serve
the people of Minnesota.”</p>
<p>Hiltsley also shared her heartfelt message to fellow Kenyans who have
been celebrating her historic achievement.</p>
<p>“This is a historical moment, and I’m honored to be a Kenyan
American,” she said. “Let’s continue celebrating this victory, but after
that, we have work to do.”</p>
<p>She said her eyes are set on not just her role in Minnesota, but also
finding ways to collaborate with Kenya’s leaders to address issues
facing the country, including corruption and a lack of strong
leadership.</p>
<p>“Kenya has unlimited potential,” she said. “It’s up to our leaders to
do right by the people.”</p>
<p>Hiltsley will officially take her seat in the Minnesota State House
of Representatives and be sworn in on January 7. Representatives are
elected to serve two-year terms.</p>

<h2 id="boeing-to-face-civil-trial-over-2019-max-crash">Boeing to face
civil trial over 2019 MAX crash</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Beleaguered aviation giant Boeing is set to confront
another hurdle next week when it faces a civil trial over the March 2019
Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people.</p>
<p>The trial, scheduled for federal court in Chicago, originally
included six plaintiffs, but “all but one” have settled, a person close
to the litigation told AFP this week.</p>
<p>Barring an accord, the case will be Boeing’s first civil trial over
the MAX crashes.</p>
<p>A settlement, which would need court approval, is still possible,
even after the proceedings start.</p>
<p>But the source told AFP the case is expected to go to trial, a view
held by a second legal source.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs in the case are relatives of Indian-born Manisha
Nukavarapu, who was in her second year of medical school, specializing
in endocrinology at East Tennessee State University.</p>
<p>Nukavarapu, who was single and without children, boarded a 737 MAX on
March 10, 2019, in Addis Ababa in a flight bound for Nairobi to visit
her sister, who had just given birth, according to a complaint.</p>
<p>But the jet, which had been delivered in November 2018, crashed just
six minutes after taking off, killing everyone on board.</p>
<p>More trials expected</p>
<p>Relatives of 155 victims were deposed by the court between April 2019
and March 2021 in cases of wrongful death due to negligence, according
to legal filings.</p>
<p>“As of today, there are 30 cases pending on behalf of 29 decedents,”
a third legal source told AFP on October 22.</p>
<p>The cases have been split into groups, with the next trial scheduled
for April 2025 unless all the suits are settled.</p>
<p>Boeing has “accepted responsibility for the MAX crashes publicly and
in civil litigation because the design of the MCAS … contributed to
these events,” an attorney for Boeing said at an October 11 court
hearing.</p>
<p>The MCAS was a flight stabilizing system that malfunctioned in the
Ethiopian Airlines crash and in the October 2018 Lion Air crash in
Indonesia, which killed 189 people.</p>
<p>The MAX entered commercial service in May 2017. The worldwide fleet
was grounded for 20 months following the Ethiopian Airlines crash.</p>
<p>According to Boeing, more than 90% of the cases stemming from the
crashes have been settled. The company has not disclosed the overall
financial hit from these cases.</p>
<p>“Boeing has paid billions of dollars to the crash families and their
lawyers in connection with civil litigation,” a Boeing attorney said at
the October 11 hearing, which took place in Texas and involves a
Department of Justice criminal case over the MAX.</p>
<p>Dozens of plaintiffs have been deposed in civil litigation over the
Lion Air crash, with 46 represented by Seattle law firm Herrmann.</p>
<p>The Texas litigation concerns a new deferred prosecution agreement
with the Department of Justice after the DOJ concluded Boeing flouted a
$2.5 billion January 2021 criminal settlement over fraud charges related
to the MAX certification.</p>
<p>In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to fraud as part of the latest
DPA, but the accord has yet to be accepted by a federal judge.</p>

The richest man in the world just became even more influential after
pouring millions into former President Donald Trump’s reelection
campaign. Tesla shares soared after Trump’s win and CEO Elon Musk was
already invited to join a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy. We’ll get into what the cozy relationship between Trump and
Musk could mean for the U.S. economy and national security. And, we’ll
talk about the many Americans who are looking to move abroad in the face
of the U.S. election results. Plus, we’ll play a round of Half Full/Half

<p class="drop-caps">
I won’t sugar coat this: The election of Donald Trump to a second term
with a likely governing trifecta has dealt a devastating blow to U.S.
efforts to cut climate-warming pollution.
</p>
<p>
I’ve spent the past four years analyzing the progress made under the
Biden-Harris Administration as leader of the
<a href="https://repeatproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>REPEAT
Project</u></a>, which uses energy systems models to rapidly assess the
impact of federal energy and climate policies. In that time, the passage
of landmark legislation — the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law — and finalization of key federal regulations on
greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, cars and trucks, and oil and
gas supply chains put the U.S. on track to
<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/13345138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than double</u></a> its pace of decarbonization and avoid about 6
billion tons of cumulative emissions through 2035. Though even that
progress was not enough: Recent policies would do only about half the
work required to bend U.S. emissions onto a net-zero pathway by 2035.
</p>
<p>
A President Harris would have fought to protect and build on the efforts
of the past four years. Now that opportunity is lost. One notable
climate scientist even
<a href="https://thebulletin.org/2024/11/welcome-to-the-american-petrostate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declared</u></a>
a second Trump term “game over for the climate.”
</p>
<p>
With Trump once again ascendant and seemingly committed to dismantling
the historic climate progress made by the United States over the past
four years, one can be forgiven for feeling anguish about the
opportunities we’ve lost, rage about the very real suffering that will
result from further delay, or deep despair about the darker days ahead.
</p>
<p>
But only for a moment. Because the fight to defend that progress begins
today, and there is no time to lose.
</p>
<p>
In 1992, the nations of the world established the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change and
<a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/what-is-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change#:~:text=The%20ultimate%20objective%20of%20the,ecosystems%20to%20adapt%20naturally%20to" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pledged</u></a>
to “prevent dangerous human induced interference with the climate
system.” As the parties to the UNFCCC gather once again in Azerbaijan
this December, one thing should be clear to all: We have failed in that
task. This year is
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/2024-will-be-worlds-hottest-record-eu-scientists-say-2024-11-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>virtually
certain</u></a> to be the warmest on record and the first to breach 1.5
degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. Wildfires and
droughts, hurricanes and floods now seem to strike with alarming
frequency and terrible ferocity.
</p>
<p>
Yet
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021RG000757" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
best</u></a>
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>science</u></a>
tells us that climate change is not like an asteroid hurtling towards
earth, an all-or-nothing battle for survival. Rather, scientists tell us
that every billion tons of CO2 and every 10th of a degree of warming we
prevent will save lives, prevent suffering, and avoid countless damage.
</p>
<p>
The fight cannot be surrendered, and the project of building a world
where the lives and aspirations of 8-going-on-10 billion people can be
powered by clean, abundant energy remains essential.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, I have been in this fight long enough to have experienced
several gutting defeats before — <em><em>and</em></em> to have witnessed
real, transformative progress.
</p>
<p>
When I began my career nearly two decades ago, a good onshore wind
project
<a href="https://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cost</u></a>
$100 to $200 per megawatt-hour, two to five times the average cost of
fossil power. Germany had just launched a subsidy program paying a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_tariffs_in_Germany#:~:text=4%20See%20also-,Progression%20of%20solar%20PV%20FiTs%20before%202012,created%20with%20a%20lower%20tariff." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lavish</u></a>
€400 to €500 per megawatt-hour for solar photovoltaics. And it would be
several years still before the first Tesla Roadster would even hit the
streets.
</p>
<p>
Today, either solar or wind power is the
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cheapest</u></a>
way to generate new electricity almost everywhere in the world, and the
International Energy Agency expects solar to overtake nuclear, wind,
hydro, gas, and, finally, coal, to become
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-solar-surge-will-send-coal-power-tumbling-by-2030-iea-data-reveals/#:~:text=The%20IEA's%20latest%20World%20Energy,source%20of%20electricity%20by%202033." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
largest source of electricity</u></a> in the world by 2033. Here in the
U.S., clean electricity and battery storage constitute virtually all of
the more than 2.5 terawatts of projects requesting
<a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/generation-storage-and-hybrid-capacity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interconnection</u></a>
to our grids. Likewise, electric vehicles (whether two-, three-, or
four-wheeled) are now the cheapest and fastest growing mobility solution
for those in emerging economies and the rich world alike. One in five
cars and trucks sold globally are
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/electric-car-sales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
electric</u></a> — in China, that figure is
<a href="https://about.bnef.com/electric-vehicle-outlook/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearing</u></a>
50%.
</p>
<p>
Annual U.S. emissions are more than a billion metric tons (or 16%) lower
than their peak in 2007, even as the economy is 40%
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>larger</u></a>.
The European Union has
<a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/climate-strategies-targets/progress-climate-action_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cut</u></a>
emissions by 37% from their peak, and by 8% in 2023 alone. Even China,
the world’s top polluter,
<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/have-china-s-carbon-emissions-peaked-answer-critical-limiting-global-warming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>may
have seen its emissions peak in 2023</u></a> — seven years ahead of
schedule.
</p>
<p>
In sum, the trajectory of global emissions has been wrestled down from
inexorable rise to plateau and impending peak. That may not be enough to
prevent dangerous climate change, but it is sufficient to
<a href="https://zenodo.org/records/14058094" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>transform
the outlook</u></a> from a bleak world of around 4 degrees of warming
and put a much more manageable world of 2 degrees within reach.
</p>
<p>
The truth is that Donald Trump can only slow, not stop the clean energy
transition. The U.S. is only responsible for about a 10th of global
emissions, and China, not America, is now the world’s largest market (by
far) for cars and trucks, electricity, and industrial commodities like
steel and cement. Trump cannot wind back the clock on technological
innovation or dampen the appetite for EVs and clean energy in the rest
of the world. Emerging climate technologies like decarbonized steel,
cement and industrial heat can take root elsewhere, even if they face
dimmer prospects in America. And a bipartisan consensus to advance
technologies like geothermal, nuclear, and carbon capture in the U.S.
remains.
</p>
<p>
While executive actions can be easily repealed, the legislative
achievements of the past four years
<a href="https://www.rff.org/news/press-releases/inflation-reduction-act-will-decrease-and-stabilize-household-electricity-price/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lower</u></a>
energy prices for American consumers and businesses, have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/us-manufacturing-election" target="_self"><u>sparked</u></a>
a long-promised American manufacturing renaissance, and direct
substantial
<a href="https://www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>investment</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.jackconness.com/ira-chips-investments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>job
creation</u></a> to Republican-represented districts and states. Texas,
that paragon of conservatism, is now the undisputed king of clean
energy. Factories producing batteries, EVs and solar panels are
sprouting across Georgia, the Carolinas, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan,
and beyond. Clean energy is now big business, and influential companies
stand to lose billions if the Inflation Reduction Act is repealed. With
Republicans securing razor-thin legislative majorities, these laws could
thus prove surprisingly durable.
</p>
<p>
In times of struggle and defeat, those brave champions of civil rights
would remind themselves that, though long, the arc of history bends
towards justice. Today, it remains our collective task to continue to
bend the arc of global emissions towards net zero.
</p>
<p>
Vice President Harris began her historic campaign by declaring, “When we
fight, we win!” That isn’t always the case, but we <em><em>can</em></em>
say with absolute certainty that if we give up the fight, we are
guaranteed defeat.
</p>
<p>
There is no “game over” in the fight against climate change. The next
battle begins today.

<p>date: 2024-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW DELHI — As India looks ahead to President-elect Donald Trump
taking charge in Washington, there is optimism the strategic
relationship built by the two countries in recent years will strengthen.
India also hopes to benefit if Trump takes a less confrontational
approach to Russia, say analysts.</p>
<p>New Delhi also is bracing for turbulence in trade ties, though, which
could be affected by Trump’s “America first” agenda.</p>
<p>In his congratulatory message posted on social media platform X,
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Trump “my friend” and said,
“I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the
India-U.S. Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership.”</p>
<p>Modi shared photos of the two leaders hugging and Trump’s visit to
India during his first term in 2020 — a time when Trump shared warm
relations with Modi.</p>
<p>Analysts in New Delhi expect that India will remain a key partner for
Washington.</p>
<p>“Compared to most other countries, particularly some of the USA’s
closest partners, perhaps India is better placed because of its
centrality in the Indo-Pacific and the role it plays in counterbalancing
China,” said Harsh Pant, vice president for studies and foreign policy
at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.</p>
<p>“Given that Trump had invested in this partnership in his earlier
term, there is hope it will continue the same trajectory,” he said.</p>
<p>The Quad group — a partnership among the United States, Japan,
Australia and India, which had been dormant earlier — was revived under
the previous Trump administration with an eye on China.</p>
<p>However, a sense of uncertainty lingers in the corridors of power in
New Delhi. “The relationship may face hiccups, which we cannot
anticipate at the moment given Trump’s leadership style and
unpredictability,” said Pant.</p>
<p>India also hopes that confrontation between the U.S. and Russia will
lessen under the Trump administration. During the campaign, Trump had
said he would end the Russia-Ukraine war without elaborating. In the
past he has spoken of having a good relationship with Russian President
Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>“If U.S. hostility to Russia lessens under Trump, we believe that it
would reduce the extreme and overwhelming Russian dependence on China,
which is good from India’s perspective,” according to Sreeram Chaulia,
dean at the Jindal School of International Affairs at O.P. Jindal Global
University.</p>
<p>Despite a recent thaw in ties with China, India remains wary of
Beijing.</p>
<p>Others point out that maintaining India’s time-tested ties with
Russia could become easier under a Trump presidency. India refused to
join Western sanctions against Russia or condemn the war in Ukraine,
positions that became an irritant in Washington.</p>
<p>“Trump appears to have a less strident approach to Russia, and that
will help India by making it simpler to balance relations between
Washington and Russia,” said Anand Kumar, associate fellow at the
Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in New
Delhi.</p>
<p>“Tariff king”</p>
<p>While security ties will likely stay on track, there are worries over
whether trade relations will take a hit under Trump, who has said he
will follow an “America first” agenda and impose tariffs on countries
that have trade surpluses with Washington.</p>
<p>The U.S. is India’s largest trading partner — two-way trade last year
totaled almost $120 billion, with a surplus of $30 billion in India’s
favor.</p>
<p>During his previous term, Trump called India a “tariff king,”
criticized high duties that New Delhi imposed on American products such
as Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and terminated India’s designation as a
developing nation that had allowed businesses to export hundreds of
products duty-free to the United States. India retaliated by raising
duties on some American products.</p>
<p>Such tensions could be exacerbated because Trump is likely to push
New Delhi to lower import duties for American companies. “This will be a
slippery slope for India; he could demand market concessions,” said
Chaulia.</p>
<p>Indian officials, however, have sounded an optimistic note.</p>
<p>“There was already a reordering of the supply chains taking place. It
is very likely that in view of the [U.S.] election results, this would
accelerate. Some of it will be disruptive, but we in India see it as an
opportunity,” Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar Subrahmanyan told
business leaders in Australia on Thursday.</p>
<p>He was referring to the trend of companies such as Apple setting up
manufacturing bases in India as they looked to diversify production from
China.</p>
<p>But analysts say Trump could take a diametrically different
approach.</p>
<p>“He has this philosophy of onshoring, that is bringing manufacturing
back to the U.S. rather than friendshoring which Biden used to talk
about — that is encouraging businesses to move to friendly countries.
So, the overall idea that U.S. businesses that are leaving China would
think of India as an alternative — that model Trump may not encourage,”
said Chaulia.</p>
<p>Defense and technology</p>
<p>There also are questions about how the defense and technology
cooperation between India and the U.S. that gained momentum under the
Biden administration will move forward. India has pushed for
co-production of defense technology rather than relying solely on direct
purchases of military equipment; sustaining that under Trump may pose a
challenge, according to analysts.</p>
<p>“The U.S. has operated under the assumption that boosting India’s
capabilities is in America’s self-interest, especially in balancing
China. But Trump is likely to demand some Indian ‘pro’ for American
‘quid,’” analyst C. Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express newspaper on
Thursday.</p>
<p>“India may find itself on a steep learning curve as it figures out
there may be no ‘free lunch’ under Trump’s second term,” Mohan
wrote.</p>
<p>Still, as India prepares to navigate a Trump presidency, there is an
overall sense of confidence.</p>
<p>“I don’t think India is as worried as some other world capitals. New
Delhi understands that if Trump’s obsession with China continues, that
gives India greater space to maneuver,” said Pant.</p>

The Federal Reserve cut its short-term interest rate by a quarter of a
percentage point yesterday. At his briefing, Fed Chair Jerome Powell
stayed away from politics, despite the freshness of the news of Donald
Trump’s decisive victory. But many of Trump’s proposals could affect the

<li>What a Trump presidency means for U.S. emissions
</h3>
<p>
With climate-skeptic Donald Trump set to retake the White House in
January, many are wondering what his policies will mean for U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions. He’s likely to walk back pollution rules on
cars and power plants, repeal some parts of the Inflation Reduction Act,
boost oil and gas drilling, and pull out of the Paris Agreement. Jesse
Jenkins, who leads the Princeton ZERO Lab and is co-host of Heatmap’s
Shift Key podcast,
<a href="https://x.com/JesseJenkins/status/1854598348763783548?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_vUEiVmcQrxDPhDFiIv_i18TR2GwFSHNsnSkBAJCPGR7ZNkk7__72hJdaQ7Rf-OBQDj2d3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
projected emissions will indeed be <strong>higher than they would under
current policies</strong>, but “since Trump cannot repeal grants already
awarded or tax credits already provided to date, and it is unlikely that
every provision in IRA will be repealed,” they probably will remain
<strong>lower than Jenkins’ so-called Frozen Policies scenario</strong>,
which assumes no new climate policies since January 2021.

published in the journal <em>Communications Earth &amp; Environment</em>
found that carbon dioxide emissions from private jets have risen by 50%
over the last four years. The research analyzed data from about 19
million private flights (half of which were shorter than 300 miles) made
by more than 25,000 private aircraft between 2019 and 2023. In 2023
alone, private flights resulted in about 15.6 million metric tons of CO2
emissions. Most private flights are taking place in the United States:
The researchers say that while the U.S. is home to 4% of the global
population, nearly 70% of all private aircraft are registered there. The
2022 FIFA World Cup was one of the most carbon-intensive events for
private aircraft. Also on the list? The Davos conference and – uh oh –

<h2
id="ready-or-not-how-china-scrambled-to-counter-the-second-trump-shock">Ready
or not? How China scrambled to counter the second Trump shock</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING/HONG KONG — After Donald Trump first stormed the White House
eight years ago, rattled Chinese leaders responded to his tariffs and
fiery rhetoric with force, resulting in a trade war that plunged ties
between the globe’s largest economies to multiyear lows.</p>
<p>This time around, Beijing has been preparing for Trump’s return by
deepening ties with allies, boosting self-reliance in tech, and setting
aside money to prop up the economy that is now more vulnerable to fresh
tariffs already threatened by Trump.</p>
<p>While some retaliation to those moves might be unavoidable, China
will focus on exploiting rifts between the U.S. and its allies, experts
say, and aim to lower the temperature to help strike an early deal to
cushion the blow from trade friction.</p>
<p>Zhao Minghao, international relations expert at Shanghai’s Fudan
University said China probably wouldn’t replay the playbook from the
first Trump presidency when Beijing had a very strong reaction to
Trump’s moves on tariffs.</p>
<p>He pointed out Chinese President Xi Jinping’s message to Trump from
Thursday, in which Xi called for “cooperation” and not “confrontation,”
emphasizing “stable, sound and sustainable” relations between the two
superpowers.</p>
<p>“Trump is not a stranger to Beijing at this time,” Zhao told Reuters.
“Beijing would respond in a measured way and make efforts to communicate
with the Trump team.”</p>
<p>While Chinese tech giants are now far less reliant on U.S. imports,
the economy — hit by a massive property crisis and saddled with
unsustainable debt — is in a weaker position than in 2016, struggling to
eke out 5% growth compared to 6.7% then.</p>
<p>To make things worse, Trump has pledged to end China’s
most-favored-nation trading status and slap tariffs on Chinese imports
in excess of 60% - much higher than those imposed during his first
term.</p>
<p>Fudan’s Zhao said Beijing has this scenario gamed out but expects
tariffs to come in below the level pledged on the campaign trail because
“that would significantly push up the inflation in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Still, that threat alone has unnerved producers in the world’s
largest exporter because China sells goods worth more than $400 billion
a year to the U.S. and hundreds of billions more in parts for products
Americans buy elsewhere.</p>
<p>Li Mingjiang, a scholar at the Rajaratnam School of International
Studies in Singapore, said that as a result, the Chinese economy might
require even more stimulus than the $1.4 trillion expected on
Friday.</p>
<p>“It’ll be a very serious blow to China’s international trade that
will affect jobs and government revenues,” said Li. “China will probably
have to come up with a much bigger stimulus package domestically.”</p>
<p>Charm offensive</p>
<p>To boost global trade, China has been on a diplomatic blitz, shoring
up alliances, mending fences with foes, and continuing difficult talks
with the European Union, even after the bloc imposed stiff tariffs on
Chinese electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Last month China ended a four-year military stand-off with India on
their disputed border; in August, it resolved a two-year spat with Japan
over the discharge of radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear
plant; and Premier Li Qiang in June visited Australia — the first such
trip in seven years.</p>
<p>Also last month, both Xi and Li attended separate summits of BRICS —
which now accounts for 35% of the global economy — and the 10-state
Shanghai Cooperation Organization, as China deepens ties with the Global
South.</p>
<p>“The first Trump administration did not show a lot of interest in
robust engagement in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, which
provided the Chinese a lot of latitude to operate in these markets
largely uncontested,” said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of the
China-Global South Project.</p>
<p>In Europe, trade tensions with China could be counterbalanced by
worries over Trump’s potentially reduced role in the Ukraine war and his
economic policies, creating an opening for Beijing, say some
experts.</p>
<p>“China will carry on reaching out to Europeans, the British, the
Australians and even the Japanese, not only to try to drive a wedge
between the U.S. and the countries of the north,” said Jean-Pierre
Cabestan, an expert at Hong Kong’s Baptist University.</p>
<p>“But also as part of its mission to rebalance its foreign trade in
favor of the Global South,” he said.</p>
<p>Tech punchline</p>
<p>During the first trade war, Trump banned high-tech exports to China
and sanctioned companies including China’s largest chipmaker SMIC,
prompting its tech sector to become domestic-focused and
self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Winston Ma, a former managing director for the China Investment
Corporation (CIC), China’s sovereign wealth fund, said a major trigger
for this shift was Trump’s ban on the sale of components to Chinese
telecommunications firm ZTE in 2018.</p>
<p>That was “really scary from a China perspective, so they began to
prepare. It was the start of that sort of defensive thinking,” added
Ma.</p>
<p>Soon after, Xi urged the nation to boost self-reliance in science and
tech, pushing China to build-up crucial industries including AI and
space.</p>
<p>The result: Eight years ago, China had only four government
procurement projects worth over $1.4 million, replacing foreign hardware
and software with domestic alternatives. That number has exploded to 169
such projects this year, data show.</p>
<p>Despite these strides, chipmakers “definitely feel the tightening —
these Chinese companies couldn’t supply to global clients and can’t have
access to the latest chips,” said Ma.</p>
<p>Nazak Nikakhtar, a Commerce Department official under Trump who knows
his advisers, said she expected Trump to be “much more aggressive about
export control policies towards China.”</p>
<p>She anticipated “a significant expansion of the entity list,” that
restricts exports to those on it to capture affiliates and business
partners of listed companies.</p>
<p>Ma, the ex-CIC executive, said the restrictions will have an impact
for some time as the U.S. expands the sanctions regime to overseas
suppliers.</p>
<p>“I think the punchline is that the coming years are the most critical
for this U.S.-China tech rivalry.”</p>

id="in-israeli-settlement-named-after-trump-residents-see-opportunity-after-the-election">In
Israeli settlement named after Trump, residents see opportunity after
the election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RAMAT TRUMP, Golan Heights — Israeli residents of “Trump Heights” are
welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump’s return
to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote
settlement in the central Golan Heights.</p>
<p>During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader
to recognize Israel’s control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria
in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost
after him.</p>
<p>But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after
that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump
Heights, or “Ramat Trump” in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and
Israel’s more-than-yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby
Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation.</p>
<p>Trump’s election has inspired hope in the community that it will
attract more members and also more funding for security
improvements.</p>
<p>“Maybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help
here and help our kids here,” said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights’
community manager.</p>
<p>Ori Kallner, head of the Golan’s regional council, showed off dozens
of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility
lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments.</p>
<p>“President Trump’s return to the White House definitely puts the town
in the headlines,” he said.</p>
<p>Hanging on while war rages nearby</p>
<p>Kallner stood next to a metal statue of an eagle and a menorah,
symbolizing the United States and Israel, as Israeli warplanes flew
overhead. Two explosions from rockets fired from Lebanon punched the
hills nearby, and just across the border in Lebanon, plumes of smoke
rose into the air from Israeli airstrikes.</p>
<p>An enormous sign with the settlement’s name in Hebrew and English
gleamed in the sun, while two large sunbaked metal flags of Israel and
the United States were faded almost beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Surrounded by ashen ruins of villages fled by Syrians in the 1967
war, the town is perched above the Hula Valley, where Israel has amassed
tanks, artillery and troops for its fight in Lebanon. Most towns in the
valley have been evacuated. Trump Heights sends its kids to a makeshift
daycare in a nearby settlement after the government shuttered all
schools in the region in the wake of the October 1 invasion of
Lebanon.</p>
<p>“We find ourselves hanging by our fingernails to be in our own
community, not be evacuated, and on the other hand, we cannot work, we
cannot send our kids to any kind of an education system,” said
Freimann.</p>
<p>Trump Heights is only about 12 kilometers from Lebanon and Syria.
Alerts for incoming fire gives residents about 30 seconds’ head start to
get to a bomb shelter.</p>
<p>Trump broke with other leaders on the Golan Heights</p>
<p>Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern
Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognized.</p>
<p>That changed in March 2019 when Trump, without notice, tweeted that
the U.S. would “fully recognize” Israel’s control of the territory. His
announcement drew widespread condemnation from the international
community, which considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory and
Israel’s settlements to be illegal. The Biden administration left the
decision intact, but the U.S. remains the lone country to recognize the
Israeli annexation.</p>
<p>Kallner said he hopes Trump will now persuade European countries to
recognize Israeli sovereignty there.</p>
<p>According to Israeli figures, the Golan is home to about 50,000
people — roughly half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab
Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians under
occupation.</p>
<p>Israel has encouraged and promoted settlements in the Golan, and the
Druze residents operate farms and a tourism and restaurant sector
popular with Israelis. But the area has struggled to develop because of
its remoteness, several hours from Israel’s economic center in Tel
Aviv.</p>
<p>That economic hardship has only worsened during the war as the
hospitality sector cratered. On July 28, a rocket killed 12 Druze
children on a soccer field in the city of Majdal Shams, about 20
kilometers away. Israel invaded Lebanon months later.</p>
<p>In June 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led an inauguration
ceremony for Trump Heights. The U.S. ambassador at the time, David
Friedman, noted that the ceremony came days after Trump’s birthday and
said: “I can’t think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday
present.”</p>
<p>As president, Trump was close with Netanyahu</p>
<p>The Golan recognition was among a series of diplomatic gifts that
Trump delivered to Israel during his first term. They included
recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the American
embassy to the contested city, and a series of diplomatic agreements
with Arab countries known as the Abraham Accords.</p>
<p>He has vowed to bring peace to the tumultuous region during his
second term, but has not said how.</p>
<p>Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first
term but ran afoul of the former president when he congratulated Joe
Biden on his 2020 victory. The Israeli prime minister announced Tuesday
that he was one of the first foreign leaders to call the president-elect
and congratulate him on his victory. An official in his office, speaking
on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, said aides
were upbeat and giddy.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on history’s greatest comeback!” the Israeli leader
said in a statement. “Your historic return to the White House offers a
new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great
alliance between Israel and America.”</p>
<p>At Trump Heights, Kallner was optimistic too: “The Golan community is
strong and resilient, and people that want to come and live here are
from the same material. I believe we will overcome these challenging
times and won’t stop growing.”</p>

judge rules against Biden legalization program for immigrant
spouses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge in Texas on Thursday ruled against
President Joe Biden’s program offering a path to citizenship for certain
immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens, a blow that could keep the program
blocked through Biden’s final months in office.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker found the program exceeded
Biden’s executive authority. The program offers a path to citizenship to
about 500,000 immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally if they are
married to U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>The initiative, known as Keeping Families Together, launched in
August but was blocked days later by Barker, who left it frozen while he
considered a legal challenge brought by Texas and a coalition of U.S.
states with Republican attorneys general.</p>
<p>Biden, a Democrat, announced the program in June before dropping out
of the presidential race and paving the way for Vice President Kamala
Harris to face Republican Donald Trump, an immigration hard-liner.</p>
<p>Trump defeated Harris in Tuesday’s election and is expected to launch
a wide-ranging immigration crackdown that would likely include rolling
back Biden’s initiative for immigrant spouses, which the Trump campaign
called a “mass amnesty” that would encourage illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Americans see immigration as the most pressing issue for Trump to
address when he takes office in January, and a large majority believe he
will order mass deportations of people living in the U.S. illegally, a
Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Thursday found.</p>
<p>The Biden administration could appeal Thursday’s court ruling. The
White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

id="giuliani-facing-contempt-charge-in-election-workers-case">Giuliani
facing contempt charge in election workers case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A federal judge on Thursday threatened to hold former New York City
Mayor Rudy Giuliani in civil contempt if he failed to hand over his
property to two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million
defamation judgment against him.</p>
<p>The valuables include a $5 million Manhattan condominium, a 1980
Mercedes-Benz once owned by actress Lauren Bacall, a jersey signed by
baseball legend Joe DiMaggio and some cash accounts.</p>
<p>The women said that they received death threats and that their
reputations were destroyed after Giuliani falsely accused them of ballot
fraud during Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman had ordered Giuliani to surrender the
property by October 29 to Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea “Shaye”
Moss. However, when representatives of the women went to the former
mayor’s apartment last week, they found that most of its contents,
including art and sports memorabilia, had been cleared out four weeks
earlier, and that some items had been placed in storage on Long
Island.</p>
<p>Liman warned Giuliani in court on Thursday that he expected the women
to ask that the former mayor be held in contempt if he continued to
refuse to relinquish his possessions.</p>
<p>“He’s not going to be in contempt if he’s made efforts and it’s
impossible to comply with the order. But that’s the standard that he’s
going to be held to,” Liman said.</p>
<p>Giuliani filed for bankruptcy after the multimillion-dollar judgment,
but his case was dismissed when a federal judge found that Giuliani had
not provided a clear depiction of his finances. The judge’s dismissal
opened the doors for Giuliani’s creditors, including the election
workers, to file against him.</p>
<p>Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for the women, said in court Thursday that
attempts to take possession of Giuliani’s items have been met with
“delay and then evasion” tactics. The lawyer said Giuliani was
apparently moving around his assets and had opened new bank
accounts.</p>
<p>Giuliani said in court that he had been “treated rudely” by the
people trying to take his assets.</p>
<p>Giuliani’s lawyers have unsuccessfully argued that their client
should not be required to turn over his possessions while he appeals the
judgment.</p>
<p>“Every bit of property that they want is available if they are
entitled to it,” Giuliani told reporters Thursday. “Now, the law says
they’re not entitled to a lot of them. For example, they want my
grandfather’s watch, which is 150 years old. That’s a bit of an
heirloom. Usually, you don’t get those unless you’re involved in a
political persecution. In fact, having me here today is like a political
persecution.”</p>
<p>Giuliani, 80, who once enjoyed widespread popularity, has now been
disbarred in New York and Washington.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-trumps-election-victory-mean-for-nato-europe">What
does Trump’s election victory mean for NATO, Europe?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — America’s allies in Europe are debating what Donald Trump’s
win in Tuesday’s U.S. presidential election could mean for their
security and prosperity amid concerns that the next four years may once
again be characterized by a turbulent transatlantic alliance.</p>
<p>European interests</p>
<p>About 50 European leaders met in Budapest on Thursday for a summit of
the European Political Community, which was set up in 2022 in the wake
of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe must stand up for itself
as it prepares for the next Trump presidency in the United States.</p>
<p>“There is a geopolitical situation where it is clear that we have two
blocs: the United States of America on one side and China on the other,
which above all seek their own interests,” Macron told the other
European leaders.</p>
<p>“I think that our role here in the European Union is not to comment
on the election of Donald Trump, to wonder if it is good or not. He was
elected by the American people, and he is going to defend the interests
of American people and that is legitimate and that is a good thing,” he
said.</p>
<p>“The question is, are we ready to defend the interests of Europeans?
That is the only question that we should ask ourselves. And for me, I
think that is our priority,” he said.</p>
<p>NATO</p>
<p>The NATO alliance remains the bedrock of Europe’s security.</p>
<p>“The first implication for the alliance is how to continue support
for Ukraine if there’s an expected drawdown of military assistance from
the U.S.,” said Ed Arnold, senior research fellow for European security
at Britain’s Royal United Services Institute.</p>
<p>“That can either be delivered through NATO — and there were some
steps taken in this summer to sort of formalize those structures — but
still significantly less than where it needs to be. It can also be done
through the EU as well, which might increase slightly but probably not
enough. Or it can be done bilaterally,” Arnold told VOA.</p>
<p>“I think actually the mechanisms are probably largely irrelevant.
It’s more about the cost to individual nations, and that’s going to have
to ramp up pretty quickly if they’re going to be able to have that
impact,” he said.</p>
<p>Shortfall</p>
<p>Does Europe have the capacity to make up any shortfall from a U.S.
withdrawal of support for Kyiv?</p>
<p>“Yes, but it would take a lot more effort than Europe is making now,”
according to analyst Ian Bond of the Center for European Reform. “And I
think there will be some, perhaps in Germany, perhaps elsewhere, who
will say the Ukrainians are just going to have to put up with losing
some of their territory.</p>
<p>“I think for the Baltic states, for the Nordic states, Poland — they
will look at this and they will say, ‘Russia is going to be an
existential threat to us if it is allowed to control Ukraine. And
therefore we must step up our efforts,’” Bond said.</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, Trump said he would end the Russia-Ukraine war
on day one, although he didn’t elaborate on how that would be achieved.
In the past he has boasted of a good relationship with Russian President
Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Peace deal?</p>
<p>Ukraine fears being forced into an unfavorable peace deal — and
Europeans might change their calculations, said analyst Arnold of
RUSI.</p>
<p>“There might be a bit of a worry where there’s some within Europe who
say,”Why would we ramp up aid now if there’s going to be a negotiated
settlement fairly soon? And I think the real risk for Europe as a whole
— the EU but also NATO — is that actually the U.S. and Russia might
start to do these negotiations without them,” Arnold said.</p>
<p>Leverage</p>
<p>There are deeper concerns that the U.S. might withdraw wider support
for European security. Former government officials say Trump considered
pulling the U.S. out of NATO altogether in his first term.</p>
<p>“One of the very few consistent beliefs that Trump has held to since
he entered politics has been the idea that the United States is being
taken advantage of by its allies,” said Jonathan Monten, a U.S. foreign
policy analyst at University College London.</p>
<p>“At times, Trump threatened to withdraw from the alliance altogether
but was ultimately held back. So the million-dollar question … is
whether or not he will actually act on that threat,” Monten told
VOA.</p>
<p>“I think he likes the idea that he’s keeping foreign allies as well
as adversaries guessing as to his ultimate intentions. I think he sees
that as a source of leverage, as a source of power,” he said.</p>
<p>NATO’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, who took over the role October
1, has struck a more upbeat tone, praising Trump for getting allies to
spend more on defense.</p>
<p>“When he was president, he was the one in NATO who stimulated us to
move over the 2% [of GDP spending target],” Rutte told reporters in
Budapest on Thursday.</p>
<p>Tariffs</p>
<p>It’s not only security fears that are haunting European capitals.
America’s allies could also face economic turbulence when Trump enters
the White House.</p>
<p>“The [Trump] claims of putting about 60% or more tariffs on all
imports from China will have to have a major disruptive impact on world
trade, and there will be repercussions on the EU, on Europe, on the U.K.
and elsewhere. We can expect also tariffs on imports from the EU as
well,” said Garret Martin, co-director of the Transatlantic Policy
Center at American University in Washington.</p>
<p>“One element that I think is going to be absolutely critical for
Europe, for the EU, is to work on protecting its unity and its
unanimity. Trump, I think, is likely to try to adopt a divide and rule
approach,” Martin said.</p>
<p>Unpredictability</p>
<p>Trump’s unpredictability means there is little Europe’s leaders can
do to prepare, said Monten.</p>
<p>“They can try flattery,” he said. “They can try to offer him deals
that benefit him personally, but it’s unclear what exactly they would
have to offer. They can offer him the kind of stature or respect that
comes along with a big grand summit or trade deal. He seems to crave
that kind of respect.</p>
<p>“But when it comes to actual tangible concrete results, it is unclear
what levers they have either to threaten him with or to cajole him
with,” Monten told VOA.</p>

<h2 id="southern-california-wildfire-destroys-132-structures">Southern
California wildfire destroys 132 structures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAMARILLO, California — A Southern California wildfire has destroyed
132 structures in less than two days, fire officials said Thursday. </p>
<p>The fire started Wednesday morning in Ventura County and has grown to
nearly 80 square kilometers. </p>
<p>About 10,000 people remained under evacuation orders Thursday as the
Mountain Fire continued to threaten about 3,500 structures in suburban
neighborhoods, ranches and agricultural areas around Camarillo in
Ventura County. </p>
<p>The fire’s cause has not been determined. </p>
<p>County fire officials said crews working in steep terrain with
support from water-dropping helicopters were focusing on protecting
homes on hillsides along the fire’s northeast edge near the city of
Santa Paula, home to more than 30,000 people. </p>
<p>Kelly Barton watched as firefighters sifted through the charred
rubble of her parents’ ranch home of 20 years in the hills of Camarillo
with a view of the Pacific Ocean. </p>
<p>“This was their forever retirement home,” Barton said Thursday. “Now
in their 70s, they have to start over.” </p>
<p>Her father returned to the house an hour after evacuating Wednesday
to find it destroyed. He was able to move four of their vintage cars to
safety but two — including a Chevy Nova he’d had since he was 18 —
burned to “toast,” Barton said. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service said a red flag warning, which indicates
conditions for high fire danger, would remain in effect until 6 p.m.
Winds were expected to decrease significantly but humidity levels will
remain critically low, forecasters said. </p>
<p>Officials in several Southern California counties urged residents to
watch for fast-spreading blazes, power outages and downed trees during
the latest round of notorious Santa Ana winds. </p>
<p>Santa Anas are dry, warm and gusty northeast winds that blow from the
interior of Southern California toward the coast and offshore, moving in
the opposite direction of the normal onshore flow that carries moist air
from the Pacific. They typically occur during the fall months and
continue through winter and into early spring. </p>
<p>The Mountain Fire was burning in a region that has seen some of
California’s most destructive fires over the years. The fire swiftly
grew from about 1.2 square kilometers to more than 41 square kilometers
in little more than five hours on Wednesday. By Thursday afternoon it
was mapped at nearly 80 square kilometers and Governor Gavin Newsom had
proclaimed a state of emergency in the county. </p>
<p>Across the country in New Jersey, firefighters were battling blazes
in the parched New Jersey Pinelands on Thursday, where they say
conditions are the driest they have been in at least 120 years. </p>
<p>A forest fire in the Philadelphia suburb of Evesham forced the
evacuation of a dozen homes on Thursday and was threatening dozens of
other residences. The blaze was discovered Thursday morning and had
burned completely uncontained across less than 2 square kilometers by
early afternoon, the New Jersey Forest Fire Service said. </p>
<p>Crews were battling another forest fire Thursday about an hour away
in Jackson Township that was discovered a day earlier. </p>
<p>And late Thursday afternoon, a third, smaller blaze broke out in
Glassboro, another Philadelphia suburb. Few details were immediately
available on that fire. </p>
<p>No injuries or property damage have been reported in any of the
fires.</p>

Federal Reserve cuts key interest rate by quarter-point</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate on
Thursday by a quarter-point in response to the steady decline in the
once-high inflation that had angered Americans and helped drive Donald
Trump’s presidential election victory this week.</p>
<p>The rate cut follows a larger half-point reduction in September, and
it reflects the Fed’s renewed focus on supporting the job market as well
as fighting inflation, which now barely exceeds the central bank’s 2%
target.</p>
<p>Thursday’s move reduces the Fed’s benchmark rate to about 4.6%, down
from a four-decade high of 5.3% before September’s meeting. The Fed had
kept its rate that high for more than a year to fight the worst
inflation streak in four decades. Annual inflation has since fallen from
a 9.1% peak in mid-2022 to a 3½-year low of 2.4% in September.</p>
<p>In a statement after its latest meeting ended, the Fed said the
“unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,” while inflation has
fallen closer to the central bank’s target but “remains somewhat
elevated.”</p>
<p>After their rate cut in September — their first such move in more
than four years — the Fed’s policymakers had projected that they would
make further quarter-point cuts in November and December and four more
next year.</p>
<p>But with the economy now mostly solid and Wall Street anticipating
faster growth, larger budget deficits and higher inflation under a Trump
presidency, further rate cuts may have become less likely.</p>
<p>The economy is clouding the picture by flashing conflicting signals,
with growth solid but hiring weakening. Consumer spending, though, has
been healthy, fueling concerns that there is no need for the Fed to
reduce borrowing costs and that doing so might overstimulate the economy
and even re-accelerate inflation.</p>
<p>Financial markets are throwing yet another curve at the Fed:
Investors have sharply pushed up Treasury yields since the central bank
cut rates in September. The result has been higher borrowing costs
throughout the economy, thereby diminishing the benefit to consumers of
the Fed’s half-point cut in its benchmark rate, which it announced after
its September meeting.</p>
<p>Broader interest rates have risen because investors are anticipating
higher inflation, larger federal budget deficits, and faster economic
growth under a President Trump. Trump’s plan to impose at least a 10%
tariff on all imports, as well as significantly higher taxes on Chinese
goods, and to carry out a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants
would almost certainly boost inflation. This would make it less likely
that the Fed would continue cutting its key rate. Annual inflation as
measured by the central bank’s preferred gauge fell to 2.1% in
September.</p>
<p>Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that Trump’s proposed 10%
tariff, as well as his proposed taxes on Chinese imports and autos from
Mexico, could send inflation back up to about 2.75% to 3% by
mid-2026.</p>
<p>Rate cuts by the Fed typically lead to lower borrowing costs for
consumers and businesses over time. Yet this time, mortgage rates fell
in anticipation of rate cuts but have since bounced back up as the
economy has grown briskly, fueled by consumer spending. High borrowing
costs not only for mortgages but also for car loans and other major
purchases, even as the Fed is reducing its benchmark rate, has set up a
potential challenge for the central bank: Its effort to support the
economy by lowering borrowing costs may not bear fruit if investors are
acting to boost longer-term borrowing rates.</p>
<p>The economy grew at a solid annual rate just below 3% over the past
six months, while consumer spending — fueled by higher-income shoppers —
rose strongly in the July-September quarter.</p>
<p>But companies have scaled back hiring, with many people who are out
of work struggling to find jobs. Powell has suggested that the Fed is
reducing its key rate in part to bolster the job market. If economic
growth continues at a healthy clip and inflation climbs again, though,
the central bank will come under growing pressure to slow or stop its
rate cuts.</p>

health officials call for expanded bird flu testing for farm
workers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Federal health officials on Thursday called for more testing of
employees on farms with bird flu after a new study showed that some
dairy workers had signs of infection, even when they didn’t report
feeling sick. </p>
<p>Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested
and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav
Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. </p>
<p>The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in
Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers — or 7% — had antibodies
that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1
influenza. </p>
<p>“The purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the
transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus
changing,” Shah told reporters. </p>
<p>The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird
virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people.
It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46
farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in
contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry. </p>
<p>Outside experts said it’s notable that the study prompted the CDC to
take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and
treating workers only when they had symptoms. </p>
<p>“This is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1
viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,” said
Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of
Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. </p>
<p>Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the
chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a
virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. </p>
<p>“It shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the
H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this
virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually
run out,” Rasmussen said in an email. </p>
<p>The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado
tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood
tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and
none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they
used eye protection. </p>
<p>High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected
cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers
said. </p>
<p>Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness
have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm
owners and farmworkers to allow testing. </p>
<p>The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15
states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon
farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was
detected in U.S. swine.</p>

<h2 id="elon-musks-plan-to-make-tesla-the-last-ev-maker-standing">Elon
Musk’s Plan to Make Tesla the Last EV-Maker Standing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDI4NTM5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTI3OTc4Nn0.GfH-rPtfZr-T3mf0YlU0Gd6D-rdreC2WQpfnmm8vR18/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It was a curious alliance from the start. On the one hand, Donald Trump,
who made antipathy toward electric vehicles a core part of his
meandering rants. On the other hand, Elon Musk, the man behind the
world’s largest EV company, who nonetheless put all his weight, his
millions of dollars, and the power of his social network behind the
Trump campaign.
</p>
<p>
With Musk standing by his side on Election Day, Trump has once again
secured the presidency. His reascendance sent shock waves through the
automotive world, where companies that had been lurching toward
electrification with varying levels of enthusiasm were left to wonder
what happens now — and what benefits Tesla may reap from having hitched
itself to the winning horse.
</p>
<p>
Certainly the federal government’s stated target of 50% of U.S. new car
sales being electric by 2030 is toast, and many of the actions it took
in pursuit of that goal are endangered. Although Trump has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_blank">softened</a>
his rhetoric against EVs since becoming buddies with Musk, it’s hard to
imagine a Trump administration with <em><em>any</em></em> kind of
ambitious electrification goal.
</p>
<p>
During his first go-round as president, Trump attacked the state of
California’s ability to set its own ambitious climate-focused rules for
cars. No surprise there: Because of the size of the California car
market, its regulations helped to drag the entire industry toward
lower-emitting vehicles and, almost inevitably, EVs. If Trump changes
course and <em><em>doesn’t</em></em> do the same thing this time, it’ll
be because his new friend at Tesla
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/30/musks-tesla-california-ev-trump-00186320" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supports</u></a>
those rules.
</p>
<p>
The biggest question hanging over electric vehicles, however, is the
fate of the Biden administration’s signature achievements in climate and
EV policy, particularly the Inflation Reduction Act’s $7,500 federal
consumer tax credit for electric vehicles. A Trump administration looks
poised to tear down whatever it can of its predecessor’s policy. Some
analysts
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/trump-reelection-what-it-means-for-evs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>predict</u></a>
it’s unlikely the entire IRA will disappear, but concede Trump would try
to kill off the incentives for electric vehicles however he can.
</p>
<p>
There’s no sugar-coating it: Without the federal incentives, the state
of EVs looks somewhat bleak. Knocking $7,500 off the starting price is
essential to negate the cost of manufacturing expensive lithium-ion
batteries and making EVs cost-competitive with ordinary combustion cars.
Consider a crucial model like the new Chevy Equinox EV: Counting the
federal incentive, the most basic $35,000 model could come in under the
starting price of a gasoline crossover like the Toyota RAV4. Without
that benefit, buyers who want to go electric will have to pay a premium
to do so — the thing that’s been holding back mass electrification all
along.
</p>
<p>
Musk, during his honeymoon with Trump,
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/business/elon-musk-election-bet/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>boasted</u></a>
that Tesla doesn’t need the tax credits, as if daring the
president-elect to kill off the incentives. On the one hand, this is
obviously false. Visit Tesla’s
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/model3/design#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>
and you’ll see the simplest Model 3 listed for $29,990, but this is a
mirage. Take away the $7,500 in incentives and $5,000 in claimed savings
versus buying gasoline, and the car actually starts at about $43,000,
much further out of reach for non-wealthy buyers.
</p>
<p>
What Musk really means is that his company doesn’t need the
incentives<em><em> nearly as bad as other automakers do</em></em>. Ford
is hemorrhaging billions of dollars as it struggles to make EVs
profitably. GM’s big plan to go entirely electric depended heavily on
federal support. As <em><em>InsideEVs</em></em>
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/740030/evs-trump-election-cm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>notes</u></a>,
the likely outcome of a Trump offensive against EVs is that the legacy
car brands, faced with an unpredictable electrification roadmap as
America oscillates between presidents, scale back their plans and lean
back into the easy profitably of big, gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks. Such
an about-face could hand Tesla the kind of EV market dominance it
enjoyed four or five years ago when it sold around 75% of all electric
vehicles in America.
</p>
<p>
That’s tough news for the climate-conscious Americans who want an
electric vehicle built by someone not named Elon Musk. Hundreds of
thousands of people, myself included, bought a Tesla during the past
five or six years because it was the most practical EV for their
lifestyle, only to see the company’s figurehead shift his public persona
from goofy troll to Trump acolyte. It’s not uncommon now, as
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/few-democrats-willing-to-buy-a-tesla-after-elon-musk-backs-trump-investor-warns-170050119.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Democrats
distance themselves from Tesla</u></a>, to see Model 3s adorned with
bumper stickers like the “Anti-Elon Tesla Club,” as one on a car I
followed last month proclaimed. Musk’s newest vehicle, the Cybertruck,
is a rolling embodiment of the man’s brand, a vehicle purpose-built to
repel anyone not part of his cult of personality.
</p>
<p>
In a world where this version of Tesla retakes control of the electric
car market, it becomes harder to ditch gasoline without indirectly
supporting Donald Trump, by either buying a Tesla or topping off at its
Superchargers. Blue voters will have some options outside of Tesla — the
industry has come too far to simply evaporate because of one election.
But it’s also easy to see dispirited progressives throwing up their
hands and buying another

<h2
id="donald-trumps-transition-starts-now.-heres-how-it-will-work">Donald
Trump’s transition starts now. Here’s how it will work</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Donald Trump ’s impending return to the White House
means he’ll want to stand up an entirely new administration from the one
that served under President Joe Biden. His team is also pledging that
the second won’t look much like the first one Trump established after
his 2016 victory.</p>
<p>The president-elect now has a 75-day transition period to build out
his team before Inauguration Day arrives on Jan. 20. One top item on the
to-do list: filling around 4,000 government positions with political
appointees, people who are specifically tapped for their jobs by Trump’s
team.</p>
<p>That includes everyone from the secretary of state and other heads of
Cabinet departments to those selected to serve part time on boards and
commissions. Around 1,200 of those presidential appointments require
Senate confirmation, which should be easier with the Senate now shifting
to Republican control.</p>
<p>Here’s what to expect:</p>
<p>What will the transition look like?</p>
<p>Though the turnover in the new administration will be total, Trump
will be familiar with what he needs to accomplish. He built an entirely
new administration for his first term and has definite ideas on what to
do differently this time.</p>
<p>He’s already floated some names.</p>
<p>Trump said at his victory party early Wednesday that former
presidential hopeful and anti-vaccination activist Robert Kennedy
Jr. will be tapped to “help make America healthy again,” adding that
“we’re going to let him go to it.” Ahead of the election, Trump didn’t
reject Kennedy’s calls to end fluoridated water. Trump has also pledged
to make South African-born Elon Musk, a vocal supporter of the Trump
campaign, a secretary of federal “cost-cutting,” and the Tesla CEO has
suggested he can find trillions of dollars in government spending to
wipe out.</p>
<p>The transition is not just about filling jobs. Most presidents-elect
also receive daily or near-daily intelligence briefings during the
transition.</p>
<p>In 2008, outgoing President George W. Bush personally briefed
President-elect Barack Obama on U.S. covert operations. When Trump was
preparing to take office in 2016, Obama’s national security adviser,
Susan Rice, briefed Michael Flynn, her designated successor in the new
administration. In 2020, Trump’s legal challenges of the election’s
results delayed the start of the transition process for weeks, though,
and presidential briefings with Biden didn’t begin until Nov. 30.</p>
<p>Who is helping Trump through the process?</p>
<p>Trump’s transition is being led primarily by friends and family,
including Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi
Gabbard, as well as the president-elect’s adult sons, Donald Trump
Jr. and Eric Trump, and his running mate, JD Vance. Transition co-chairs
are Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon, the former
wrestling executive who previously led the Small Business Administration
during Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>Lutnick said this year’s operation is “about as different as
possible” from the 2016 effort, which was first led by Chris Christie.
After he won eight years ago, Trump fired Christie, tossed out plans the
former New Jersey governor had made and gave the job of running the
transition to then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence.</p>
<p>At the start of his first term, Trump assembled an original Cabinet
that featured some more mainstream Republicans and business leaders who
ultimately disappointed, or broke publicly with him, or both. This time,
Trump has promised to value loyalty as much as possible — a philosophy
that may ensure he makes picks that are more closely aligned to his
ideological beliefs and bombastic professional style.</p>
<p>Unlike the campaign of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris,
Trump’s team didn’t sign any pre-Election Day transition agreements with
the General Services Administration, which essentially acts as the
federal government’s landlord. He has therefore already missed deadlines
to agree with GSA on logistical matters like office space and tech
support and with the White House on access to agencies, including
documents, employees and facilities.</p>
<p>New transition rules</p>
<p>In 2020, Trump argued that widespread voter fraud — which hadn’t
actually occurred — cost him the election, delaying the start of the
transition from his outgoing administration to Biden’s incoming one for
weeks.</p>
<p>Four years ago, the Trump-appointed head of the GSA, Emily Murphy,
determined that she had no legal standing to determine a winner in the
presidential race because Trump was still challenging the results in
court. That held up funding and cooperation for the transition.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Trump’s efforts to subvert election results had
collapsed across key states that Murphy agreed to formally ” ascertain a
president-elect ” and begin the transition process. Trump eventually
posted on social media that his administration would cooperate.</p>
<p>To prevent that kind of holdup in future transitions, the
Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 mandates that the
transition process begin five days after the election — even if the
winner is still in dispute. That is designed to avoid long delays and
means that “an ‘affirmative ascertainment’ by the GSA is no longer a
prerequisite for gaining transition support services,” according to
agency guidelines on the new rules.</p>
<p>The uncertainty stretched even longer after the 2000 election, when
five weeks elapsed before the Supreme Court settled the contested
election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. That
left Bush with about half the usual amount of time to manage
transitioning the government from the outgoing Clinton administration.
That ultimately led to questions about national security gaps that may
have contributed to the U.S. being underprepared for the Sept. 11
attacks the following year.</p>

Senate Energy and Climate Committees Poised for Big Shake-Ups</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDI5MDQxNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODY1Mjc3MH0.Vrm90l791K9biavW4ytWzYu-ODIp7JTpYuRQpq-gLPM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When Republicans flipped the Senate, they took the keys to three
critical energy and climate-focused committees.
</p>
<p>
These are among the most powerful institutions for crafting climate
policy on Earth. The Senate plays the role of gatekeeper for important
legislation, as it requires a supermajority to overcome the filibuster.
Hence, it’s both where many promising climate bills from the House go to
die, as well as where key administrators such as the heads of the
Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency are vetted
and confirmed.
</p>
<p>
We’ll have to wait a bit for the Senate’s new committee chairs to be
officially confirmed. But Jeff Navin, co-founder at the climate
change-focused government affairs firm Boundary Stone Partners, told me
that since selections are usually based on seniority, in many cases it’s
already clear which Republicans are poised to lead under Trump and which
Democrats will assume second-in-command (known as the ranking member).
Here’s what we know so far.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
</h3>
<p>
This committee has been famously led by Joe Manchin, the former
Democrat, now Independent senator from West Virginia, who will retire at
the end of this legislative session. Energy and Natural Resources has a
history of bipartisan collaboration and was integral in developing many
of the key provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act — and could thus
play a key role in dismantling them. Overall, the committee oversees the
DOE, the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Forest Service, and the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, so it’s no small deal that its
next chairman will likely be <strong>Mike Lee</strong>, the
ultra-conservative Republican from Utah. That’s assuming that the
committee’s current ranking member, <strong>John Barrasso</strong> of
Wyoming, wins his bid for Republican Senate whip, which seems very
likely.
</p>
<p>
Lee opposes federal ownership of public lands, setting himself up to
butt heads with <strong>Martin Heinrich</strong>, the Democrat from New
Mexico and likely the committee’s next ranking member. Lee has also said
that solving climate change is simply a
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/26/politics/mike-lee-green-new-deal/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>matter
of having more babies</u></a>, as “problems of human imagination are not
solved by more laws, they’re solved by more humans.” As Navin told me,
“We’ve had this kind of safe space where so-called quiet climate policy
could get done in the margins. And it’s not clear that that’s going to
continue to exist with the new leadership.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Senate Environment and Public Works Committee
</h3>
<p>
This committee is currently chaired by Democrat Tom Carper of Delaware,
who is retiring after this term. Poised to take over is the Republican’s
current ranking member, <strong>Shelley Moore Capito</strong> of West
Virginia. She’s been
<a href="https://www.capito.senate.gov/news/press-releases/capito-to-lead-effort-overturning-bidens-illegal-attempt-to-close-american-power-plants" target="_blank"><u>a

power plants, while also carving out areas of bipartisan consensus on

This was a breakout moment for companies taking bets on the election’s

victory by former President Donald Trump, while traditional polls were
showing a tossup. We’ll hear more. Plus, why the U.S. dollar may grow

<h2 id="biden-calls-trump-victory-fair-and-transparent">Biden calls
Trump victory ‘fair’ and ‘transparent’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, long a political adversary of
President-elect Donald Trump, declared Thursday that Trump’s election
this week to a second nonconsecutive four-year term in the White House
was “fair” and “transparent,” and that there would be a peaceful
transfer of power on January 20.</p>
<p>Biden, speaking to dozens of his White House aides in the Rose
Garden, said he accepted that Trump had defeated his vice president,
Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>“The will of the people always prevail,” Biden said, “As I’ve said
many times, you can’t love your country only when you win. And you can’t
love your neighbor only when you agree.”</p>
<p>But Biden, a Democratic political figure for five decades, lamented
what might have been — for the vice president he picked to run alongside
him in 2020 to succeed him. He praised her campaign as “inspiring” and
said she “gave her whole heart and effort.”</p>
<p>“We lost this battle,” Biden said. “Setbacks are unavoidable, but
giving up is unforgivable. We’re going to be okay, but we need to stay
engaged. We need to keep going. And above all, we need to keep the
faith.”</p>
<p>Biden described his single term as the U.S. leader as “an historic
presidency” that will be “changing people’s lives” for years to come,
especially infrastructure improvements throughout that the country that
he pushed to congressional approval during the first two years of his
presidency.</p>
<p>Biden, who ousted Trump from power in the 2020 election, said in a
seven-minute address that he is leaving his Republican political rival
and now his successor “the strongest economy in the world.”</p>
<p>While economic numerical standards support that assessment, voter
exit polling showed to a significant degree that Trump supporters
disapproved of Biden and Harris’ handling of the American economy, the
world’s largest, because rising consumer prices throughout their time in
office sharply squeezed household budgets.</p>
<p>Trump vowed during his campaign, without saying how, that he would
bring down inflation. He has proposed new tax cuts during his upcoming
administration, which would put more money in the pockets of consumers,
particularly the wealthiest, and corporate coffers, but could also
balloon the country’s long-term national debt that already totals nearly
$36 trillion.</p>
<p>Biden called Trump on Wednesday to congratulate him and invited him
to the White House soon to discuss their handover of power.</p>
<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Thursday
that if Trump wants U.S. intelligence briefings, he will get them. An
ODNI spokesperson said the agency “is acting consistent with the
tradition, in place since 1952, of providing intelligence briefings to
the president-elect,” although it was not known whether Trump has made
such a request.</p>
<p>Key appointments</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump is moving quickly to consider appointments to key
positions in his new White House administration and could name some
choices within days.</p>
<p>He has been huddling with aides at his oceanside Mar-a-Lago retreat
in Florida to mull over his options.</p>
<p>Even before the election, transition chiefs Howard Lutnick and Linda
McMahon met with some potential candidates for top jobs, either in the
White House or to head the government’s Cabinet-level departments and an
array of other agencies.</p>
<p>Trump could name the world’s richest man, Tesla chief executive Elon
Musk, a staunch advocate and campaign donor for Trump, to a new position
to find government inefficiencies and curb spending excesses.</p>
<p>Another major Trump political supporter, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a
scion of a U.S. Democratic Party dynasty, could be named to oversee
health issues, even though he has rebuffed COVID vaccinations as
unneeded.</p>
<p>Several Wall Street financiers are under consideration for top-level
economic positions, and Trump aides say that some Republican senators
may be tapped to head Cabinet-level agencies.</p>
<p>Trump aides also have prepared a long list of possible executive
orders and regulation reversals for him to sign on his first day in
office, to end policies that have been adopted by Biden over the last
four years.</p>
<p>Biden was running for reelection against Trump until his disastrous
debate performance against Trump in June and falling poll numbers forced
him from the contest. Biden quickly endorsed Harris.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, Biden praised Harris for her campaign,
saying, “She’s been a tremendous partner and public servant full of
integrity, courage and character.</p>
<p>“Under extraordinary circumstances, she stepped up and led a historic
campaign that embodied what’s possible when guided by a strong moral
compass and a clear vision for a nation that is more free, more just and
full of more opportunities for all Americans,” Biden said.</p>

<h2 id="why-county-commissioners-matter-for-the-climate">Why County
Commissioners Matter for the Climate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDI4OTQ2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzI2NTcyM30.ffHjmwrYrbR9U-CsNuiae-BQNwrWMBO1QW1ebBWJo1I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The most important climate election you’ve never heard of? Your local
county commissioner.
</p>
<p>
County commissioners are usually the most powerful governing individuals
in a county government. As officials closer to community-level planning
than, say a sitting senator, commissioners wind up on the frontlines of
grassroots opposition to renewables. And increasingly, property owners
that may be personally impacted by solar or wind farms in their
backyards are gunning for county commissioner positions on explicitly
anti-development platforms.
</p>
<p>
Take the case of newly-elected Ohio county commissioner – and Christian
social media lifestyle influencer – Drenda Keesee.
</p>
<p>
In March, Keesee beat fellow Republican Thom Collier in a primary to
become a GOP nominee for a commissioner seat in Knox County, Ohio. Knox,
a ruby red area with very few Democratic voters, is one of the hottest
battlegrounds in the war over solar energy on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/solar-farmland" target="_self"><u>prime
farmland</u></a> and one of the riskiest counties in the country for
developers, according to Heatmap Pro’s database. But Collier had
expressed openness to allowing new solar to be built on a case-by-case
basis, while Keesee ran on a platform focused almost exclusively on
blocking solar development. Collier ultimately placed third in
<a href="https://www.boe.ohio.gov/knox/c/elecres/20240319results.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
primary</u></a>, behind Keesee and another anti-solar candidate placing
second.
</p>
<p>
Fighting solar is a personal issue for Keesee (pronounced
<em><em>keh</em></em>-see, like “messy”). She has aggressively fought
<a href="https://www.frasiersolar.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Frasier
Solar</u></a> – a 120 megawatt solar project in the country proposed by
Open Road Renewables – getting involved in organizing against the
project and regularly attending state regulator hearings. Filings she
submitted to the Ohio Power Siting Board state she owns a property at
least somewhat adjacent to the proposed solar farm. Based on the sheer
volume of those filings this is clearly her passion project – alongside
<a href="https://www.faithlifechurch.org/our-pastors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>preaching</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2024/04/gop-candidate-compares-lgbtq-activists-to-hitler-says-demons-are-turning-kids-trans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>comparing
gay people to Hitler</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday I spoke to Collier who told me the Frasier Solar project
motivated Keesee’s candidacy. He remembered first encountering her at a
community meeting – “she verbally accosted me” – and that she “decided
she’d run against me because [the solar farm] was going to be next to
her house.” In his view, he lost the race because excitement and money
combined to produce high anti-solar turnout in a kind of local
government primary that ordinarily has low campaign spending and is
quite quiet. Some of that funding and activity has
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/ohio-mount-vernon-frasier-solar-fossil-fuel-metric-media" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>been
well documented</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“She did it right: tons of ground troops, people from her church, people
she’s close with went door-to-door, and they put out lots of propaganda.
She got them stirred up that we were going to take all the farmland and
turn it into solar,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Collier’s takeaway from the race was that local commissioner races are
particularly vulnerable to the sorts of disinformation, campaign
spending and political attacks we’re used to seeing more often in races
for higher offices at the state and federal level.
</p>
<p>
“Unfortunately it has become this,” he bemoaned, “fueled by people who
have little to no knowledge of what we do or how we do it. If you stir
up enough stuff and you cry out loud enough and put up enough
misinformation, people will start to believe it.”
</p>
<p>
Races like these are happening
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18052024/ohio-solar-projects-politics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>elsewhere
in Ohio</u></a> and in other states like Georgia, where opposition to a
battery plant
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/georgia-ev-plant-backed-by-the-climate-law-sparks-water-war/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mobilized
Republican primaries</u></a>. As the climate world digests the federal
election results and tries to work backwards from there, perhaps at
least some attention will refocus on local campaigns like these.

<strong>1. Madison County, Missouri </strong>– A giant battery material

<p>
<strong>2. Benton County, Washington State </strong>– Governor Jay
Inslee finally got state approvals finished for Scout Clean Energy’s
massive Horse Heaven wind farm after a prolonged battle over project
siting, cultural heritage management, and bird habitat.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Inslee previously
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/climate-lab/inslee-rejects-recommendation-to-slash-proposal-for-wa-wind-farm/" target="_blank"><u>rejected
a request</u></a> by the state’s energy siting council to slash the size
of Horse Heaven to accommodate environmental concerns and host community
discontent. Some turbines were taken off of the project plans but
nowhere near the recommended reduction.<br/>
</li>
<li>
I spoke with Paul Krupin at Tri-Cities CARES, a citizens group that was
opposed to the scope of the project, who told me his organization and
collaborating opponents in the Yakima tribe have yet to decide whether
to challenge this approval in state court.
</li>

“We’re thinking about it,” he said, acknowledging some potential legal

<strong>3. Fulton County, Georgia </strong>– A large NextEra battery
storage facility outside of Atlanta is facing a lawsuit that commingles
usual conflicts over building these properties with environmental
justice concerns, I’ve learned.

<li>
The litigation was filed in October in Fulton County Superior Court by
three residents close to the proposed project site and challenges the
legality of local regulators’ March approval of the battery
project.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Activists have declared the project
<a href="https://canopyatlanta.org/2024/10/10/we-still-have-to-fight-to-breathe-clean-air/" target="_blank"><u>an
environmental justice issue</u></a> given the majority-black surrounding
communities also claim to deal with other forms of disproportionate
industrialization from Amazon warehouses.<br/>
</li>
<li>
“This is an older neighborhood … They’ve lived there my entire life.
It’s one thing if you consciously decide to move into a neighborhood
that has a battery storage facility,“ activist Mose James IV told
podcaster Adrianne Hutchinson in September, “but for some reason on the
South side – South Fulton – our neighbors, we look up and there’s
warehouses surrounding each and every one of our neighborhoods.”

<p class="drop-caps">
We’re joined today by Frank Wolak, CEO of perhaps the most crucial D.C.
trade group for all things hydrogen: the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy
Association. The morning after Election Day we chatted about whether
Trump 2.0 will be as receptive as members of Congress have been to
hydrogen and the IRA’s tax credit for producing the fuel. Let’s look
inside his crystal ball, shall we?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Simply put, will president-elect Donald Trump keep the IRA’s 45V
tax credit in place? </strong>
</p>
<p>
So a couple things there. First, the production tax credit still has to
be finalized and what they do about the tax credits, if anything, is a
function of whether the Biden administration issues final guidance.
</p>
<p>
If they issue final guidance, then what that guidance says will
determine what kind of reaction the Trump administration may have,
whether to adjust it or tweak it.
</p>
<p>
The second thing: I think the tax credits fit into a question of the IRA
broadly and hydrogen specifically. The Trump administration is going to
be looking at the entirety of the IRA. There’s the question of what
pushback hydrogen has in this administration and if it’s viewed as
valuable or important or secondary, tertiary to other things. And I
think we’ve yet to see that in the form of any platform.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So Trump’s view on hydrogen is a mystery then – how will that
uncertainty impact hydrogen projects in development today? </strong>
</p>
<p>
The uncertainty that has been experienced by this industry predates the
election outcome. The long wait for guidance has definitely slowed down
the amount of investment. They’ve put many things on hold. This is not a
secret.
</p>
<p>
What I’ll say is, the ability to regroup and fulfill the expectations
that this industry had two or three years ago is hugely dependent on the
outcome of the tax credit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you think we’ll see companies do in this information
vacuum? Will we see them double down on supporting the credit or
potentially get out of hydrogen since it’s an emerging, nascent
technology? </strong>
</p>
<p>
The doubling down on the tax credit depends on what the guidance looks
like.
</p>
<p>
If the guidance looks flexible, the question is: how do you take that
flexibility and make sure the Trump administration continues it and sees
it as valuable or vital?
</p>
<p>
If the tax credit becomes rigid and stays rigid in the Biden
administration, you’ll have a two step process – to unwind the rigidity
and then also encourage the Trump administration to see the merits. If
the guidance stays as stated, the work is harder.
</p>
<p>
The degree to which industry continues to make investments and says,
<em><em>“hey, we’re all in,”</em></em> is a function of how these tax
credits emerged. Are they going to really keep fighting and to keep the
momentum going, or are the [credits] so limited that companies go,
<em><em>“look this is going to be very very hard to overcome in the U.S.
so we’re going to take our investment elsewhere.”</em></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>You think we might see companies dip out of the hydrogen space
over the credit’s outcome? </strong>
</p>
<p>
Mature long term players who are multinationals … are remaining
extremely positive. They may adjust the sequence of their investments
but they’re in this because they’re in hydrogen and want to be in this
market as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
But those who saw this as an opportunity to come in and take advantage
of tax credits are having those reactions of, “Should I invest? Do I
look [at it] positively?” And that’s probably natural.

id="plea-deals-revived-for-alleged-911-mastermind-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-others">Plea
deals revived for alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,
others</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A military judge has ruled that plea agreements struck
by alleged September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two
co-defendants are valid, voiding an order by U.S. Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin to throw out the deals, a government official said.</p>
<p>The official spoke on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the
order by the judge, Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall, has not yet been
posted publicly or officially announced.</p>
<p>Unless government prosecutors or others attempt to challenge the plea
deals again, McCall’s ruling means that the three 9/11 defendants before
long could enter guilty pleas in the U.S. military courtroom at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, taking a dramatic step toward wrapping up the
long-running and legally troubled government prosecution in one of the
deadliest attacks on the United States.</p>
<p>The plea agreements would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants, Walid
bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, the risk of the death penalty in
exchange for the guilty pleas.</p>
<p>Government prosecutors had negotiated the deals with defense
attorneys under government auspices, and the top official for the
military commission at the Guantanamo Bay naval base had approved the
agreements.</p>
<p>The plea deals in the September 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks that
killed nearly 3,000 people spurred immediate political blowback by
Republican lawmakers and others after they were made public this
summer.</p>
<p>Within days, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying
them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the
gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that
should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the
time.</p>
<p>The agreements, and Austin’s attempt to reverse them, have made for
one of the most fraught episodes in a U.S. prosecution marked by delays
and legal difficulties. That includes years of ongoing pretrial hearings
to determine the admissibility of statements by the defendants given
their years of torture in CIA custody.</p>
<p>The Pentagon is reviewing the judge’s decision and had no immediate
further comment, said Major General Pat Ryder, Pentagon press
secretary.</p>
<p>Lawdragon, a legal news site that long has covered the courtroom
proceedings from Guantanamo, and The New York Times first reported the
ruling.</p>
<p>Military officials have yet to post the judge’s decision on the
Guantanamo military commission’s online site. But Lawdragon said
McCall’s 29-page ruling concludes that Austin lacked the legal authority
to toss out the plea deals and acted too late, after Guantanamo’s top
official already had approved the deals.</p>
<p>Abiding by Austin’s order would give defense secretaries “absolute
veto power” over any act they disagree with, which would be contrary to
the independence of the presiding official over the Guantanamo trials,
the law blog quotes McCall as saying in the ruling.</p>
<p>While families of some of the victims and others are adamant that the
9/11 prosecutions continue until trial and possible death sentences,
legal experts say it’s not clear that could ever happen. If the 9/11
cases ever clear the hurdles of trial, verdicts and sentencings, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would likely
hear many of the issues in the course of any death penalty appeals.</p>
<p>The issues include the CIA destruction of videos of interrogations,
whether Austin’s plea deal reversal constituted unlawful interference
and whether the torture of the men tainted subsequent interrogations by
“clean teams” of FBI agents that did not involve violence.</p>

arrests US citizen suspected of offering military intel to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Berlin — Germany has arrested a U.S. citizen suspected of offering
intelligence on the U.S. military to China that he had acquired while
working for troops stationed in Germany, the federal prosecutor’s office
said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>The man, identified only as Martin D. under German privacy law, is
accused of having declared himself ready to work as an agent for a
foreign intelligence agency, the statement said.</p>
<p>The accused had worked for U.S. armed forces in Germany until
recently, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>In 2024, he is said to have contacted Chinese state positions and
offered to share with them sensitive information to pass on to Chinese
intelligence. He had gathered the information through his work for the
military, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Germany has warned of an increased risk of espionage from Beijing and
arrested a number of people this year for alleged spy activities.</p>
<p>This includes three Germans arrested in April on suspicion of working
to hand over technology that could strengthen China’s navy, as well as a
European Union staffer of a far-right politician accused of working with
Chinese intelligence.</p>

<strong></strong>The world is still reeling from the results of this

in international financial institutions, is viewed as crucial to that

Another early effect of the decisive election result is that clean
energy stocks are down. The iShares Global Clean Energy exchange traded
fund, whose biggest holdings are the solar panel company First Solar and
the Spanish utility and renewables developer Iberdola, is down about 6%.
The iShares U.S. Energy ETF, meanwhile, whose largest holdings are Exxon
and Chevron, is up over 3%. Some specific publicly traded clean energy
stocks have sunk, especially residential solar companies like Sunrun,
which is down about 30% compared to Tuesday. “That renewables companies
are falling more than fossil energy companies are rising, however,
indicates that the market is not expecting a Trump White House to do
much to improve oil and gas profitability or production, which has
actually increased in the Biden years thanks to the spikes in energy
prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and continued
exploitation of America’s oil and gas resources through hydraulic
fracturing,”

id="in-historic-shift-american-muslim-and-arab-voters-desert-democrats">In
historic shift, American Muslim and Arab voters desert Democrats</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In a historic shift, Muslim and Arab Americans broke with two decades
of Democratic loyalty, splitting most of their votes between
President-elect Donald Trump and third-party candidates in Tuesday’s
presidential election, according to preliminary findings of two
prominent advocacy groups.</p>
<p>The exodus, fueled by anger over the Biden administration’s handling
of the war in Gaza, helped Trump win key battleground states, especially
Michigan, as he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to win a second
term in the White House.</p>
<p>A nationwide exit poll of more than 1,300 voters by the Council on
American Islamic Relations (CAIR) found that significantly less than 50%
of Muslim voters backed Harris. That compares with an estimated 65% to
70% that reportedly voted for President Joe Biden in 2020.</p>
<p>The lion’s share of the Muslim vote went to Jill Stein, the Green
Party candidate who advocated for ending U.S. military support for
Israel, or Trump, who received the backing of several Arab and Muslim
community leaders and elected officials in Michigan.</p>
<p>A full picture of the Muslim vote is yet to emerge. The CAIR survey
was at odds with the Associated Press’s Votecast survey, which found the
vice president captured 63% of Muslim votes overall.</p>
<p>But voting patterns found by the CAIR poll marked a sharp departure
from the last 20 years during which Muslim Americans had overwhelmingly
supported the Democratic ticket, according to Robert McCaw, CAIR’s
director of government affairs.</p>
<p>“This is the first time in more than 20 years that the Muslim
community has been split between three candidates,” McCaw said in an
interview with VOA.</p>
<p>The shift in the Muslim vote echoed among Arab American voters, who
had backed Democratic presidential nominees over Republican candidates
2-to-1 for more than two decades, said James Zogby, president of the
Arab American Institute.</p>
<p>The group did not do an exit poll. But going into the election, its
polling indicated that the Arab vote would be split 42% to 41% between
Trump and Harris, and Zogby said the election result likely reflected
that chasm.</p>
<p>“Gaza took a toll and caused a great deal of dissatisfaction among
demographic groups in the community that I wouldn’t have expected to
have that degree of impact,” Zogby told VOA. “What they saw happening in
Gaza impacted them quite profoundly.”</p>
<p>An estimated 3.7 million Americans trace their heritage to Arab
countries, and a similar number is classified as Muslim Americans. Both
groups are exceedingly diverse, and not every Arab and Muslim American,
whether conservative or progressive, fits neatly into a category.</p>
<p>Strong revolt seen in Michigan</p>
<p>But the voter revolt among Arab and Muslim Americans in Michigan was
unmistakable, especially in the areas of Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, and
Hamtramck.</p>
<p>In Dearborn, where more than 55% of the residents are of Middle
Eastern descent, Trump won more than 42% of the vote, up from 30% four
years ago. Harris received just 36% from a community that gave Biden
nearly 70% of its vote.</p>
<p>In nearby Hamtramck, the first majority-Muslim city in the U.S.,
Trump picked up 43% of the vote, up from just 13% in 2020. Harris
secured just 46%, down from the 85% that Biden notched four years
ago.</p>
<p>Stein received 9% and 18% in Hamtramck and Dearborn respectively.</p>
<p>The lost Muslim and Arab votes hurt Harris’s bid to win Michigan and
its 15 electoral votes. The Muslim voting rights group Emgage estimates
there are more than 200,000 registered Muslim voters in Michigan; Trump
won the state by a margin of about 84,000 votes according to the latest
results Thursday.</p>
<p>To Samraa Luqman, a Dearborn-based real estate agent and political
activist, the shift was not a surprise.</p>
<p>Luqman, who describes herself as a left-leaning Democrat, said she
campaigned for Biden’s reelection last fall but switched sides after his
administration failed to secure a cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
<p>“I [voted for Trump] primarily to exact accountability for the
genocide, but also in hopes that it will be immediately stopped when he
enters office,” Luqman said in an interview with VOA.</p>
<p>In her own Yemeni-American family, the vote was split between Trump
and Stein, she said.</p>
<p>“The No. 1 reason was to make sure Harris loses the election,” Luqman
said.</p>
<p>Until 2000, Arab and Muslim Americans leaned Republican, voting for
George W. Bush in that year’s close election.</p>
<p>That changed after the attacks of 9/11 triggered the Bush
administration’s war on terror and unleashed a wave of Islamophobia.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, some Muslims, driven by a belief that the
Democratic Party did not represent their values, started to drift back
to the Republican Party.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza gave this segment an added incentive to vote
Republican or third party, Luqman said.</p>
<p>“It really put the nail in the coffin for the Democrats for this
election,” she said.</p>
<p>Gaza wasn’t the only pressing concern for Arab and Muslim voters.
Kitchen table issues such as jobs and inflation influenced many
votes.</p>
<p>“I think everybody that lives here, they look at the issues that
affect them here: the economy, the education system affecting the
families,” said Asm Kamal Rahman, a Bangladeshi-American community
activist in Hamtramck.</p>
<p>Rahman, a Democrat, said he voted for Trump, his first Republican
vote, mainly because of Trump’s economic plan. But like many voters
interviewed for this article, he said his family was split, with his
daughter voting for Stein.</p>
<p>Concern over illegal immigration, another top voter issue this
election, resonated with some Muslim and Arab voters.</p>
<p>“I’m sick and tired of the career politicians promoting all of the
policies that really hurt the average American, whether it be open
borders, for example, that bring in all of the drugs,” said Nagi
Almudhegi, a Dearborn data analyst, who said he voted straight
Republican.</p>
<p>In the final days of the campaign, Trump courted Michigan’s Arab and
Muslim voters, promising to end the Gaza conflict and other foreign
wars, a message that resonated with many. Last week, he traveled to
Hamtramck where Mayor Amer Ghalib, who is of Yemeni descent, had
endorsed him, sparking dissent from some city council members.</p>
<p>“His outreach didn’t go unnoticed,” said Rahman, the Bangladeshi
American activist.</p>
<p>Though Harris backed a cease-fire in Gaza and met with some community
activists early during her short campaign, she was criticized by some
for not doing enough outreach to win over Arab and Muslim voters.</p>
<p>“I think it gave an open field to Donald Trump to actually walk into
Michigan, see them directly, shake their hands and say, ‘I want you to
vote for me,’” said Zogby, a longtime member of the Democratic National
Committee.</p>
<p>Chad Haines, co-director of the Center of Muslim Experience in the
U.S. at Arizona State University, said the election divided the Muslim
American community between those who wanted to send Democrats a message
over Gaza, and others who feared a Trump return.</p>
<p>“So … one camp is happy that … the Democrats have taken, in a sense,
a hit, and another is deeply concerned about the next four years,”
Haines, a Muslim convert who voted for Harris, said in an interview.</p>

wants to claw back unspent IRA funds. That might not be easy.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Among the many promises President-elect Donald Trump laid out on the
campaign trail: clawing back unspent money from the Inflation Reduction
Act, which has poured billions into the clean energy sector. But much of
those funds is destined for red states and red counties, and the
politics of stopping the money will be tough. Also on the program: a

Climate Bulwarks Against the Next Trump Presidency​</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
As the realities of Trump’s return to office and the likelihood of a
Republican trifecta in Washington began to set in on Wednesday morning,
climate and clean energy advocates mostly did not sugarcoat the result
or look for a silver lining. But in press releases and interviews,
reactions to the news coalesced around two key ways to think about what
happens next.
</p>
<p>
Like last time Trump was elected, the onus will now fall on state and
local leaders to make progress on climate change in spite of — and
likely in direct conflict with — shifting federal priorities. Working to
their advantage, though, much <em><em>more</em></em> so than last time,
is global political and economic momentum behind the growth of clean
energy.
</p>
<p>
“No matter what Trump may say, the shift to clean energy is
unstoppable,” former White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy
said in a statement.
</p>
<p>
“This is a dark day, but despite this election result, momentum is on
our side,” Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous wrote. “The
transition away from dirty fossil fuels to affordable clean energy is
already underway.”
</p>
<p>
“States are the critical last line of defense on climate,” said Caroline
Spears, the executive director of Climate Cabinet, a group that
campaigns for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-policy-local" target="_self"><u>local
climate leaders</u></a>, during a press call on Wednesday. “I used to
work in the solar industry under the Trump administration. We still
built solar and it was on the back of great state policy.”
</p>
<p>
Reached by phone on Wednesday, the climate policy strategist Sam
Ricketts offered a blunt assessment of where things stand. “First things
first, this outcome sucks,” he said. He worried aloud about what another
four years of Trump would mean for his kids and the planet they inherit.
But Ricketts has also been here before. During Trump’s first term, he
worked for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lets-go-washington" target="_self"><u>the
“climate governor,”</u></a> Washington’s Jay Inslee, and helped further
state and local climate policy around the country for the Democratic
Governors Association. “For me, it is a familiar song,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Ricketts believes the transition to clean energy has become inevitable.
But he offered other reasons states may be in a better position to make
progress over the next four years than they were last time. There are
now 23 states with Democratic governors and at least 15 with Democratic
trifectas — compare that to 2017, when there were just 16 Democratic
governors and seven trifectas. Additionally, Democrats won key seats in
the state houses of Wisconsin and North Carolina that will break up
previous Republican supermajorities and give the Democratic governors in
those states more opportunity to make progress.
</p>
<p>
Spears also highlighted these victories during the Climate Cabinet press
call, adding that they help illustrate that the election was not a
referendum on climate policy. “We have examples of candidates who ran
forward on climate, they ran forward on clean energy, and they still won
last night in some tough toss-up districts,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Ricketts also pointed to signs that climate policy itself is popular. In
Washington, a ballot measure that would have repealed the state’s
emissions cap-and-invest policy failed. “The vote returns aren’t all in,
but that initiative has been obliterated at the ballot box by voters in
Washington State who want to continue that state’s climate progress,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
But the enduring popularity of climate policy in Democratic states is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-policy-local" target="_self"><u>not
a given</u></a>. Though the measure to overturn Washington’s
cap-and-invest law was defeated, another measure that would revoke the
state’s nation-leading policies to regulate the use of natural gas in
buildings hangs in the balance. If it passes, it will not only undo
existing policies but also hamstring state and local policymakers from
discouraging natural gas in the future. In Berkeley, California, the
birthplace of the movement to ban gas in buildings, a last-ditch effort
to preserve that policy through a tax on natural gas was rejected by
voters.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, two counties in Oregon overwhelmingly voted in favor of a
nonbinding ballot measure opposing offshore wind development. And while
2024 brought many examples of climate policy progress at the state
level, there were also some signs of states pulling back due to concerns
about cost, exemplified by New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/kathy-hochul-nyc-congestion-pricing" target="_self"><u>major
reversal</u></a> on congestion pricing in New York City.
</p>
<p>
The oft-repeated hypothesis that Republican governors and legislators
might defend President Biden’s climate policies because of the
investments flowing to red states is also about to be put to the test.
“I think that’s going to be a huge issue and question,” Barry Rabe, a
public policy professor at the University of Michigan, told me. “You
know, not only can Democrats close ranks to oppose any changes, but is
there any kind of cross-party Republican base of support?”
</p>
<p>
Josh Freed, the senior vice president for the climate and clean energy
program at Third Way, warned that the climate community has a lot of
work to do to build more public support for clean energy. He pointed to
the rise of right-wing populism around the world, driven in part by the
perception that the transition away from fossil fuels is hurting
<em><em>real</em></em> people at the expense of corporate and political
interests.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve seen, in many places, a backlash against adopting electric
vehicles,” he told me. “We’ve seen, at the local county level,
opposition to siting of renewables. People perceive a push for
eliminating natural gas from cooking or from home heating as an
infringement on their choice and as something that’s going to raise
costs, and we have to take that seriously.”
</p>
<p>
One place Freed sees potential for continued progress is in corporate
action. A lot of the momentum on clean energy is coming from the private
sector, he said, naming companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google
that have invested considerable funds in decarbonization. He doesn’t see
that changing.
</p>
<p>
A counterpoint, raised by Rabe, is those companies’ contribution to
increasing demand for electricity — which has simultaneously raised
interest in financing clean energy projects and expanding natural gas
plants.
</p>
<p>
As I was wrapping up my call with Ricketts, he acknowledged that state
and local action was no substitute for federal leadership in tackling
climate change. But he also emphasized that these are the levers we have
right now. Before signing off, he paraphrased something the writer
Rebecca Solnit
<a href="https://x.com/RebeccaSolnit/status/1854083133681045941" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted</u></a>
on social media in the wee hours of the morning after the electoral
college was called. It’s a motto that I imagine will become something of
a rallying cry for the climate movement over the next four years. “We
can’t save everything, but we can save some things, and those things are
worth saving,” Ricketts said.

China congratulate Trump as region anticipates changing US policy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — Leaders from China and Taiwan have congratulated
Donald Trump’s national election victory, despite growing uncertainty
about how his second presidential term might impact dynamics across the
Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping urged China and the United States to
find the right way to get along in the new era, to benefit ’’both
countries and the wider world.”</p>
<p>He hopes the two sides will “uphold the principles of mutual respect,
peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, strengthen dialogue and
communication, properly manage differences and expand mutually
beneficial cooperation,” according to a readout released by China’s
official Xinhua News Agency on Thursday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, who came to power in May,
said in a post on social media platform X that he is confident that the
“longstanding Taiwan-U.S. partnership, built on shared values and
interests, will continue to serve as a cornerstone for regional
stability and lead to greater prosperity.” </p>
<p>On the Chinese internet, some social media users say they expect
Trump to impose high tariffs on Chinese products but expressed mixed
views on how the looming trade war might affect the Chinese
economy. </p>
<p>In Taiwan, some Taiwanese people express concern about the U.S.
reducing their support for Taiwan under Trump’s second term due to his
comments about Taiwan during the campaign and his isolationist approach
to international affairs. </p>
<p>“Judging from his comments on Taiwan over the last few months, I
worry the U.S. won’t be so supportive of Taiwan if they want to
stabilize relations with China,” Lydia Yang, a 35-year-old marketing
professional in Taipei, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>During an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in July, Trump said
Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense and compared U.S. military
spending on Taiwan to an insurance policy.</p>
<p>“I know the people very well. Respect them greatly. They did take
100% of our chip business. I think Taiwan should pay us for defense,” he
said during the interview. </p>
<p>In addition to asking Taiwan to pay for U.S. protection, Trump also
accused Taiwan of stealing semiconductor technologies from the United
States and threatened to impose tariffs against Taiwanese semiconductor
companies.</p>
<p>“We put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in and
borrow the money and build chip companies here. They’re not going to
give us the good companies anyway,” he said during an interview with Joe
Rogan on October 25. </p>
<p>Some Taiwanese people said these comments reflect Trump’s
transactional approach to foreign policy and underline that he would
prioritize American interests once he returns to the White House next
January.</p>
<p>“When it comes to things that don’t directly benefit the U.S., I
would be worried about his approach,” Lai Ming-Wei, a 44-year-old
engineer, told VOA in a recorded interview.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has not yet responded to a VOA request for comment
regarding the president-elect’s policy toward Taiwan.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, some Taiwanese officials have tried to
reassure the public that bilateral relations between Taiwan and the
United States won’t significantly change under the second Trump
administration.</p>
<p>“On relations across the Taiwan Strait, we believe that the United
States will continue its current approach of constraining China and
being friendly to Taiwan,” Tsai Ming-yen, Director-General of Taiwan
National Security Bureau, told journalists on the sideline of Taiwan’s
parliament on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Analysts say while the basic elements of U.S.-Taiwan relations will
remain the same, Trump’s campaign comments and more isolationist foreign
policy approach could increase uncertainty for bilateral relations
between Taipei and Washington.</p>
<p>“We don’t know what version of Donald Trump we are going to see and
this kind of uncertainty doesn’t bring stability and predictability to
the Taiwan Strait,” Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National
Taiwan University, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>Other experts say Taiwan will have to take concrete actions to
convince Trump that the island is serious about boosting its defense
capabilities amid rising military pressure from China.</p>
<p>“Taiwan needs to offer something concrete, such as increasing the
defense budget, because if Taiwan fails to do so, Trump may think Taiwan
isn’t doing anything, so he doesn’t need to be too nice to Taiwan,” said
Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan,
speaking by phone to VOA.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s defense minister Wellington Koo said on Tuesday that Taipei
must show its determination to defend itself regardless of who won the
U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>“We have to let them understand that Taiwan has the determination to
defend itself, and the importance of Taiwan’s economic security and
strategic geopolitical position,” he told journalists on the sidelines
of the parliament. </p>
<p>However, some Chinese analysts say Taiwan’s attempt to deepen
military cooperation with the United States, including buying more
weapons from Washington, would be counterproductive to the stability
across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments about Taiwan paying for U.S. protection mean “he is
asking Taiwan to increase their defense spending so they can buy more
American weapons, but sending more arms to Taiwan wouldn’t help convince
China that peaceful reunification is still possible,” Zhou Bo, a senior
fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua
University in China, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about Trump’s potential policies toward Taiwan,
based on his campaign comments, some analysts say it remains to be seen
how his administration will formulate Taiwan policies.</p>
<p>“There are different voices in his camp. There are voices focusing on
the economic competition side, which is represented by Trump himself,
and there are voices talking about pulling away from Europe and focusing
more resources in Asia to compete with China, and there are voices
looking at drawing together U.S. assets, including allies, to compete
hard with China,” Ja Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National
University of Singapore, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>However, he said Taiwan should be prepared for potential
inconsistency in Trump’s approach as he tends to “cycle through
officials very quickly” during his first term in office. “That
inconsistency may create an impression that there’s an opening for
Beijing,” Chong said.</p>

id="chinas-exports-soar-past-forecast-as-factories-front-run-trump-tariff-threat">China’s
exports soar past forecast as factories front-run Trump tariff
threat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — China’s outbound shipments grew at the fastest pace in over
two years in October as factories rushed inventory to major export
markets in anticipation of further tariffs from the U.S. and the
European Union, as the threat of a two-front trade war looms.</p>
<p>With Donald Trump being elected as the next U.S. president, his
pre-election pledge to impose tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of
60% is likely to spur a shift in stocks to warehouses in China’s No.1
export market.</p>
<p>Trump’s tariff threat is rattling Chinese factory owners and
officials, with some $500 billion worth of shipments annually on the
line, while trade tensions with the EU, which last year took $466
billion worth of Chinese goods, have intensified.</p>
<p>Export momentum has been one bright spot for a struggling economy in
China as household and business confidence has been dented by a
prolonged property market debt crisis.</p>
<p>Outbound shipments from China grew 12.7% year-on-year last month,
customs data showed on Thursday, blowing past a forecast 5.2% increase
in a Reuters poll of economists and a 2.4% rise in September.</p>
<p>Imports fell 2.3%, compared with expectations for a drop of 1.5%,
turning negative for the first time in four months.</p>
<p>“We can anticipate a lot of front-loading going into the fourth
quarter, before the pressure kicks in come 2025,” said Xu Tianchen,
senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p>
<p>“I think it is mainly down to Trump. The threat is becoming more
real.”</p>
<p>China’s exports to the U.S. increased an annual 8.1% last month,
while outbound shipments to Europe jumped 12.7% over the same
period.</p>
<p>“We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months,” Zichun
Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. “Any
potential drag from Trump tariffs may not materialize until the second
half of next year.”</p>
<p>“Trump’s return could create a short-term boost to Chinese exports as
U.S. importers increase their purchases to get ahead of the tariffs,”
she added.</p>
<p>Trade data from South Korea and Taiwan pointed to cooling global
demand, while German manufacturers have also reported they are
struggling to find buyers overseas, leading analysts to conclude Chinese
producers are slashing prices to find buyers or simply moving stocks out
of China.</p>
<p>An official factory activity survey for October showed Chinese
factories were still struggling to find buyers overseas.</p>
<p>“If the PMI new export sub-index has been going down, and the export
figure goes up, I think it is safe to say it’s more of an inventory
shift,” said Dan Wang, a Chinese economist based in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Exporters also had help from a positive turn in the weather, enabling
them to send out delayed orders.</p>
<p>Typhoon Bebinca brought Shanghai to a standstill for one day in
September, causing severe disruption to one of China’s busiest ports. In
the eastern province of Jiangsu a violent tornado killed at least 10
people and several other regions suffered heavy rain and strong winds,
disrupting production.</p>
<p>Natural disasters cost China 230 billion yuan ($32.23 billion) in
direct economic losses over the third quarter, according to data from
the Ministry of Emergency Management.</p>
<p>Economists have cautioned Chinese policymakers against becoming too
reliant on outbound shipments for growth and urged officials to
introduce more stimulus.</p>
<p>Analysts are now turning their attention to a $1.4 trillion fiscal
package officials are likely to sign off on this week, which they expect
to stabilize local government and property developers’ balance sheets
and ease the strains that have weighed on consumption.</p>
<p>China’s trade surplus came in at $95.27 billion last month, up from
$81.71 billion in September.</p>

<h2 id="china-expects-bumpy-relations-with-the-us-under-trump">China
expects bumpy relations with the US under Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — Following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s
sweeping victory, Chinese netizens said they expect the U.S. to increase
trade tensions with China while analysts say Washington’s efforts to
counter China’s expansion might weaken under a second Trump
administration.</p>
<p>Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has vowed to impose
tariffs, between 60% to 200%, on Chinese products on several occasions.
During an interview with Fox News on February 4, Trump said he would
impose more than 60% tariffs on Chinese imports but emphasized he wasn’t
going to start a trade war with China.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he would tax
China at 150% to 200% if Beijing decides to “go into Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Some Chinese internet users expect Trump to follow through on the
campaign promise to impose huge tariffs on Chinese products but have
mixed views about how the tariffs will affect the Chinese economy and
their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Amid China’s ongoing economic downturn, some Chinese social media
users worry that Trump’s return to the White House could exacerbate the
economic pressure on many Chinese citizens.  </p>
<p>“It’s hard to look at Trump’s victory with pure joy, because he is
going to launch a trade war with China when he comes into power, and our
economy will suffer further,” a Chinese netizen in the capital, Beijing,
wrote on the popular microblogging site Weibo, which is similar to
X.</p>
<p>“How will the lives of normal citizens change? I’m feeling a sense of
unease about the unpredictability of the future,” the person added.</p>
<p>Others say the 60% tariff on Chinese imports to the United States
that Trump proposed during the campaign will push Chinese companies to
redirect exports from the U.S. to other markets, including Southeast
Asia, South America and Europe.</p>
<p>“Trump’s approach of being [an] enemy with the whole world may make
some left-wing regimes in Europe disappointed, and this development may
lead to a de-escalation of trade tensions between China and Europe,” Niu
Chun-bao, chairman of Shanghai Wanji Asset Management Co., posted on
Weibo.</p>
<p>Some Chinese netizens predict the immense pressure that Trump is
likely to impose on Beijing will enhance China’s domestic unity, and his
transactional approach to resolving tensions may offer more room for
negotiation and bargaining.</p>
<p>“As long as there are no major internal problems, no external
pressure can overwhelm China. So, I think the overall situation may
still be positive,” another netizen in the eastern Chinese province of
Shandong wrote on Weibo.</p>
<p>‘Significant hit’</p>
<p>While Chinese netizens hold mixed views about the potential tariffs
that Trump has vowed to impose on Chinese imports, analysts say this
move would be “a significant hit” to the Chinese economy, which has been
troubled by an ongoing property crisis, high youth unemployment and weak
domestic demand.</p>
<p>If Trump decides to impose 60% tariffs on all Chinese products
imported to the U.S., “This would be a return to a big-picture trade war
rather than a narrow tech war. And it would have a much deeper impact on
China’s export-driven growth potential because he is hitting the
entirety of China’s exports to the U.S.,” Jacob Gunter, an expert on
China’s political economy at the Mercator Institute for China Studies,
told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>In Gunter’s view, Trump may use the tariffs to force China to make
more concessions on trade. After imposing up to 25% tariffs on $200
billion of Chinese goods imported to the U.S. in 2019, the Trump
administration and China reached a trade deal that saw Beijing promise
to increase purchases of American goods to at least $200 billion.</p>
<p>“We could see a return to the deal-making Donald Trump, where he
wants to strike a deal and be viewed as this great negotiator, because
that’s who he imagines himself to be,” Gunter said, adding that it
remains to be seen how Trump might position the tariffs during his
second term.</p>
<p>Other experts say one thing to look out for is what concessions Trump
might make during a potential negotiation with China.</p>
<p>“One big question is whether Trump will soften the position the Biden
administration has maintained on Taiwan in exchange for more exports and
more U.S. investment into China,” Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist
for Asia Pacific at French investment bank Natixis, told VOA by
phone.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has not yet responded to a VOA request for comment
regarding his administration’s trade plans with China once he takes
office in January.</p>
<p>In response to potential tariffs that the incoming Trump
administration could impose, analysts say China could impose
counter-tariffs on U.S. agricultural products from states controlled by
the Republican Party.</p>
<p>“Economic and political tensions between the two countries will
inevitably rise, while the global economy and global supply chains will
be thrown into chaos,” Zhiqun Zhu, an expert on Chinese foreign policy
at Bucknell University, told VOA in a written response.</p>
<p>Weakened coordination with allies</p>
<p>While trade and economic tensions between China and the U.S. are
expected to rise during Trump’s second term, Zhu said Trump’s return to
power may also be good news for Beijing, as Washington’s efforts to
counter China’s expansion of its influence in the Indo-Pacific region
may be weakened due to Trump’s isolationist approach in international
affairs.</p>
<p>“Trump is more likely to push ahead with his agenda without
consulting allies and partners or seeking their support, and this might
be good news for China,” Zhu told VOA.</p>
<p>“China can take a ‘divide-and-conquer’ strategy to dilute the
effectiveness of Trump’s foreign policy, especially the Indo-Pacific
strategy, and we may see improvements in China’s relations with its
neighbors, particularly Japan, South Korea and India, as well as U.S.
allies in other parts of the world,” Zhu added.</p>
<p>In his view, bilateral relations between China and the U.S. will be
dominated by competition under the second Trump administration, but
there is also room for diplomacy and cooperation.</p>
<p>“Competition itself is not necessarily harmful, because if the two
countries can manage the competition in a healthy way, both sides can
benefit,” Zhu said.</p>

ordered to evacuate from Southern California wildfire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAMARILLO, California — California was lashed by powerful winds
Wednesday that fed a fast-moving wildfire, which destroyed dozens of
homes and forced thousands of residents to flee. Forecasters also warned
of the potential for “extreme and life-threatening” blazes.</p>
<p>Northwest of Los Angeles, the Mountain Fire exploded in size and
prompted evacuation orders for more than 10,000 people as it threatened
3,500 structures in suburban communities, ranches and agricultural areas
around Camarillo, according to a statement from Gov. Gavin Newsom. He
said he has requested federal assistance for the area east of the
Pacific coast city of Ventura.</p>
<p>The blaze was burning in a region that has seen some of California’s
most destructive fires over the years. A thick plume of smoke rose
hundreds of feet into the sky Wednesday, blanketing whole neighborhoods
and limiting visibility for firefighters and evacuees. The fire grew
from less than 1 square kilometer to 62 square kilometers in little more
than five hours.</p>
<p>Ventura County Fire Captain Trevor Johnson described crews racing
with their fire engines to homes threatened by the flames to save
lives.</p>
<p>“This is as intense as it gets. The hair on the back of the
firefighters’ neck I’m sure was standing up,” he said during a news
conference Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>At one spot, flames licked the burning remains of a home. Its roof
was reduced to only a few charred shingles.</p>
<p>Two people suffered apparent smoke inhalation and were taken to
hospitals, fire officials said. No firefighters reported significant
injuries.</p>
<p>The erratic winds and limited visibility grounded fixed-wing
aircraft, and gusts topped 98 kph, said weather service meteorologist
Bryan Lewis. Water-dropping helicopters were still flying.</p>
<p>First responders pleaded with residents to evacuate. Deputies made
contact with 14,000 people to urge them to leave as embers spread up to
4 kilometers away and sparked new flames.</p>
<p>“This fire is moving dangerously fast,” Ventura County Fire Chief
Dustin Gardner said.</p>
<p>Aerial footage from local television networks showed dozens of homes
in flames across several neighborhoods as embers were whipped from home
to home. Other footage captured horses trotting alongside evacuating
vehicles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile to the south, Los Angeles County Fire Department crews
scrambled to contain a wildfire near Malibu’s Broad Beach as authorities
briefly shut down the Pacific Coast Highway as flames burned near
multimillion-dollar properties. Residents were urged to shelter in place
while aircraft dropped water on the 20-hectare Broad Fire. It was 15%
contained early in the afternoon, with forward progress stopped. Fire
officials said two structures burned.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service office for the Los Angeles area amended
its red flag warning for increased fire danger with a rare “particularly
dangerous situation” label, and officials in several counties urged
residents to be on watch for fast-spreading blazes, power outages and
downed trees amid the latest round of notorious Santa Ana winds.</p>
<p>With predicted gusts between 80 kph and 160 kph and humidity levels
as low as 8%, parts of Southern California could experience conditions
ripe for “extreme and life-threatening” fire behavior into Thursday, the
weather service said.</p>
<p>Forecasters also issued red flag warnings until Thursday from
California’s central coast through the San Francisco Bay Area and into
counties to the north, where strong winds were also expected.</p>
<p>Utilities in California began powering down equipment during high
winds and extreme fire danger after a series of massive and deadly
wildfires in recent years were sparked by electrical lines and other
infrastructure. On Wednesday, more than 65,000 customers in Southern
California were without power preventatively, and upward of 20,000 in
Northern California.</p>

What will happen to the economy during Trump’s second stint in the White
House? We don’t know for sure. But his planned immigration crackdown
could cut into gross domestic product and raise prices, and his promised
high tariffs are likely to do the same. Plus: Stocks jumped after the
election was called, Biden will leave behind a vigorous economy and
firms seeking skilled labor are gonna need to educate new workers.

id="fear-joy-and-calls-for-a-strong-europe-france-reacts-to-trump-win">Fear,
joy and calls for a strong Europe: France reacts to Trump win</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PARIS — A century of straw polls at the iconic Harry’s Bar in Paris
have accurately called almost every U.S. election. This November was no
different. The tallies displayed on the bar’s window on a chilly
Wednesday morning were another reminder of Donald Trump’s decisive
victory — with uncertain consequences for France and Europe.</p>
<p>Even as some French celebrate the former president’s comeback to the
White House, others fear its repercussions and wonder whether their
country will follow the same rightward tilt in its own 2027 presidential
elections.</p>
<p>“I guess we’re disappointed but unfortunately not surprised,” said
freelance producer and Paris resident Charlotte Danglegan. “The fascist
powers are taking more and more importance, and it’s the same case in
France.”</p>
<p>Not everyone sees it that way. On social media platform X, right-wing
French politician Eric Ciotti saluted Trump’s victory as “a magnificent
victory against a system, a hope for peace and a defeat for
wokists.”</p>
<p>David Gil, a member of the far-right National Rally Party is also
pleased.</p>
<p>“For us, it’s good news,” he said. “But it’s a bit early to see what
it means for France.”</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron was an early bird in congratulating
Trump — sending his wishes to work “for more peace and prosperity,”
before the Republican’s win was officially confirmed.</p>
<p>But Macron followed that message with another on X, declaring he and
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wanted to work “for a Europe more united,
stronger, more sovereign in this new context.”</p>
<p>French government officials echoed similar themes, reflecting
Macron’s longstanding push for beefing up Europe’s military and other
defenses.</p>
<p>“We need to find ways to work on our common interests, but
fundamentally, the answer lies with us,” European Affairs Minister
Benjamin Haddad told France Inter radio.</p>
<p>Europeans, he said, “can’t accept that their security will be decided
without them, that tomorrow a capitulation will be imposed on Ukrainians
without them, without the Europeans.”</p>
<p>Cooling relations</p>
<p>Macron struck up initially cordial relations with Trump during his
first term in office, marked by the U.S. president’s visit to Paris in
2017 during Bastille Day celebrations. But ties cooled over differences
on trade, climate change and Iran. Now, there are other areas of
disagreement, including the future of Ukraine and support for NATO.</p>
<p>“It’s really time for us to wake up and do something,” said Jean-Yves
Camus, an analyst at the Jean Jaures Foundation in Paris. “Because if we
do not have the military capacity to weigh in on Ukraine and the Middle
East, then we are dependent on what Washington will do.”</p>
<p>For their part, French businesses are worried about the potential
impact of Trump’s promised tariffs on imports, which could affect
industries such as beverages and aeronautics. Still, observers say,
France is less exposed to a potential trade war than other countries,
including neighboring Germany.</p>
<p>Walking near Harry’s Bar, phone salesman Cameron Orilia said he had
not been closely following the U.S. presidential campaign.</p>
<p>“I hope things will work out for business” during Trump’s term, he
said, “that customs will work out. I’m just looking at the economic side
of the politics.”</p>
<p>Wake-up call?</p>
<p>But other Paris residents are worried about the political side.</p>
<p>“I feel a bit scared,” said Lucy Bone, a Briton who has lived in
Paris for 25 years. “I’m thinking [about] what happened to all our
democracies? We are now going to be in a world that’s driven by
dictators.”</p>
<p>As with Americans, the French are worried about high prices and
immigration — themes that catapulted Trump to victory. The hard-right
National Rally emerged on top of both of France’s European and
parliamentary elections this year. Today it holds the most seats of any
party in the lower house — although not the majority.</p>
<p>Some believe Trump’s election may set a precedent for National Rally
leader Marine Le Pen to do the same in 2027. Still, Le Pen has been
cautious in reacting to another four years under Trump, who remains
highly controversial in France.</p>
<p>“The only thing I think about is France’s interest and Europe’s
interest,” she told reporters Wednesday. Under a Trump presidency that
defends U.S. interests, “Europe has got to wake up” and do the same.</p>
<p>“Le Pen has been very, very strong in saying that National Rally
members of parliament should not support President Trump, should not
take sides in this election,” Camus said, “for fear that the bad image
of President Trump would damage her own chance of becoming
president.”</p>

id="special-counsel-considers-how-to-wind-down-2-federal-cases-against-trump">Special
counsel considers how to wind down 2 federal cases against Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Special counsel Jack Smith is evaluating how to wind
down the two U.S. federal cases against Donald Trump before he takes
office in light of longstanding Justice Department policy that says
sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted, a person familiar with the
matter said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results
of the 2020 presidential election and illegally hoarding classified
documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. But Trump’s election defeat of
Kamala Harris means that the Justice Department believes he can no
longer face prosecution in accordance with decades-old department legal
opinions meant to shield presidents from criminal charges while in
office.</p>
<p>The person familiar with Smith’s plans was not authorized to discuss
the matter by name and spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>By moving to end the cases before the inauguration in January, Smith
and the Justice Department would avert a potential showdown with Trump.
The president-elect said as recently as last month that he would fire
Smith, who was appointed in November 2022 by Attorney General Merrick
Garland, “within two seconds” of taking office.</p>
<p>NBC News first reported Smith’s plans.</p>
<p>Smith’s two cases charge Trump in a conspiracy to undo the election
results in the run-up to the Capitol riot, and with retaining top secret
records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and obstructing FBI efforts
to recover them.</p>
<p>The classified documents case has been stalled since July when a
Trump-appointed judge, Aileen Cannon, dismissed it on grounds that Smith
was illegally appointed. Smith has appealed to the Atlanta-based 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where the request is pending.</p>
<p>In the 2020 election interference case, Trump was scheduled to stand
trial in March in Washington, where more than 1,000 of his supporters
have been convicted of charges for their roles in the Capitol riot. But
the case was halted as Trump pursued his sweeping claims of immunity
from prosecution that ultimately landed before the U.S. Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>Trump could be emboldened by the Supreme Court’s ruling in July,
which granted former presidents expansive immunity from prosecution for
acts taken in the White House and explicitly put off-limits any alleged
conduct involving Trump’s discussions with the Justice Department. That
included his efforts to use the Justice Department to conduct sham
election fraud investigations as part of his bid to stay in power.</p>
<p>The conservative-majority Supreme Court sent the case back to U.S.
District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine which of the other allegations
in the indictment, if any, could move forward to trial.</p>
<p>In response, Smith’s team last month filed a 165-page brief laying
out new evidence to persuade the judge that the actions alleged in the
indictment were taken in Trump’s private capacity as a candidate — not
as commander-in-chief — and therefore can remain part of the case.
Trump’s lawyers are scheduled to file their response later this month.
Whatever Chutkan rules is expected to be appealed again to the Supreme
Court, meaning a possible trial would be likely a year or more away.</p>

Last night, Donald Trump secured a second term in the White House. He
campaigned on an aggressively pro-fossil -fuel agenda, promising to
repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s landmark 2022 climate law,
and roll back Environmental Protection Agency rules governing power
plant and car and truck pollution.

<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Jesse and Rob pick through the
results of the election and try to figure out where climate advocates go
from here. What will Trump 2.0 mean for the federal government’s climate
policy? Did climate policies notch any wins at the state level on
Tuesday night? And where should decarbonization advocates focus their
energy in the months and years to come? Shift Key is hosted by Robinson
Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a
professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>You know the real question, I guess —
and I just, I don’t have a ton of optimism here — is if there can be
some kind of bipartisan support for the idea that changing the way we
permit transmission lines is good for economic growth. It’s good for
resilience. It’s good for meeting demand from data centers and factories
and other things that we need going forward. Whether that case can be
made in a different, entirely different political context is to be seen,
but it certainly will not move forward in the same context as the
[Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024] negotiations.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>And I think there’s a broad question
here about what the Trump administration looks like in terms of its
energy agenda. We know the environmental agenda will be highly
deregulatory and interested in recarbonizing the economy, so to speak,
or at least slowing down decarbonization — very oil- and
gas-friendly.<br/> I think on the energy agenda, we can expect oil and
gas friendliness as well, obviously. But I do think, in terms of who
will be appointed to lead or nominated to lead the Department of Energy,
I think there’s a range of whether you would see a nominee who is
aggressively focused on only doing things to support oil and gas, or a
nominee who takes a more Catholic approach and is interested in all
forms of energy development. <br/> <br/> And I don’t, I don’t mean to be
… I don’t think that’s obvious. I just think that’s like a … you kind of
can see threads of that across the Republican Party. You can see some
politicians who are interested only, really, in helping fossil fuels.
You can see some politicians who are very excited, say, about
geothermal, who are excited about shoring up the grid, right? Who are
excited about carbon capture. <br/> <br/> And I think the question of
who winds up taking control of the energy portfolio in a future Trump
administration means … One thing that was true of the first Trump
administration that I don’t expect to go away this time is that the
Trump policymaking process is extremely chaotic, right? He’s surrounded
by different actors. There’s a lot of informal delegation. Things
happen, and he’s kind of involved in it, but sometimes he’s not involved
in it. He likes having this team of rivals who are constantly jockeying
for position. In some ways it’s a very imperial-type system, and I think
that will continue. <br/> <br/> One topic I’ve been paying a lot of
attention to, for instance, is nuclear. The first Trump administration
said a lot of nice things about nuclear, and they passed some
affirmatively supportive policy for the advanced nuclear industry, and
they did some nice things for small modular reactors. I think if you
look at this administration, it’s actually a little bit more of a mixed
bag for nuclear. <br/> <br/> RFK, who we know is going to be an
important figure in the administration, at least at the beginning, is
one of the biggest anti nuclear advocates there is. And his big,
crowning achievement, one of his big crowning achievements was helping
to shut down Indian Point, the large nuclear reactor in New York state.
JD Vance, Vice President-elect JD Vance, has said that shutting down
nuclear reactors is one of the dumbest things that we can do and seems
to be quite pro, we should be producing more nuclear. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>On the other hand, Tucker Carlson was on, uh
…<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer: … </strong>suggested it was demonic,
yeah.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jenkins: </strong>Exactly, and no one
understands how nuclear technology works or where it came from.<br/>
<br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>And Donald Trump has kind of said both
things. It’s just super uncertain and … it’s super uncertain.

The
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/donald-trump-2024-climate-energy" target="_self"><u>re-election
of Donald Trump</u></a> all but assures that the next four years of
climate policy will have to unfold at the local level. With a

the U.S. at odds</u></a> with its international partners now set to
return to the White House in January, the country will almost certainly
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-trump-election-win-could-add-4bn-tonnes-to-us-emissions-by-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fall
far short</u></a> of its 2030 emission reduction targets. But state and
local policies can still achieve meaningful progress on their own: On
Wednesday morning, green organizers like Climate Cabinet were
<a href="https://climatecabinet.org/news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already</u></a>
stressing that “it will now be up to state leaders to hold the line
against Trump and to ensure continued progress toward clean energy.”
</p>
<p>
Will Americans defend and advance that progress, though? The
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/election-results" target="_self"><u>results
of several climate-related ballot measures</u></a> that were put to vote
Tuesday night are giving mixed signals.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, there were a number of victories worth celebrating.
Most significantly, Washington voters
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lets-go-washington" target="_self"><u>confirmed</u></a>
their state’s cap-and-invest carbon trading program, which pumps
millions of dollars into local transit, environmental, and
decarbonization projects. Voters across the country also signed off on
creating climate- and conservation-related bonds and funds, including in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/election-results#:~:text=U.S.%20House.-,Hawaii,-Question%201%20(Honolulu" target="_self"><u>Honolulu</u></a>,
<a href="http://louisiana" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Louisiana</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.thegazette.com/campaigns-elections/30m-conservation-bond-passes-in-johnson-county/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Jefferson
County, Iowa</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-minnesota-amendment-1-extend-environmental-trust-fund.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Minnesota</u></a>,
and
(<a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/elections/2024/11/california-election-news-proposition-4-environment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>likely</u></a>)
the state of California. Local transit-related measures also, on the
whole,
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yfreemark.bsky.social/post/3labxhnsyex2g" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>had
a good night</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But there were some concerning rejections, too.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/election-results#:~:text=Measure%206%2D219%20(Coos%20County)%20and%20Measure%208%2D116%20(Curry%20County)" target="_self"><u>Two
counties</u></a> on the southern Oregon coast expressed overwhelming
(though non-binding) opposition to offshore wind development in their
region, with some 80% of voters in Curry County signaling their
objection.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/election-results#:~:text=Measure%20GG%20(Berkeley)" target="_self"><u>Two-thirds
of voters</u></a> in Berkeley, California — one of
<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Berkeley-Albany-El-Cerrito-liberal-cities-America-6699200.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
most liberal cities</u></a> in the country — also rejected what would
have been a first-in-the-nation tax on natural gas in large buildings.
In Washington,
<a href="https://www.komonews.com/news/local/initiative-2066-natural-gas-policies-measures-election-day-november-5-washington-state-building-industry-association-house-bill-1589-legislativhttps://www.komonews.com/news/local/initiative-2066-natural-gas-policies-measures-election-day-november-5-washington-state-building-industry-association-house-bill-1589-legislative-sessione-session" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>early
results</u></a> on an initiative that is still too close to call show
voters on track to approve a measure that would bar cities, towns, and
the state from “prohibiting, penalizing, or discouraging” gas appliances
in buildings — “<em><em>discouraging</em></em>” being the operative,
ill-defined, and all-encompassing word — threatening Seattle’s 2050
net-zero emissions target.
</p>
<p>
South Dakotans also rejected a bill that would have smoothed the
permitting process for a carbon dioxide pipeline that would carry CO2
from ethanol plants to an injection well in North Dakota as a means of
dealing with planet-warming emissions. Though CO2 pipelines are
controversial and have “strange politics,”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/south-dakota-carbon-pipeline" target="_self"><u>as
Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo has written</u></a>, the citizen-led backlash
was often couched in the language of opposing out-of-state interests who
were “going to make a buck from the future energy transition.”
</p>
<p>
My read of the night’s referenda and ballot measures is that voters
largely seem willing to do the passive work of supporting climate and
environmental policy (for instance by directing the use of property
taxes or reconfirming a law already in place) and <em><em>less</em></em>
willing to voluntarily take on some of the burden themselves, in the
form of hosting new development in their communities or opting into
transitions away from climate-polluting fuels. This isn’t terribly
surprising — local battles over the energy transition are common and
frequent enough that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-fight-newsletter-renewable-energy-opposition" target="_self"><u>we
have a whole weekly newsletter here at Heatmap addressing them</u></a> —
but it also suggests that there isn’t nearly enough momentum to prevent
potentially catastrophic backsliding under four more years of Trump.
</p>
<p>
There <em><em>is</em></em> good news, though. Local policy is often
nimbler and more responsive than state- or federal-level policy. It’s
also something
<a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/how-to-get-a-new-bike-lane" target="_self"><u>anyone
can get involved in</u></a>, and there is presently a wide-open
opportunity to convince Americans to embrace a clean energy economy and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/yimby-climate-laws" target="_self"><u>build
things</u></a>. The seemingly
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self"><u>total
failure</u></a> of the current administration to capitalize on the
benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, however, does mean that
climate, transit, environmental justice, decarbonization, and
conservation organizers and activists will have their work cut out for
them in the next years to come.
</p>
<p>
But it isn’t impossible, even if it is uphill sledding. As Climate
Cabinet’s Caroline Spears put it in her Wednesday morning note, “It’s
time to go back to our roots, dig deep, and rebuild our democracy and
climate progress from the local level up.”

Energy Stocks Are Down — But Not Out — After Trump’s Win</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDI4MzY1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NzYxNTY3OH0.2comipEVf0sHgtyF_Jmy1IIyE6dU3jPNAp85H9idIr8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
While many investors and analysts had anticipated a Donald Trump victory
Tuesday — Maheep Mandloi of Mizuho Securities wrote earlier this week
that stocks had “priced in” a 70% chance of Trump winning — that hasn’t
stopped markets from twitching reflexively now that he’s actually
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/donald-trump-2024-climate-energy" target="_blank">done
it</a>.
</p>
<p>
The clean energy industry, for its part, is already preparing to sell
itself to a Republican Washington. The trade group Advanced Energy
United’s president Heather O’Neill congratulated Trump in a statement
and said it was “committed to working with the Trump-Vance
Administration to meeting America’s energy challenges with advanced
energy solutions.”
</p>
<p>
But the market isn’t convinced the gambit will pay off.
</p>
<p>
The first and most obvious effect of the decisive election result is
that clean energy stocks are down. The iShares Global Clean Energy
exchange traded fund, whose biggest holdings are the solar panel company
First Solar and the Spanish utility and renewables developer Iberdola,
was down about 7% in early trading versus yesterday. The iShares U.S.
Energy ETF, meanwhile, whose largest holdings are Exxon and Chevron, is
up over 3% compared to yesterday and just over 10% on the year.
</p>
<p>
Some specific publicly traded clean energy stocks have sunk so far
today, especially residential solar companies like Sunrun, which was
down over 25% in early trading. Sunrun competitor Sunnova was also down
over 40%, while the inverter company Solaredge is down over 20%. Solar
panel company First Solar, which some analysts think could be protected
from a Trump revision of the Inflation Reduction Act due to its U.S.
manufacturing presence, is still down over 12%.
</p>
<p>
“Manufacturing credits will likely stick,” Greg Brew, an analyst at
Eurasia Group, told me. “Why touch a whole of bunch of jobs in red
districts?”
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t mean manufacturing will be unaffected. This morning FREYR,
a Norwegian battery companies, announced that it will
<a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/476984837/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/DRAFT-Project-Sol-Investor-Presentation-MASTER-FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>acquire</u></a>
the U.S. assets of Trina Solar, a Chinese solar module manufacturing
company. These include a plant in Texas that started production just
last week, according to the announcement, indicating worry that a Trump
administration could see more trade conflict with China and Chinese
companies while also trying to boost domestic manufacturing, even in the
renewables sector.
</p>
<p>
That renewables companies are falling more than fossil energy companies
are rising, however, indicates that the market is not expecting a Trump
White House to do much to improve oil and gas profitability or
production, which has actually increased in the Biden years thanks to
the spikes in energy prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine
and continued exploitation of America’s oil and gas resources through
hydraulic fracturing. And while the Biden administration attempted to
issue a formal pause on approvals of new export terminals for liquified
natural gas, a federal judge
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/01/judge-blocks-biden-lng-pause-00166157" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>blocked
that move</u></a> in July. In September, the Department of Energy
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/lng/090324-us-doe-grants-lng-export-permit-for-altamira-lng-first-since-permitting-pause" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>approved
exports for a terminal on the Mexican Gulf Coast</u></a> using American
gas.
</p>
<p>
“He’s going to come in and say ‘drill baby drill,’” Brew said of Trump.
He will also likely increase leasing on federal land and toss the ban on
new facilities for liquefied natural gas exports. But the overall effect
may be limited. “I don’t think the Biden administration did anything to
get in the way of exploration and production investment” for the fossil
fuel sector, Brew said.
</p>
<p>
Cheniere Energy and Energy Transfer, two companies with existing or
planned LNG terminals, did see their shares rise a touch in morning
trading. Companies that operate oil refineries have also gotten a nice
boost today. Phillips 66 and Valero shares are up 4.5% and 5%,
respectively, as the market is anticipating an overhaul of Environmental
Protection Agency mileage standards designed to accelerate the
transition to electric vehicles. “Anything on mileage standards and/or
EV credit reduction is likely positive for duration of refining as it
pushes out the EV adoption curve,” the investment bank Jefferies wrote
in a note to clients.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the wind energy industry has long been the target of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-trump-could-do-to-offshore-wind" target="_self"><u>specific
ire</u></a> from Trump and is taking a hit Wednesday. U.S.-traded shares
of Vestas, the Danish turbine manufacturer, are down almost 15% and have
hit their lowest point this year. GE Vernova, meanwhile, the GE energy
spinoff that makes both wind turbines and the turbines that go into
natural gas power plants (as well as electrical equipment) is up over
3%. Unlike pure-play green energy companies, GE Vernova is positioned to
profit from any increase in electricity demand, whether served by
renewables or fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
And of course, there’s the most valuable green technology company in the
world, one that manufactures electric vehicles and batteries (and
robots). In early trading, Tesla stock is up over 13%, bringing it to
its highest price per share — $285 — since September 2022.
</p>
<p>
Renewables companies are at risk from both changes in tax policy as well
as the potential for Trump’s tax cut and spending plans to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates-energy" target="_self"><u>keep
interest rates high</u></a>. While the market is focused on the
prospects of new legislation and regulation in Washington, renewables
companies may be looking just as warily at the Federal Reserve, which
will announce an interest rate decision on Thursday. The market expects
the federal funds rate to fall another 0.25 percentage points, following
the half-point
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates-energy" target="_self"><u>mega-rate
cut</u></a> in September. What happens after that is anyone’s guess.

leaders congratulate Trump but wonder if he can end Middle East wars as
promised</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>AMMAN, JORDAN — Arab leaders quickly congratulated Donald Trump on
his U.S. presidential election victory. Some are hopeful he could bring
an end to conflicts raging in the Middle East while others are looking
for a stronger stance against Iran.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,
United Arab Emirates leaders, and Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad,
all congratulated Donald Trump on his win, saying strengthening
strategic partnerships is important.</p>
<p>Dania Koleilat Khatib, president of the Research Center for
Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, told VOA that during the
election, Trump emphasized personal ties with such leaders compared to
what she called Biden’s more transactional approach.</p>
<p>Khatib said Arab leaders want Trump to end war in Gaza and
Lebanon.</p>
<p>“One of his main campaign promises was to end the war in Gaza. But
end it how? Would it end with a Palestinian state? We don’t know,” she
said. “The thing that is worrying is [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin]
Netanyahu attacking Iran. This will be major. Handling Iran will not be
easy for Trump.”</p>
<p>Bin Salman has reiterated that his country would not consider
improving ties with Israel unless the Gaza war ended and a Palestinian
state is established.</p>
<p>Wealthy Gulf states have bolstered ties with Iran and given the
Islamic Republic assurances that they won’t allow Israel to use their
airspace to facilitate attacks on Iran.</p>
<p>In its response to the elections, Iran played down the results,
saying it was ready for confrontation with Israel.</p>
<p>Jordan’s King Abdullah, Egypt’s Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Lebanon’s
caretaker Prime Minister Najib Makati, who are involved in trying to
negotiate an end to the raging conflicts, also congratulated Trump.</p>
<p>Analyst Osama Al Sharif in Amman said he believes Trump will pressure
Netanyahu to end the conflicts before the presidential inauguration next
year.</p>
<p>“He will boldly tell Netanyahu … to wrap things up before the 20th of
January because those two wars, especially Gaza, have become so toxic
and they have become part of the [President Joe] Biden stigma, which was
also eventually inflicted on [Vice President Kamala] Harris,” he
said.</p>
<p>“Trump doesn’t need to start his first day at the office with more
news of children getting killed and hospitals being blown up.”</p>
<p>Al Sharif told VOA that Iran will be a big challenge for Trump, who
he says is an “isolationist who wants to extract America from any
conflict.” He predicted Trump may tighten sanctions on Iran.</p>
<p>“More sanctions,” he said. “He may be able to communicate with Tehran
through [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, who is now a very close ally
of the Iranians. That remains to be seen.”</p>
<p>Al Sharif, however, expressed concern that Trump might recognize
Israel’s annexation of most of the West Bank under Israel’s current hard
right government, which he said “would complicate things dramatically”
for the Palestinians and Jordan.</p>

Country’s Biggest CO2 Pipeline Was Just Dealt a Huge Setback</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDIzMTI2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4OTc4NjQwOH0.FDWecnTDCi9lh4tdoAUiHZ3AoEj-2bPyRedvn2jyO9A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
South Dakota voters have
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-south-dakota-referred-law-21-regulation-for-pipeline-companies.html" target="_blank">rejected</a>
a ballot measure that would have eased the permitting process for a
highly contentious carbon dioxide pipeline. The planned $8 billion
project, developed by Summit Carbon Solutions, would carry CO2 captured
from ethanol plants to sequestration wells in neighboring North Dakota.
But if the company had been banking on legislative relief for its siting
challenges, it will have to figure out a new plan to move forward.
</p>
<p>
Referred Law 21, as the measure was called, was a citizen-led veto
referendum on a bill that passed the South Dakota legislature and was
signed by the governor in March. The bill would have preempted all local
land use regulations and ordinances related to the siting of carbon
dioxide pipelines and other transmission infrastructure, including power
lines. Full authority to permit these projects would have been handed to
the state’s utility commission, an elected three-member body that
regulates utilities.
</p>
<p>
Summit Carbon Solutions is trying to build what would be the largest
pipeline designed to carry carbon dioxide in the United States. From a
climate perspective, putting debates on land use and local control
aside, the calculus of the project is complicated.
</p>
<p>
Ethanol refineries are ripe for carbon capture — they emit a very pure
stream of CO2 that is technologically easy to capture, and it’s better
that it be buried underground than dumped in the atmosphere. But the
long term prospects for ethanol in a low-carbon future are murky at
best, and investing $8 billion in carbon capture and pipeline
infrastructure could help justify its continued use over other,
potentially better solutions. Though it’s clear electric cars will
eventually crowd out ethanol from the passenger vehicle fuel market,
some advocate for the industry to pivot to aviation fuel.
</p>
<p>
The pipeline faces opposition throughout the Midwest from a diverse
coalition of stakeholders, including landowners in the pipeline’s path,
environmental groups like the Sierra Club that oppose carbon capture in
general, and Republican legislators who question the project’s merits on
the grounds that climate change is merely a “hypothesis.” Though CO2
pipelines generally have a good track record for safety, a
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/21/1172679786/carbon-capture-carbon-dioxide-pipeline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high-profile
rupture in Mississippi in 2020</u></a>, which sent 45 people to the
hospital, has also amplified concerns.
</p>
<p>
At least five municipalities in South Dakota have passed rules governing
the siting of the pipeline, Chase Jensen, a senior organizer for the
environmental nonprofit Dakota Rural Action told me on a call last week.
For example, Minnehaha County, the home of Sioux Falls, adopted setback
rules last year that require pipelines to be laid 330 feet away from
residential areas, businesses, and churches. An ordinance in Lincoln
County requires 1,855 feet, and prohibits construction on sites of
historical or archeological significance.
</p>
<p>
“Everybody who’s going to make a buck from the future energy transition
is licking their chops at this,” Jensen said of Referred Law 21, which
would have preempted these ordinances. “It’s a lot easier to just make
campaign donations to three public utility commissioners than the
300-plus county commissioners across the state.”
</p>
<p>
The bill signed into law in March was
<a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/2024/03/06/legislature-passes-attempted-balance-between-landowners-and-carbon-pipeline-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>painted
as a compromise</u></a>. Though it weakened local control, it gave
counties the ability to charge pipeline companies a tax of $1 per linear
foot of pipe installed. It also included a so-called “Landowner Bill of
Rights” that enshrined certain protections like ensuring the pipeline’s
developer is liable for damages caused by the project, and designating a
minimum depth at which the pipeline must be buried.
</p>
<p>
But Jensen and
<a href="https://www.sdpropertyrightslocalcontrol.com/faqs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>others
who opposed</u></a> argued it didn’t offer landowners anything new —
some of its provisions are already afforded by South Dakota law, and
others had already been negotiated with Summit Carbon Solutions. Jensen
pointed out that the utility commission already has the ability to
override local ordinances if it finds them to be overly restrictive.
</p>
<p>
Now, with control over pipeline siting back squarely in the hands of
local authorities, the future of the Summit project in South Dakota is
unclear. The utility commission already rejected the company’s initial
application for construction permits last year; Summit has since altered
its route and reapplied.
</p>
<p>
Martin Lockman, a climate law fellow at Columbia Law School, told me it
was difficult to take away a clear message from the fight, in part
because CO2 pipelines have strange politics. Coalitions for and against
them don’t break down over party lines or traditional groups like
environmentalists versus fossil fuel companies. Some climate advocates,
as well as experts in the U.S. Department of Energy, say we’ll need to
build many thousands of miles of new carbon pipelines in order to help
us sequester carbon captured from industrial facilities and from the
atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
The specific arguments over the Summit project may not apply to projects
proposed elsewhere, Lockman told me, but its fate could still have
ripple effects. “Any kind of high profile failure might make investors a
little bit more leery to participate in this kind of project,” he said.

<p>
The Federal Reserve meets today and tomorrow to determine the future
path of interest rates. The central bank is designed to do its work
insulated from politicians, and its independence from political
pressures is a cornerstone of monetary policy. But a second presidency
of Donald Trump could bring that independence into question. We’ll hear
more. We’ll also discuss the connections between Trump, interest rates
and the deficit.

id="republicans-take-control-of-us-senate-in-tuesday-voting">Republicans
take control of US Senate in Tuesday voting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the U.S. Senate, said the
incoming Senate Republican majority would be an important guardrail for
the country.</p>
<p>“It’s a good day for the GOP [Republican Party],” McConnell told
reporters Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Republican party won back a majority in the Senate with at least
51 of 100 seats in Tuesday’s election. Control of the House of
Representatives, which is currently held by Republicans, was not yet
decided early Wednesday.</p>
<p>All 435 seats in the House of Representatives were at stake in
elections throughout the United States for new two-year terms, while 34
of the 100 seats in the Senate were contested for new six-year
terms.</p>
<p>Before Election Day, Democrats had narrow control of the Senate and
Republicans of the House. Key Republican victories for Senate seats in
West Virginia and Ohio put them in position to be back in the
majority.</p>
<p>In the House, Republicans held a 220-212 edge, with three vacant
seats going into the election. Control of that chamber has not been
confirmed yet. Control of the House may not be known for several days,
as California has often taken days to count ballots, and recounts and
runoffs of close races can take weeks to resolve.</p>
<p>Political surveys throughout the election campaign have shown voters
— much like in the Kamala Harris-Donald Trump race for the White House —
evenly divided in their political preference for congressional
control.</p>
<p>An October Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 43% of registered voters
would back the Republican House candidate in their district, while 43%
would back the Democratic candidate.</p>
<p>A Republican majority in the U.S. Senate could jeopardize any future
U.S. aid packages to Ukraine to aid its fight against Russia.</p>
<p>McConnell, who has often been at odds with his own party in support
of that aid, reiterated its importance on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“It may seem old-fashioned to some, but I’m still a Reagan Republican
who thinks that America’s role in the world is absolutely indispensable,
even if you’re concerned about cost.”</p>

<h2>
THE TOP FIVE
</h2>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Donald Trump wins 2024 presidential election
</h3>
<p>
Donald Trump has won the 2024 presidential election. Votes are still
being tallied, but he has so far taken the swing states of Pennsylvania,
Georgia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. At the time of publishing, he
had secured 277 electoral college votes to Vice President Kamala Harris’
224. Republicans also took control of the Senate, but the status of the
House of Representatives remains unclear.
</p>
<p>
The energy and environmental implications of a Trump victory are
profound,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/donald-trump-2024-climate-energy?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--Sdk-WuSHEUY5gFJRtmkHCwsxsLovgLnEhbJR1TCUAgWxAhfN8cRrgo6AV5Y6DMGXb92cz" rel="noopener" target="_self">writes
Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. He is likely to pull the United States out
of the Paris Agreement, approve a new tranche of liquified natural gas
export terminals, and block and then begin to roll back the
Environmental Protection Agency’s climate rules for power plants, cars,
and light-duty trucks. “Not all of these rollbacks will make themselves
felt at first,” Meyer writes. “The current set of EPA clean car rules,
for instance, apply to vehicles sold through model year 2026. That is
close enough to the present that automakers have already begun to make
the necessary investments to meet those standards. But vehicles sold in
the latter half of this decade will likely face much weaker rules or
none at all.” He may also try to repeal or otherwise hinder the
Inflation Reduction Act, which would set the country and world back in
the fight against climate change. But it would also significantly raise
taxes on energy companies (and automakers) while hurting Trump’s own
voters, as the IRA’s hundreds of billions in investments, which are
largely tax credits, have overwhelmingly flowed to Republican districts.
</p>
<p>
“For every step back that Trump takes on climate policy, China will step
forward and take more of a global leadership role,” Meyer writes. “As
Trump’s White House steers American climate policy for the rest of the
2020s, they will not just be deciding what direction the U.S. will go in
— they will be acting with, or against, the rest of the world.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Environmental groups react to Trump win
</h3>
<p>
Reactions to Trump’s victory are trickling in from climate organizations
and analysts. Here are a few:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
“There is no denying that another Trump presidency will stall national
efforts to tackle the climate crisis and protect the environment, but
most U.S. state, local, and private sector leaders are fully committed
to charging ahead. And you can count on a chorus of world leaders
confirming that they won’t turn their back on climate and nature goals.”

Lashof, U.S. Director of the World Resources Institute</a>.
</li>
<li>
“This is a dark day, but despite this election result, momentum is on
our side. The transition away from dirty fossil fuels to affordable
clean energy is already underway. Trump can’t change the reality that an
overwhelming majority of Americans want more clean energy, not more
fossil fuels. Through investments in the Inflation Reduction Act we are
creating millions of new clean energy jobs. Clean energy is already
cheaper in most cases than dirty fossil fuels, and wind and solar now
generate more power in the U.S. than coal.”

tabs on</a> 36 of the most important climate elections, from seats in
the House and Senate down to local ballot measures and attorneys
general. Here’s where some of those stand so far:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans</strong> won re-election in
Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District. Kiggans, the vice chair of the
Conservative Climate Caucus and a Trump ally, backed the Default on
America Act to repeal clean energy tax credits and has flip-flopped on
her support of offshore wind.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Democrat Attorney General Josh Stein</strong> won the election
for governor in North Carolina. He had proposed a path to reach carbon
neutrality in the state by 2050 and has a history of taking on polluters
and Big Oil price gougers. His Republican opponent had called climate
change “junk science” and said he’d attempt to block history and science
from being taught in the first through fifth grades.
</li>
<li>
<strong>In Ohio’s Senate race</strong>, MAGA Republican Bernie Moreno
has flipped the seat of three-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Moreno
has stressed that “we need natural gas, we need oil” rather than “this
move toward windmills, solar panels.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>The race for Pennsylvania’s Senate seat remains a
toss-up</strong> between Democratic incumbent Bob Casey, Jr. and
Republican David McCormick. Few Senate races this year have touched on
climate and energy issues as much as this one, in the country’s
second-largest natural gas-producing state.
</li>
<li>
<strong>In New Mexico, Democrat Rep. Vasquez managed to fend off a
challenge from Republican Yvette Herrell</strong> to hold on to the
state’s 2nd congressional district. The district includes a large swath
of the oil-rich Permian Basin, and Vasquez had walked the line between
promoting wind and solar manufacturing as part of the IRA while also
“looking out for those fossil fuel communities.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Republican Austin Knudsen will remain Montana’s attorney
general</strong>, beating Democratic challenger Ben Alke. Knudsen leads
the state’s case against the 16 young plaintiffs in <em>Held v.
Montana</em>, who are suing lawmakers for allegedly violating their
right to a “clean and healthful environment” as enshrined in the state’s
constitution.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the Republican-backed effort to repeal Washington state’s
new cap and invest program failed; voters in Berkeley rejected a ballot
measure that would have functionally reinstated the city’s
first-in-the-nation prohibition against gas hookups in new buildings;
and California looks likely to pass Proposition 4, which authorizes $10
billion in bonds for water quality, coastal resilience projects,
wildfire prevention, and climate-risk protections.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Trump victory puts Elon Musk in the spotlight
</h3>
<p>
Donald Trump has ascended to the White House with the assistance of a
strange coalition, which includes Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is supposedly
going to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency. In his
victory speech, Trump

a verse to Musk. “A star is born: Elon,” Trump said, praising Musk’s
efforts on the campaign trail, his “beautiful” rockets, and Starlink.
“The future is gonna be fantastic,” Musk

“Musk has said that repealing the IRA could benefit Tesla by kneecapping
its competitors. Yet much of Tesla’s profit comes from selling
regulatory credits created by California and the federal government’s
climate policies. If Trump repeals those policies, what will happen to
Tesla’s profitability?”

it hit a sweltering 81 degrees Fahrenheit (it was also the city’s
hottest November day on record). It also hit a record 81 degrees in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which has not seen rain since October 6, and a
record 78 degrees in Columbus, Ohio. In Hartford, Connecticut, the
mercury likewise reached 78 degrees, tying the previous Nov. 5 record
set in 2022. New York City and Washington, D.C., meanwhile, experienced
their warmest Election Days since President Franklin D. Roosevelt
defeated the Republican governor of Kansas, Alf Landon. It was the

Value of Caregivers to Veterans’ Health, Wellness, and Recovery</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, updated: 2024-11-06, from: RAND blog</p>
<p>More than 14 million Americans are caring for a service member or
veteran. They provide services worth billions of dollars every year,
often at tremendous financial and emotional costs to themselves. They
need better access to mental health care, compensation, and other
support.</p>

weight loss drug dupes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The diabetes drug giant Novo
Nordisk is reassuring investors with big sales numbers for its popular
weight loss drug, Wegovy. But there are concerns over the production of
unofficial copies of its drugs, which have been linked to
hospitalizations and deaths. And in Nigeria, millions have been without
electricity for more than a week following technical problems with the
country’s power grid. We hear about the impact from businesses.

id="abortion-rights-advocates-win-in-7-states-and-clear-way-to-overturn-missouri-ban-but-lose-in-3">Abortion
rights advocates win in 7 states and clear way to overturn Missouri ban
but lose in 3</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Voters in Missouri cleared the way to undo one of the
nation’s most restrictive abortion bans in one of seven victories for
abortion rights advocates, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota
defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place. </p>
<p>Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland
and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they’ll need
to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans
discrimination on the basis of “pregnancy outcomes” prevailed in New
York. </p>
<p>The results include firsts for the abortion landscape, which
underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned
Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and
cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled
states. </p>
<p>They also came in the same election that Republican Donald Trump won
the presidency. Among his inconsistent positions on abortion has been an
insistence that it’s an issue best left to the states. Still, the
president can have a major impact on abortion policy through executive
action. </p>
<p>In the meantime, Missouri is positioned to be the first state where a
vote will undo a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with an
amendment that would allow lawmakers to restrict abortions only past the
point of a fetus’ viability — usually considered after 21 weeks,
although there’s no exact defined time frame. </p>
<p>But the ban, and other restrictive laws, are not automatically
repealed. Advocates now have to ask courts to overturn laws to square
with the new amendment. </p>
<p>“Today, Missourians made history and sent a clear message: decisions
around pregnancy, including abortion, birth control, and miscarriage
care are personal and private and should be left up to patients and
their families, not politicians,” Rachel Sweet, campaign manager of
Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Roughly half of Missouri’s voters said abortion should be legal in
all or most cases, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 2,200
of the state’s voters. But only about 1 in 10 said abortion should be
illegal in all cases; nearly 4 in 10 said abortion should be illegal in
most cases. </p>
<p>Bans remain in place in three states after votes </p>
<p>Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota became the first states since Roe
was overturned where abortion opponents prevailed on a ballot measure.
Most voters supported the Florida measure, but it fell short of the
required 60% to pass constitutional amendments in the state. Most states
require a simple majority. </p>
<p>The result was a political win for Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican
with a national profile, who had steered state GOP funds to the cause.
His administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the
measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it
to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial
supporting it. </p>
<p>Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the national anti-abortion group
SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the result is “a
momentous victory for life in Florida and for our entire country,”
praising DeSantis for leading the charge against the measure. </p>
<p>The defeat makes permanent a shift in the Southern abortion landscape
that began when the state’s six-week ban took effect in May. That
removed Florida as a destination for abortion for many women from nearby
states with deeper bans and also led to far more women from the state
traveling to obtain abortion. The nearest states with looser
restrictions are North Carolina and Virginia — hundreds of miles
away. </p>
<p>“The reality is because of Florida’s constitution a minority of
Florida voters have decided Amendment 4 will not be adopted,” said
Lauren Brenzel, campaign director for the Yes on 4 Campaign said while
wiping away tears. “The reality is a majority of Floridians just voted
to end Florida’s abortion ban.” </p>
<p>In South Dakota, another state with a ban on abortion throughout
pregnancy with some exceptions, the defeat of an abortion measure was
more decisive. It would have allowed some regulations related to the
health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most
national abortion-rights groups did not support it. </p>
<p>Voters in Nebraska adopted a measure that allows more abortion
restrictions and enshrines the state’s current 12-week ban and rejected
a competing measure that would have ensured abortion rights. </p>
<p>Other states guaranteed abortion rights </p>
<p>Arizona’s amendment will mean replacing the current law that bans
abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. The new measure ensures
abortion access until viability. A ballot measure there gained momentum
after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could
enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined
with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced. </p>
<p>In Maryland, the abortion rights amendment is a legal change that
won’t make an immediate difference to abortion access in a state that
already allows it. </p>
<p>It’s a similar situation in Missouri, where abortion is already legal
until viability. </p>
<p>The Colorado measure exceeded the 55% of support required to pass.
Besides enshrining access, it also undoes an earlier amendment that
barred using state and local government funding for abortion, opening
the possibility of state Medicaid and government employee insurance
plans covering care. </p>
<p>A New York equal rights law that abortion rights group say will
bolster abortion rights also passed. It doesn’t contain the word
“abortion” but rather bans discrimination on the basis of “pregnancy
outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.” Sasha Ahuja,
campaign director of New Yorkers for Equal Rights, called the result “a
monumental victory for all New Yorkers” and a vote against opponents who
she says used misleading parental rights and anti-trans messages to
thwart the measure. </p>
<p>The results end a win streak for abortion-rights advocates </p>
<p>Until Tuesday, abortion rights advocates had prevailed on all seven
measures that have appeared on statewide ballots since the fall of
Roe. </p>
<p>The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this
year. Their opponents’ efforts are focused on portraying the amendments
as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral. </p>
<p>Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy,
with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about
six weeks of pregnancy — before women often realize they’re pregnant.
Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen
slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized
efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans
have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents
of the states with bans. </p>
<p>The issue is resonating with voters. About one-fourth said abortion
policy was the single most important factor for their vote, according to
AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide.
Close to half said it was an important factor, but not the most
important. Just over 1 in 10 said it was a minor factor. </p>
<p>The outcomes of ballot initiatives that sought to overturn strict
abortion bans in Florida and Missouri were very important to a majority
of voters in the states. More than half of Florida voters identified the
result of the amendment as very important, while roughly 6 in 10 of
Missouri’s voters said the same, the survey found.</p>

<h2 id="trump-wins-us-presidential-election">Trump wins US presidential
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump defeated Vice President Kamala
Harris to earn a new four-year term as the country’s leader.</p>
<p>In a tightly contested race, Trump secured at least 277 of the 538
available electoral votes in Tuesday’s election, giving him the
necessary majority to become the first U.S. leader to win
non-consecutive terms since the 1890s.</p>
<p>Harris, the Democratic candidate who joined the race late after
President Joe Biden dropped out in July, was trying to become the first
woman elected to the U.S. presidency.</p>
<p>Trump claimed victory early Wednesday as he thanked his supporters at
a rally in Florida.</p>
<p>“This was a movement like nobody’s ever seen before, and, frankly,
this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,” Trump
said.</p>
<p>He pledged to “fix our borders” and “fix everything in our
country.”</p>
<p>Trump also said he would work to deliver a “strong, safe and
prosperous America.”</p>
<p>A Harris campaign official told a crowd of her supporters in
Washington that she would not address the gathering overnight but would
speak later Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the U.S. system, where the presidential election is tallied in a
series of state-by-state contests, both Harris and Trump were quickly
declared winners in states where their parties enjoy clear majority
support, while the nation focused on roughly seven so-called
battleground states that were expected to tip the balance in the
direction of the winner.</p>
<p>Ultimately it was Trump’s victories in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North
Carolina and Wisconsin that gave him the advantage.</p>
<p>Republican success Tuesday extended to Congress, where the party won
back a majority in the Senate with at least 51 of 100 seats. Control of
the House of Representatives, which is currently held by Republicans,
was not yet decided early Wednesday.</p>
<p>Trump served from 2017-2021 but left office after losing to Biden in
an election that Trump continued to falsely assert that he won. That
denial helped fuel the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a
mob of his supporters who disrupted the official tallying of the 2020
election results.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies also launched numerous legal challenges after
the 2020 vote, with state and federal judges eventually dismissing more
than 50 lawsuits.</p>
<p>Since leaving office, Trump was convicted of 34 charges linked to
hush money payments he made to an adult film actress in the lead-up to
the 2016 election. Sentencing in that case is scheduled for November 26.
Trump was also indicted in three other cases, including two accusing him
of trying to illegally overturn the 2020 election and another alleging
he took hundreds of highly secret national security documents to his
Florida home.</p>
<p>Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated for a new term on January
20.</p>
<p>A key foreign policy focus in a new Trump administration will be
relations between the United States and China, including subjects such
as trade, Taiwan and China’s actions in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Trump instituted a series of tariffs against Chinese imports amid a
trade war with China during his previous administration.</p>
<p>Vincent Wang, dean of the college of arts and sciences at Adelphi
University, told VOA Mandarin that China would be less likely to take an
aggressive stance than it would have been if Harris won.</p>
<p>“If Trump is elected, I think China may not dare, because he doesn’t
go through drafts, he has already said harsh words. If he wakes up
today, he might say he’s going to raise tariffs by 200 percent. If he
wakes up tomorrow, he might want to bomb Beijing. So I think this
so-called this Trump-type deterrent, on the contrary, will make them a
little bit more restrained,” Wang said Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="world-leaders-congratulate-trump-on-election-win">World leaders
congratulate Trump on election win</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — World leaders offered congratulations to Donald
Trump after news media projections showed he secured a decisive victory
in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>Trump defeated his Democratic rival Kamala Harris, marking a
historical political comeback for the former Republican president
following four years out of office.</p>
<p>Early Wednesday, many world leaders took to the social media website
X to congratulate Trump, whose unpredictable “America First” foreign
policy approach complicated relations with many U.S. allies and foes
alike during his first term in office.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first U.S.
allies to send a message of support, praising Trump’s “historic return,”
which he said offers a “powerful recommitment to the great alliance
between Israel and America.”</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has called for more U.S.
and Western support to fight off Russia’s invasion, spoke positively of
what he said was Trump’s commitment to ‘peace through strength’ in world
affairs.</p>
<p>“This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace
in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action
together,” said Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>The head of NATO — the Western military alliance that Trump has long
criticized for not doing enough to take care of Europe’s defense — made
similar comments in his congratulatory message for Trump.</p>
<p>“His leadership will again be key to keeping our Alliance strong. I
look forward to working with him again to advance peace through strength
through #NATO,” said Mark Rutte, the NATO Secretary General.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also quickly offered
congratulations, saying he is “ready to work together as we did for four
years…with your conviction and mine.”</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government stands
“shoulder to shoulder” in defense of shared values of freedom, democracy
and enterprise.</p>
<p>“From growth and security to innovation and tech, I know that the
UK-US special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the
Atlantic for years to come,” Starmer said.</p>
<p>Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, said she
“warmly congratulate[s]” Trump and praised the “true partnership”
between the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p>During Trump’s first term, friction erupted between the EU and the
U.S., partly over Trump’s imposition of tariffs on European exports.</p>
<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, a conservative Trump ally,
called Trump’s victory the “biggest comeback in US political history”
and said it was a “much needed victory” for the world.  </p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has not commented on the U.S.
election results. But on X, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
relished the apparent defeat of Harris, saying “Kamala is finished…let
her keep cackling infectiously.”</p>
<p>Asian leaders also began sending congratulatory messages.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, “Australians and
Americans are great friends and true allies.”</p>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered the “heartiest
congratulations” to Trump, who he called his friend.</p>
<p>“As you build on your successes of the previous term, I look forward
to reviewing our collaboration to further strengthen” the U.S.-India
relationship, Modi said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. expressed
hope that the “unshakeable alliance” between Washington and Manila,
“will be a force of good that will blaze a path of prosperity and amity,
in the region, and in both sides of the Pacific.”</p>

<p>
As the election odds swung sharply towards Republican Donald Trump as
Tuesday evening slid into Wednesday morning, climate-conscious
investors, academics, strategists, and other internet personalities were
mostly mute. It was a night to stare blankly at the TV, watch the needle
slowly tilt to the right, and vaguely wonder about the future of the
climate.
</p>
<p>
That is, unless you were
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/elon-musk-trump" target="_blank">Elon
Musk</a>, Trump’s latest, closest campaign confidant, in which case
fist-pumping posts abounded. Well before any polls had closed, Musk
posted on X about supposedly “record numbers” of men turning out to vote
for Trump. While we can’t confirm that’s true, it set a vibe for the
evening to come.

Around 2:30 a.m. ET, Trump took the stage at the convention in West Palm
Beach where his supporters had gathered and declared victory in the
race. By then
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-vs-harris-us-voters-head-polls-turbulent-campaign-concludes-2024-11-05/" target="_blank">some</a>,
though certainly not all networks had called the election in Trump’s
favor. He devoted a verse of his rambling, genial speech to Musk. “A
star is born: Elon,” Trump said in his victory speech, praising Musk’s
efforts on the campaign trail, his “beautiful” rockets, and Starlink,
which Trump apparently hadn’t heard of before Hurricane Helene.
</p>
<p>
Musk, for his part, seems psyched about the prospect of playing a role
in the Trump administration. “The future is gonna be fantastic,” he
<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854048115206078507" target="_blank">said</a>,
as the electoral votes crept closer to 270. Though climate tech investor
Kristin Ellis of Lowercarbon Capital did have one extra bit of
perspective to add:

Won. Now the Fight Over the Clean Energy Economy Begins.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDIzMTI3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNTU3MzU5N30.uxB61jSj4XA2vt-uxJjj0jw4N3eN82idAq54pcvvgPk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As of early Wednesday morning, Donald Trump seems likely to be
re-elected president of the United States, becoming the first commander
in chief since Grover Cleveland to serve non-consecutive terms.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s probable victory has profound implications for America’s
economy, security, and leadership in the world. But it will also impact
the country’s energy and environmental policy.
</p>
<p>
During his first term, Trump made his antipathy for climate policy into
a centerpiece of his politics, turning the United States into a global
pariah on environmental issues. His second term will play out in a
different context — one in which the United States has a real climate
law on its books, but also where China has seized a commanding lead in
many of the most important zero-carbon technologies. That means Trump’s
climate decisions will matter to the country’s economic policy in a way
that they never did before.
</p>
<p>
But what will a Trump administration look like? To begin with: Trump’s
victory will put climate advocates — and the broader clean energy
economy — on defense for the next four years and beyond.
</p>
<p>
The first few steps taken by the Trump administration are easy to
predict. He will pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, just
like he did during the first term; he will approve a new tranche of
liquified natural gas export terminals; and he will block and then begin
to roll back the Environmental Protection Agency’s climate rules for
power plants, cars, and light-duty trucks.
</p>
<p>
Not all of these rollbacks will make themselves felt at first. The
current set of EPA clean car rules, for instance, apply to vehicles sold
through model year 2026. That is close enough to the present that
automakers have already begun to make the necessary investments to meet
those standards. But vehicles sold in the latter half of this decade
will likely face much weaker rules or none at all.
</p>
<p>
Then the bigger climate policy questions will come. First up is whether
Trump tries to repeal or otherwise hinder the Inflation Reduction Act,
the landmark climate incentives law passed by President Joe Biden. Trump
has said that he wants to
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/28/trump-climate-law-ira-pullback" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>“terminate”</u></a>
IRA spending, telling the Economic Club of New York that he seeks to
“rescind all unspent funds” under the law.
</p>
<p>
That would — as Trump hopes — set the country and world back in the
fight against climate change. But it would also significantly raise
taxes on energy companies (and automakers) while hurting Trump’s own
voters. The IRA’s hundreds of billions in investments, which are largely
tax credits, have overwhelmingly flowed to Republican districts.
According to
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/climate-bill-biden-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
</u><u><em><em>Washington Post</em></em></u><u> analysis</u></a>,
districts that backed Trump in 2020 have received three times as much
IRA funding as those that supported Biden. New factories making EVs,
batteries, and solar panels have popped up across purple and red
America, including in Georgia, Arizona, and the Sun Belt. That’s why 18
House Republicans have
<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4815990-mike-johnson-ira-clean-energy-tax-credits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked</u></a>
Mike Johnson directly not to repeal the law. If Democrats ultimately win
the House of Representatives — we will probably not know for some weeks
— then Trump will lack the votes to repeal the law outright.
</p>
<p>
That’s the theory behind the IRA, at least. The climate law, like the
Affordable Care Act before it, is meant to protect itself from repeal by
tying itself to local economies across the country. Will that theory
hold? Will the climate law survive Trump’s first 100 days? Now we will
find out.
</p>
<p>
Even if the law itself stands, Trump may seek other ways to tamper with
it. By saying that he might “rescind the [IRA’s] unspent funds,” he is
raising the specter of impoundment, the name for when the president
delays or refuses to spend funding that Congress has authorized.
Impoundment is
<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S3-3-7/ALDE_00013376/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>of
dubious legality</u></a>, and it is regulated by
<a href="https://democrats-budget.house.gov/resources/reports/impoundment-control-act-1974-what-it-why-does-it-matter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
1974 law</u></a> first passed to rein in Richard Nixon, but Trump might
nonetheless try to pause some IRA payments for a time. The first
impeachment case against him in 2019 concerned his impoundment of
defense funding for Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the IRA, though, there are a number of lurking fissures in a
second Trump administration’s climate and environmental policy. Trump
has ascended to the White House with the assistance of a strange
coalition. It includes Elon Musk, an EV and defense contracting
billionaire, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., an environmental lawyer turned
anti-vaccine crusader and
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5063939/rfk-jr-central-park-bear-bicycle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>roadkill
enthusiast</u></a>. Trump has promised to put Kennedy in charge of
public health policy, and Musk is supposedly going to oversee a new
Department of Government Efficiency.
</p>
<p>
These men agree on some policies. But they do not agree on everything,
including in the realm of energy policy. Even during his victory speech,
Trump jokingly warned Kennedy to “stay away from the liquid gold,”
referencing domestic oil production.
</p>
<p>
Kennedy is also a lifelong opponent of nuclear energy, and one of his
greatest career victories is shutting down New York’s nuclear reactor
Indian Point. Musk
<a href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-3812/elon-musk-shutting-down-nuclear-plants-is-total-madness/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>champions</u></a>
nuclear energy and has said shuttering reactors is “total madness.” The
likely next vice president, JD Vance,
also<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jd-vance-joe-rogan_n_6723e7f7e4b0871068fea5de" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>
tacitly supports</u></a> nuclear. But Trump, who
<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/29/us-news/trump-vows-to-make-electricity-cheap-with-hundreds-of-new-power-plants-and-modular-nuclear-reactors/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
officially called</u></a> for the U.S. to build more nuclear reactors,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-cites-cost-and-risks-of-building-more-nuclear-plants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
sounded more skeptical</u></a> of nuclear energy lately.
</p>
<p>
Other fault lines risk dividing this cohort. Kennedy has
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/07/05/pollution-vaccine-theory-trans-people-mainstream" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>campaigned</u></a>
against the chemical industry. Will he back the buildout of refineries
and chemical plants that Trump has promised? Elon Musk has said that
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/elon-musk-climate-law-repeal-could-help-tesla/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>repealing
the IRA</u></a> could benefit Tesla by kneecapping its competitors. Yet
much of Tesla’s profit
<a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-ev-sales-credits-growing-c362771f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>comes
from selling regulatory credits</u></a> created by California and the
federal government’s climate policies. If Trump repeals those policies,
what will happen to Tesla’s profitability? (Will Musk care?)
</p>
<p>
The backdrop to these disagreements will be the now forever altered
geopolitics for climate policy. Eight years ago, when Trump first took
office, climate policy was seen as fundamentally limited to the
environment — and clean energy was an important but up-and-coming,
almost wholesome niche pursuit that Democrats doted upon. Now the stuff
of clean energy — renewables, batteries, and EVs — are central to modern
economic development and to geopolitics.
</p>
<p>
China shows why that is. For every step back that Trump takes on climate
policy, China will step forward and take more of a global leadership
role. Indeed,
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-perspective-on-the-us-withdrawal-from-the-paris-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>partly
because of Trump’s own policies</u></a>, China has taken a commanding
lead in zero-carbon technologies over the past decade. In particular it
now
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self"><u>dominates</u></a>
electric vehicle production, producing cheaper and technologically
superior models to anything available elsewhere in the world. If America
ends its support for EVs, then China will happily take what global
market share remains from U.S. automakers — in fact,
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/101424-chinas-ev-sales-output-hit-fresh-record-in-sep" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>it
is already doing so</u></a>. As Trump’s White House steers American
climate policy for the rest of the 2020s, they will not just be deciding
what direction the U.S. will go in — they will be acting with, or
against, the rest of the world.

Navy contractor behind one of the military’s biggest scandals sentenced
to 15 years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO — Former military defense contractor Leonard “Fat Leonard”
Francis was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison for masterminding a
decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S. Navy officers,
federal prosecutors said.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Janis L. Sammartino also ordered Francis to pay
$20 million in restitution to the Navy and a $150,000 fine, according to
a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. He was also ordered to
forfeit $35 million in “ill-gotten proceeds from his crimes,” the
statement said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the sentence resulted from Francis’ first guilty
plea in 2015 concerning bribery and fraud, his extensive cooperation
with the government since then and another guilty plea Tuesday for
failing to appear for his original sentencing hearing in 2022.</p>
<p>Shortly before he was due to be sentenced in September 2022, Francis
cut off a GPS monitor he was wearing while under house arrest and fled
the country. He was later arrested in Venezuela and brought back to the
U.S. in December 2023.</p>
<p>Sammartino sentenced him to more than 13 1/2 years for the bribery
and fraud charges, plus 16 months for failing to appear. The sentences
are to be served consecutively.</p>
<p>“Leonard Francis lined his pockets with taxpayer dollars while
undermining the integrity of U.S. Naval forces,” U.S. Attorney Tara
McGrath said in Tuesday’s statement. “The impact of his deceit and
manipulation will be long felt, but justice has been served today.”</p>
<p>Email and phone messages seeking comment were left Tuesday for
William Douglas Sprague, an attorney for Francis.</p>
<p>Sprague, who sought a sentence of just under nine years, argued that
his client’s cooperation should warrant a lesser sentence, 10 News San
Diego reported.</p>
<p>Sprague also said Francis’ company provided the Navy with exemplary
services for many years.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, as Leonard acknowledged in his early guilty plea and
immediate cooperation, his greed drove him to commit bribery and to
commit fraud,” Sprague said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Francis’ actions led to one of the biggest bribery
investigations in U.S. military history, which resulted in the
conviction and sentencing of nearly two dozen Navy officials, defense
contractors and others on various fraud and corruption charges.</p>
<p>An enigmatic figure who was 6-foot-3 and weighed 350 pounds at one
time, Francis owned and operated his family’s ship-servicing business,
Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. or GDMA, which supplied
food, water and fuel to vessels. The Malaysian defense contractor was a
key contact for U.S. Navy ships at ports across Asia for more than two
decades. During that time, Francis wooed naval officers with Kobe beef,
expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels
from Thailand to the Philippines.</p>
<p>In exchange, officers, including the first active-duty admiral to be
convicted of a federal crime, concealed the scheme in which Francis
would overcharge for supplying ships or charge for fake services at
ports he controlled in Southeast Asia. The officers passed him
classified information and even went so far as redirecting military
vessels to ports that were lucrative for his Singapore-based ship
servicing company.</p>
<p>In a federal sting, Francis was lured to San Diego on false pretenses
and arrested at a hotel in September 2013. He pleaded guilty in 2015,
admitting that he had offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy
officials, defense contractors and others. Prosecutors say he bilked the
Navy out of at least $35 million. As part of his plea deal, he
cooperated with the investigation leading to the Navy convictions. He
faced up to 25 years in prison.</p>
<p>While awaiting sentencing, Francis was hospitalized and treated for
renal cancer and other medical issues. After leaving the hospital, he
was allowed to stay out of jail at a rental home, on house arrest with a
GPS ankle monitor and security guards.</p>
<p>But three weeks before his scheduled sentencing in September 2022, he
snipped off his monitor and made a brazen escape, setting off an
international search. Officials said he fled to Mexico, made his way to
Cuba and eventually got to Venezuela.</p>
<p>He was arrested more than two weeks after his disappearance — caught
before he boarded a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport
outside Caracas. Venezuelan officials said he intended to reach
Russia.</p>
<p>The cases were handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in an effort to
be independent of the military justice system. But they have came under
scrutiny.</p>
<p>The felony convictions of four former Navy officers were vacated
following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Sammartino agreed to
allow them to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $100 fine
each.</p>
<p>Last year, Sammartino ruled that the lead federal prosecutor in the
officers’ case committed “flagrant misconduct” by withholding
information from defense lawyers, but that it was not enough to dismiss
the case.</p>

Today we’re talking about a breakout story of this election cycle: the
rise of prediction markets and betting on elections. For the first time
in a century, Americans can legally place bets on election outcomes
using a platform called Kalshi. But the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission warns that these markets could warp the public’s
understanding of our elections if they’re treated like polls. On this
Election Day episode, Cantrell Dumas of Better Markets, a financial
reform advocacy group, explains how Americans are dabbling in election
betting, the legal questions surrounding these prediction markets, and
why he believes manipulation of these markets has the potential to sway
elections.

<h2 id="voa-talks-with-us-presidential-3rd-party-candidates">VOA talks
with US presidential 3rd party candidates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have
spent the past few months battling for the White House, and experts say
that votes for third party candidates could be a deciding factor for who
will become the next president of the United States.  </p>
<p>With the latest polls showing Harris and Trump in a dead heat in
battleground states around the country, ballots cast for third-party
candidates Jill Stein of the Green Party, independent Cornel West and
Libertarian Chase Oliver could be enough to tip the scales.  </p>
<p>VOA Persian spoke with all three of them. Their responses have been
edited for length and clarity.  </p>
<p>Green Party candidate Jill Stein </p>
<p>VOA: During one of his final campaign rallies in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, former President Donald Trump praised you, saying he loved
the Green Party and that you might be one of his favorite politicians.
What do you make of this?  </p>
<p>Jill Stein: I make of that about as much as I make of Donald Trump’s
assessment of climate change, which is that he sort of believes the
opposite of reality. I am in this race to provide an alternative to the
two parties that are bought and paid for, that are serving Wall Street
and the war contractors and definitely not the American people. So I
don’t have a lot of high regard for Donald Trump’s political strategies
or his values.  </p>
<p>VOA: How much support do you expect to receive in battleground states
like Michigan? There were some polls that suggested you have support of
over 40% of the Arab American population there.  </p>
<p>Stein: Exactly what the numbers will turn out to be, it depends how
many people are turning out to vote. It depends how strong the vote of
the, not only the Muslim population, but also many African Americans and
Hispanics and young people who feel like they do not have a future under
Kamala Harris, and they do not have a future under Donald Trump. At this
point, it’s too soon to say. We ourselves do not strictly work based on
polls. We’re really in this based on principle and for the long haul. We
would be delighted if we make the 5% cut in the national poll in the
national results, but it’s very hard to say at this point.  </p>
<p>VOA: What would be your position regarding the government of Iran?
 </p>
<p>Stein: I think we need to open the door to negotiations with Iran.
Iran has elected a new president who is said to be moderate and
interested in improving relations with the West, and we need to explore
that. I think the most critical thing in the Middle East right now is
resolving this expanding war and the intention of Bibi [Prime Minister
Benjamin] Netanyahu to create a wider war and drag the U.S. into it. I
think that is the greatest threat to peace in the Middle East right now
and has the potential to grow into a conflict that’s even bigger than
the Middle East. </p>
<p>Independent candidate Cornel West </p>
<p>VOA: How many states allowed you to have your name on the ballot and
why did others not?    </p>
<p>Cornel West: We’ve got 16 states where we have direct ballot access.
We have 24 states where we have write-in access, and that did require
petitions and signatures. So that required a lot of work on behalf of
magnificent volunteers. But it was very difficult. There’s been a
tremendous struggle, but we come up swinging.  </p>
<p>VOA: How different will your policy be compared to what we hear from
Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump?  </p>
<p>West: Martin Luther King [Jr.] said, militarism, racism, poverty and
materialism are the four forces that are sucking the democratic energy
out of the American social experiment. I take very seriously his
critique of militarism. I see that as a criticism of American foreign
policies in which we are so eager to create these lethal armed forces
rather than engage in wise diplomatic processes. And so there would be
no genocide. I would have had an embargo on any kind of military or
financial support of Israel as it was very clear that they were laying
bare this kind of massive massacre on innocent people, especially
innocent children and women and men.  </p>
<p>The same would be true in terms of being able to bring an end to the
war in Ukraine. Same would be true in terms of trying to be more
diplomatic with China. I see Kamala Harris as a militarist, Black woman.
That is to say she’s willing to not just provoke, but to push [Russian
President Vladimir] Putin. And I think Putin himself is still very much
a gangster and a war criminal in his own way, but he has a right —
Russia has a right to security. And the same is true with China. There’s
too much provocation, and I think that moves us toward World War III in
the same way that Trump moves us towards Civil War II at home. And that
was one reason why I wanted to provide some kind of alternative to Trump
and [U.S. President Joe] Biden.</p>
<p>And then when Biden had his LBJ moment [referring to Biden’s poor
debate performance] something that we talked about many, many months
ago, we just predicted that Harris now is following through on the same
militarism in Gaza. And of course, genocide, the crime of genocide, is a
litmus test of morality of any nation, any country, and if you deny it,
if you enable it, it’s a sign that you don’t have a moral fiber in your
military policy.  </p>
<p>VOA: Many people in the occupied West Bank are disturbed by Tehran’s
support for militants in Gaza. How do you see this considering the moral
aspects of your vision, your doctrine and your policy?    </p>
<p>West: Malcolm X used to say, I’m for truth, no matter who’s for it,
and justice, no matter who supports it. People can actually support just
movements for motivations that themselves are highly suspicious. When
the French supported the American revolutionaries, when Lafayette came
to the United States, it was partly because the French were over against
the British in Europe, they didn’t have a whole lot of solidarity with
these colonists responding against the British Empire. … The Soviet
Union supported the freedom struggles in Africa. It wasn’t always
because they just love Africans so much. It was anti-United States. They
had a Cold War going on, and their policies were strategic and tactical
in that way. The same would be true for Iran vis-a-vis Palestinians.</p>
<p>So I think we have to be very truthful about the ways in which the
motives might not always be attractive, but when you’re a people like
Palestinians this moment, whose backs are against the wall, they need
help from anybody, and it’s very important that people highlight their
plight so that their babies are not crushed. But that doesn’t mean that
those who are supporting them always have the right motives, and
therefore we can still be critical of what those motives are.  </p>
<p>Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver </p>
<p>VOA: In your platform, you mentioned that Libertarians seek the
United States at peace with the world. How different will your foreign
policy be?</p>
<p>Chase Oliver: It would be a drastic difference than what the status
quo has been, certainly since I’ve been an adult. Since I’ve been an
adult, let’s just call it the post-9/11 War on Terror kind of foreign
policy mindset that we’ve had, which I think is rooted in ideas that are
very black and white. You’re either with us or you’re with the
terrorists.</p>
<p>The best way to solve a problem is through a preemptive war or
through increasing our military presence in the region, to flex our
muscle. And what I think that has done is actually created further
instability, particularly in the Middle East, which I don’t think has
been a success despite the trillions of dollars we’ve spent in both Iraq
and Afghanistan. I don’t think you can say either of those nations are
particularly bastions of democracy, or that the region itself is now
more stable than it was.</p>
<p>And so for me, I would say let’s remove our military footprint and
start flexing our diplomatic muscle. Let’s start meeting with world
leaders directly, one on one. Let’s start forming coalitions around
peaceful ideas and free trade and voluntary exchange to tear down
barriers between our nations so that we can have cultural exchanges with
one another. I think these are the ideas that we really need to be
pushing, and not a militarized foreign policy that’s ruined the idea
that the United States must be the world’s enforcer.   </p>
<p>VOA: So you don’t see America as the leader of the free world with
its responsibilities?    </p>
<p>Oliver: I absolutely see America as a leader in terms of the markets
of the world, the economic engine of the world, the diplomatic arm of
the world. But it doesn’t need to be coming, using the military might of
the world. Teddy Roosevelt said, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.”
We have a very powerful military that can defend ourselves, and
ultimately, if there were a need and if Congress declared a war, fight a
war anywhere in the world with absolute certainty that we could dominate
our opponent. But you don’t flex your muscle like that around the world.
That’s not a position of strength. When you use that military might to
push your agenda, that’s actually a position of weakness, because good
ideas should not require force, and you should be able to diplomatically
work throughout the world.</p>
<p>And I recognize the world is not perfect. The world does not lack
violence. The world is not lacking for bad people, particularly
governments around the world who represent good people. And Iran is no
different. The government of Iran is abhorrent. They’re abusive to their
people. They curtail their rights. But the people of Iran are good,
innocent people who don’t deserve to have things like airstrikes and
missiles raining down upon them because of the evils of their
government. And I hope that ultimately, we can liberalize the world more
towards more liberalized things like free speech, freedom of movement
and freedom of religion. But that’s not going to come just from us
beating people down. </p>
<p>VOA: How difficult is it to run as a third-party candidate?    </p>
<p>Oliver: Running as an alternative party candidate has a lot of
challenges because the two mainstream parties have a lot of built-in
incumbency power, both in the number of elected officials they have as
well as things like taxpayer-funded primaries. So they basically take
taxes out of my wallet to fund primaries that help promote the
candidates that are Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>And as a Libertarian, we’re kind of left in the lurch there. So
there’s a lot of challenges, especially around things like ballot
access. There’s a lot of solutions. And actually a big part of my
platform is a thing called the voter bill of rights that will open up
this process, not just for Libertarians like myself, but all sorts of
other alternative parties that really need to have their voices
heard.</p>

Back-to-back Hurricanes Helene and Milton caused billions in damage. How
are insurers going to pay for it all? Turns out, insurance companies
have their own insurance. But as disasters get more severe and more
frequent, “reinsurance” isn’t covering what it used to. Also in this

become a lithium extraction hotspot, and small businesses seem hesitant

Army soldier injured while working on Gaza pier has died</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A U.S. Army soldier who was injured in May while working
on the American-built pier to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza has
died. </p>
<p>Sargeant Quandarius Stanley, 23, was a motor transport operator and
was critically injured when high winds and heavy seas damaged the pier,
causing four Army vessels to become beached. Two other service members
also were injured but later returned to duty. </p>
<p>U.S. military officials have not provided details on how exactly
Stanley was injured but have noted it was not in combat. He died last
Thursday and had been assigned to the 7th Transportation Brigade
Expeditionary at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia. </p>
<p>“Sergeant Quandarius Stanley was an instrumental and well respected
first-line leader in the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary (TBX),
especially during the mission to provide humanitarian assistance to the
people of Gaza. We will continue to provide support to his family during
this difficult time,” said Colonel John “Eddie” Gray, brigade commander.
“Our entire unit mourns alongside his family.” </p>
<p>Captain Shkeila Milford-Glover, spokesperson for the 3rd
Expeditionary Sustainment Command, said Stanley had recently retired and
was receiving treatment in a long-term care medical center. </p>
<p>The massive pier project was hampered by unexpected bad weather and
security issues, as well as persistent safety issues involving Israeli
forces that prompted aid agencies to halt distribution of the supplies
out of fear of being injured and killed. </p>
<p>The Defense Department formally pulled the pier from the Gaza shore
on June 28 and declared an end in mid-July to the mission to bring aid
into the territory besieged by the war between Israel and Hamas. </p>
<p>The military moved nearly 20 million pounds of aid onto the Gaza
shore in what officials said was the “largest volume of humanitarian
assistance” ever delivered into the Middle East. </p>
<p>But aid agencies had difficulty moving the food brought ashore to
areas farther into Gaza where it was needed most because humanitarian
convoys came under attack.</p>

<h2 id="migrant-caravan-of-3000-heads-north-in-mexico">Migrant caravan
of 3,000 heads north in Mexico</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A caravan of approximately 3,000 migrants set off on Tuesday from
southern Mexico, headed toward the United States on the day when U.S.
voters were deciding between U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris
and Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Immigration has been a key issue in the U.S. election campaign.</p>
<p>Before heading northward, the migrants gathered in Tapachula, the
capital of the southern Chiapas state, carrying banners with messages
such as “NO MORE MIGRANT BLOOD” and images of the Virgin of Guadalupe,
an important religious and cultural symbol in Mexico, according to
Reuters witnesses.</p>
<p>“We want U.S. authorities to see us, to see that we are people who
want to work, not to harm anyone,” said Honduran migrant Roy Murillo,
who joined the caravan with his two children and his pregnant wife.</p>
<p>In recent years, several caravans with people hoping to enter the
United States have attempted to reach the U.S.-Mexican border, traveling
in mass groups for safety. Most have dispersed along the way.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid to travel alone with my family. Here, the cartels either
kidnap you or kill you. … That’s why we’re coming in the caravan,”
Murillo said.</p>
<p>Murillo recounted his unsuccessful attempts to secure an asylum
appointment through a mobile app developed by the U.S. Customs and
Border Protection agency.</p>
<p>Tapachula, a mandatory crossing point for tens of thousands of
migrants, has become one of Mexico’s most violent cities in recent
months, with migrants frequently targeted by organized crime, according
to official data.</p>
<p>“I feel suffocated here. That’s why we decided to leave,” said
28-year-old Venezuelan migrant Thais, who spoke on condition that her
surname not be used due to safety concerns.</p>
<p>She joined the caravan with her husband and 3-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>“I wish Mr. Trump and Ms. Kamala would see that we are human beings,
that we want to live and support our families,” she added.</p>
<p>Voters cast ballots on Tuesday in the race between Vice President
Harris, a Democrat seeking to become the first female U.S. president,
and Trump, a Republican immigration hard-liner aiming to regain the
presidency.</p>

Department of Agriculture bans school lunch fees for low-income
families</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible
for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees
beginning in 2027.</p>
<p>School districts currently work with processing companies to offer
cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge
“processing fees” for each transaction. By law, students who are
eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents
for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however,
families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies
charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a
recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>
<p>For families with lower incomes who can’t afford to load large sums
in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently,
increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or
reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for
school lunches electronically, according to the report.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department’s new policy becomes effective starting in
the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for
families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which
equals $57,720 for a family of four.</p>
<p>“USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing
schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and
thrive,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday.
“While today’s action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income
households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable
path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at
no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal
so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full
potential.”</p>
<p>The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online
school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School
lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year,
according to the report.</p>
<p>The USDA has mandated since 2017 that school districts inform
families of their options, but even when parents are aware, having to
pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.</p>
<p>“It’s just massively inconvenient,” said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at
Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two
school-aged children.</p>
<p>Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the
$3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch accounts, she and her husband
decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.</p>
<p>“A dollar here and there, I expected,” she said. “But $3.25 per
transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of
living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.”</p>
<p>Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both
time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks
to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school
lunches, which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at
any point.</p>
<p>In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S.,
the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment
processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of
$2.37, or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a
child’s account.</p>
<p>While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate
fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that
complex company structures “may insulate companies from competition and
make school districts less likely to negotiate.” Just three companies —
MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe and LINQ Connect — dominate the market,
according to the report.</p>
<p>Without the ability to choose which company to work with, “families
have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,” the agency said, “including
those that may violate federal consumer protection law.”</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
American voters have chosen Donald Trump as their next president —
again. The decision will have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/donald-trump-2024-climate-energy">monumental
consequences</a> for the renewables transition, energy prices, and
environmental issues. But it was not the only race of this election
cycle.
</p>
<p>
Heatmap has been keeping tabs on 36 of the most important climate
elections, from seats in the House and Senate down to local ballot
measures and attorneys general. Though this is far from an exhaustive
list of races that will touch the climate this year, we hope it’ll help
you piece together how and where climate-related issues are resonating
with voters around the country.
</p>
<p>
A few notes on how this list is organized:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We’ve listed races by state according to when polls close, and within
each state, from the highest-level offices to the lowest, including
local referenda.
</li>
<li>
All incumbents are identified with an *.
</li>
<li>
Race status comes from state Boards of Elections and national trackers
like <em><em>The Associated Press</em></em> and <em><em>The New York
Times </em></em>to verify the winner in each race.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some key races remain undecided as of Thursday morning. While
Republicans took control of the Senate, the House is still up for grabs.

North Carolina Attorney General Stein has won the election for governor.
The state suffered one of the costliest storms in U.S. history earlier
this year due to the flooding from Hurricane Helene, which drew
attention to the divide between the two candidates who’d been running
for the state’s highest office. Republican Mark Robinson called climate

Causey nearly twice over</a>. While insurance commissioner isn’t the
sexiest race, the election drew outsized attention in part because of
Nationwide’s decision not to renew thousands of homeowner policies in
eastern North Carolina in 2023 due to climate change, and the
devastating flooding earlier this year from Hurricane Helene.

MAGA Republican Bernie Moreno has flipped the seat of three-term

60% of Coos County voters registered their feelings against the
development of offshore wind projects, while nearly 80% of Curry County

Californians have approved a proposition that will issue $10 billion in

<a href="https://alamedacountyca.gov/rovresults/252/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Over
two-thirds</a> of voters in Berkeley rejected a ballot measure backed by
climate and labor groups that would have authorized a tax of $2.9647 per
therm of natural gas in large buildings, with the funds going toward
decarbonization programs. The ballot measure had been an attempt to
functionally reinstate the city’s first-in-the-nation prohibition
against gas hookups in new buildings, which a federal appeals court
struck down last spring. Supporters of Measure GG had raised almost
$72,000 by the end of September, while the no campaign — backed by real
estate groups that said the tax was prohibitively expensive for small
businesses, nonprofits, schools, and grocery stores — had raised
$131,000 at the end of September.

from automotive marketing research firm AutoPacific suggests political
affiliation is becoming a smaller factor in Americans’ decision making
process around whether to buy an electric vehicle. So far, most EV
adopters lean Democratic. But as EVs become more common, AutoPacific’s
survey suggests the political gap is shrinking. Among people who
identify as “future EV acceptors” – those who say they’ll consider
buying an EV in the future – 46% are Democrat, 28% are Republican, and
24% are independent or third party. That’s a narrower gap than exists
among current EV owners (54% of whom are Democrats and 30% are
Republicans). “When it comes to EV rejection, politics do play a small

wood could be surprisingly suitable for space flight: Without exposure

<p>
Stocks index futures are pointing to modestly higher markets this
Election Day morning. The 10-year interest rate is steady today but is
the highest it’s been since late July. We’ll be keeping an eye on
currency markets, too. Then, new companies are coming to the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. And later, some of Hollywood’s biggest stars are
coming to Broadway for limited runs. But how long does a show have to
stay open to make money?

<h2 id="the-climate-stakes-of-this-election">The Climate Stakes of This
Election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDE0MTA2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDY1MDA4NX0.tSz4fs9zbP4wtePyA0LWEcRxxM4IDxGFaEzfbPK75Hs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When Joe Biden was still running for reelection to the presidency, he
often repeated the line that voters should keep him in the White House
to
“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/01/20/us/biden-2024-president-election-news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>finish
the job</u></a>.” Though she would be loath to describe her mission that
way, that is more or less what Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris,
has proposed since she took on the nomination — or perhaps more
precisely, that she will keep doing the job, though the job may never be
finished.
</p>
<p>
Donald Trump, on the other hand, wants to quit the job, burn down the
workplace, and steamroll the rubble. At least, that’s how it can appear
on some issues, climate change perhaps more than any other. There are
few policy areas where this election presents such a stark difference in
which path the candidates propose to take.
</p>
<p>
Let’s begin by considering Harris — a fairly ordinary Democrat when it
comes to climate, in that she has committed herself to strong climate
action but has not put it at the top of her policy agenda. Her truncated
presidential campaign reflected that emphasis, which might have given
climate activists some reason to be disappointed if what they were
looking for was someone who would place their issue at the center of her
campaign. Unlike abortion and economics, climate was absent from Harris’
TV ads and usually mentioned only in passing on the stump.
</p>
<p>
But by now, most advocates are savvy enough to understand that
campaigning and governing are not the same thing. The commitments a
president makes during the campaign matter, but structural factors
matter more as the policymaking process unfolds. Where is the center of
gravity in their party on the issue, and what demands will the party’s
coalition make? Who are the personnel staffing key agencies, and what
are their priorities? How do existing laws and programs position the
administration if there is no new legislation? What other forces are
trying to move climate policy in either direction?
</p>
<p>
Taking all those factors into consideration, the most likely outcome of
a Harris presidency is that her administration would maintain the
trajectory Joe Biden established (even if there is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-policy-harris-walz" target="_self"><u>plenty
of room</u></a> for her to expand on Biden’s climate accomplishments).
Subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law will keep flowing. More
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/loan-programs-office" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>loans</u></a>
will bolster innovative green tech. Many of the Biden administration
appointees who currently work on energy and climate will probably stay
in their jobs, or at the very least be replaced by officials with a
similar outlook.
</p>
<p>
In other words, while Biden has been the most aggressive president in
history on climate change, Harris would come in a close second if she
does little more than continue Biden’s policies. And she hasn’t promised
much more than that — during the campaign, Harris proposed no new
large-scale climate initiatives.
</p>
<p>
If nothing else, that was realistic, since the prospects for a sweeping
new climate bill on the scale of the IRA getting through Congress would
be slight. That’s especially true if one or both houses are controlled
by Republicans, a distinct possibility no matter who becomes president.
</p>
<p>
If that president is Donald Trump, on the other hand,
<em><em>and</em></em> Republicans control Congress, the IRA and other
laws that fund climate programs would be under threat. Even if the GOP
does have full control, however, it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/old-school-politics-ira" target="_self"><u>doesn’t
mean</u></a> the entire IRA is headed for repeal. Much of the money from
recent climate legislation has gone to districts represented by
Republicans, who will resist a wholesale dismantling of the law, and
even oil companies
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9adc51ff-34f4-4aa2-b41b-5ebcbd7fd8cd?_hsmi=332210142" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support</u></a>
some provisions from a simple desire to minimize regulatory uncertainty.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, a Congress determined to roll back Biden-era climate
legislation will have plenty of targets to aim at, and it’s a near
certainty that at least some of the provisions in the bills Biden signed
would be undone. Trump would almost certainly withdraw again from the
Paris climate agreement (Biden recommitted to it after Trump rejected it
in his first term), move to increase fossil fuel production on federal
land, stymie enforcement of environmental laws, and be a loud and
consistent voice for rejecting climate science and increasing emissions.
</p>
<p>
On the campaign trail, Trump continues to promise that he will
“terminate the Green New Scam” and
<a href="https://x.com/Video_Grabz/status/1852641794665972064" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claims</u></a>
that global warming is a myth “because we’re actually cooling.”
Increasing domestic fossil fuel production is so important to him that
he
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hannity-dictator-authoritarian-presidential-election-f27e7e9d7c13fabbe3ae7dd7f1235c72" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proclaimed
it</u></a> reason enough, along with border security, for him to become
“a dictator” for a day upon taking office. On that first day, he has
said, “I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill.”
</p>
<p>
But it’s more than the quantity of drilling, especially since America is
<a href="https://theconversation.com/under-both-trump-and-biden-harris-us-oil-and-gas-production-surged-to-record-highs-despite-very-different-energy-goals-236859" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already
producing</u></a> more oil and gas than any country ever has. Earlier
this year, Trump
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a>
oil executives they should raise $1 billion for him, which, given the
tax and regulatory benefits he plans to bestow on them, would be a
bargain. While fossil fuel industry contributions haven’t reached that
billion-dollar line, the industry’s help for Trump has been
<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus?ind=E01" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>substantial</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In a Trump administration, most of the action would be in federal
agencies. As <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/climate-skeptics-are-hatching-big-plans-for-a-second-trump-term/ar-AA1tnYF7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently
reported</u></a>, climate deniers with ties to Trump are “laying the
groundwork to bring back coal-fired power plants, gut science at the
Environmental Protection Agency and neuter the modeling used in the
federal government’s national climate assessment and other reports”
should he win. Though Trump has sought to distance himself from Project
2025, it provides the most detailed elaboration of current Republican
thinking on climate policy; among other things, it
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/climate/republicans-climate-project2025.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggests</u></a>
rolling back green subsidies, shuttering the Department of Energy office
distributing loans for clean technology, scaling back regulations meant
to limit emissions, and weakening enforcement of environmental laws.
</p>
<p>
The most critical goal of the project, which Trump
<a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/10/30/trump-schedule-f-plan-federal-worker-fears/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>embraces</u></a>
wholeheartedly, is to turn thousands of civil servants into political
appointees so they can be fired at will and replaced with more loyal
cronies. Those who work on climate-related issues, whether scientists or
administrators or
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/sep/26/jared-moskowitz/what-does-project-2025-say-about-the-national-weat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>weather
forecasters</u></a>, would probably be high on the list.
</p>
<p>
And we can’t ignore a factor that will help shape climate policy no
matter who wins: the Supreme Court. When it has been discussed during
this campaign, the subject has usually been the 2022
<em><em>Dobbs</em></em> decision to overturn <em><em>Roe v.
Wade</em></em>. But the court’s recent decisions on the legal
architecture of government regulation could have an effect just as
momentous for climate policy as <em><em>Dobbs</em></em> has had on
abortion.
</p>
<p>
In the
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Loper
Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em></em></u></a> decision, the court
ended “Chevron deference,” essentially seizing for itself the
responsibility to guide implementation of laws that had previously
rested with federal agencies. The effect on future climate policy will
<a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/us-supreme-courts-chevron-deference-ruling-will-disrupt-climate-policy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>likely
be enormous</u></a>. We are at the front end of a wave of lawsuits by
fossil fuel companies and polluters of all kinds looking to the court’s
conservative majority to neuter environmental regulations. There’s no
telling just how far the conservative majority will go, but there isn’t
much reason for optimism in the short run. And the court’s direction
could be determined by who gets to make the next couple of appointments;
everything from a new liberal majority to a 7-2 or 8-1 conservative
supermajority is possible in the coming years.
</p>
<p>
While neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump put climate change at the
center of their campaigns, the climate kept intruding, whether in the
form of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/park-fire-arson#:~:text=The%20Park%20Fire%2C%20which%20has%20burned%20nearly%20400%2C000%20acres%20near%20Paradise%2C%20north%20of%20Sacramento%2C%20is%20now%20the%20fourth%20biggest%20wildfire%20in%20California%E2%80%99s%20recorded%20history." target="_self"><u>wildfires</u></a>

or
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>hurricanes</u></a>.
Just as those disasters are likely to worsen, the policy fights over
climate in the next four years will intensify. When we look back, 2024
may or may not turn out to have been
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/election-2024" target="_blank">the
most important election of our lifetimes</a>. But either way it turns
out, the consequences will be profound.

workers accept contract, end more than 7-week strike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE — Unionized machinists at Boeing voted Monday to accept a
contract offer and end their strike after more than seven weeks,
clearing the way for the aerospace giant to resume production of its
bestselling airliner and generate much-needed cash.</p>
<p>Leaders of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers district in Seattle said 59% of members who cast ballots agreed
to approve the company’s fourth formal offer and the third put to a
vote. The deal includes pay raises of 38% over four years, and
ratification and productivity bonuses.</p>
<p>However, Boeing refused to meet strikers’ demand to restore a company
pension plan that was frozen nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p>The contract’s ratification on the eve of Election Day clears the way
for a major U.S. manufacturer and government contractor to restart
Pacific Northwest assembly lines that the factory workers’ walkout have
idled for 53 days.</p>
<p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a message to employees Monday night
that he was pleased to have reached an agreement.</p>
<p>“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are
all part of the same team,” Ortberg said. “We will only move forward by
listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to
the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”</p>
<p>According to the union, the 33,000 workers it represents can return
to work as soon as Wednesday or as late as Nov. 12. Boeing’s CEO has
said it might take “a couple of weeks” to resume production in part
because some could need retraining.</p>
<p>The contract decision is “most certainly not a victory,” said Eep
Bolaño, a Boeing calibration specialist based in Seattle who voted in
favor of ratification. Bolaño said she and her fellow workers made a
wise but infuriating choice to accept the offer.</p>
<p>“We were threatened by a company that was crippled, dying, bleeding
on the ground, and us as one of the biggest unions in the country
couldn’t even extract two-thirds of our demands from them. This is
humiliating,” Bolaño said.</p>
<p>Leaders of IAM District 751 had endorsed the latest proposal, saying
they thought they had gotten all they could though negotiations and the
strike.</p>
<p>“It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently
declare victory,” the union district said before Monday’s vote. “We
believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn’t be right as we
have achieved so much success.”</p>
<p>The average annual pay of Boeing machinists is currently $75,608 and
eventually will rise to $119,309 under the new contract, according to
the company.</p>
<p>A continuing strike would have plunged Boeing into further financial
peril and uncertainty.</p>
<p>CEO Kelly Ortberg, an outsider who started at Boeing only in August,
has announced plans to lay off about 10% of the workforce, about 17,000
people, due to the strike and a series of other factors that diminished
the company’s reputation and fortunes this year.</p>

<h2 id="us-voters-choose-between-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump">US
voters choose between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Poll results began pouring in late Tuesday in the tight presidential
contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald
Trump, with both notching early wins in their respective strongholds in
a historic poll that could see the U.S. elect its first female
president.</p>
<p>Trump, who is seeking to return to the White House after his 2020
loss, grabbed his home state of Florida, swinging the early tally into
his column with that state’s 30 electoral college votes. Harris, as
expected, locked down several smaller states on the East Coast. The
winning candidate needs 270 electoral college votes, out of 538, to win,
and some states were not expected to finish counting before Wednesday.
The winner will begin a four-year presidential term in January.</p>
<p>Political analysts predicted that the race would come down to just
seven political battleground states, where surveys show the two
candidates are within 2 percentage points of each other — making them
too close to call.</p>
<p>Watch related report by Kane Farabaugh:</p>
<p>Jim Kessler, vice president of policy at think tank Third Way, told
VOA late Tuesday that Harris offers something new to a particular
demographic of voters.</p>
<p>“I think part of it is that she’s a woman, and a woman of color,” he
said of Harris, who is of mixed Black and South Asian heritage. “And I
think many women are excited about that.”</p>
<p>Another point in her favor, he said, is the Supreme Court’s 2022
decision to overturn federally protected abortion access. Harris has
campaigned on a platform of codifying those protections into law.</p>
<p>“Literally, since that decision, Democrats have overperformed the
public opinion polls, in part because women are showing up at the polls
in higher numbers than men, especially compared to previous elections,”
he said.</p>
<p>Trump, who voted in Florida Tuesday, said he was confident in his
performance.</p>
<p>He told reporters, “If it’s a fair election, I’d be the first one to
acknowledge” the results, though it was not clear what might meet that
definition. Democratic critics say they expect Trump to challenge the
outcome unless he wins.</p>
<p>Both Harris and Trump have assembled a vast roster of experienced
election lawyers to contest any irregularities they believe might affect
the outcome to their candidate’s disadvantage.</p>
<p>More than 83 million Americans cast early votes before Tuesday,
either in person at polling stations or by mail.</p>
<p>The total is more than half the 158 million who voted in the 2020
election, when President Joe Biden defeated Trump. It was a Democratic
victory that to this day Trump says he was cheated out of by fraudulent
voting rules and vote counts.</p>
<p>Biden remained at the White House throughout the day and made no
public appearances.</p>
<p>A Trump victory would make him only the second president to serve two
non-consecutive terms, after Grover Cleveland in the 1880s. He would
also be the first felon to serve as president as he awaits sentencing
later in November after being convicted of 34 charges linked to his hush
money payment to a porn film star ahead of his successful 2016 run for
the presidency.</p>
<p>Harris for weeks has claimed she is the underdog in the campaign but
lately expressed more optimism and now says she expects to become the
country’s 47th president.</p>
<p>U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the national popular
vote but through the Electoral College, which turns the election into 50
state-by-state contests, with 48 states awarding all their electoral
votes to the winner in those states. Nebraska and Maine allocate theirs
by both statewide and congressional district vote counts.</p>
<p>The number of electoral votes in each state is based on population,
so the biggest states hold the most sway in determining the overall
national outcome. Aside from the 19 electoral votes at stake in
Pennsylvania, two other battleground states, Georgia and North Carolina,
have 16 apiece, and Michigan has 15.</p>
<p>Voters near the nation’s capital told VOA that their exercise in
democracy was a pleasant one.</p>
<p>Voting was “just a smooth process,” said Arlington, Virginia, voter
Neil Puri. “Civility. Having people respect each other again and vote
with love rather than party lines.”</p>
<p>And in Alabama — a state Trump claimed early in the evening — Pastor
Robby Boyd told VOA’s Lao Service that he had faith in a smooth
outcome.</p>
<p>“My biggest concern is that there are questions that linger no matter
who wins, that there are questions or charges of fraud,” he said. “We
don’t want that to happen. I just pray that it’s so obvious whoever the
winner is, that we can move on as a country.”</p>

county in swing state of Georgia counting ballots ahead of Election
Day</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lawrenceville, Georgia — One of the most ethnically diverse counties
in the Southeastern United States will be among those issuing early
voting results Tuesday night, a reveal that could indicate which of the
presidential candidates is in the lead in the crucial count of 538
electoral votes.</p>
<p>The victor must receive at least 270 of those electoral votes, and
Georgia, seen as one of the seven states where the outcome is uncertain,
has 16 of those precious votes. Only Pennsylvania has more — 19 — among
the battleground states. North Carolina also has 16.</p>
<p>The other wild cards are Arizona (11), Michigan (15), Nevada (6) and
Wisconsin (10).</p>
<p>It is possible for the declared victor in the electoral count to lose
the national popular vote total. That last happened in 2016, when
Republican Donald Trump won 304 electoral votes but lost the popular
vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 2%.</p>
<p>It could be days before the United States knows who its next
president will be, but at the Gwinnett County Voter Registration and
Elections headquarters in the swing state of Georgia, workers are
already scanning several hundred thousand ballots submitted in advance
by mail-in and early voters. The tabulations of those ballots will be
released the moment the polls close at 7 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Up to 70% of the vote total from those already-processed ballots will
be known within that first hour, said Zach Manifold, the county’s
elections supervisor.</p>
<p>“And then, kind of a long night begins,” Manifold told VOA on Monday.
“Our first precinct usually arrives maybe about 8:30, just depending on
how much line there is at seven o’clock. But 8:30 is the first precinct.
We have 156 precincts that all have to come back. I don’t know why, but
it always seems like that last one comes in sometime between 11:30 and
midnight.</p>
<p>“After you get past midnight, you’ll probably have just about all the
precincts in and have a pretty good feel for the final — at least the
unofficial results — for Gwinnett,” Manifold said.</p>
<p>To demonstrate transparency, the media, which is expected to include
dozens of TV news crews and other journalists from around the world,
will be allowed in the large room where the ballots are opened. The
reporters will be kept behind a cordon but not prevented from observing
the entire process. Activities in the tabulation room, in another part
of the same building, will be livestreamed online.</p>
<p>Gwinnett County, with a population of about 1 million, is the
second-largest county in Georgia. It is remarkable for its exceptional
diversity, with no single ethnic group making up more than about
one-third of its residents. In 2023, non-Hispanic whites made up about
one-third of the country’s population, as did African Americans,
according to census data.</p>
<p>“We have a very large Hispanic population, Asian population, Black
population,” said Manifold. “It is a very much a mixture of what is
America. And, so, I think a lot of the reason that people are wanting to
see what Gwinnett’s like [on election night] is, I think, Gwinnett is a
lot like modern America.”</p>
<p>Democrat Joe Biden’s strong margin in this suburban county four years
ago helped him narrowly win Georgia and thus the presidency, unseating
Trump.</p>
<p>Gwinnett County voted Republican every year between 1980 and 2012,
but in line with a trend of suburban political realignment, went
narrowly for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump, a political novice
that year, won Georgia overall in 2016, which was key to his unexpected
presidential victory.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome this week, Manifold knows he will be
drinking a lot of coffee from Tuesday morning to stay alert.</p>
<p>“It’s about a 24-hour day a lot of the time in these presidential
elections,” he said. “I’ll start at our warehouse at 4 a.m., and we’ll
see what time we get out of here at the main office.”</p>

<h2 id="somali-americans-gear-up-for-us-elections">Somali Americans gear
up for US elections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS, MN — Somali Americans in Minnesota last month took part
in a town hall involving Democratic and Republican party representatives
encouraging them to participate in the 2024 election, arguing the stakes
are high for them and their grandchildren.</p>
<p>During a VOA town hall event in Minneapolis, Somali Americans
listened to remarks by panelists from both political parties, who
answered questions about the economy, immigration, and foreign policy,
explaining what their candidate would do to win the votes of Somali
Americans.</p>
<p>Economic policy</p>
<p>While many Somali Americans are traditionally Democratic-leaning,
there are rising numbers who support former President Donald Trump,
crediting him for stronger economic conditions during his presidency,
despite concerns over his immigration policies.</p>
<p>Faisal Deri, chair of the African Republicans of Minnesota, urged
Somali Americans to vote for Trump, stating that Somali Americans,
including truck drivers, experienced positive economic conditions during
his presidency.</p>
<p>“Truck drivers’ business was thriving, with a high volume of work and
plenty of income flowing in. That brought significant money into the
community, and they were able to send substantial support to their
relatives in Somalia. But, under [President Joe] Biden’s term, business
was down, and many have been forced to park their trucks,” Deri
said.</p>
<p>Nimo Ahmed, a Democrat and an activist, is the chair of the Somali
American Coalition Action Fund. She said there’s no way the community
will vote for Trump, claiming his policies primarily benefit
millionaires.</p>
<p>“[Vice President Kamala] Harris will support small businesses, which
are essential for many Somali families in Minnesota who run small
stores. Trump had focused on supporting millionaires and would continue
to do so, but we are middle-class people, and only the Democratic Party
truly supports the middle class,” Ahmed said.</p>
<p>Habon Abdulle, director of Ayada Leads, an organization that empowers
African diaspora women, stressed that it is crucial for everyone to
vote.</p>
<p>“Vote for whoever you choose, but please vote, because your vote
reflects your values and who you’re negotiating with. Please make your
voice heard,” Abdulle said.</p>
<p>On the economy, the other questions posed to the panelists included:
Why is the U.S. spending billions of dollars on foreign wars while
homelessness persists in America? What actions can Harris take to
address high interest rates, given the community’s desire for affordable
homeownership?</p>
<p>In response, Deri asserted that the ongoing wars abroad have
contributed to rising interest rates. He noted that when Trump was in
office, interest rates were low, allowing many Somalis to purchase
homes. However, that is no longer the case, as affordability has
decreased.</p>
<p>“If Trump returns to the White House, his first action would be to
end the wars and cut foreign aid to Ukraine, rearranging those funds for
use within the United States,” Deri said.</p>
<p>Nimo Ahmed defended Harris on economic policies, asserting that her
policies aim to support lower and middle-class Americans.</p>
<p>Immigration policy</p>
<p>Trump’s plans for “mass deportations” as well as tightening
immigration policy are also concerns for Somali Americans, as well as a
travel ban that affected many foreign visitors during his last term in
office. Community members said they worry reinstating travel bans could
halt family reunifications, and mass deportations could impact many
Somali residents in the United States.</p>
<p>Ahmed, the Democrat party supporter, said Trump’s policies would not
be good for Somali American communities.</p>
<p>“Trump doesn’t respect immigrants and has referred to them as
‘poisoning the blood.’ We must support Harris to prevent deportations so
Somalis without legal status can live with dignity here. When Trump
talks about ‘poisoning the blood,’ he’s including some Somalis in that
group, so we need to protect them,” Ahmed said.</p>
<p>In contrast, Deri, the Republican panelist, argued that Trump’s
immigration policies focus on preventing criminals from entering the
United States, a benefit to all American communities, including
Somalis.</p>
<p>“The deportation policy targets criminals who bring drugs into the
country, which especially harms minorities like us. The focus isn’t on
Somalis, and each country’s rules must be respected,” Deri said.</p>
<p>Foreign policy</p>
<p>Ahead of the election, opinion surveys have indicated that many
American Muslims oppose the Biden administration’s handling of the war
between Israel and Hamas. During the VOA town hall, some participants
questioned why they should support Harris when there seems to have been
no significant action in ending the conflict in Gaza.</p>
<p>“I don’t support Biden and Harris for failing to establish a
cease-fire in Gaza. It’s disheartening, but Trump doesn’t have anything
for Gazans; their lives would only be worse if he were to be elected. I
prefer Harris’s party because they can be held accountable, while
Trump’s administration lacks that accountability,” Democrat Nimo Ahmed
said.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, following a terror attack
in southern Israel by Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group.</p>
<p>Deri, the pro-Republican activist argued that the Biden-Harris
administration’s policies have been tested, and they missed their
opportunity to deliver aid to Gaza.</p>
<p>“If we vote for Harris, we are rewarding someone who has failed.
Trump is a strong leader, and he could potentially resolve the Gaza
situation quickly,” Deri said.</p>
<p>Amin Harun, a lawyer in Minneapolis, said the division of opinion
among American Muslims is a significant issue.</p>
<p>“Some are voting, some are rejecting, and others are supporting
different candidates. Unifying the voices of Muslims is essential for
expressing their collective thoughts,” Harun said.</p>
<p>Abdulle, the director of the Ayada Leads organization, underscored
the importance of voting.</p>
<p>“Even if you don’t vote for the president, you need to participate in
local elections, vote for local seats so that your votes make an
impact,” Abdulle said.</p>
<p>Ifrah Farah, a town hall attendee, said there should not be a reason
to equate the policies of Biden with those of Harris, who she said has
her own political agenda.</p>
<p>Farah urged participants to vote, stating, “Elections are crucial. If
you’re a citizen of this country, you should vote because it will
benefit you and your children in the future.”</p>
<p>As the community gears up for these crucial elections, there are
dozens of Somali American candidates vying for seats to represent a
rapidly growing immigrant community that has exceeded 300,000.</p>
<p>This story originated in VOA’s Somali Service. The townhall was
recorded on October 19, 2024, and was conducted in Somali. The
discussion has been translated into English for this story.</p>

id="us-issues-election-eve-warning-of-ramped-up-russian-influence-ops">US
issues Election Eve warning of ramped-up Russian influence ops</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Just hours before tens of millions of U.S. voters headed
to the polls for the country’s presidential election, U.S. intelligence
agencies issued a dire warning about ramped up influence operations –
some apparently aimed at convincing Americans to turn on each other.</p>
<p>The statement late Monday cautioned voters to beware of a new wave of
influence operations aimed at undermining trust and confidence in the
U.S. election process, adding that a flood of fake videos and articles
meant to spark outrage and inflame tensions is likely to only
accelerate, especially in swing states that could determine the outcome
of the presidential race.</p>
<p>“Russia is the most active threat,” according to the warning issued
by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the
Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency, or CISA.</p>
<p>“Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing
videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the
election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and
suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political
preferences,” they said.  </p>
<p>“We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured
content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks
after polls close,” the statement added. “These efforts risk inciting
violence, including against election officials.”</p>
<p>The last-minute warning follows a series of declassified assessments
that U.S. intelligence officials have issued in the weeks and months
leading up to Tuesday’s election.</p>
<p>Yet while most votes have been cast without issue, organizations
representing state election officials cautioned there are likely to be
some disruptions.</p>
<p>“As with any Election Day, it is important to note operational issues
may arise,” according to the National Association of State Election
Directors and the National Association of Secretaries of State.</p>
<p>“Voting locations could open late, there could be lines during busy
periods, or an area could lose power,” they said in a statement. “These
are inevitable challenges that will arise on Election Day.”</p>
<p>There have also been other efforts to try to derail the election.</p>
<p>CISA said it has observed “small scale incidents,” including efforts
to take down official election websites with distributed denial of
service attacks, as well as several attempts to blow up or set fire to
ballot drop boxes.</p>
<p>The most recent declassified assessment, issued just two weeks ago,
warned Russia, Iran and China “remain intent on fanning divisive
narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans’ confidence in
the U.S. democratic system consistent with what they perceive to be in
their interests.” </p>
<p>It further warned that intelligence obtained by U.S. intelligence
agencies made them “increasingly confident” that Russia was starting to
engage in plans “aimed at inciting violence,” and that Iran might follow
Moscow’s lead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The information shared in the new warning builds on that assessment,
pointing to a flurry of new activity linked to Russia.</p>
<p>Specifically, the new statement blames Kremlin-linked actors for
posting and amplifying an article falsely claiming that U.S. officials
in key states are orchestrating a plan to rig the election by using
tactics such as ballot stuffing and cyberattacks.</p>
<p>It also links Russian actors to a video of a fake interview of an
individual claiming a scheme in the Southwestern state of Arizona sought
to tip the vote in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Vice
President Kamala Harris with fake overseas ballots and doctored voter
rolls.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies had already attributed responsibility for
other social media videos to Russian influence actors — including two
last week claiming to show Haitian immigrants voting multiple times and
purporting to show ballots in Pennsylvania being ripped up.  </p>
<p>The latest statement also warned that Iran “remains a significant
foreign influence threat to U.S. elections,” citing, in part, previously
Iranian efforts to hack the campaign of Republican presidential
candidate, former President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>VOA has reached out to the Russian Embassy in Washington and the
Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York for a response to the
new U.S. allegations.</p>
<p>Russia, Iran and China have repeatedly rejected previous U.S.
assessments of their influence operations.</p>
<p>The Russian Embassy in Washington late Monday in an email to VOA
dismissed the newest U.S. intelligence warning as “baseless.”</p>
<p>“The Embassy has not received either any proof for these claims
during its communications with U.S. officials, or any inquiries
regarding the narrative being promoted by the press,” the embassy said,
further describing Washington’s accusations of Russian disinformation
campaigns “an unfortunate tradition” for U.S. elections.</p>
<p>The Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York has yet to
respond to VOA’s request for comment.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about the potential of Russian and Iranian influence
operations, the U.S. expressed confidence earlier Monday that other
foreign efforts to hack into the country’s election infrastructure in
order to alter the vote tally would come up short. </p>
<p>In a briefing with reporters, CISA officials said there is no
evidence to suggest foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China have
the wherewithal to infiltrate and manipulate the country’s election
infrastructure.</p>
<p>“I can say with great confidence that I do not believe that a
technical hack of our elections in the way that it would materially
impact the presidential election is possible,” said CISA Director Jen
Easterly.</p>
<p>“Given the multiple layers of safeguards, the cybersecurity
protections, the physical access controls, the preelection testing of
equipment for accuracy, the postelection audits, it would not be
possible for a bad actor to tamper with or manipulate our voting systems
in such a way that it would have a material impact on the outcome of the
presidential election, certainly not without being detected,” Easterly
told reporters.</p>
<p>Some of the confidence stems from the decentralized way U.S.
elections are run — with each state using its own, individual system to
record and tally ballots. But it also follows years of preparation by
CISA, working with state and local election officials across the United
States.</p>
<p>Those efforts have included more than 700 cybersecurity assessments,
and hundreds of election exercises and training sessions since the start
of 2023.</p>
<p>Additionally, none of the state voting systems are connected to the
internet, and an estimated 97% of U.S. voters will be casting ballots in
jurisdictions that produce paper records as a backup.</p>
<p>“Our election infrastructure has never been more secure,” Easterly
said. “The election community has never been better prepared to deliver
safe, secure, free and fair elections.”</p>
<p>As of late Monday, CISA estimated that more than 77 million Americans
had already cast ballots during the early voting period, with tens of
millions more expected to vote in person on Election Day.</p>
<p>That confidence, however, has been tempered by concerns that foreign
actors could play on mundane disruptions, like power outages, or
cyberattacks on other U.S infrastructure to spark fears across the
U.S.</p>
<p>“As with any Election Day, it is important to note operational issues
may arise,” according to the National Association of State Election
Directors and the National Association of Secretaries of State.</p>
<p>“Voting locations could open late, there could be lines during busy
periods, or an area could lose power,” they said in a statement. “These
are inevitable challenges that will arise on Election Day.”</p>
<p>Already, there have also been other efforts to try to derail the
election.</p>
<p>CISA said it has observed “small scale incidents,” including efforts
to take down official election websites with distributed denial of
service attacks, as well as several attempts to blow up or set fire to
ballot drop boxes. </p>
<p>“We expect that these types of incidents and other forms of
disruptions will continue on Election Day [and] in the days that
follow,” Easterly told reporters, adding despite cause for concern there
have been “no significant impacts to election infrastructure.” </p>
<p>Still, CISA and its state and local partners are wary that even
though the U.S. is on track, foreign influence campaigns could alter the
perception among voters due to what U.S. officials have described as “a
firehose of disinformation.”</p>
<p>Some of the efforts, like those attributed to Russia and Iran, have
gained widespread attention.</p>
<p>Others, like Chinese efforts against Republican lawmakers and
candidates seen as critical to Beijing, appear to be more targeted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And gauging the effectiveness of these efforts, especially the recent
videos attributed to Russia, is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>“The successfulness, I would say, is quite small,” said Brian Liston,
a senior threat intelligence analyst with Recorded Future’s Insikt
Group.</p>
<p>“We have not really seen these videos, or this content break out
beyond social media or on Telegram,” Liston told VOA.</p>
<p>But there are concerns, however, that some of these narratives could
gain traction on more mainstream social media platforms.</p>
<p>“Since Elon Musk took over Twitter and gutted content moderation and
really changed the purpose of X, we’ve seen it become just a hotbed of
mis and disinformation,” said Audrey McCabe, an information
accountability analyst at Common Cause, a nonpartisan watchdog and
advocacy organization.</p>
<p>McCabe told reporters Monday that the changes to X have rippled
across the social media space.</p>
<p>“[It] has allowed other platforms to lower their standards for
content moderation and what they’re doing to protect users,” she said.
“And so, we’re seeing an increase of this stuff everywhere, including on
Meta, and other platforms as well.”</p>
<p>And if some of the foreign influence efforts spread far enough, it
could help exacerbate exiting tensions.</p>
<p>“They are deliberately finding narratives to try to stoke partisan
discord and inflame domestic tension and pit Americans against one
another, and we cannot let them succeed,” a senior CISA official said,
who briefed reporters last Friday on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen how these disinformation campaigns have led to very real
threats of violence targeting these public servants, and that should be
unacceptable,” the official added, citing repeated threats against
election officials across the country. </p>
<p>CISA officials on Monday said that state and local election officials
have been in close contact with law enforcement agencies, and that
precautions have been put in place to better protect election workers,
election officials and even the ballots themselves.</p>
<p>They also emphasized that so far, there have been no credible or
specific threats to polling locations.</p>
<p>“We’ve not seen specific reporting about violence at polling places,”
Easterly said Monday in response to a question from VOA. “I certainly
don’t want voters to feel at all intimidated about going to voting
locations.”</p>

There are only a few bills with strong bipartisan support in the
soon-to-be lame duck Congress. Requiring AM radio in new cars is one of
them. Proponents say AM radio is a vital part of the Emergency Alert
System and still broadcasts news in rural communities. Carmakers aren’t
buying it. Plus, the Dow’s got some newcomers, OPEC (once again)
postpones increasing oil production, and farmers stress about tariffs
ahead of the election.

id="remains-of-nearly-30-civil-war-veterans-found-in-funeral-homes-storage-are-laid-to-rest">Remains
of nearly 30 Civil War veterans found in funeral home’s storage are laid
to rest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PAWTUCKET, R.I. — For several decades, the cremated remains of more
than two dozen American Civil War veterans languished in storage
facilities at a funeral home and cemetery in Seattle.</p>
<p>The simple copper and cardboard urns gathering dust on shelves only
had the name of each of the 28 soldiers — but nothing linking them to
the Civil War. Still, that was enough for an organization dedicated to
locating, identifying and interring the remains of unclaimed veterans to
conclude over several years that they were all Union soldiers deserving
of a burial service with military honors.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing that they were still there and we found them,” said Tom
Keating, the Washington state coordinator for the Missing in America
Project, which turned to a team of volunteers to confirm their war
service through genealogical research. “It’s something long overdue.
These people have been waiting a long time for a burial.”</p>
<p>Most of the veterans were buried in August at Washington’s Tahoma
National Cemetery.</p>
<p>In a traditional service offered to Civil War veterans, the
historical 4th U.S. Infantry Regiment dressed in Union uniforms fired
musket volleys and the crowd sang “The Battle Hymn of the Republic.”
Names were called out for each veteran and their unit before their
remains were brought forward and stories were shared about their
exploits. Then, they were buried. </p>
<p>Among them was a veteran held at a Confederate prison known as
Andersonville. Several were wounded in combat and others fought in
critical battles including Gettysburg, Stones River and the Atlanta
campaign. One man survived being shot thanks to his pocket watch – which
he kept until his death — and another deserted the Confederate Army and
joined the Union forces. </p>
<p>“It was something, just the finality of it all,” Keating said, adding
they were unable to find any living descendants of the veterans. </p>
<p>While some remains are hidden away in funeral homes, others were
found where they fell in battle or by Civil War re-enactors combing old
graveyards. </p>
<p>Communities often turn reburials into major events, allowing
residents to celebrate veterans and remember a long-forgotten war. In
2016, a volunteer motorcycle group escorted the remains of one veteran
cross country from Oregon to the final resting place in Maine. In South
Carolina, the remains of 21 Confederate soldiers recovered from
forgotten graves beneath the stands of a military college’s football
stadium were reburied in 2005. </p>
<p>Sometimes reburials spark controversy. The discovery of the remains
of two soldiers from the Manassas National Battlefield in Virginia
prompted an unsuccessful attempt in 2018 by several families to have DNA
tests done on them. The Army rejected that request and reburied them as
unknown soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery. </p>
<p>Along with those buried at Tahoma, Keating said, several others will
be buried at Washington State Veterans Cemetery and a Navy veteran will
be buried at sea. The remains of several more Civil War veterans were
sent to Maine, Rhode Island and other places where family connections
were found. </p>
<p>Among them was Byron Johnson. Born in Pawtucket in 1844, he enlisted
at 18 and served as a hospital steward with the Union Army. He moved out
West after the war and died in Seattle in 1913. After his remains were
delivered to Pawtucket City Hall, he was buried with military honors at
his family’s plot in Oak Grove Cemetery. </p>
<p>Pawtucket Mayor Donald R. Grebien said Johnson’s burial service was
the right thing to do. </p>
<p>“When you have somebody who served in a war but especially this war,
we want to honor them,” he said. “It became more intriguing when you
think this individual was left out there and not buried in his own
community.” </p>
<p>Grebien said the burials recall important lessons about the 1861-1865
war to preserve the Union, fought between the North’s Union Army and the
Confederate States of America at a cost of hundreds of thousands of
lives. </p>
<p>“It was important to remind people not only in Pawtucket but the
state of Rhode Island and nationwide that we have people who sacrificed
their lives for us and for a lot of the freedoms we have,” he said. </p>
<p>Bruce Frail and his son Ben — both long active in the Sons of Union
Veterans of the Civil War — were on hand for service. Ben Frail was also
a re-enactor at Johnson’s service, portraying a Union Army captain. </p>
<p>“It’s the best thing we can do for a veteran,” said Bruce Frail, a
former commander-in-chief with the Sons of Union Veterans and state
coordinator for Missing in America Project. </p>
<p>“The feeling that you get when you honor somebody in that way, it’s
indescribable,” he said. </p>
<p>The task of piecing together Johnson’s life story was left to Amelia
Boivin, the constituent liaison in the Pawtucket mayor’s office. A
history buff, she recalled getting the call requesting the city take
possession of his remains and bury them with his family. She got to work
and Johnson’s story became the talk of City Hall. </p>
<p>She determined Johnson grew up in Pawtucket, had two sisters and a
brother and worked as a druggist after the war. He left to make his
fortune out West, first in San Francisco and eventually in Seattle,
where he worked nearly up until his death. It doesn’t appear Johnson
ever married or had children, and no living relatives were found. </p>
<p>“I felt like it was resolution of sorts,” Boivin said. “It felt like
we were doing right for someone who otherwise would have been lost to
history.”</p>

id="pennsylvania-judge-musks-1-million-a-day-voter-sweepstakes-can-proceed">Pennsylvania
judge: Musk’s $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes can proceed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — The $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes that Elon Musk
’s political action committee is hosting in swing states can continue
through Tuesday’s presidential election, a Pennsylvania judge ruled
Monday.</p>
<p>Common Pleas Court Judge Angelo Foglietta — ruling after Musk’s
lawyers said the winners are paid spokespeople and not chosen by chance
— did not immediately explain his reasoning.</p>
<p>District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, had called the process a
scam “designed to actually influence a national election” and asked that
it be shut down.</p>
<p>Musk lawyer Chris Gober said the final two recipients before
Tuesday’s presidential election will be in Arizona on Monday and
Michigan on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The $1 million recipients are not chosen by chance,” Gober said
Monday. “We know exactly who will be announced as the $1 million
recipient today and tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Chris Young, the director of America PAC, testified that the
recipients are vetted ahead of time, to “feel out their personality,
(and) make sure they were someone whose values aligned” with the
group.</p>
<p>Musk’s lawyers, in closing arguments, called it “core political
speech” given that participants sign a petition endorsing the U.S.
Constitution. They said Krasner’s legal bid to shut down the sweepstakes
under Pennsylvania law was moot because there would be no more
Pennsylvania winners before the program ends Tuesday.</p>
<p>Krasner believes the giveaways violates state election law and
contradict what Musk promised when he announced them during an
appearance with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ’s campaign
in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 19: “We’re going to be awarding a
million dollars randomly to people who have signed the petition every
day from now until the election,” Musk vowed.</p>
<p>Young also acknowledged that the PAC made the recipients sign
nondisclosure agreements.</p>
<p>“They couldn’t really reveal the truth about how they got the money,
right?” asked Krasner lawyer John Summers.</p>
<p>“Sounds right,” Young said.</p>
<p>In an Oct. 20 social media post shown in court, Musk said anyone
signing the petition had “a daily chance of winning $1M!”</p>
<p>Summers grilled him on Musk’s use of both the words “chance” and
“randomly,” prompting Young, who also serves as the PAC’s treasurer, to
concede the latter was not “the word I would have selected.”</p>
<p>Young said the winners knew they would be called on stage but not
specifically that they would win the money.</p>
<p>Musk did not attend the hearing. He has committed more than $70
million to the super PAC to help Trump and other Republicans win in
November.</p>
<p>“This was all a political marketing masquerading as a lottery,”
Krasner testified Monday morning. “That’s what it is. A grift.”</p>
<p>Lawyers for Musk and the PAC said they do not plan to extend the
lottery beyond Tuesday. Krasner said the first three winners, starting
on Oct. 19, came from Pennsylvania in the days leading up to the state’s
Oct. 21 voter registration deadline.</p>
<p>Other winners came from the battleground states of Wisconsin, Nevada,
Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan. It’s not clear if anyone
has yet received the money. The PAC pledged they would get it by
Nov. 30, according to an exhibit shown in court.</p>
<p>More than 1 million people from the seven states have registered for
the sweepstakes by signing a petition saying they support the right to
free speech and to bear arms, the first two amendments to the U.S.
Constitution. Krasner questioned how the PAC might use their data, which
it will have on hand well past the election.</p>
<p>“They were scammed for their information,” Krasner said. “It has
almost unlimited use.”</p>
<p>Krasner’s lawyer, John Summers, said Musk is “the heartbeat of
America PAC,” and the person announcing the winners and presenting the
checks.</p>
<p>“He was the one who presented the checks, albeit large cardboard
checks. We don’t really know if there are any real checks,” Summers
said.</p>
<p>Foglietta was presiding over the case at Philadelphia City Hall after
Musk and the PAC lost an effort to move it to federal court.</p>
<p>Krasner has said he could still consider criminal charges, as he’s
tasked with protecting both lotteries and the integrity of elections. In
the lawsuit, he said the defendants are “indisputably violating”
Pennsylvania’s lottery laws.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania remains a key battleground state with 19 electoral votes
and both Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris have
repeatedly visited the state, including stops planned Monday in the
final hours of the campaign.</p>
<p>Krasner — who noted that he has long driven a Tesla — said he could
also seek civil damages for the Pennsylvania registrants. Musk is the
CEO and largest shareholder of Tesla. He also owns the social media
platform X, where America PAC has published posts on the sweepstakes,
and the rocket ship maker SpaceX.</p>

arrests Turkish businessman accused of helping Venezuela skirt
sanctions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>miami — A Turkish businessman was arrested Monday in Miami and
charged with helping Venezuela’s state-run oil company circumvent U.S.
sanctions.</p>
<p>Taskin Torlak, 37, was arrested while attempting to return to Turkey,
the Justice Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Torlak operated several companies
involved in the shipment of sanctioned oil. Starting in 2020, he
allegedly started working with unnamed co-conspirators and companies
from Ukraine, China, Indonesia and elsewhere to transport Venezuela’s
crude oil at a time when most Western buyers stayed clear of the South
American country for fear of undermining U.S. sanctions aimed at
removing President Nicolas Maduro.</p>
<p>Torlak and his associates allegedly hid the identities of transaction
beneficiaries to enable U.S. banks to unknowingly process payments
related to the illegal oil transports.</p>
<p>“We could use one of the clean names to avoid money getting stuck
somewhere,” he allegedly wrote in communications with one of the
co-conspirators.</p>
<p>To evade detection, the chartered oil tankers frequently turned off
their automated tracking systems, a mandatory safety device, when
transporting the illegal Venezuelan crude. They also frequently changed
the vessels’ registry to fly so-called flags of convenience. </p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately possible to locate an attorney for Torlak. </p>
<p>The U.S. started ratcheting up sanctions on Venezuela following
Maduro’s first re-election in 2018, in which several key opponents were
barred from running. Since then, the self-declared socialist leader has
deepened his grip on power, this year claiming he won a third six-year
term in the face of evidence presented by his opponents that the vote
was stolen. The U.S. responded with another round of sanctions against
officials accused of obstructing the vote and carrying out human rights
abuses. </p>
<p>“The Justice Department will continue to hold accountable those
involved in criminal efforts to circumvent sanctions imposed on the
Maduro regime,” Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen said in a
statement.</p>

UN, US confronts Russia over North Korean troops for Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Russia refused to confirm its plans for North Korean
troops it reportedly plans to deploy in its fight against Ukraine,
during a confrontation with the United States Monday at the U.N.
Security Council.</p>
<p>“I heard the statement [of the Russian envoy], as did others in this
room, but the one question still remains that that statement does not
address, and that is whether there are DPRK troops on the ground in
Russia,” U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood told council members,
using the abbreviation for North Korea’s formal name.</p>
<p>“And my question still stands, and I hope that the Russian Federation
will answer that simple question,” he said.</p>
<p>Wood was referring to intelligence indicating that an estimated
10,000 North Korean troops have been sent to Russia for training and
deployment to fight alongside the Kremlin’s troops in Ukraine, with some
of the North Koreans believed to be heading to Ukraine in the coming
days. </p>
<p>“We’re not in a court here, and the question of the United States, in
the spirit of an interrogation, is not something I intend to answer,”
said Russian Deputy Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva.</p>
<p>U.S. officials estimate that more than a half-million Russian troops
have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since Russia launched its
full-scale illegal invasion on February 24, 2022. Russia, they say, is
now turning to pariah state North Korea to bolster its forces.</p>
<p>Ambassador Wood said the Russians have trained the North Koreans in
artillery and drone operations, and basic infantry operations.</p>
<p>“The nature of the training Russia is providing to these forces, to
include trench clearing, indicates Russia intends to use these forces in
front line operations,” he said.</p>
<p>South Korea’s envoy said Pyongyang is acting in a “more desperate and
dangerous” way recently, including the blowing up of rail and road links
between the two neighbors.</p>
<p>“And now the desperate DPRK is demanding more sacrifices from its own
people by dispatching troops to Russia,” said Ambassador JoonKook
Hwang.</p>
<p>William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA
Monday that it is unclear how experienced and professional the North
Korean troops are.</p>
<p>“And we don’t know how they will react when faced in combat
positions. They have not been basically in a war for a long time,” he
said. “So, whether the North Koreans have the ability and the equipment
to maintain, to keep in the battlefield, is an open question.”</p>
<p>Western nations have questioned what the regime of North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un will get in return from Moscow for its troops. There
are concerns it could include advanced military technology, possibly for
its illicit nuclear and ballistic missile programs, in addition to
economic or other support.</p>
<p>“North Korea could benefit politically or diplomatically,” Naoko
Aoki, a political scientist at RAND Corporation told VOA. “And this is a
little bit more vague than the other more tangible support, but it is
nevertheless important, because Russia, as it has been doing, can shield
North Korea in the U.N. Security Council so that North Korea is not
faced with further sanctions for its nuclear and missile development,
for example, and also basically help [it] over the long run.” </p>
<p>She said that would support the Kim regime’s goal of remaining in
power and increasing its influence on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>On March 28, Moscow took one such step to shield Pyongyang, using its
Security Council veto to shut down the panel that monitors
implementation of the council’s sanctions on North Korea — sanctions
that Russia previously voted for.</p>
<p>Ballistic missile launch</p>
<p>The Security Council met Monday to discuss Pyongyang’s October 30
missile launch of a solid fuel intercontinental ballistic missile
(ICBM).</p>
<p>“The latest ICBM is estimated to have landed in the waters near
Japan, around only 200 kilometers from the island of Hokkaido,” Japan’s
ambassador, Yamazaki Kazuyuki told the council. “This ICBM launch is
more threatening than ever, as it reached a height of over 7,000
kilometers and a flight time of about 86 minutes — the highest and
longest length trajectory of any missile that North Korea has launched
to date.”</p>
<p>He said its estimated range capability of 15,000 kilometers covers
three quarters of the planet, making it the gravest threat yet from
North Korea.</p>
<p>North Korea’s ambassador dismissed the council’s meeting as
“unlawful” and interference in its domestic affairs.</p>
<p>“Like all strategic weapons tests we have conducted so far, the test
launching of our ICBM Hwasong-19 this time, is a part of the exercise of
the just and legitimate right to self-defense to reliably safeguard
security of our state as well peace of the region involved,” said
Ambassador Kim Song.</p>
<p>Russia sides with North Korea</p>
<p>“The aim of convening a meeting is the same every time, to make yet
another step towards demonizing the DPRK,” said Ambassador Evstigneeva.
She blamed the United States for ratcheting up tension on the peninsula
because of its recent military exercises with South Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea’s ambassador questioned the timing of the latest launch
and strongly condemned it. </p>
<p>“Its intention could be to distract the world’s attention from its
troops in Russia, demonstrate themselves as larger than life, or gain
diplomatic leverage amid the U.S. presidential election,” said
Ambassador Hwang.</p>
<p>“Regardless of the intention, it was clearly an attempt to advance
its missile technology, which makes the launch another flagrant
violation of multiple Security Council resolutions,” he said. </p>
<p>VOA’s Kim Lewis contributed reporting for this story.</p>

Elections inspire hyperbole. Every two years, we have “the most
important election of our lifetime,” America’s future constantly “hangs
in the balance,” and the stakes perennially “couldn’t be higher.”
</p>
<p>
But this year, some breathlessness <em><em>does</em></em> seem
appropriate. 2024 marks the first presidential election since the
January 6, 2021 insurrection attempt, which historians and
constitutional scholars have
<a href="https://legalscholarsonimpeachment.medium.com/historians-and-constitutional-scholars-statement-on-the-second-impeachment-of-president-donald-51a9a8dab61e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>described</u></a>
as the gravest threat to the peaceful transfer of power since the Civil
War. No less existentially, tomorrow’s election will also have global
consequences. Americans will either elect a leader who continues
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-inflation-reduction-act-remains-astonishing" target="_self"><u>the

<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a

</p>
<p>
Make no mistake: Picking the next president of the United States is the
single most important race of this election. However control of the U.S.
House and Senate, which voters will also decide on Tuesday, will either
help or hinder the next president’s agenda, whichever candidate takes
the office. It’s not a coincidence that a number of those critical races
involve candidates whose names will be familiar to the climate and
energy world: Senator Jon Tester, a moderate Democrat in Montana who
proved crucial in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, dreams of owning
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/24/senate-only-farmer-is-an-unlikely-champion-climate-action/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an

to fight the
“<a href="https://www.lcvvictoryfund.org/candidate/tim-sheehy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate

<a href="https://www.aztechcouncil.org/how-arizona-senators-kyrsten-sinema-mark-kelly-shaped-the-inflation-reduction-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shape
the IRA</u></a> but will either leave her seat to a Republican who

<a href="https://rubengallego.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/gallego-votes-support-arizonas-working-families-cut-prescription-drug" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>voted

state; Congressperson Yvette Herrell of New Mexico, who voted against
the IRA while at the same time being one of the

on and on</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Smaller local elections
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-e8-climate-cabinet" target="_self"><u>will
be crucial</u></a>, too. Democrats need a pickup in New York’s 4th
Congressional District, just to the north of deep blue New York City,
where Republican Representative Anthony D’Esposito is defending his seat
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/long-island-feud-race-congress-election-2024-1235140159/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>with
the help of Elon Musk’s super PAC</u></a>; former Earth sciences teacher
Tony Vargas, who believes Nebraska has a “moral obligation” to fight
climate change, is attempting to unseat Republican Representative Don
Bacon, a climate skeptic; and Montanans will elect their next attorney
general, picking between the incumbent who leads
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/held-v-montana-climate-kids" target="_self"><u>the
state’s case against the 16 young plaintiffs in </u><u><em><em>Held v.
Montana</em></em></u></a>, and Democrat Ben Alke, who has extensive
experience in environmental law.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/public-utilities-arizona-montana-louisiana" target="_self"><u>As
Heatmap has covered</u></a>, there are also several public utilities
commission races, the results of which will have “an outsized influence
on the country’s energy mix.”
</p>
<p>
In many places, climate will be on the ballot even more directly. In
South Dakota, the debate over carbon capture and CO2 pipelines is being
<a href="https://www.keloland.com/keloland-com-original/referred-law-21-voters-to-weigh-in-co2-pipeline-debate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>put

decide if they want to incentivize the decarbonization of large
buildings with a natural gas tax; and Washingtonians will have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lets-go-washington" target="_self"><u>two
different climate-related policies to defend</u></a>, with repeal
initiatives on the ballot thanks to a determined Republican millionaire.
</p>
<p>
Starting on Tuesday at 6 p.m., Heatmap will update a list of our most
anticipated climate-related races — 36 in all — with live results as
states and municipalities count the votes. For all the models, polls,
and punditry, it’s still impossible to know what will happen on Tuesday;
however, it’s no exaggeration to say we can be sure we’ll be living in a
different country come January 20, 2025. We can endlessly speculate
about <em><em>how</em></em> different it will be and what the climate
and energy transition will look like in the years ahead. But only
tomorrow knows.

<p class="drop-caps">
In Texas,
<a href="https://www.oakrunsolarproject.com/" target="_blank"><u>the Oak
Run Solar Project</u></a> would have been a slam dunk.
</p>
<p>
Developers would install 800 megawatts of solar panels — enough to power
800,000 homes — across nine square miles of unused land. It would devote
some of its acreage to new farming practices that incorporate solar
panels. And it would sell its electricity cheaply — and profitably —
because it was near the state capital and because it could take
advantage of a pre-existing onsite connection to the regional power
grid.
</p>
<p>
But Oak Run wasn’t proposed in Texas. It was proposed in Ohio, and that
means it has faced enormous opposition. Ohio has some of the country’s
strictest restrictions on solar development, and 10 counties have
blocked solar development outright.
</p>
<p>
Although Madison County, where Oak Run was proposed, is not one of them,
the blowback to the project cost
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18052024/ohio-solar-projects-politics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
local Republican county commissioner</u></a> his job. Oak Run was
eventually approved by the state’s power siting board earlier this year,
but its opponents
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/hotspots/oak-run-savion-madison-county-ohio" target="_self"><u>are
now appealing that decision</u></a> in the state’s Supreme Court.
</p>
<p>
Madison County, Ohio, also illustrates the political transformation that
has revolutionized the upper Midwest. The predominantly rural county
near the state’s capital, Columbus, has favored Republicans since the
1960s. But in recent decades it has swung hard to the right. In 2008,
Barack Obama won nearly 40% of the county’s vote. Eight years later,
Hillary Clinton picked up just 27%.
</p>
<p>
These two facts may seem like they have little to do with each other.
But they point to one of the biggest trends in clean energy development
across the country: The counties that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and
then Donald Trump in 2016 are some of the worst places in the country to
permit and build renewable projects.
</p>
<p>
The size of a county’s swing from 2008 to 2016 is one of the biggest
predictors of whether a proposed wind or solar project will be contested
or blocked, according to a new Heatmap Pro analysis of more than 8,500
projects and local policies around the country.
</p>
<p>
The magnitude of that swing is by far the most important political
variable to emerge from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/pro" target="_blank">Heatmap Pro</a>’s
analysis of more than 60 risk factors influencing community support or
opposition to renewable projects. It is more strongly associated with a
given project’s success than whether a county votes for Democratic or
Republican candidates overall.
</p>
<p>
The only variables that are more closely correlated than the
2008-to-2016 swing are fundamental measures of a region’s population or
local economy, such as its median income, racial demographics, or
dominant industries. Towns and regions
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/solar-farmland" target="_self"><u>that
heavily depend on farming</u></a>, for instance, have become
particularly reluctant to accept new solar projects in recent years.
</p>
<p>
Heatmap Pro’s analysis focused not only on whether a county’s residents
support wind or solar projects in theory, but also on whether renewable
projects proposed in the area are canceled, contested, or exposed to
political turbulence. It surveyed more than 7,000 wind and solar
projects proposed and built across the United States since the 1990s.
</p>
<p>
Many of the counties with the largest Obama-to-Trump swings have passed
proposals meant to limit renewable development. Vermillion County in
Indiana — where more than a quarter of voters swung from Obama to Trump
— has
<a href="https://www.vermilliongov.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Commercial-Solar-Energy-Amendment-2020-15.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
extensive set of restrictions</u></a> on new solar projects. Solar
projects in Elk County, Pennsylvania, which saw a similar swing, have
<a href="https://wjactv.com/news/local/solar-farm-expansion-raises-concerns-over-prime-farmland-use-in-pennsylvania" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also
turned out against</u></a> solar projects using up “prime farmland.”
</p>
<h3>
Why 2008 to 2016?
</h3>
<p>
There are a few reasons why the Obama-to-Trump swing might be associated
with more opposition to renewables.
</p>
<p>
In 2008, solar and wind were still frontier technologies and were not
price-competitive with fossil fuels. Although vaguely associated with
Democrats, politicians on both sides of the aisles
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/03/energy-independence-gas-prices/627117/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>championed
wind and solar</u></a> so as to wean the country off foreign oil.
</p>
<p>
But in the following decade, the U.S.
<a href="https://seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-research-data/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increased</u></a>
its solar capacity by roughly 100-fold, while it has
<a href="https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Wind-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than doubled</u></a> its installed wind capacity.. Today, solar and wind
energy
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61242" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are
major features</u></a> of the electricity system, and many Republicans
have openly embraced fossil fuels and cast doubt on the value of cleaner
alternatives.
</p>
<p>
To be sure, the Obama-to-Trump swing was influenced by other social and
economic factors, as well as a state’s specific political environment.
Leah Stokes, a UC Santa Barbara political scientist
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/wind-farm-protests-leah-stokes-pnas" target="_self"><u>who
has studied the growing local opposition to wind farms</u></a>, told me
that the correlation with Obama-Trump voters may originate from Trump’s
dominance of the upper Midwest in 2016. Because a small group of
anti-renewable advocates can change an entire region’s policies, that
could lead to more opposition to renewables in one part of the country
or another.
</p>
<p>
“Is there
<a href="https://www.distilled.earth/p/meet-the-man-fueling-clean-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
person</u></a>, or a network of people, who are going place by place
pushing these anti-solar and wind local laws? That would lead to a
geographic concentration,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Even within individual counties, the electorate wasn’t the same in 2016
as it was in 2008. Throughout the 2010s, tens of millions of Americans
moved around the country, with the largest net change moving from the
Northeast to the South. Cities became younger on average, while rural
areas and suburbs became older.
</p>
<p>
Even within counties, a different set of voters showed up to the polls
in each election. One reason why the 2012 election might not be
correlated with opposition to renewables is that many voters who voted
for Obama in 2008 skipped the next cycle. Those same voters — many of
whom were white and working class — showed back up in 2016 and
<a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/11/09/the_missing_white_voters_revisisted_132308.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>backed</u></a>
Trump.
</p>
<p>
What is driving the opposition to renewables? Perhaps a county’s swing
against renewable energy is happening precisely because voters there are
persuadable. From 2008 to 2016, many voters in these counties changed
their minds about which candidate or political party to support. As they
shifted their stance to the right, they also adopted more seemingly
Republican views about wind and solar development. Donald Trump has
distinguished himself by his embrace of fossil fuels and climate change
skepticism — perhaps as voters come to support him, they also adopt his
positions.
</p>
<p>
What’s interesting, however, is that deep red counties that have not
seen a political shift — places that backed, say, McCain and Romney by
roughly the same margin as they backed Trump in 2016 — continue to build
wind and solar at a good clip. Texas, for instance, is the
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/texas-goes-green-how-oil-country-became-the-renewable-energy-leader" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>No. 1
state for renewable deployment</u></a>. A county’s partisanship, in
other words, is not as good a predictor of its opposition to renewables
as its <em><em>swinginess.</em></em>
</p>
<p>
Edgar Virguez, an energy systems engineer at the Carnegie Institution
for Science at Stanford University, has studied what drives opposition
to renewables in North Carolina. He told me that some of the same
factors that predict a county’s Trump support — such as its population
density and education level — also predict whether that county has
enacted a local restriction on renewable energy.
</p>
<p>
When he and his colleagues studied local policies in North Carolina,
they found that lower density and less educated counties “had
significantly higher reductions in the land available for solar
development” when compared with denser or more educated counties, he
said. Once a county has fewer than 35 people per square mile, or when
less than 20% of the population has a bachelor’s degree, the number of
restrictions on local land use shot up. That’s a problem for
decarbonization, he added, because less dense counties also usually have
the best and most affordable land available for solar development.
</p>
<p>
That finding may not hold true in other states. Heatmap, for instance,
has found that whiter and more educated counties are more likely to
oppose renewables. And to some degree, less dense counties are exactly
where you’d expect to see more solar and wind projects get built — and
thus more local policies restricting them pop up. But it is nonetheless
not great news for advocates, given that a couple of America’s political
institutions — namely, the Senate and the Electoral College — favor
rural voters or Midwestern states. If the trend takes root, then it
could eventually curtail renewable development across the country. That
question — and many others — will partly be decided in this week’s
presidential election.

<h2 id="what-does-harris-mean-by-an-opportunity-economy">What does
Harris mean by an opportunity economy?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As U.S. voters remain largely dissatisfied with the economy under
President Joe Biden, Kamala Harris has sought to define her own economic
policy under the label of an opportunity economy. But what does that
term mean, and how different is it than what Biden has offered?</p>
<p>Among many contentious topics influencing the 2024 election, the
economy remains the number one issue for a majority of voters. With
Americans reporting feeling worse off financially despite positive
economic trends, Vice President Harris has sought to distinguish her own
economic platform from that of the administration in which she currently
serves.</p>
<p>President Biden’s economic platform has been characterized by support
for unions and American industries, efforts to cancel student debt and
attempts to pass major disaster recovery and infrastructure packages.
Harris has aimed to build on these policies while doing more to address
concerns over rising prices due to inflation, and her economic program
has focused largely on ways to lower costs for Americans.</p>
<p>These proposals include a ban on price-gouging, a price cap on
prescription drugs and subsidizing the construction of new homes in
hopes that increasing supply will help stem rising housing costs.</p>
<p>Harris has also sought to make the case to voters that tariffs
proposed by her rival, former President Donald Trump, will exacerbate
price increases as companies pass higher import costs on to consumers.
However, the vice president has also proposed tariffs in strategic
industries such as energy and is likely to retain tariffs on Chinese
goods maintained under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign’s frequent references to an “opportunity economy”
combine the Democratic Party’s traditional support for social safety
nets and consumer protection regulations with an entrepreneurial message
usually associated with Republicans. Besides expanding the child tax
credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, the vice president has echoed
Trump’s proposal for eliminating taxes on tips earned by service
workers.</p>
<p>Harris has also announced plans to provide more loans for new small
businesses and to ensure that historically disadvantaged groups can
benefit economically from the growing legal cannabis industry.</p>
<p>Harris’ California background and connections to Silicon Valley also
suggest that she may be more friendly to the tech industry and the
emerging cryptocurrency market. It remains to be seen whether a Harris
administration would replace Lina Khan of the Federal Trade Commission
and Gary Gensler of the Securities and Exchange Commission – two Biden
appointees known for their tough regulatory approach.</p>
<p>The vice president’s economic plan has received a mixed reception.
Many economists believe Trump’s proposed tax cuts and deregulation may
help spur economic growth, but a majority polled by The Wall Street
Journal have predicted that Harris’ less aggressive trade policy will be
better for curbing inflation and the deficit.</p>
<p>When it comes to the general public, however, Harris is still
perceived as less capable of handling the economy than Trump, although
the margin of Trump’s advantage has shrunk as the election draws
near.</p>

<h2
id="trump-lawsuits-complaints-target-media-in-closing-days-of-campaign">Trump
lawsuits, complaints target media in closing days of campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — In the last week of the U.S. presidential campaign,
candidate Donald Trump sued CBS News and filed a complaint with the
Federal Election Commission against The Washington Post newspaper.  </p>
<p>The cases are the latest high-profile conflicts between the former
president and news outlets that he often accuses of bias.  </p>
<p>Trump sued CBS over an interview of Vice President Kamala Harris on
the network’s “60 Minutes” program that aired in early October. Trump
had also agreed to give an interview to “60 Minutes” before backing
out.</p>
<p>Filed in Texas on Thursday, the lawsuit alleges that the network
aired two different responses from Harris about the Israel-Hamas
war.</p>
<p>In a statement, CBS said “60 Minutes” gave an excerpt of the
interview to the CBS show “Face the Nation” that used a longer section
of her answer than what aired on “60 Minutes.”</p>
<p>But Trump’s lawsuit — which calls for a jury trial and $10 billion in
damages — alleges that CBS violated a Texas law that prohibits deceptive
acts in the conduct of business.</p>
<p>A CBS spokesperson told VOA the interview was not doctored. The
lawsuit “is completely without merit and we will vigorously defend
against it,” the spokesperson said in an email.</p>
<p>Trump on Thursday also filed a complaint with the Federal Election
Commission alleging that The Washington Post illegally contributed to
the Harris campaign.  </p>
<p>The complaint alleges a social media ad campaign highlighting the
newspaper’s critical coverage of the former president constituted
“illegal corporate in-kind contributions and unreported last-minute
independent expenditures.” Trump’s legal representatives allege the ad
campaign meant the Post was “acting like any other partisan player in
the election process.”  </p>
<p>A Post spokesperson told VOA that promoted posts on social media
reflect high-performing content from the newspaper</p>
<p>“We believe allegations suggesting this routine media practice is
improper are without merit,” the spokesperson said in an email.</p>
<p>Gabe Rottman, policy director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press, dismissed the case against the Post. </p>
<p>“Advertising by news organizations is a legitimate, routine press
function and receives strong First Amendment protections in the courts,”
he told VOA in a text message.  </p>
<p>Trump’s campaign and office did not reply to VOA’s multiple requests
for comment on the recent legal actions or the former president’s press
freedom record for this story. </p>
<p>Power to revoke broadcasting licenses</p>
<p>Trump has had a contentious relationship with some news outlets since
running for president in 2015. Often referring to journalists as “the
enemy of the people,” he has complained on social media and in speeches
about ideological bias and unfair treatment of conservative voices,
while also championing media that reflect his views. </p>
<p>He has pledged to jail journalists who do not name confidential
sources on stories he believed to have national security implication,
and suggested changing First Amendment protections to allow punishing
people who burn the American flag or criticize Supreme Court judges.
 </p>
<p>Trump had previously threatened to revoke CBS’s broadcast license if
elected. On his social media platform, Truth Social, he said “60
Minutes” had “created the Greatest Fraud in Broadcast History” and that
CBS should lose its license because it is “corrupt.” </p>
<p>Following his September debate against Harris on ABC News, Trump
called for that network’s broadcasting license to be revoked over what
he described as “unfair” fact-checking.</p>
<p>And as president in 2017, Trump threatened to revoke NBC’s
broadcasting license after the outlet reported a dispute between the
then-president and his military advisers about the size of the nuclear
arsenal.</p>
<p>In an October statement, the chair of the Federal Communications
Commission, which issues licenses, said the FCC “does not and will not
revoke licenses for broadcast stations simply because a political
candidate disagrees with or dislikes content or coverage.”  </p>
<p>Many of Trump’s supporters applaud his attacks on the media,
reflecting in part the steep erosion of trust in the press that public
opinion polls have tracked among many Americans for years.</p>
<p>But media analysts say Trump’s attacks echo how leaders in countries
like Hungary have undermined journalistic norms.</p>
<p>Clayton Weimers, the head of the U.S. office of Reporters Without
Borders, or RSF, said the lawsuit against CBS “looks like a publicity
stunt.”</p>
<p>But, he said, “It reinforces the very real threats that Trump has
issued to use the U.S. government to punish media outlets he doesn’t
like should he regain the White House.”</p>
<p>Leading up to and during his time as president, Trump published more
than 2,000 posts on social media that the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker
classified as anti-media. After Trump left the White House, his
anti-media rhetoric has continued.</p>
<p>Between September 1 and October 24, Trump verbally insulted, attacked
or threatened the media at least 108 times in public, RSF found in a
study. RSF has not conducted a similar study about Vice President Harris
because she does not make those kinds of anti-media statements, Weimers
said.</p>
<p>“By just accepting that as a piece of this political moment, I do
think there’s a risk that the American public has grown numb to how
serious it is, what an aberration it is, and how dangerous it could be
going forward,” Weimers said in a phone interview.  </p>
<p>Trump’s public attacks against the media frequently play well with
his supporters. At many of his rallies, the candidate often pauses after
criticizing the media to give his supporters a chance to jeer at the
reporters who are present.</p>
<p>Last month, Trump’s presidential campaign sent VOA a statement that
Republican National Committee spokesperson Taylor Rogers originally
provided to the conservative news site The Daily Caller. In it, Rogers
described Trump as a “champion for free speech” and said that “everyone
was safer under President Trump, including journalists” because of
“commonsense law.”</p>
<p>Newspaper endorsements</p>
<p>Record-low distrust in media in the U.S. is what billionaire and
Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos pointed to in an op-ed last week to
explain why the newspaper would not make an endorsement in this year’s
presidential election. </p>
<p>Days before the Post’s announcement, the billionaire owner of the Los
Angeles Times said his newspaper would not endorse a candidate so as not
to worsen political divisions.</p>
<p>For some media analysts, the decisions by the Post and the Los
Angeles Times have only crystallized concerns about what a second Trump
presidency would mean for press freedom in the United States.</p>
<p>Marty Baron, the Post’s former executive editor, said he thinks it
would have been fine if the Post made this decision a year or two ago.
But announcing the decision so close to the election was a “betrayal of
core principles of the Post,” Baron told VOA in a phone interview.  </p>
<p>“This is an invitation to further intimidation and bullying, and I
think that that’s what we would likely see if Trump were to be back in
the White House,” Baron added.</p>
<p>Margaret Sullivan, a media columnist with The Guardian who previously
worked as a media columnist at the Post, said the decision does not
reflect the newspaper’s ideals.</p>
<p>“This seemed to be a move from above that wasn’t about the content of
the endorsement,” she told VOA in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Baron and Sullivan told VOA they’re concerned that the
non-endorsement is a harbinger of what’s to come for press freedom if
Trump is re-elected.  </p>
<p>“I’m very concerned about intimidation of the press,” Sullivan said.
“And frankly, I’m very concerned about the press preemptively acting
like they’ve been intimidated when they have the ability to stand
firm.”</p>
<p>Both of Trump’s legal challenges against the Post and CBS are
expected to take weeks or months before they reach a resolution.</p>

The COP16 biodiversity summit in Colombia came to a disappointing close

were high hopes that the meeting would produce a roadmap for protecting
large swathes of land, water, and degraded ecosystems by 2030, but rich
nations blocked a proposal for a new fund to help pay for poorer
nations’ efforts. “This COP was meant to be a status check on countries’
progress toward saving nature and all indicators on that status are

<li>Canada to propose plan to cap oil and gas emissions
</h3>
<p>
Canada, the fourth-largest oil producer in the world, will publish a
proposal today to cap greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel energy
production. Energy is Canada’s highest-polluting sector, with oil and
gas accounting for a quarter of all emissions and producing “more than
double the greenhouse gas pollution than all other industries combined,”
according to Hermine Landry, a spokeswoman for Environment Minister
Steven Guilbeault. Landry
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/canada-unveil-proposed-emissions-cap-oil-gas-sector-monday-2024-11-03/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_w5bHuGnm3BxbmeNfomJb2hs-MxSU7al-IInzGT7dCdFrgBjnvpV8MsPvYDLA4y3mckFUp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>

pollution, though an earlier report from Deloitte

the cap would likely nudge companies to cut production. Canada has a
goal of curbing emissions by at least 40% compared to 2005 levels by the
end of the decade. Whether this new proposal comes into effect will
depend largely on the outcome of the next election, set to be held in
late 2025.

<h2 id="music-titan-quincy-jones-dies-at-91">Music titan Quincy Jones
dies at 91</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged
from producing Michael Jackson’s historic “Thriller” album to writing
prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank
Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died
at 91. </p>
<p>Jones’ publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his
home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his
family. </p>
<p>“Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our
father and brother Quincy Jones’ passing,” the family said in a
statement. “And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we
celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be
another like him.” </p>
<p>Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to
the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black
executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical
catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and
song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own
at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the
entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to
him. </p>
<p>Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars
and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with
Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella
Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for “Roots” and “In the Heat of the
Night,” organized President Bill Clinton’s first inaugural celebration
and oversaw the all-star recording of “We Are the World,” the 1985
charity record for famine relief in Africa. </p>
<p>Lionel Richie, who co-wrote “We Are the World” and was among the
featured singers, would call Jones “the master orchestrator.” </p>
<p>In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78
rpm, top honors likely go to his productions with Jackson: “Off the
Wall,” “Thriller” and “Bad” were albums near-universal in their style
and appeal. Jones’ versatility and imagination helped set off the
explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the
“King of Pop.” On such classic tracks as “Billie Jean” and “Don’t Stop
’Til You Get Enough,” Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape
out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&amp;B and jazz and African chants. For
“Thriller,” some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones,
who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing
“Beat It” and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the
title track. </p>
<p>“Thriller” sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has
contended with the Eagles’ “Greatest Hits 1971-1975” among others as the
best-selling album of all time. </p>
<p>“If an album doesn’t do well, everyone says ‘it was the producers
fault’; so if it does well, it should be your ‘fault,’ too,” Jones said
in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. “The tracks don’t
just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill,
experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.” </p>
<p>The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001
autobiography “Q”, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an
honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for “Roots.” He also
received France’s Legion d’Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the
Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to
American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, “Listen Up:
The Lives of Quincy Jones” and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones.
His memoir made him a best-selling author.</p>

id="boeing-machinists-hold-contract-vote-that-could-end-their-7-week-strike">Boeing
machinists hold contract vote that could end their 7-week strike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Unionized factory workers at Boeing are voting Monday whether to
accept a contract offer or to continue their strike, which has lasted
more than seven weeks and shut down production of most Boeing passenger
planes.</p>
<p>A vote to ratify the contract would clear the way for the aerospace
giant to resume airplane production and bring in much-needed cash. If
members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers vote for a third time to reject Boeing’s offer, it would plunge
the company into further financial peril and uncertainty.</p>
<p>In its latest proposed contract, Boeing is offering pay raises of 38%
over four years, as well as ratification and productivity bonuses. IAM
District 751, which represents Boeing workers in the Pacific Northwest,
endorsed the proposal, which is slightly more generous than one the
machinists voted down nearly two weeks ago.</p>
<p>“It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently
declare victory,” the union district said in scheduling Monday’s vote.
“We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn’t be right as
we have achieved so much success.”</p>
<p>Union officials said they think they have gotten all they can though
negotiations and a strike, and that if the current proposal is rejected,
future offers from Boeing might be worse. They expect to announce the
result of the vote Monday night.</p>
<p>Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would
rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer. </p>
<p>Pensions were a key issue for workers who rejected the company’s
previous offers in September and October. In its new offer, Boeing did
not meet their demand to restore a pension plan that was frozen nearly a
decade ago. </p>
<p>If machinists ratify the latest offer, they would return to work by
Nov. 12, according to the union.</p>
<p>The strike began Sept. 13 with an overwhelming 94.6% rejection of
Boeing’s offer to raise pay by 25% over four years — far less than the
union’s original demand for 40% wage increases over three years.</p>
<p>Machinists voted down another offer — 35% raises over four years, but
still no revival of pensions — on Oct. 23, the same day Boeing reported
a third-quarter loss of more than $6 billion. However, the offer
received 36% support, up from 5% for the mid-September proposal, making
Boeing leaders believe they were close to a deal.</p>
<p>Boeing says average annual pay for machinists is $75,608 and would
rise to $119,309 in four years under the current offer.</p>
<p>In addition to a slightly larger pay increases, the proposed contract
includes a $12,000 contract ratification bonus, up from $7,000 in the
previous offer, and larger company contributions to employees’ 401(k)
retirement accounts.</p>
<p>Boeing also promises to build its next airline plane in the Seattle
area. Union officials fear the company may withdraw the pledge if
workers reject the new offer.</p>
<p>The strike drew the attention of the Biden administration. Acting
Labor Secretary Julie Su intervened in the talks several times,
including last week.</p>
<p>The labor standoff — the first strike by Boeing machinists since an
eight-week walkout in 2008 — is the latest setback in a volatile year
for the company.</p>
<p>Boeing came under several federal investigations after a door plug
blew off a 737 Max plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January.
Federal regulators put limits on Boeing airplane production that they
said would last until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at
the company.</p>
<p>The door plug incident renewed concerns about the safety of the 737
Max. Two of the plane’s crashed less than five months apart in 2018 and
2019, killing 346 people. The CEO whose effort to fix the company failed
announced in March that he would step down. In July, Boeing agreed to
plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving regulators who
approved the 737 Max.</p>
<p>As the strike dragged on, new CEO Kelly Ortberg announced about
17,000 layoffs and a stock sale to prevent the company’s credit rating
from being cut to junk status. S&amp;P and Fitch Ratings said last week
that the $24.3 billion in stock and other securities will cover upcoming
debt payments and reduce the risk of a credit downgrade.</p>
<p>The strike has created a cash crunch by depriving Boeing of money it
gets when delivering new planes to airlines. The walkout at Seattle-area
factories stopped production of the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling
plane, and the 777 or “triple-seven” jet and the cargo-carrying version
of its 767 plane.</p>
<p>Ortberg has conceded that trust in Boeing has declined, the company
has too much debt, and “serious lapses in our performance” have
disappointed many airline customers. But, he says, the company’s
strengths include a backlog of airplane orders valued at a half-trillion
dollars.</p>

storms injure at least 11 and leave thousands without power</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OKLAHOMA CITY — Severe storms and tornadoes battered Oklahoma early
Sunday, tossing cars and ripping roofs off buildings in the middle of
the night and leaving tens of thousands of homes and businesses without
power. Among numerous injuries, 11 people required hospitalization,
authorities said.</p>
<p>Much of the damage was reported in and around the state capital of
Oklahoma City, near the state’s center, but also scattered elsewhere
around the state. The early morning storms set off tornado warnings that
extended south to the Arkansas state line. Heavy rains caused flash
flooding in some areas and one lightning-sparked house fire was
reported.</p>
<p>More than 99,000 Oklahoma homes and businesses lost power during the
overnight storms. By late Sunday afternoon, that number was reduced to
around 24,000. No fatalities had been reported.</p>
<p>Richard Thompson, forecast chief for the National Weather Service
Storm Prediction Center in Oklahoma, said he believes six or more
tornadoes hit the state overnight. Meanwhile, forecasters warned state
residents to brace for more heavy rain and possible severe weather
through Monday.</p>
<p>“We’re not done with it yet,” he said.</p>
<p>A tornado watch for much of the central and southeast part of
Oklahoma was in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday. Other areas were under
thunderstorm or flood watches.</p>
<p>In the town of Choctaw, east of Oklahoma City, firefighters and
police officers went door to door Sunday morning to ask about
injuries.</p>
<p>“It leveled a complete neighborhood in Choctaw,” the town’s mayor,
Chad Allcox, told The Associated Press. He added that debris hindered
search and rescue efforts. “Power lines are down everywhere … a lot of
the roads are blocked, hard to get through. Very large trees blocking
roadways.”</p>
<p>Oklahoma City Fire Department spokesman Scott Douglas told the AP
that heavy rain and the lingering threat of tornadoes in the early
morning darkness complicated early search and rescue efforts. He
described a first sweep of hard-hit areas around 1:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Emergency workers had to free two people from an overturned mobile
home, including a woman injured when an air conditioner landed on her
leg, Douglas said.</p>
<p>The scale of the damage came into focus as daylight broke. Local
television footage showed downed power lines, walls peeled off homes,
overturned vehicles and neighborhood streets littered with debris.</p>
<p>Douglas said 11 people were transported to hospitals with injuries
that were not life-threatening. “There were some other minor injuries,
some walking wounded, that were going to get treatment on their own,”
Douglas said.</p>
<p>Allcox said early weather warnings and tornado sirens likely saved
lives.</p>

tech firms warn Vietnam’s planned law to hamper data centers, social
media</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HANOI, Vietnam — U.S. tech companies have warned Vietnam’s government
that a draft law to tighten rules on data protection and limit data
transfers abroad would hamper social media platforms and data center
operators from growing their businesses in the country.</p>
<p>The Southeast Asian nation with a population of 100 million is one of
the world’s largest markets for Facebook and other online platforms, and
is aiming to exponentially increase its data center industry with
foreign investment in coming years.</p>
<p>The draft law “will make it challenging for tech companies, social
media platforms and data center operators to reach the customers that
rely on them daily,” said Jason Oxman, who chairs the Information
Technology Industry Council (ITI), a trade association representing big
tech companies including Meta, Google and data centers operator
Equinix.</p>
<p>The draft law, being discussed in parliament, is also designed to
ease authorities’ access to information and was urged by the ministry of
public security, Vietnamese and foreign officials said.</p>
<p>The ministry of public security and the information ministry did not
respond to attempts to contact them via email and phone.</p>
<p>Vietnam’s parliament is discussing the law in its current month-long
session and is scheduled to pass it on Nov. 30 “if eligible,” according
to its program, which is subject to changes.</p>
<p>Existing Vietnamese regulations already limit cross-border transfers
of data under some circumstances, but they are rarely enforced.</p>
<p>It is unclear how the new law, if adopted, would impact foreign
investment in the country. Reuters reported in August that Google was
considering setting up a large data center in southern Vietnam before
the draft law was presented in parliament.</p>
<p>Research firm BMI had said Vietnam could become a major regional
player in the data center industry as limits on foreign ownership are
set to end next year.</p>
<p>Among the provisions of the draft law is prior authorization for the
transfer overseas of “core data” and “important data,” which are
currently vaguely defined.</p>
<p>“That will hinder foreign business operations,” Oxman told
Reuters.</p>
<p>Tech companies and other firms favor cross-border data flows to cut
costs and improve services, but multiple jurisdictions, including the
European Union and China, have limited those transfers, saying that
allows them to better protect privacy and sensitive information.</p>
<p>Under the draft law, companies will have to share data with Vietnam’s
ruling Communist Party and state organizations in multiple, vaguely
defined cases including for “fulfilling a specific task in the public
interest.”</p>
<p>The U.S. tech industry has raised concerns with Vietnamese
authorities over “the undue expansion of government access to data,”
Oxman said.</p>
<p>The new law “would cause significant compliance challenges for most
private sector companies,” said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi, noting talks were underway to
persuade authorities to “reconsider the rushed legislative process” for
the law.</p>

Rico prepares for Election Day as a third-party candidate makes
history</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — The two parties that have dominated Puerto
Rican politics for decades are losing their grip as they face the
stiffest competition yet from a younger generation fed up with the
island’s corruption, chronic power outages and mismanagement of public
funds.</p>
<p>For the first time in the island’s governor’s race, a third-party
candidate has a powerful second lead in the polls ahead of the U.S.
territory’s election Tuesday — and some experts say there’s a
possibility he could win.</p>
<p>“This election is already historic,” said political analyst and
university professor Jorge Schmidt Nieto. “It already marks a before and
an after.”</p>
<p>Juan Dalmau is running for Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and the
Citizen Victory Movement, established in 2019. A Gaither international
poll this month shows Dalmau closing in on Jenniffer González, a member
of the New Progressive Party and Puerto Rico’s representative in
Congress. She beat Gov. Pedro Pierluisi in their party’s primary in
June.</p>
<p>Gaither’s poll shows Dalmau with 29% of support versus González’s 31%
as he nearly caught up with her since a different poll in July showed
him with only 24% compared with González’s 43%. Coming in third was
Jesús Manuel Ortiz, of the Popular Democratic Party, followed by Javier
Jiménez of Project Dignity, a conservative party created in 2019.</p>
<p>Under pressure</p>
<p>Puerto Rican politics revolve around the island’s status, and up
until 2016, the New Progressive Party, which supports statehood, and the
Popular Democratic Party, which supports the status quo, would split at
least 90% of all votes during general elections, Schmidt said.</p>
<p>But that year, U.S. Congress created a federal control board to
oversee Puerto Rico’s finances after the government announced it was
unable to pay a more than $70 billion public debt load. In 2017, Puerto
Rico filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.</p>
<p>The debt was accrued through decades of corruption, mismanagement and
excessive borrowing, with Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority still
struggling to restructure its more than $9 billion debt, the largest of
any government agency.</p>
<p>Puerto Ricans have largely rejected and resented the board, created a
year before Hurricane Maria slammed into the island as a powerful
Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.</p>
<p>In 2020, Pierluisi won but received only 33% of votes. His opponent
from the Popular Democratic Party received 32%. It marked the first time
either party failed to reach 40% of votes.</p>
<p>The power outages that have persisted since the elections, coupled
with the slow pace of hurricane reconstruction, have frustrated and
angered voters.</p>
<p>Under Pierluisi, the government signed contracts with two companies,
Luma Energy and Genera PR, which together oversee the generation,
transmission and distribution of power. Outages have persisted, with the
companies blaming a grid that was already crumbling before the hurricane
hit due to a lack of maintenance and investment.</p>
<p>“Disastrous things have occurred during this four-year term,
especially with the electric energy,” Schmidt said. “It has affected
everyone, regardless of social class.”</p>
<p>Voters, he said, are viewing Tuesday’s elections “as a moment of
revenge.”</p>
<p>Dalmau said he would oust both companies in an “organized fashion”
within six months if he becomes governor. Ortiz said he would cancel
Luma’s contract, while González has called for the creation of an
“energy czar” that would review potential Luma contractual breaches
while another operator is found.</p>
<p>However, no contract can be canceled without prior approval of the
federal control board and Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau.</p>
<p>The candidates also are under pressure to create affordable housing,
lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crimes,
boost Puerto Rico’s economy, with the island locked out of capital
markets since 2015, and improve a crumbling health care system as
thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.</p>
<p>Dalmau, who suspended his campaign for two weeks in mid-October after
his wife had emergency brain surgery, also has said he would eliminate
tax breaks for wealthy U.S. citizens from the mainland.</p>
<p>Apathy dominates</p>
<p>Despite their promises to turn Puerto Rico around, candidates face
persistent voter apathy.</p>
<p>In 2008, 1.9 million out of 2.5 million registered voters
participated in that year’s election, compared with 1.3 million out of
2.3 million in 2020.</p>
<p>This year, nearly 99,000 new voters registered and more than 87,000
reactivated their status, according to Puerto Rico’s State Elections
Commission.</p>
<p>“A much higher number was expected,” Schmidt said.</p>
<p>He noted that those middle age and older favor González and her
pro-statehood party, while those younger than 45 “overwhelmingly” favor
Dalmau, which means that if a majority of young voters participate on
Tuesday and fewer older ones do so, he might have a chance of
winning.</p>
<p>The Bad Bunny factor</p>
<p>The months leading up to the Nov. 5 elections have been
contentious.</p>
<p>Reggaetón superstar Bad Bunny paid for dozens of billboard ads
criticizing Puerto Rico’s two main parties. In response, the governor’s
New Progressive Party financed a billboard ad suggesting an obscenity in
reference to Bad Bunny.</p>
<p>On Friday, the singer published a page-long letter in a local
newspaper deriding González’s pro-statehood party.</p>
<p>While the artist has not endorsed any local officials, the sole
person he recently began following on Instagram was Dalmau.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he briefly appeared at Dalmau’s closing campaign. A hush
fell over a crowd of tens of thousands of people as Bad Bunny spoke
before singing, saying he doesn’t endorse a specific candidate or
party.</p>
<p>“My party is the people. … My party is Puerto Rico,” he said as he
later praised the alliance between Puerto Rico’s Independence Party and
the Citizen Victory Movement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a so-called “cemetery of corruption” was set up Thursday
in the capital, San Juan, featuring large black-and-white pictures of
nearly a dozen politicians from the island’s two main parties who have
been charged or sentenced by federal authorities in recent years. It was
created by Eva Prados with the Citizen Victory Movement, who is running
for Puerto Rico’s House. By Friday, police reported that the pictures
were destroyed or stolen.</p>
<p>As the race heats up, the number of formal complaints about alleged
electoral crimes also has increased. These include people who say they
received confirmations for early voting when they made no such
request.</p>
<p>A persistent question</p>
<p>Voters on Tuesday also will be asked for a seventh time what Puerto
Rico’s political status should be.</p>
<p>The nonbinding referendum will feature three choices: statehood,
independence and independence with free association, under which issues
like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would
be negotiated.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, a change in status requires approval from
the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>The push for a change in status doesn’t depend on whether Kamala
Harris or Donald Trump win in the U.S. mainland.</p>

id="federal-judge-lets-iowa-challenge-voter-rolls-may-affect-naturalized-citizens">Federal
judge lets Iowa challenge voter rolls; may affect naturalized
citizens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — A federal judge ruled Sunday that Iowa can
continue challenging the validity of hundreds of ballots from potential
noncitizens even though critics said the effort threatens the voting
rights of people who’ve recently become U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher, an appointee of President Joe
Biden, sided with the state in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union in the Iowa capital of Des Moines on behalf of the
League of Latin American Citizens of Iowa and four recently naturalized
citizens. The four were on the state’s list of questionable
registrations to be challenged by local elections officials.</p>
<p>The state’s Republican attorney general and secretary of state argued
that investigating and potentially removing 2,000 names would prevent
illegal voting by noncitizens. GOP officials across the U.S. have made
possible voting by noncitizen immigrants a key election-year talking
point even though it is rare. Their focus has come with former President
Donald Trump falsely suggesting that his opponents already are
committing fraud to prevent his return to the White House.</p>
<p>In his ruling Sunday, Locher pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision
four days prior that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its
voter registration rolls even though it was impacting some U.S.
citizens. He also cited the Supreme Court’s recent refusal to review a
Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on state electoral laws surrounding
provisional ballots. Those Supreme Court decisions advise lower courts
to “act with great caution before awarding last-minute injunctive
relief,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Locher also said the state’s effort does not remove anyone from the
voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional
ballots.</p>
<p>In a statement Sunday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican,
celebrated the ruling.</p>
<p>“Today’s ruling is a victory for election integrity,” Reynolds said.
“In Iowa, while we encourage all citizens to vote, we will enforce the
law and ensure those votes aren’t cancelled out by the illegal vote of a
non-citizen.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the ACLU said the organization did not immediately
have a comment.</p>
<p>After Locher had a hearing in the ACLU’s lawsuit Friday, Secretary of
State Paul Pate and state Attorney General Brenna Bird issued a
statement saying that Iowa had about 250 noncitizens registered to vote,
but the Biden administration wouldn’t provide data about them.</p>
<p>Pate told reporters last month that his office was forced to rely
upon a list of potential noncitizens from the Iowa Department of
Transportation. It named people who registered to vote or voted after
identifying themselves as noncitizens living in the U.S. legally when
they previously sought driver’s licenses.</p>
<p>“Today’s court victory is a guarantee for all Iowans that their votes
will count and not be canceled out by illegal votes,” Bird said in the
statement issued after Sunday’s decision.</p>
<p>But ACLU attorneys said Iowa officials were conceding that most of
the people on the list are eligible to vote and shouldn’t have been
included. They said the state was violating naturalized citizens’ voting
rights by wrongfully challenging their registrations and investigating
them if they cast ballots.</p>
<p>Pate issued his directive Oct. 22, only two weeks before the Nov. 5
election, and ACLU attorneys argued that federal law prohibits such a
move so close to Election Day.</p>
<p>“It’s very clear that the secretary of state understands that this
list consists primarily or entirely of U.S. citizens who have exactly
the same fundamental core right to vote as the rest of us citizen Iowa
voters,” Rita Bettis Austen, the legal director of the ACLU of Iowa,
said during a Zoom briefing for reporters after the hearing.</p>
<p>The people on the state’s list of potential noncitizens may have
become naturalized </p>
<p>citizens after their statements to the Department of
Transportation.</p>
<p>Pate’s office told county elections officials to challenge their
ballots and have them cast provisional ballots instead. That would leave
the decision of whether they will be counted to local officials upon
further review, with voters having seven days to provide proof of their
U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Locher wrote that Pate backed away from some of his
original hardline positions at an earlier court hearing. Pate’s attorney
said the Secretary of State is no longer aiming to require local
election officials to challenge the votes of each person on his list or
force voters on the list to file provisional ballots even when they have
proven citizenship at a polling place.</p>
<p>Federal law and states already make it illegal for noncitizens to
vote, and the first question on Iowa’s voter registration form asks
whether a person is a U.S. citizen. The form also requires potential
voters to sign a statement saying they are citizens, warning them that
if they lie, they can be convicted of a felony, punishable by up to five
years in prison.</p>
<p>Locher’s ruling also came after a federal judge had halted a similar
program in Alabama challenged by civil rights groups and the U.S.
Department of Justice. Testimony from state officials in that case
showed that roughly 2,000 of the more than 3,200 voters who were made
inactive were actually legally registered citizens.</p>
<p>In Iowa’s case, noncitizens who are registered are potentially only a
tiny fraction of the state’s 2.2 million registered voters.</p>
<p>But Locher wrote that it appears to be undisputed that some portion
of the names on Pate’s list are registered voters who are not U.S.
citizens. Even if that portion is small, an injunction effectively would
force local election officials to let ineligible voters cast ballots, he
added.</p>
<p>Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in a sprawling legal
fight over this year’s election for months. Republicans have filed
dozens of lawsuits challenging various aspects of vote-casting after
being chastised repeatedly by judges in 2020 for bringing complaints
about how the election was run only after votes were tallied. Democrats
have their own team of dozens of staffers fighting GOP cases.</p>

Nageeye of Netherlands and Sheila Chepkirui of Kenya win New York City
Marathon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Abdi Nageeye of the Netherlands won the men’s race at the
New York City Marathon on Sunday and Sheila Chepkirui of Kenya took the
women’s event.</p>
<p>Both runners pulled away from their closest competitors in the final
few hundred meters to come away with their first victories in the
race.</p>
<p>Nageeye was step-for-step with 2022 champion Evans Chebet before
using a burst heading into Central Park to come away with the win in 2
hours, 7 minutes, 39 seconds. Chebet finished 6 seconds behind.</p>
<p>Chepkirui was running New York for the first time and pulled away
from defending champion Hellen Obiri in the women’s race. Chepkirui
started to run marathons in 2022. She finished the race in 2:24.35.
Obiri finished nearly 15 seconds behind.</p>
<p>Obiri was looking to be the first repeat champion since Mary Keitany
of Kenya won three in a row from 2014-16. Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenya
finished third, giving the African nation the top three spots.</p>
<p>Tamirat Tola, the men’s defending champion and Paris Olympic gold
medalist, finished fourth, right behind Albert Korir.</p>
<p>The top Americans finished sixth in both races. Conner Mantz led the
men and Sara Vaughn the women. Vaughn was in the lead group heading into
Mile 20 when they entered the Bronx before she dropped off the lead
pack.</p>
<p>Vaughn was geared up to run Chicago before COVID-19 kept her from
competing in that race. She was a late addition to this marathon.</p>
<p>The day got started with an upset in the men’s wheelchair race as
three-time defending champion Marcel Hug was beaten by Daniel Romanchuk,
who won in 2018 and 2019. Susannah Scaroni won the women’s wheelchair
race. It was her second victory in New York, also taking the 2022 race
and giving Americans winners in both events — the first time that has
happened.</p>
<p>The 26.2-mile course took runners through all five boroughs of New
York, starting in Staten Island and ending in Central Park. This is the
48th year the race has been in all five boroughs. Before that, the route
was completely in Central Park when it began in 1970. The first race had
only 55 finishers while more than 50,000 are expected to compete this
year.</p>
<p>The weather was perfect to run in with temperatures in the lower 40s
when the race started. Last year, it was 61 degrees when the race
started.</p>

id="will-people-leave-florida-after-devastating-hurricanes-history-suggests-not">Will
people leave Florida after devastating hurricanes? History suggests
not</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>orlando, florida — The news rippled through Treasure Island, Florida,
almost like a third storm: The mayor planned to move off the barrier
island a month after Hurricane Helene flooded tens of thousands of homes
along the Gulf Coast and two weeks after Hurricane Milton also ravaged
the state. </p>
<p>Mayor Tyler Payne’s home had been flooded and damaged beyond repair,
he explained in a message to Treasure Island residents, and he and his
husband can’t afford to rebuild. He also was stepping down as
mayor. </p>
<p>“While it pains my heart to make this decision in the midst of our
recovery from Hurricanes Helene and Milton, this is the best decision
for me and my family,” Payne, who had held the office for more than
three years and was a fourth-generation Treasure Island resident, said
Monday. </p>
<p>Up and down Florida’s storm-battered Gulf Coast, residents are making
the same calculations about whether they should stay or go. Can they
afford to rebuild? What will insurance cover? People considering moving
to Florida are contemplating whether it’s worth the risk to come to a
hurricane-prone state. </p>
<p>These existential questions about Florida’s appeal are raised
regularly after the state experiences a busy hurricane season, such as
in 2004, when four hurricanes crossed the Sunshine State. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If moves into the state offer any answer, then hurricanes have served
little as deterrents. Florida’s population has grown by one-third to 23
million residents in the two decades since Charley, Frances, Jeanne and
Ivan ravaged the state. Last year, Florida added more than 365,000
residents, second only to Texas among states. </p>
<p>On the other hand, there are signs that Florida’s white-hot real
estate market has cooled. Sales of single-family homes were down 12% in
September compared with the same time in the previous year. But interest
rates, rising home prices and skyrocketing insurance costs likely played
bigger roles than the recent hurricanes. </p>
<p>“Florida recovers much faster than you think,” said Brad O’Connor,
chief economist for Florida Realtors. </p>
<p>What happens after a storm? </p>
<p>Studies of hurricanes along the Gulf Coast have shown that any
outbound migration tends to be short-lived, and if people do leave, it’s
usually a short-distance move, such as from a barrier island to the
mainland. Older people with more financial resources are more likely to
return to devastated communities. </p>
<p>When it comes to the housing market, there may be an initial shock to
the supply as homeowners wait for reimbursement from insurance companies
to fix up their homes or sell them. </p>
<p>But in the three years after a hurricane, home prices in areas of
Florida that were hit by one are 5% higher on average than elsewhere in
the state because of smaller supply, according to a study of the impact
of hurricanes on Florida’s housing market from 2000 to 2016. New
homeowners tend to be richer than previous ones because wealthier buyers
can absorb price increases. </p>
<p>Other factors that determine how quickly communities bounce back
include whether homes were insured, the speed of insurance
reimbursements, and whether there are enough construction workers.
Because of stricter building codes implemented in the years after
Hurricane Andrew devastated South Florida in 1992, newer homes withstand
hurricanes better than older ones, O’Connor said. </p>
<p>“If a property is damaged and uninsured, and the homeowner says, ‘I
don’t want to deal with this,’ there are always people willing to scoop
up that property because it’s valuable land,” he said. “People build new
homes under the new codes and there’s less of an impact from
hurricanes.” </p>
<p>Short term and long term </p>
<p>Recent storms offer examples what happens to communities, both short
term and longer term. </p>
<p>In Lee County, home to Fort Myers, Hurricane Ian made landfall two
years ago in what had been one of the fastest growing parts of the
United States. Population growth slowed afterward to 1.5% from 4.4%
before the storm. The number of households dropped from about 340,000 to
about 326,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>
<p>In 2019, three-quarters of all United Van Lines truck moves were into
Lee County and a quarter were outbound, but that dropped to two-thirds
inbound and a third outbound in 2023 to 2024, the company told The
Associated Press. </p>
<p>The share of people in their late 20s, 30s and early 40s increased,
as did the share of men with no spouse or partner, reflecting an influx
of construction and recovery workers. The share of the white population
dropped while it increased for the Hispanic community. The percentage of
utility and transportation workers in the county jumped, according to
the Census Bureau. </p>
<p>Bay County in the Florida Panhandle, where Michael made landfall as
the first Category 5 hurricane on the continental U.S. in a quarter
century in 2018, offers a portrait of longer term trends. Four years
later, Bay County had recovered its pre-hurricane population, which
dropped almost 6% in the year after the storm. </p>
<p>Since Michael, the county has grown more diverse, wealthier and
older, with the median age rising from 39.6 to 41.4 and more people
identifying as multiracial or Hispanic. The share of households earning
$200,000 or more went from 4.3% before the hurricane to 8.3% in 2022 in
a sign that some of the least affluent residents couldn’t afford to
rebuild or return. </p>
<p>Treasure Island’s mayor </p>
<p>In his message to constituents, Payne said he would still stay
connected to the Treasure Island community because his parents plan to
rebuild on the barrier island, one of a string of beach towns along the
Gulf of Mexico west of St. Petersburg known for motels, restaurants and
bars lining the street. Payne, an attorney who also is an executive in
his family’s eyeglass-lens manufacturing business, said in his message
that his decision to move was “difficult.” </p>
<p>“I completely empathize with the difficult decisions that are facing
so many of our residents,” he said.</p>

id="opponents-use-parental-rights-anti-trans-messages-to-fight-abortion-ballot-measures">Opponents
use parental rights, anti-trans messages to fight abortion ballot
measures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — Billboards with the words “STOP Child Gender Surgery.”
Pamphlets warning about endangering minors. “PROTECT PARENT RIGHTS”
plastered on church bulletins.</p>
<p>As voters in nine states determine whether to enshrine abortion
rights in their state constitutions, opponents are using parental rights
and anti-transgender messages to try to undermine support for the ballot
proposals.</p>
<p>The measures do not mention gender-affirming surgeries, and legal
experts say changing existing parental notification and consent laws
regarding abortions and gender-affirming care for minors would require
court action. But anti-abortion groups hoping to end a losing streak at
the ballot box have turned to the type of language many Republican
candidates nationwide are using in their own campaigns as they seek to
rally conservative Christian voters.</p>
<p>“It’s really outlandish to suggest that this amendment relates to
things like gender reassignment surgery for minors,” said Matt Harris,
an associate professor of political science at Park University in
Parkville, Missouri, a state where abortion rights are on the
ballot.</p>
<p>Since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated constitutional protections
for abortion, voters in seven states, including conservative Kentucky,
Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated
attempts to curtail them.</p>
<p>“If you can’t win by telling the truth, you need a better argument,
even if that means capitalizing on the demonization of trans children,”
said Dr. Alex Dworak, a family medicine physician in Omaha, Nebraska,
where anti-abortion groups are using the strategy.</p>
<p>Tying abortion-rights ballot initiatives to parental rights and
gender-affirming is a strategy borrowed from playbooks used in Michigan
and Ohio, where voters nonetheless enshrined abortion rights in the
state constitutions.</p>
<p>Both states still require minors to get parental consent for
abortions, and the new amendments have not yet impacted parental
involvement or gender-affirming care laws in either state, said David
Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University.</p>
<p>“It’s just recycling the same strategies,” Cohen said.</p>
<p>In addition to Missouri and Nebraska, states where voters are
considering constitutional amendments this fall are Montana, Arizona,
Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada and South Dakota.</p>
<p>Missouri’s abortion ballot measure has especially become a target.
The amendment would bar the government from infringing on a “person’s
fundamental right to reproductive freedom.”</p>
<p>Gov. Mike Parson and U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, both Republicans, have
claimed the proposal would allow minors to get abortions and
gender-affirming surgeries without parental involvement.</p>
<p>The amendment protects reproductive health services, “including but
not limited to” a list of items such as prenatal care, childbirth, birth
control and abortion. It does not mention gender-affirming care, but
Missouri state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, a Republican and lawyer with
the conservative Thomas More Society, said it’s possible that could be
considered reproductive health services.</p>
<p>Several legal experts told The Associated Press that would require a
court ruling that is improbable.</p>
<p>“It would be a real stretch for any court to say that anything
connected with gender-affirming care counts as reproductive health
care,” said Saint Louis University law and gender studies professor
Marcia McCormick. She noted that examples listed as reproductive health
care in the Missouri amendment are all directly related to
pregnancy.</p>
<p>As for parental consent for minors’ abortions, she pointed to an
existing state law that is written similarly to one the U.S. Supreme
Court found constitutional, even before Roe v. Wade was overturned.</p>
<p>Most states have parental involvement laws, whether requiring
parental consent or notification. Even many Democratic-leaning states
with explicit protections for transgender rights require parental
involvement before an abortion or gender-affirming care for minors, said
Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California,
Davis School of Law.</p>
<p>A state high court would have to overturn such laws, which is highly
unlikely from conservative majorities in many of the states with
abortion on the ballot, experts said.</p>
<p>In New York, a proposed amendment to the state constitution would
expand antidiscrimination protections to include ethnicity, national
origin, age, disability and “sex, including sexual orientation, gender
identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and
reproductive health care and autonomy.” The constitution already bans
discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion.</p>
<p>The measure does not mention abortion. But because it is broader, it
could be easier for opponents to attack it. But legal experts noted that
it would also not change existing state laws related to parental
involvement in minors getting abortions or gender-affirming care.</p>
<p>The New York City Bar Association released a fact sheet explaining
that the measure would not impact parental rights, “which are governed
by other developed areas of state and federal law.” Yet the Coalition to
Protect Kids-NY calls it the “Parent Replacement Act.”</p>
<p>Rick Weiland, co-founder of Dakotans for Health, the group behind
South Dakota’s proposed amendment said it uses the Roe v. Wade framework
“almost word for word.”</p>
<p>“All you have to do is look back at what was allowed under Roe, and
there were always requirements for parental involvement,” Weiland
said.</p>
<p>Caroline Woods, spokesperson for the anti-abortion group Life Defense
Fund, said the measure “means loving parents will be completely cut out
of the equation.” Weiland said those claims are part of a “constant
stream of misinformation” from opponents.</p>
<p>If this campaign strategy failed in Michigan and Ohio, why are
anti-abortion groups leaning on it for the November elections?</p>
<p>Ziegler, the University of California, Davis, law professor, said
abortion-rights opponents know they may be “playing on more favorable
terrain” in more conservative states like Missouri or in states like
Florida that have higher thresholds for passing ballot measures.</p>
<p>“Anti-abortion groups are still looking for a winning recipe,”
Ziegler said.</p>

<h2 id="americas-holiday-calendar-is-increasingly-diverse">America’s
holiday calendar is increasingly diverse</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — John Albert’s daughter didn’t go to school on Friday. And
he couldn’t be happier about it.</p>
<p>For the first time, the high school senior and all of New York City’s
public school students have the day off to mark the holiday of Diwali,
celebrated in India and among the global Indian diaspora as the victory
of light over darkness and marked by communities of Hindus, Buddhists,
Jains and Sikhs.</p>
<p>To get the holiday added to the school calendar, where it joins other
days off for Rosh Hashanah, Lunar New Year, Eid al-Fitr as well as
federal holidays like Veterans Day, Christmas and Memorial Day, took
years of pushing from those in New York’s South Asian and Indo-Caribbean
communities like Albert. But it was worth it.</p>
<p>“It was this feeling of wanting to weave our culture into New York,”
he said.</p>
<p>From religious and cultural holidays to region-specific
commemorations to days meant to honor the towering figures and moments
of U.S. history, the holiday calendars across the 50 states and the
country at large are increasingly diverse ones, a reflection of and a
window into the many communities that make up the American whole.</p>
<p>Recognizing holidays creates community</p>
<p>Including a smaller culture’s or community’s special days as
something to recognize in the larger general culture is an act of unity,
said Lauren Strauss, professor of modern Jewish history at American
University.</p>
<p>“By doing that in an American context and by including a Muslim feast
for the end of Ramadan and by including Diwali and including Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur, my goodness. You’re just saying it out loud,
aren’t you? You’re saying that these cultures, these people, they aren’t
visitors, that they are a permanent part of this community, that it is
multicultural and multiethnic,” she said.</p>
<p>“Whether or not you think it’s good or bad, certainly it paints a
different picture of what it means to be American and what the American
calendar is.”</p>
<p>A look at what days are marked as holidays in places around the
country can be a crash course into what matters in those places.
Louisiana, home to New Orleans, takes a day for Mardi Gras. In Hawaii,
the state marks a day for King Kamehameha, who united the Hawaiian
islands, as well as a day for becoming a U.S. state. California and some
other states mark Cesar Chavez Day, named for the civil rights and labor
movement activist. In Texas and in the southwest, there are celebrations
scheduled for Friday marking Day of the Dead, the Mexican cultural
remembrance of loved ones who have passed.</p>
<p>The federal government, in addition to the 11 days that are days off
for federal workers, has a host of days that it marks as national
observances, like Harriet Tubman Day in March and Patriot Day on
September 11.</p>
<p>It keeps greeting card companies on their toes.</p>
<p>“Celebrating holidays and occasions, big or small, with the people we
care about is a vital thread that runs through our shared human
experience,” Kelly Ricker, chief product officer at American Greetings,
said in a statement. The company is “studying and talking to consumers,
continuously” to keep up with the kinds of cards people are looking
for.</p>
<p>When Chris Sargiotto started his greeting card company Apartment 2
Cards about 15 years ago, the holiday offerings were limited to
Christmas and Hanukkah. In recent years, he’s added Kwanzaa and Ramadan,
and is looking to bring Diwali cards onto the roster for next year.</p>
<p>The additional holidays were added because of requests from his
customers, the stores around that country that stock Apartment 2 cards,
a reflection of increasing demand.</p>
<p>“It was stores asking for it because of their customers are asking
for it,” he said. “Whenever we introduce one of these specific cards, it
seems to take off. So I think there definitely is the need for
these.”</p>
<p>There can be challenges as well</p>
<p>But a holiday is not always uncontested. Take mid-October, when the
federal government recognizes Columbus Day. It was added to the federal
calendar in the 20th century after efforts from Italian Americans, who
pushed for it as a way to stake their community’s place in America.</p>
<p>In the decades after though, Indigenous communities pushed back,
citing the impact of colonization on their people and the continuing
challenges. That has led to the spread of Indigenous People’s Day marked
on the same day, which while not a federally recognized is recognized in
states around the country.</p>
<p>And sometimes there’s some learning that needs to happen as well. In
Montville, New Jersey, the police department this month put a post on
Facebook explaining to the community that with Diwali approaching, they
would be more likely to see swastikas, a variation of which are ancient
sacred symbols in some religions and not deployed in the way Hitler and
the Nazis did.</p>
<p>With both Jewish and Hindu communities in the town, it was done in an
attempt to forestall misunderstanding, said Chief Andrew Caggiano, and
has been met with an overwhelmingly positive response.</p>
<p>“It’s a great opportunity,” he said, “to raise awareness about other
cultures that are that are in our community and that are part of our
community at this point.”</p>

id="inspired-by-harris-black-sorority-and-fraternity-members-help-downballot-races">Inspired
by Harris, Black sorority and fraternity members help downballot
races</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Conn. — U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes isn’t a member of the
historically Black sororities and fraternities known as the “Divine
Nine.”</p>
<p>But throughout her hotly contested reelection campaign this year,
Hayes, the first Black woman to represent Connecticut in Congress, has
sometimes felt like she’s a fellow soror, the term used by Black Greek
organizations for sorority sisters. On their own, members have shown up
to call voters, organize fundraisers, knock on doors, cheer Hayes on at
campaign events and even offer pro bono legal help.</p>
<p>“I had people from Massachusetts come in to volunteer,” said Hayes, a
Democrat who is seeking a fourth term. “I’ve had people who had
previously been considering going to a battleground state like
Pennsylvania and are saying, ‘No, we’re going to stay right here and
help out in this race in Connecticut.’”</p>
<p>Downballot candidates like Hayes — particularly Black women — have
benefited from a surge in support this year from volunteers who happen
to be members of Black Greek organizations, many energized by Kamala
Harris’ presidential run. The vice president is a longtime member of
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., which was founded at her alma matter,
Howard University, in 1908. Harris pledged AKA as a senior at Howard in
1986.</p>
<p>Collectively known as the National Pan-Hellenic Council, the nine
historically Black sororities and fraternities are nonpartisan and
barred from endorsing candidates because of their not-for-profit status.
The organizations focus on voter registration drives, civic engagement
and nonelectoral initiatives and are careful not to show favor to a
particular candidate. But many of the groups’ members, as individuals,
have been “extremely active” in federal and state races around the
country this year, said Jaime R. Harrison, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.</p>
<p>“I think that’s a part of the Kamala Harris effect,” Harrison said
during a recent visit to Connecticut.</p>
<p>There were women affiliated with all the D9 sororities on a recent
get-out-the-vote bus tour through New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware and Maryland to support Black women on the ballot.</p>
<p>Along with other volunteers, they knocked on hundreds of doors, made
thousands of calls and sent out hundreds of postcards, urging people to
vote. The trip was organized by the Higher Heights for America PAC, a
nearly 13-year-old organization that works to elect progressive Black
women.</p>
<p>Members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. showed off their crimson
and cream colors while stumping in Maryland for Democratic U.S. Senate
candidate Angela Alsobrooks, a fellow Delta who is in a closely watched
race against former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.</p>
<p>Volunteers who are D9 sorority members also campaigned for Democratic
U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, an honorary member of Alpha
Kappa Alpha who is running for the U.S. Senate. If both candidates were
elected, it would mark the first time two Black women have served in the
Senate simultaneously.</p>
<p>Latosha Johnson, a social worker from Hartford, recently participated
in a get-out-the-vote phone banking session for Hayes along with other
Black women who, like her, are members of Alpha Kappa Alpha. She said
there’s a realization among many Black and brown voters that the stakes
in the election are particularly high. And if Harris wins, she’ll need
allies in Congress, Johnson said.</p>
<p>“If we don’t get her a Congress that’s going to be able to move
things,” Johnson said, “that becomes hard.”</p>
<p>Hayes is in a rematch against former Republican George Logan, a
former state senator who identifies as Afro-Latino but has not seen an
outpouring of support from D9 members, according to his campaign.</p>
<p>Both Harris and former President Donald Trump are courting Black
voters in the final days of the presidential race. Harris’ campaign has
expressed concern about a lack of voting enthusiasm among Black men.</p>
<p>While Trump’s favorability among Black Americans has risen somewhat
since he left office in 2021, two-thirds still identify as Democrats.
About 2 in 10 identify as independents. About 1 in 10 identify as
Republicans, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for
Public Affairs Research.</p>
<p>Voter registration and nonpartisan get-out-the-vote efforts by the
sororities and fraternities, coupled with the mobilization of individual
members, could potentially have an impact on some of these races, said
Darren Davis, a professor of political science at the University of
Notre Dame.</p>
<p>“In local elections, in statewide elections, where the Black vote is
more powerful and concentrated as opposed to in national elections, D9
organizations have this tremendous untapped ability to reach and to
mobilize disaffected voters,” Davis said.</p>
<p>The D9 fraternal groups were founded on U.S. college campuses in the
early 1900s when Black students faced racial prejudice and exclusion
that prevented them from joining existing white sororities and
fraternities. In a tradition that continues today, the organizations
focused on mutual upliftment, educational and personal achievement,
civic engagement and a lifelong commitment to community service.</p>
<p>Many of the fraternities and sororities served as training grounds
for future civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. and Rosa Parks.</p>
<p>Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. member Brandon McGee is a former
Democratic state representative who now leads Connecticut’s Social
Equity Council on cannabis. As the father of two daughters, he is
excited about helping Harris and Hayes win.</p>
<p>“I want my babies to see me working for a female who looks like their
mother. And even beyond looking like their mother, a female,” he said.
“And I want my babies to know, ‘You can do the same thing.’”</p>

id="ballot-box-fires-underscore-concerns-that-conspiracy-theories-make-them-targets">Ballot
box fires underscore concerns that conspiracy theories make them
targets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>atlanta, georgia — Two ballot drop boxes in the Pacific Northwest
were damaged in a suspected arson attack just over a week before
Election Day, destroying hundreds of ballots at one location in the city
of Vancouver in the state of Washington.</p>
<p>At the other, in neighboring Portland, Oregon, it appears a fire
suppression system contained the blaze and limited the number of ballots
damaged to three. Authorities are reviewing surveillance footage as they
try to identify who is responsible.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened, how rules and security measures about drop
boxes vary across the country, and how election conspiracy theories have
undermined confidence in their use.</p>
<p>What do we know?</p>
<p>Police said incendiary devices started the fires in the drop boxes in
Portland and Vancouver. Authorities said evidence showed the fires were
connected and that they also are related to an October 8 incident when
an incendiary device was placed at a different drop box in
Vancouver.</p>
<p>Multnomah County Elections Director Tim Scott said his office was
planning to contact the three voters whose ballots were damaged in
Portland to help them get replacements ballots.</p>
<p>In Vancouver, hundreds of ballots were lost at a ballot box at the
Fisher’s Landing Transit Center when the drop box’s fire suppression
system did not work as intended. Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey said
the box was last emptied at 11 a.m. Saturday. Voters who dropped their
ballots there afterward are being urged to contact the office to get a
new one.</p>
<p>The office will be increasing how frequently it collects ballots and
changing collection times to the evening to keep ballot boxes from
remaining full overnight when vandalism is more likely to occur.</p>
<p>Kimsey described the suspected arson as “a direct attack on
democracy.”</p>
<p>When and where can drop boxes be used?</p>
<p>Drop boxes have been used for years in states such as Colorado,
Oregon, Utah and Washington, where ballots are mailed to all registered
voters.</p>
<p>They grew in popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, as
election officials sought options for voters who wanted to avoid crowded
polling places or were worried about mail delays.</p>
<p>In all, 27 states and the District of Columbia allow ballot drop
boxes, according to data collected by the National Conference of State
Legislatures. Six others don’t have a specific law but allow local
communities to use them.</p>
<p>Placement can vary widely. In some communities, they’re located
inside public buildings, available only during office hours. Elsewhere,
they are outside and accessible at any hour, typically with video
surveillance or someone watching.</p>
<p>Sporadic problems have occurred over the years.</p>
<p>In 2020, a few drop boxes were hit by vehicles, and one in
Massachusetts was damaged by arson. In that case, most of the ballots
were legible enough for voters to be identified and sent replacements. A
drop box also was set on fire in Los Angeles County in 2020.</p>
<p>How should they be secured?</p>
<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency advises
state and local election officials to place drop boxes in convenient,
high-traffic areas that are familiar to voters, such as libraries and
community centers.</p>
<p>If drop boxes are not staffed, they should be secured and locked at
all times, located in well-lit areas and monitored by video surveillance
cameras, the guidance says. Many are bolted to the ground, surveilled
with cameras or confined to public buildings during business hours,
where they can be monitored.</p>
<p>How have conspiracy theories contributed to concerns around drop
boxes?</p>
<p>Ballot drop boxes have been in the spotlight for the last four years,
targeted by right-wing conspiracy theories that falsely claimed they
were responsible for massive voter fraud in 2020.</p>
<p>A debunked film called “2,000 Mules” amplified the claims, exposing
millions to a groundless theory that a ballot harvesting operation was
depositing fraudulent ballots in drop boxes in the dark of night.</p>
<p>An Associated Press survey of state election officials across the
U.S. found there were no widespread problems associated with drop boxes
in 2020.</p>
<p>Paranoia about drop boxes continued into the 2022 midterms, when
armed vigilantes began showing up to monitor them in Arizona and were
restricted by a federal judge. This year, the conservative group True
the Vote launched a website hosting citizen livestreams of drop boxes in
various states.</p>
<p>In Montana, where an important U.S. Senate race is on the ballot,
Republicans recently seized on an unsubstantiated ballot box tampering
claim to raise money off doubts about the electoral process.</p>
<p>How have states responded since the 2020 election?</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers in several states sought to tighten rules around
mail voting after the 2020 election, and much of their focus was on the
use of ballot drop boxes.</p>
<p>Six states have since banned them: Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, South Carolina and South Dakota, according to research
by the Voting Rights Lab, which advocates for expanded voting
access.</p>
<p>Other states have restricted their use. This includes Ohio and Iowa,
which now permits only one drop box per county, according to the Brennan
Center for Justice.</p>
<p>In Georgia’s Fulton County, which includes Atlanta and has over 1
million residents, 10 ballot drop boxes are available for this year’s
presidential election. That’s down from 38 four years ago under an
emergency rule prompted by the pandemic. It’s the result of an election
overhaul by Georgia Republicans in response to former President Donald
Trump’s false claims of a stolen election.</p>
<p>Overall, 12 states prohibit drop boxes or do not list drop boxes as
an approved method of returning a ballot, according to data collected by
the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five other states do not
have a state law and do not use drop boxes.</p>
<p>Drop boxes had been used for years in Wisconsin, one of this year’s
presidential battlegrounds, but support for them has split along
ideological lines since 2020. In Wausau, the conservative mayor carted
away the city’s lone drop box, an action that’s under investigation by
the state Department of Justice. The drop box has since been returned
and is in use.</p>

id="liberty-university-sued-by-former-it-staffer-fired-after-disclosing-shes-a-transgender-woman">Liberty
University sued by former IT staffer fired after disclosing she’s a
transgender woman</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The bitter nationwide debate over transgender rights is playing out
on a very personal level in a federal court lawsuit filed in Virginia by
a former Liberty University employee. She was fired by the evangelical
Christian school after disclosing her identity as a transgender
woman.</p>
<p>The lawsuit on behalf of Ellenor Zinski was filed in July by the
American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and the Richmond law firm of
Butler Curwood. It alleges that she was fired last year from her job on
Liberty’s Information Technology help desk solely because of her gender
identity, in violation of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the conservative legal organization Liberty
Counsel filed a brief on behalf of the university asking the federal
district court to dismiss the lawsuit. The brief contends that the Civil
Rights Act explicitly permits religious educational institutions to make
employment decisions consistent with their religious doctrine — in this
case a doctrinal statement asserting that “denial of birth sex by
self-identification with a different gender” is sinful.</p>
<p>Liberty University, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, has evolved over
its five-decade history into one of the largest Christian universities
in the world, with more than 100,000 students enrolled in its
residential and online programs. One of its co-founders was the late
Jerry Falwell Sr., the prominent televangelist and conservative
activist; his son, Jerry Falwell Jr., served as president for 13 years
before resigning in 2020 amid a series of personal scandals.</p>
<p>The brief filed by Liberty Counsel alleges that Zinski attempted to
“set up” the university, applying for the IT job four months after
beginning to take female hormones yet agreeing — when offered the job in
February 2023 — to adhere to the school’s statement rejecting
transgender transition.</p>
<p>Only after a 90-day probation ended did Zinski notify the university
of the gender transition process and then request that the school
“depart from its doctrine and mission,” Liberty Counsel said in an
effort to get the lawsuit dismissed.</p>
<p>“All of this was done to set Liberty up and attempt to make an
example out of the university for standing its ground,” contended Mat
Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman.</p>
<p>Wyatt Rolla, the ACLU of Virginia’s senior transgender rights
attorney, rejected the claim of a set-up.</p>
<p>“It’s strange to disparage Ellenor over what turned out to be real
concern with employment discrimination,” they said. “Her intention was
to be a highly successful employee for Liberty who continued to meet all
of her obligations.”</p>
<p>The trans woman suing Liberty had grown up admiring the
university</p>
<p>Zinski, 30, says she was raised as a conservative Christian, attended
a Christian high school, and took the job at Liberty hoping the
university — which she had admired — would accept her even after
learning of her transition. She had received a positive performance
review after completing her probation.</p>
<p>“I was really hoping they would work with me … that I could be
myself,” she told The Associated Press. “I was hoping I could advocate
for queer people. We need Jesus just as much as anyone else does.”</p>
<p>In her July 2023 letter to the university disclosing her transition,
Zinski stressed that her Christian faith “has been a guiding force
throughout this process.”</p>
<p>“The public discourse surrounding the transgender community has
imbued my journey with a certain degree of trepidation,” she wrote.
“However, I am hopeful that with your support and understanding, we can
navigate this process with sensitivity and respect for all parties
involved.”</p>
<p>Zinski received no immediate response to her letter, leading to what
she described as intense anxiety.</p>
<p>After four weeks, she inquired about the status of her case and was
promptly summoned to a meeting with Liberty human resources officials to
be informed she was being fired. A lengthy email explaining the rational
for the firing was read aloud to her at the meeting.</p>
<p>“Active and unrepentant patterns of sin, including sinful behaviors
regarding sexual expression and/or gender expression, would be
incompatible with our Christian workplace,” the email said.</p>
<p>What lies ahead for Ellenor Zinski — and her lawsuit?</p>
<p>Within a few months of her firing, Zinski was able to obtain a
similar IT help-desk job at the University of Lynchburg, a small,
private university. It is affiliated with the Christian Church
(Disciples of Christ), a mainline Protestant denomination, and describes
spiritual life on campus as “inclusive and open.”</p>
<p>“A lot of people at work have my back,” Zinski said.</p>
<p>She has also found support as an active member of Lynchburg’s Trinity
Episcopal Church. It was at Trinity, she says, that she was first
assured that “God made me this way.”</p>
<p>The next formal step in the case will be the filing of a brief by the
ACLU of Virginia opposing Liberty Counsel’s motion to dismiss the
lawsuit.</p>
<p>Daniel Schmid, a Liberty Counsel lawyer working on this case, said
there would likely be a hearing — and perhaps a decision — on the motion
to dismiss before the end of this year. Yet the case could linger far
beyond that, he said, if there are appeals eventually leading to the
U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In a phone interview with the AP, Schmid alluded to the so-called
“ministerial exception” — which gives religious institutions protection
against anti-discrimination lawsuits related to jobs with ministerial
functions.</p>
<p>Even with IT staff and janitors, Schmid said, “Liberty considers them
to be ministers of the Gospel. The First Amendment protects their right
to make that call.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $300,000 on
behalf of Zinski, as well as a declaration that the university’s
handling of the case violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>Zinski told the AP she has no desire to return to work at Liberty, at
least under its current leadership.</p>
<p>“My biggest fear if I ever went back is knowing there are people who
do not want me there at all,” she said. “I would not feel comfortable
enough to work there.”</p>

id="latino-evangelical-voters-torn-between-their-faith-and-harsh-rhetoric-around-immigration">Latino
evangelical voters torn between their faith and harsh rhetoric around
immigration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Rev. Arturo Laguna leads a largely immigrant church of about 100
followers in Phoenix. His job as a pastor, he says, gets complicated
come election season.</p>
<p>Laguna’s church, Casa de Adoracion, is in Arizona — one of seven
closely watched swing states that could possibly decide the next
president. It is also a microcosm of the larger Latino evangelical
Christian community in the U.S.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken Laguna says, for the members of his congregation,
voting is “not an intellectual issue.”</p>
<p>“It’s a matter of faith and spirituality,” he said. “We’re in a
complicated moment because, on the one hand, we are against abortion,
and on the other, we are concerned about the sharp rhetoric around
immigration and lack of reform. It’s a difficult choice.”</p>
<p>This is not a new dilemma for Latino evangelicals, who are growing in
numbers even as mainline white Protestant denominations have steadily
declined. Latino evangelicals are an influential voting bloc. Both
parties have tried to appeal to them over the past two election cycles —
neither with remarkable success — according to faith and community
leaders.</p>
<p>A 2022 Pew Research Center survey showed 15% of Latinos in the U.S
identify as evangelical Protestants. Among all American evangelicals,
they are the fastest-growing group. About half of Latino evangelicals
identified as Republicans or as independents who lean right, while 44%
identified as Democrats or as independents leaning left.</p>
<p>While U.S. Latinos generally favor Democratic candidates, a majority
of Latino evangelicals backed Donald Trump in 2020. According to AP
Votecast, about six in 10 Latino evangelical voters supported Trump in
2020, while four in 10 supported Biden.</p>
<p>A Pew survey released last month showed that about two-thirds of
Latino Protestants planned to back Trump this year, while about
two-thirds of Hispanic Catholics and religiously unaffiliated Hispanics
said they were supporting Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Agustin Quiles, president and founder of Mission Talk, a
Florida-based Latino Christian social justice organization, says
conflicting priorities leave some Latino evangelicals feeling
politically homeless. Some are torn between their conservative views on
social issues such as abortion and their desire to see immigration and
criminal justice reform, he said.</p>
<p>While many are offended by Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, Quiles
added, Democrats still haven’t figured out how to have conversations
with the community about issues such as abortion.</p>
<p>“So there is a lot of silence among Latino evangelicals right now,”
he said. “That does not mean they are not going to vote. There is just a
lot of discontent.”</p>
<p>To understand Latino evangelicals, it is important to understand
their origins, said Elizabeth Conde-Frazier, a scholar of the
Association of Hispanic Theological Association. The word “evangelico”
pertains to Protestants or those who are not Catholic, which includes a
wide swath of churches, cultures and traditions, she said.</p>
<p>“When immigrants come here and have to reestablish themselves, the
Protestant, Pentecostal and mainline churches become spaces where people
create a new sense of community and family,” Conde-Frazier said. “People
are trying to understand what life is supposed to be in this
country.”</p>
<p>With white Protestantism in decline and different mainline
denominations vying for the loyalty of these communities,
second-generation Latino Christians became more a part of the dominant
culture and often embraced the fervor of the white evangelical church,
she said.</p>
<p>“Latino churches, in order to gain a sense of power and acceptance,
began to align with (white conservative) evangelical churches in the
U.S., moving away from their ‘evangelico’ roots,” Conde-Frazier said.
Now, she added, some Latino evangelicals find themselves increasingly at
odds with their white counterparts because they are pro-immigration.</p>
<p>Quiles says in white evangelical churches where Latinos, including
undocumented immigrants, are growing in numbers, there is palpable
dissonance between what is said in the pulpit and how those in the pews
perceive it.</p>
<p>“Just because a pastor pushes anti-immigrant agenda, that does not
mean members are receiving it,” he said. “They selectively take what
they want from the teaching.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Juan Garcia, who leads a 100-strong Hispanic ministry at the
First Baptist Church in Newport News, Virginia, said the word
“evangelico” represents the Gospel to him. He says the “evangelical”
label feels tainted because of its affiliation with one political
party.</p>
<p>“Jesus is not Democrat or Republican,” he said. “Some see their
Christian values being represented by the Republican party and others
see some of their values represented by the Democrats. But neither party
is Christian in essence.”</p>
<p>Garcia feels that sense of political homelessness, too.</p>
<p>“I have a candidate I may vote for, but no political party I’d like
to belong to,” he said. “The most important value we as Christians must
live by is love — love our neighbors, the poor, those fleeing
persecution.”</p>
<p>Garcia said he has his “opinions and inclinations” but doesn’t view
the candidate he favors as flawless. He warns his flock: “If one is the
anti-Christ, the other is not Christ.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Jacqueline Tavarez, pastor of the Pentecostal Church of God
in Raleigh, North Carolina, says her diverse congregation cares more
about the values a political party represents rather than the face or
the voice of the party.</p>
<p>“Our community doesn’t care about the politics,” she said. “They care
about laws that affect our communities in terms of jobs, opportunities,
education. And they view abortion and transgender laws as an attack on
family values. When they see the ballot, they don’t see Trump or
(Harris). They see what the party supports and how the community is
going to fare under a candidate.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Lori Tapia, the Arizona-based national pastor and president
of the Obra Hispana, Disciples of Christ, said politics is not typically
integrated into the life of the Latino evangelical church. Unlike white
evangelical congregations, political engagement happens more
organically, she said.</p>
<p>“Here, the compassion piece is always stronger and there is a desire
to see leaders who will prioritize compassionate politics,” Tapia said.
“There is also frustration at how slow progress is on critical issues.
Anyone can pitch a story or a political campaign. But where is it being
manifested in the lives of people who are struggling?”</p>
<p>Bishop Angel Marcial, who leads the Church of God that oversees more
than 15,000 churches, says some of the main issues for his congregants
are healthcare education, public safety and housing.</p>
<p>“Voting gives you respect in this country and it brings opportunities
for marginalized communities,” he said. “As pastors, we don’t tell
people whom to vote for, but we do tell them about the platforms that
best align with the values of the church and needs of our
communities.”</p>
<p>John P. Tuman, professor of political science at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas, observes that in Las Vegas, Latino evangelicals who
join larger evangelical churches that have English and Spanish services
tend to skew conservative. However, in communities that form their own
congregations and conduct services in Spanish and Otomi, an Indigenous
language in Mexico, are likely to have more diverse political views.</p>
<p>“They tend to be historically in favor of immigration reform with a
pathway to citizenship, along with other elements of a social justice
message that resonates more with Democratic candidates,” he said.</p>
<p>Nevada is also a key swing state.</p>
<p>Pastor Willie Pagan, who leads the 700-strong Iglesia de Dios in
North Las Vegas that falls under the Church of God, said the economy is
a top issue for his congregants.</p>
<p>“Yes, people are worried about immigration, but those who are here
already, they want the economy to be stable,” he said. “They see
homelessness and crime growing in Las Vegas. Our church was in a rough
neighborhood that has gotten rougher recently.”</p>
<p>Pagan says some in his congregation believe they were better off
financially and safer during the Trump administration, and wish to vote
Republican to uphold their conservative religious values. But there are
also those who fear they or their loved ones could get deported, he
said.</p>
<p>“The struggle is real.”</p>

id="indian-americans-show-shifting-political-loyalties-ahead-of-presidential-election">Indian
Americans show shifting political loyalties ahead of presidential
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — At a recent Diwali gathering in Denver, software
architect Salil Gaonkar asked his Indian American friends to raise their
hands: Would they vote for Trump or Harris in the presidential race?</p>
<p>The response — from about 45 tech professionals and business owners
who had overwhelmingly backed Joe Biden in 2020 — stunned him. Former
President Donald Trump edged out Vice President Kamala Harris, albeit by
a narrow margin.</p>
<p>“I was shocked,” Gaonkar, a progressive Democrat who is supporting
Harris, said. “Most of them voted for Biden, but now there was a
significant shift and that surprised me really.”</p>
<p>One dinner poll does not a trend make, but Gaonkar’s experience
appears to reflect a broader national pattern. Indian Americans, long a
reliable Democratic voting bloc, are showing signs of shifting
allegiance.</p>
<p>A Carnegie Endowment survey released this week showed the number of
Indian Americans identifying as Democrats dropped to 47% from 56% in
2020. Harris, despite her Indian heritage, commanded just 60% support
from a community that gave Biden nearly 70% of its votes four years ago.
Trump, meanwhile, improved his support to 31% from 22%.</p>
<p>The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7%. And while
other polls show stronger South Asian support for Harris, the shift in
loyalties is significant, said Milan Vaishnav, director of Carnegie
Endowment’s South Asia program and one of the co-authors of the
study.</p>
<p>“We are seeing some signs of a greater shift or movement or
acceptance of at least this Republican Party, led by Trump, and that to
us, was a big surprise,” Vaishnav said in an interview with VOA last
Friday.</p>
<p>The rightward drift isn’t unique to Indian Americans. In recent
years, Republicans have made surprising gains among Hispanic, Black,
Arab and Muslim voters – all once deemed reliable Democratic voting
blocs.</p>
<p>Polls show a razor-thin race between Harris and Trump, and whether
these shifts will propel the former president back to the White House
remains uncertain. But the findings shatter a core assumption of
American politics: that minority and immigrant communities are safely
Democratic, Vaishnav said, during an online presentation Thursday.</p>
<p>“There has been this idea of demography is destiny and that the
Democratic Party, which has been the natural home to ethnic and racial
minorities and many if not most immigrant communities … will have a
perpetual electoral advantage as the size of these groups increases,” he
said. “Clearly, there are many signs that that’s not true. Our survey is
one of them.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More than 5 million strong, Indian Americans defy easy
categorization. They’re predominantly Hindus, with smaller numbers of
Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and others among them. While many
first-generation Indians lean conservative, plenty don’t.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Tuesday’s election, their concerns mirror those of other
Americans: Inflation, abortion, jobs, and immigration. U.S.-India
relations barely register.</p>
<p>“They vote like Americans because they are,” said Sumitra
Badrinathan, a professor at the American University and one of three
co-authors of the report, during the presentation.</p>
<p>Demolishing long-held assumptions about the community, the Carnegie
survey revealed that Harris’ Indian heritage hasn’t helped her top
Biden’s 2020 numbers. More surprisingly, it showed that Indian American
men under 40 — not their first-generation, supposedly “traditional”
elders — are driving the rightward shift.</p>
<p>“The Democrats don’t have a problem with the uncles,” Vaishnav said.
“They have a problem with males under 40.”</p>
<p>According to Pew Research, about two-thirds of Indian Americans are
immigrants. Many are politically split by era.</p>
<p>“People who came in 1990 or later are clinging to Trump, but people
[in] my dad’s generation are solidly Democratic,” said Angana Shah, a
Michigan-based social justice lobbyist and lawyer.</p>
<p>The divide between first- and second-generation Indians surfaces in
other ways. For many recent arrivals, illegal immigration has emerged as
a top concern. Gaonkar said his formerly Biden-supporting friends cite
illegal border crossings as the main reason for switching to Trump.</p>
<p>“Indians hate the illegal immigration that skyrocketed under Biden,”
Gaonkar said. “We know what hoops we have had to go through to get into
the country legally and stay here and to see some others come in like
that is not right.”</p>
<p>The sentiment cuts deep among first-generation immigrants. Take
Dharmendra Jaiswal, a Maryland tech executive whose path to citizenship
stretched nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>He voted for Biden in 2020, his first presidential election, but now
backs Trump.</p>
<p>“People are pissed off,” he said. “Illegal immigrants are getting
[education and health care] from our taxpayer money.”</p>
<p>Indians make up the third-largest group of undocumented immigrants in
the U.S. But Jaiswal said, “illegal immigrant is illegal immigrant.”</p>
<p>Suhag Shukla, co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation, said the
backlash against illegal immigration makes sense. Immigration backlogs
force many Indian immigrants to wait 10 to 20 years for green cards and
citizenship.</p>
<p>“People should not be in limbo for 20 years, but unfortunately that
is the state of the immigration program that we are dealing with today
and many are speaking out just like many other Americans about the need
to have stronger borders,” Shukla said in an interview with VOA this
week.</p>
<p>Criticized for being soft on unauthorized immigration, Harris has
defended her record, highlighting a drop in illegal border crossings due
to recent policy changes implemented by the Biden administration. For
his part, Trump has vowed to carry out the “largest deportation
operation in American history.”</p>
<p>Harris’ campaign, launched in July, electrified many progressive
Indian Americans, drawing thousands of eager volunteers.</p>
<p>But the enthusiasm masked a deeper reality: Her Indian heritage
proved a weak draw for many voters. The Carnegie survey found that fewer
than 1 in 10 Indian American supporters were motivated by her South
Asian heritage.</p>
<p>Towson University professor Pallavi Guha, an Indian American, said
many members of her community are “looking beyond identity
politics.”</p>
<p>“People who are supporting Vice President Harris are supporting Vice
President Harris because of the policies,” Guha, who lives in Howard
County, Maryland, said in an interview with VOA on Thursday.</p>
<p>A survey of South Asian voters by the Indian American Impact Fund, a
political group, found Harris leading Trump, 68% to 20%, in the
battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>With more than 400,000 eligible South Asian voters in these states,
the community is “poised to make the margin of difference in what will
likely be a razor-thin election,” the group said in a statement last
month.</p>
<p>But the enthusiasm isn’t uniform. Rupal Shah, an Atlanta-based
second-generation Indian American non-profit worker volunteering for
IAI, sees a generational divide.</p>
<p>“I’m second generation and I believe that my generation of folks are
very, very pro-Kamala, ready to vote for her, excited about her,” Shah
said. “And then when you talk to my parents or parents in general, you
get a sense of excitement and a sense of nervousness.”</p>
<p>“Their fiscal concerns always kind of rise to the top, but there’s
also a lot of excitement about Kamala and who she represents and how she
represents our community,” Shah said.</p>
<p>VOA reached out to both the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment
but did not receive a response from either group.</p>

lithium mine will crush rare plant habitat US said is critical to its
survival, lawsuit says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RENO, Nevada — Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing
the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an
endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows
and threaten cultural resources.</p>
<p>The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week
ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.’s Rhyolite
Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm’s buckwheat is known to
exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and
Las Vegas.</p>
<p>It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President
Joe Biden’s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda
intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the
production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar
panels.</p>
<p>The new lawsuit says the Interior Department’s approval of the mine
marks a dramatic about-face by U.S. wildlife experts who warned nearly
two years ago that Tiehm’s buckwheat was “in danger of extinction now”
when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.</p>
<p>“One cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously
destroying biodiversity,” said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western
Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed
Thursday in federal court in Reno.</p>
<p>“The use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not
justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone
environmental laws,” said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin
Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.</p>
<p>Rita Henderson, spokesperson for Interior’s Bureau of Land Management
in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining
company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and “vigorously
defend” approval of the project, “which was based on its careful and
thorough permitting process.”</p>
<p>“We are confident that the BLM will prevail,” Yeftich said. He added
that he doesn’t expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin
construction next year.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western
Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than
1.6 kilometers away described as “a site of intergenerational
transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.”</p>
<p>But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act.
It details the Fish and Wildlife Service’s departure from the dire
picture it painted earlier of threats to the 15-centimeter-tall
wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine
Ioneer plans to dig. </p>
<p>The mine’s permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 3.6
square kilometers the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding
the plants — home to various pollinators important to their survival —
would be lost for decades, some permanently.</p>
<p>When proposing protection of the 368 hectares of critical habitat,
the service said “this unit is essential to the conservation and
recovery of Tiehm’s buckwheat.” The agency formalized the designation
when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of
less-stringent threatened status.</p>
<p>“We find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because
the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm’s buckwheat is in danger
of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the
future,” the agency concluded.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant’s
population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government’s latest
estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not
considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s biological
opinion.</p>
<p>The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by
rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population
as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion
that while the project “will result in the long-term disturbance
(approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant
community … and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not
expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical
habitat as a whole.”</p>

separated by US-Mexico border reunite for a few precious minutes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico — Nearly 200 families gathered Saturday along a
stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border for heartfelt but brief reunions with
loved ones they had not seen for years because they live in different
countries. </p>
<p>Tears flowed and people embraced as Mexican families were allowed to
reunite for a few minutes at the border with relatives who migrated to
the U.S. Adults and children passed over the Rio Grande to meet with
their loved ones. </p>
<p>This year, the annual “Hugs Not Walls” event organized by an
immigrant rights advocacy group happened three days before the U.S.
presidential election, whose monthslong campaigns have focused heavily
on immigration and border security. It also took place under decreased
security, according to the Network in Defense of the Rights of
Migrants. </p>
<p>“We did not have barbed wire, we did not have so many soldiers
deployed in our community,” said Fernando Garcia, the organization’s
director, highlighting the border security changes that the border has
seen since the reunions began last decade. “The barbed wire had to be
opened so that the families could have this event.” </p>
<p>Garcia said he expects migration into the U.S. to continue regardless
of who wins Tuesday’s election. Family reunions, he said, will continue,
too. </p>
<p>“Deportation policy, border policy, immigration policy, is separating
families in an extraordinary way and is deeply impacting these
families,” he said.</p>

<p>By immigrants, for immigrants: ‘Documented’ covers immigration
through a personal lens</p>
<p>In New York City, a media outlet run by immigrants for immigrants
uses messaging apps to engage with communities on elections, crime and
local issues. Liam Scott and Cristina Caicedo Smit have the story,
narrated by Caicedo Smit. Tina Trinh contributed.</p>
<p>Naturalized citizens to play a bigger role in 2024 election</p>
<p>Naturalized immigrants will make up 10% of Americans eligible to vote
in 2024. What impact might they have on the election?</p>
<p>US border arrests remained lower in October amid Biden asylum
restrictions</p>
<p>U.S. border authorities apprehended about 54,000 migrants illegally
crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in October, according to preliminary
figures obtained by Reuters. They show a marginal rise from September
but continue the broader downward trend since June when new restrictions
were imposed under President Joe Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris,
the Democratic presidential candidate, has called for even tougher
border restrictions in the face of criticism by Republican candidate
Donald Trump over illegal immigration. Reuters reports.</p>
<p>Migrant families separated under Trump still feel fallout, fear his
return</p>
<p>With the United States on the verge of an election that could put
former President Donald Trump back in office, Billy wants people to know
that what happened to him and several thousand other children still
reverberates. Some families have not been reunited, and many of those
together in the U.S. have temporary status and fear a victorious Trump
carrying out promised mass deportations. The Associated Press
reports.</p>
<p>Immigration around the world</p>
<p>VOA60 World - At least 10 dead after Israeli airstrike on a street in
Gaza’s Nuseirat Refugee Camp</p>
<p>An Israeli strike on a street in central Gaza’s Nuseirat Refugee Camp
killed at least 10 people, including children, and injured 20 others,
according to Palestinian health officials and Associated Press
journalists.</p>
<p>Myanmar opposition: Dialogue impossible, China must rethink junta
support</p>
<p>Malaysia, hosting about 200,000 Myanmar refugees, has a direct stake
in resolving the crisis. Produced by Nyein Chan Aye. </p>
<p>Canada-India tensions could escalate cyberthreats, hinder
immigration</p>
<p>Canada’s deepening dispute with India over its alleged campaign of
violence against Sikhs in Canada could intensify Indian-based cyber
espionage and hold back immigration, but analysts and experts see no
immediate impact on trade. Concern about a widening rift between the two
countries comes after a senior Canadian official told a parliamentary
national security committee Tuesday that Indian Minister of Home Affairs
Amit Shah, a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was the
mastermind behind the alleged plots. Reported by Reuters.</p>
<p>Sudan displacement crisis worsens as fighting, hunger, sexual
violence escalates</p>
<p>The International Organization for Migration warned Tuesday that
Sudan’s displacement crisis is worsening as increasing numbers of people
flee fighting, hunger and sexual violence, thereby threatening “regional
instability.” “The scale of this displacement and the corresponding
humanitarian needs grows every day,” Amy Pope, IOM director general,
told journalists in Geneva on a video link from Port Sudan. Lisa Schlein
reports for VOA from Geneva.</p>
<p>Uganda struggles to feed 1.7 million refugees as international
support dwindles</p>
<p>Uganda is home to more than 1.7 million refugees, the largest
refugee-hosting country in Africa, according to the United Nations
refugee agency. Despite being renowned for welcoming those fleeing
neighboring violence, Ugandan officials and humanitarians say dwindling
international support coupled with high numbers of refugees have put
much pressure on host communities. Reported by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Russian army deserters hope French asylum decision will encourage
others to flee</p>
<p>Thousands of Russians, including soldiers, have sought asylum in the
West since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 — though only a small
fraction of their applications have been approved. This month, however,
France allowed several Russian army deserters to enter the country to
seek refugee status. Henry Ridgwell reports.</p>
