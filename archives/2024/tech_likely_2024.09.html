<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Biosrhythm blog</p>
<p>Seasoned Apple Macintosh pros have likely experienced the joy (and
sadness) of using a large AppleTalk network. You know, the kind where
the Chooser suddenly shows a Zone menu at the bottom left where there
used to be none? When you first see it, it’s a shock– like you’ve

<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Status-Q blog</p>
<p>I’ve wanted an e-bike for ages, ever since I first tried one many,
many years ago, but most of my normal cycling destinations are close
enough that I didn’t really feel I had an excuse to buy one. But then we
started to think that folding bikes would also be useful when
campervanning, and so

up-to-date Chromium for Windows XP, Vista, and 7</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Modern browsers don’t really support older versions of Windows
anymore, so anyone running Windows XP, 2003, Vista, and even Windows 7
and 8 are losing access to secure and capable browsers. While running
those older versions of Windows on production machines isn’t exactly
advised, they’re still great fun as retrocomputing platforms and to keep
older Windows games accessible using period-correct hardware. As such,
there’s some awesome news: there is now a fully up-to-date variant of
Chromium for these older versions of Windows called Supermium. It tracks
current Chromium, supports extensions, sandboxing, Aero Glass, Google
Sync, and even Widevine on Windows 7 and higher. Micheal MJD just
published a video showing Supermium in action in case you’re curious.
You’ll need at least Windows XP SP3 and an Intel Pentium 4 with SSE2 in
order to run it, and Windows 2000 support is in the works, too.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Redox has published the summary of development covering February, and
there’s quite a few interesting leaps forward this month. First and
foremost, the operating system got a major file read/write speed boost
by implementing records in RedoxFS. The migration to UNIX-format paths
is ongoing, Boxedwine is currently being ported, and more and more
programs are getting ported, including complex applications like
Audacity, Celestia, KiCad and Neothesia. There’s a lot more this month,
so be sure to read the whole report.</p>

<p>Agony first. The agony starts with the fact that Elon Musk has a
point; OpenAI, Altman and Brockman <em>have</em> changed their mission
since he gave them his money, his time and his reputation. Here’s what
they told that State of the California in 2015: THIRD: This Corporation
shall be a nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for charitable
and/or educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding
provision of any future United States Internal Revenue law. The specific
purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research,
development and distribution of technology related to artificial
intelligence. The resulting technology will benefit the public and the
corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit
when applicable. The corporation is not organized for the private gain
of any person.</p>

<h2 id="biden-is-a-fine-president">Biden <i>is</i> a fine president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and
proto-blogger
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/C4Dyym1uc3c">Jeff
Jarvis</a>, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just
made it a blog post.
</p>
<p>
The thing about Gaza is that there’s the rest of the world, and they’re
watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been
such an asshole to the US. He’s a freaking MAGA.
</p>
<p>
So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but
he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all
around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will
die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure.
The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the
right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there’s another path,
compassion and help.
</p>
<p>
Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But
they’re doing it the only way we can, given who we are.
</p>
<p>
Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we
never have. Journos seem to think Americans can’t understand the basics
of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of
the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn’t really any more
complicated.

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-roundup">IndieWeb Carnival: Roundup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
February has come to an end and with it also ended my experience hosting
the 9th edition of the IndieWeb Carnival. To be honest with you, I
didn’t know what to expect going into this. Foreverliketh.is—who was the
host for the month of January—emailed me one day asking me if I wanted
to host one of the upcoming months because the carnival was running
short on hosts and I obviously accepted.
</p>
<p>
His month on the topic of
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive
Internalization </a> saw
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">13
people contributing</a> and so I said to myself “If 10 to 15 people
decide to participate in February I’ll consider that a win”.
</p>
<p>
Well, looks like we got there. I have 44 links in front of me so this is
going to be quite the roundup but before we jump into that let me first
say thank you to all the people who decided to take the time to
participate. You’re all a bunch of awesome people. Also, the Carnival
continues and this month’s topic is going to be
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">Accessibility
in the Small Web</a>. Look forward to reading your posts there. Now it’s
time to dive into the submissions.
</p>
<h2>
Quick overview
</h2>
<p>
As I said before, I have 44 links in front of me. One person contributed
2 posts, 43 of those posts were written specifically for this month’s
carnival and 1 was submitted not by its author but by someone else. They
thought it was a quality entry and they were right so I decided to
include it.
</p>
<h2>
The roundup
</h2>
<p>
It’s 7.42 am, I have my cup of tea in front of me, and it’s time to
review all these entries.

On Digital Relationships: Once Upon A Time, I Was A Voxer

<blockquote>
<p>
There’s no way for me to write up my time as a Voxer both online and off
in any way that’s comprehensive or even likely especially coherent.
Between the memory deficiencies and the flood of alcohol with occasional
marijuana digressions, there’s just not enough to form a full picture.
While I appear on the incest map, there are versions that link me to
people with whom I did not have a saliva or semen connection. The
community was a jumbled mess but there’s also a lot of myth wrapped up
in it all. I won’t deny I at least had more than my fair share of
crushes, including a photographer who I didn’t actually know very well,
although we got along fine, and whose later and far too soon funeral to
this day I regret missing. (People still remember you, K.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love that this was the first post I received. I am a sucker for
stories. I just love them. I love learning about people’s previous
lives, about their adventures, about the way they got where they are
now. I also love when the physical and the digital intersect and
learning about the origin of the name Bix was such a treat.

<blockquote>
<p>
Understanding that the generalisability of any study can be questioned,
it is worth reflecting that the IndieWeb—made up in large part of
text-heavy websites—can help foster meaningful digital relationships,
strengthen social support and feelings of satisfaction associated with
these relationships. And because a key, if indirect, result of the
IndieWeb movement is to promote a balance of creation and consumption,
it is all the more powerful a tool to employ in strengthening digital
relationships of humans through the web.
</p>

VH post was the starting point for so many interesting deep dives and
I’m going to write at least a few posts thanks to this. I loved the
parallelism between the IndieWeb and the physical interactions.

Digital Relationships
</h3>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s a struggle to slow the cadence of the web and our daily social
interactions; to avoid becoming over-stimulated the second we wake up in
the morning. And it’s for this reason I find myself gravitating towards
natural activities of the past—without a screen. Albeit with a slightly
different landscape and a more focused mindset.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is something I’m also experiencing. And it’s paradoxical in a way.
I retreated from social media years ago to hide in my digital corner and
do my own things. I spend more time outside, walking, enjoying nature,
and listening to birds. And yet what’s left of my online life is a lot
more meaningful.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How a family sits around a table in public all staring at their phones
carrying on relationships digitally with everyone other than those
sitting in close physical proximity is a tip of the societal scale that
disturbs me. How others begin, navigate and end romantic relationships
exclusively with digital mechanics confuses me. The fact that our world
seems to be trending toward more technology that replaces the
relationship with more digital depresses me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The large-scale implications of technology are something that worries me
a lot. It’s one of those topics I find myself returning over and over
again. Another topic I need to explore more on this site.

<p>
And people are trying to solve this for themselves. Which is why there
are so many different online spaces and different ways of communication
online. But that also means, that there is no way to have one way to
communicate with everybody.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t help to ask myself if that’s necessarily a bad thing. Do we
actually need a way to communicate with everybody? Maybe we want some
friction in the system. Maybe the fact that not everyone is willing to
use emails is why emails are still the best way to have one-to-one
interactions online.

Oh the People You’ll Meet: A Visual Timeline of Human Connections
</h3>
<p>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s not bad to know many people. The value of a substantial social
network is quite high. But having just one close person to go to when
you’re feeling down… how many average relationships is that worth? Who
feels deep happiness for you when something good happens in your life?
Who can you make beautiful memories with?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t agree more. Like everything in life, what matters is to find
a good balance. You want plenty of interactions to keep your mind
stimulated and your points of view challenged and the digital world is
perfect for that. But you also want at least a couple of close IRL
relationships.

I’m so incredibly thankful to live in an era where I can have the best

But it all starts on the internet, on the old independent web, where
there’s no algorithm and no digital gods telling us what we can and

continues in our hearts. Because it doesn’t matter what channel or app
we use to communicate, as long as we have the will. Because whatever app
we use, a friend will be on the other side. We can enjoy whatever
platform we have while it exists, and we can move on when it ceases to
exist. It doesn’t matter if the platform stays or not, what matters is
that friends will be there, friends will stay.

I love this. And I love mail! I keep thinking that maybe I should set up
a PO Box and start connecting at an even slower pace. Maybe after I

been able to solve on my own; solving the problem on the page is a
relief.

As I’m writing this, I can’t help but think maybe this relationship is
strange. Maybe I have too much dependence on my devices and that I

most profound years with any one thing, living or otherwise, it is bound
to become sentimental.

<p>
It’s odd how we can feel an attachment to objects but it’s something I
can absolutely relate to. I don’t own many things but there are a bunch
I care about and I’d feel really sad if I were to lose them. Also, this

is to forget the body when online, we are not daemons or spirits without
bodies. We are human beings, embodied and earthbound, and any bonds we
forge should take that into account.

The unguided nature of the app allows people to reflect on these

and visual elements, thus building a unique relationship with the past
and with the archaeological site.

<p>
Some people think it is impossible to have meaningful exchanges /
relationships with other without seeing each other, but I disagree. It
is even sometime better to talk to people you don’t see, some topics are
easier that way. Yes written communication are more complex because some
information can not be shared (body language, tone - in particular irony
and sarcasm, …), but that doesn’t prevent people to find a way to
interact that works for them and create true companionship, friendship
or more.

The rules of engagement changed. Where our digital playgrounds once were
about hanging out and shooting the shit with friends, they now became
something else. People started optimising. Optimising what? Everything.
What they said, how they said it and when they said it. All in an effort
to gain more friends. We still called them friends at that point. But
the veil quickly fell away and the term followers eventually took the
place of friends. And rightly so, because you can’t optimise for
friendship.

they are active.
