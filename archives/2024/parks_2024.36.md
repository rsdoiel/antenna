## Grand Canyon National Park to Reopen South Rim Hotels September 5

date: 2024-09-03, from: Press Releases

Grand Canyon National Park will reopen hotels on the park’s South Rim beginning Thursday, September 5 and transition down to Stage 3 water restrictions.  

Park water utility crews successfully completed complex repairs to the Transcanyon Waterline late last week and resumed pumping water without identifying any new breaks. The park will operate under Stage 3 water restrictions until the water storage tanks have adequate capacity to return to routine water conservation practices. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/transition-to-stage-3-september-5.htm

## Grand Canyon National Park to Temporarily Close Overnight Hotel Accommodations Beginning August 29

date: 2024-09-01, from: Press Releases

Grand Canyon National Park will implement Stage 4 water restrictions on the South Rim starting the afternoon of Thursday, August 29, due to a series of four significant breaks in the 12½ mile-long Transcanyon Waterline that supplies water from the canyon for use in the park. Since July 8, the park has faced challenges with water supply, and currently, no water is being pumped to either the South or North Rim. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/temporary-closure-of-hotel-accomodations.htm
