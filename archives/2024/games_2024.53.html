2025’ event guide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, updated: 2024-12-30, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Pokémon Go’s yearly New Years event for 2025 (dubbed “New Year’s
2025”) has started, taking place from Monday, Dec. 30, 2024, until
Wednesday, Jan. 1, 2025. The event brings back Pokémon in party hats, as
well as some other perks, including Timed Research. Notably, you’ll get
2,025 XP for each Pokémon caught with an excellent […]</p>

classic board game Clue changed over its more than 75-year history</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, updated: 2024-12-27, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Clue, the murder-mystery board game, has been a staple of game nights
and big-box store shelves for as long as we can remember. In fact, 2024
marks Clue’s 75th anniversary. First released as Clue in the United
States in 1949 by Parker Brothers, the game has sold more than 150
million copies and is listed […]</p>

What If…? was nothing more than a slew of missed opportunities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, updated: 2024-12-27, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>One of Marvel Comics’ oldest traditions has been the What If title, a
series that aims to take the Marvel universe as we know it and ponder
what said universe would be like if something (whether it be a small,
seemingly insignificant detail or the absence of entire superteams) was
different. So when Marvel Studios […]</p>

<p>Genshin Impact patch 5.3 is coming soon, bringing new characters and
story with it. The update will add three characters: Mavuika, Citlali,
and Lan Yan as players complete the Natlan story quest and head back to
Liyue for Lantern Rite. Below, we explain when Genshin Impact
maintenance starts and ends, alongside the release time of […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-30, updated: 2024-12-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There are many museums, zoos, botanic gardens, and other institutions
that are good at translating their educational and preservational assets
to social media. And then there’s the Monterey Bay Aquarium and its
oceanic lo-fi livestreams.  Monterey Bay is an internationally respected
aquarium that real nerdy-ass fuckin’ nerds will know as the

<p>date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Disney unveiled the first trailer for its long-awaited, MCU-adjacent
animated series Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man on Sunday, on the
heels of its big What If…? series finale . Produced by Marvel Animation
and Polygon Pictures (Knights of Sidonia, Kaina of the Great Snow Sea),
the series will center on Peter Parker’s early days as Spider-Man,

<p>date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>YouTube channel Odd Tinkering doesn’t hold many surprises — other
than the disbelief at how good the consoles, controllers, and keyboards
they restore look when the work is done. What starts as a broken, dirty
Game Boy Color in this video becomes a crisp, clean handheld fit to be a
1998 Christmas present. The creator, […]</p>

<p>We know you watched a few videos this year, but did you watch a few
Polygon videos this year? To celebrate another year in the can, the
Polygon video team gave each producer the chance (…and assignment) to
shout out their favorite work from 2024 to give you an idea of where to
dive in. […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>When it comes to good YouTube videos, I’m biased in favor of content
made explicitly for the platform: media critiques, long-form
investigations, and pointless tests of human endurance. “Outside In” is
an exception. This educational video comes from a strange and distant
land: the 1990s. Based on the mathematical concept of sphere inversion,
it should […]</p>
