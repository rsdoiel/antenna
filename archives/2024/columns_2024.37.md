**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I keep seeing mention of "Podcast 2.0" in various places. That is unusually greedy, even for the tech industry. What next? Deprecating the way podcasting has worked for the last 20 years? How do we know the people doing this aren't shilling for Spotify, Google or Amazon? Please don't mess with something that works as well as podcasting. You want to do something better, great -- make your own name and get people to respect it. Stealing respect from podcasting tells me you have no honor or self-respect, and it should say the same to everyone else. Something else that tells you it's bad, they never bothered to send me an email. Welcome to the tech industry.

## Good forms

date: 2024-09-13, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><a href="https://brian.io/">Brian LeRoux</a> posted <a href="https://indieweb.social/@brianleroux/112932335725534529">a few thoughts about forms</a> and the idea of a “<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/04/thoughts-on-cosmotechnics/">good form</a>” resonated with me so I dogpiled some of my own thoughts and experiences on it. Here’s a compilation of those ideas. I’m sure this is incomplete and would love to see your list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good forms work without client JavaScript (Brian LeRoux)</li>
<li>Good forms always submit (Brian LeRoux)</li>
<li>Good forms remember values and display problems inline (Brian LeRoux)</li>
<li>Good login forms work with password managers (<a href="https://elk.zone/oldbytes.space/@mingo/112932355524060403">Mingo Hogan</a>)</li>
<li>Good forms use a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag</li>
<li>Good forms use appropriate input types</li>
<li>Good forms have clear labelled inputs and buttons</li>
<li>Good forms have focus states</li>
<li>Good forms have logical tab order</li>
<li>Good forms allow paste</li>
<li>Good form elements leverage the <code>inputmode</code> attribute</li>
<li>Good form elements leverage the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute</li>
<li>Good search forms wrap the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag in a <code>&lt;search&gt;</code> element</li>
<li>Good forms can be reset with a <code>&lt;button type=reset&gt;</code></li>
<li>Good forms participate in <code>formData</code></li>
<li>Good forms don’t use placeholder as a label</li>
<li>Good forms work on phones</li>
<li>Good forms don’t popup and ask for personal information</li>
<li>Good forms only ask for what is necessary and aren’t too long</li>
<li>Good forms use HTTPS</li>
<li>Good forms use the proper HTTP verbs</li>
<li>Good forms validate on the client AND on the server</li>
<li>Good forms have been driven with a screen reader <em>before</em> going to production</li>
<li>Good forms clearly denote required attributes</li>
<li>Good forms warn about costly or destructive actions</li>
<li>Good forms make the baby Jesus smile</li>
<li>Good authenticated forms should have a server-generated nonce value</li>
<li>Good forms should do a pre-flight check for <code>navigator.onLine</code> before attempting a submit</li>
<li>Good forms start with <code>accent-color</code> for styling and only get more complex if necessary</li>
<li>Good forms see custom controls as a radioactive asset that must be removed at the earliest opportunity</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways. People should talk about forms more. Here’s some more resources on good form design.</p>
<ul>

## Dropbox almost reinvented the web

date: 2024-09-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>I was trying to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/113125134990424609">explain</a> to Miguel de Icaza, a longtime developer friend, how Dropbox was within inches of making the web a million times more useful, ten years ago, and then backed away from it. I don't think I've ever told the story here on my blog, so here goes. </i></p>
<p>In 2013, Dropbox had a developer program, you could write an app, and register it with them, and then the user could run your app from a website, and log on to Dropbox in the app, and they would have access to files in a directory in the user's Dropbox hierarchy in the app, as if it were accessing it from the local file system, which in a way they were.</p>
<p>I made an <a href="http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html">outliner</a> for that system, and loved it -- it was great, I didn't have to get into the business of reselling storage, or user identity. And for the users, it "just worked" as they say, because they were already using Dropbox, and now it could be used for something completely new and incredibly useful, and it didn't require huge venture capital to get it going, so it would enable very small niche products to find a market. It was brilliant and visionary, and I was very open about my feelings on my blog. </p>
<p>They also had a Public Folder, where any user files could be accessed over the web. </p>
<p>They were within an inch of the perfect system. The problem was my app couldn't access user files in any other directory. So it didn't allow for specialization in products, every editor had to do everything. </p>
<p>They had an option where you could give an app access to <i>everything</i> but that was ridiculous, I couldn't recommend users do that. Users store all kinds of private data on Dropbox.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="http://fargo.io/docs/fargo/dropbox.html">howto</a> for the product and how it connects to Dropbox.</p>
<p>They lost interest in this, btw -- and when they broke the API, I took that opportunity to shut down the product. </p>
<p>I wish they had gone in that direction, or someone would go in that direction. </p>

## Microsoft Is Adding New Cryptography Algorithms

date: 2024-09-12, updated: 2024-09-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Microsoft is updating <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/SymCrypt">SymCrypt</a>, its core cryptographic library, with new quantum-secure algorithms. Microsoft&#8217;s details are <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-s-quantum-resistant-cryptography-is-here/ba-p/4238780">here</a>. From a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/microsoft-adds-quantum-resistant-algorithms-to-its-core-crypto-library/">news article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first new algorithm Microsoft added to SymCrypt is called ML-KEM. Previously known as CRYSTALS-Kyber, ML-KEM is one of three post-quantum standards <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards">formalized last month</a> by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The KEM in the new name is short for key encapsulation. KEMs can be used by two parties to negotiate a shared secret over a public channel. Shared secrets generated by a KEM can then be used with symmetric-key cryptographic operations, which aren&#8217;t vulnerable to Shor&#8217;s algorithm when the keys are of a sufficient size...</p></blockquote>

## Finding questions and answers about why I like books

date: 2024-09-12, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexHormozi/status/1543229182796132352">a tweet</a> awhile back that sent my brain to a far off galaxy…</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
	  Most people are proud of their reading habit.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  But for many, it’s just an act of productive procrastination.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  I’m looking at you “I read a book a week” club
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Here’s how you know:
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Are you reading to find answers to questions?…or are you reading to find questions to answer?
  </p>
  &mdash; Alex Hormozi (@AlexHormozi) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexHormozi/status/1543229182796132352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2022</a>
</blockquote>
<p>Of all the injustices happening in the world… you know who needs to be taken down a peg? The Book-a-Week People. Fuck those guys. With their books in their Zoom backgrounds. That bothers me. Fuck them.</p>
<p>I know the original post is part of some weird hustle culture subgenre, but it’s probably no surprise to folks reading that <a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/">I like books</a> and fit this targeted demographic. After pondering whether I’m “finding answers to questions or questions to answer” my answer is a resounding, “…I guess?”</p>
<p>A lot of why I read is about juxtaposition. I read business books to juxtapose my experience against the Platonic ideal of “good business”. I read about social justice to juxtapose my lived experience against others lived experience. I read science fiction to juxtapose the present against futures I haven’t imagined. I read non-fiction airport books because I like facts and social science garbage. I read books on topics I’m already an expert in to see if there’s information that further informs my perspective. I read to <a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/06/telepresence/">teleport</a> to different places, minds, times, and rooms where it happened.</p>
<p>I read to escape. I read to find myself. I read because I like facts. I read because I like fiction. I read for entertainment. I read to fall asleep. I listen to books to help me finish mundane tasks like doing the dishes every night. And I listen to books because there’s a slight communistic thrill of getting them from the library.</p>
<p>There’s a widely accepted idea out there that “the best way to become a better writer is to become a better reader.” I think Stephen King said it, but I can’t find the quote. Either way, I want to become a better writer. Whether fact or fiction, I want the ability to not struggle when putting thoughts on the page. Oh to partake in this magical osmosis! The transitive impartation of skills! Let me flex the language encoding and decoding synapses in my 40-watt brain.</p>
<p>And sometimes reading is out of due diligence. Like… if you’re going to start a job as a manager… read a book on management? Or ten? You’re dealing with people’s lives and careers, seems like the least you could do. If you’re going to talk or blog on a topic and there’s a relevant book… read that before <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-southern-phrase-showing-your-ass-mean">showing your ass</a>? A thought backed by some literature seems better than regurgitating TikToks.</p>
<p>Books are strange objects. Chapters and chapters of coherent research and lived experiences assembled by people who wanted to put it all down in one place. Edited by actual editors who like editing. Designed— down to the weight of the paper, the typography, and the illustration on the cover— to make the experience of reading it enjoyable. Books are uncanny and impractical objects. A terribly inefficient way to encode information from one brain to another, but an excellent way to tell a story.</p>
<p>You can also just like books for no reason.</p>
<p>Anyways, books. Check ‘em out.</p>

And btw I also am wasting my ideas too, one in a hundred has any influence, and even then it's minscule, the ideas drift away unimplemented or unused. I keep writing, hoping I see a way to get into the global conversation, again. I remember what it's like. But I'm not done. We still have a big problem to solve in our political and communication system. Online software is where it's at.

A couple of months ago, I was practically begging him to do this. He was pouring so much unfocused energy into making journalism play an appropriate role in our democracy. When Jeff started posting to his blog, it gave his friends something to point to. This writing had much more impact than a random tweet. Journalism crossed a line they should not have crossed. Now we fully expect them to try to do it again. We have to find a way for our ideas not to be scattered in the wind, so thorougly ignorable. And in doing so, I'm convinced we'd find a better way to organize the electorate online so it's more immune from unwise and unfair manipulation from the journalists. At the same time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gillmor">Dan Gillmor</a>, who was also scattering his ideas about, has started a <a href="https://cornerstone.ghost.io/">newsletter</a>. Dan was a real blogging <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22dan+gillmor%22">pioneer</a> as was Jeff. We remember how this kind of thing boots up. We can set up any kind of distribution system we need. What matters is the collection of brilliance. Individuals are not so powerful unless they come from one of these.

A campaign would be a season.

Near the end of the season you have the election, with the following episodes the plotting, intrigue, and undermining of democracy, and at the end of the season the inauguration of a new president. Each year you have more michegas, until four years later you go through the election all over again. People would really study the candidates, and would have reasons they like one character over another. And maybe the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYqqW3c2mBU">patriarch</a> doesn't die, and decides to run again. This is where we're heading, we might already be there.

## A slip of the tongue?

<p>It would have been cool if Harris had said "He's going to have you for dinner" instead of "He's going to eat you for lunch," which is what she said Putin would do to Trump. </p>
<p>Makes you wonder if that was a slip of the tongue or if it was a little Easter Egg she dropped for our later amusement. </p>

## It's marketing dummy

date: 2024-09-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/12/24/drummer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">What Harris is doing is marketing. It takes a lot of impressions to get people to believe she can be president. If she wants to win, she has to do a lot of interviews and rallies and say quotable things, and be tweeting all the time, not just in the campaign snark accounts (which are great) but also seriously in her own name. </p>
<p>People aren't going to care about the policies though they will say that's what they want more of. What they want to feel is that she is present. Biden was invisible that's why they didn't like or trust him, even though he is a good president. Trump is very present, and they like that, trust that, but most of them also know he's a creep. She just has to keep beating the drum. </p>
<p>And the secret is to keep beating the drum, constantly, after she wins. Don't disappear like Obama did. She must not only be president of the United States, but she has to be <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/09/10/twitterPresidentKamala.html">president of Twitter</a> too (and by Twitter I mean all the twitter-like systems). </p>
<p>So don't expect undecided voters to all convert to Harris in one event. But they will if she stays in the news, even dominates the news (please) and help them see Trump as a thing of the past. </p>
<p>That's the way to win, and to win in governing too. </p>

I wouldn't have traded places with Harris for anything in the world, she did fantastic. The pressure on her was enormous. I don't think Trump said one thing that was true. And Harris made the point that the division is coming from that guy over there, and if we don't want it all we have to do is turn the freaking page. For once the power is with the people. The Repubs in the Senate wouldn't vote to convict, the Supreme Court just gave him immunity, but the American people, in a few weeks, can tell them all to fuck off.

When Trump repeated his most egregious lie about murdering babies being legal in certain states, moderator Muir confidently, almost derisively, said that there is no such thing. And when Trump said he didn't admit he lost the election, and then when challenged said in a snotty way he was being sarcastic, Muir plainly that wasn't true either. It was like the Monty Python <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vuW6tQ0218">dead parrot</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Parrot_sketch">sketch</a>.

## Evaluating the Effectiveness of Reward Modeling of Generative AI Systems

date: 2024-09-11, updated: 2024-09-10, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>New research evaluating the effectiveness of reward modeling during Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10270">SEAL: Systematic Error Analysis for Value ALignment</a>.&#8221; The paper introduces quantitative metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of modeling and aligning human values:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aims to align language models (LMs) with human values by training reward models (RMs) on binary preferences and using these RMs to fine-tune the base LMs. Despite its importance, the internal mechanisms of RLHF remain poorly understood. This paper introduces new metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of modeling and aligning human values, namely feature imprint, alignment resistance and alignment robustness. We categorize alignment datasets into target features (desired values) and spoiler features (undesired concepts). By regressing RM scores against these features, we quantify the extent to which RMs reward them ­ a metric we term feature imprint. We define alignment resistance as the proportion of the preference dataset where RMs fail to match human preferences, and we assess alignment robustness by analyzing RM responses to perturbed inputs. Our experiments, utilizing open-source components like the Anthropic preference dataset and OpenAssistant RMs, reveal significant imprints of target features and a notable sensitivity to spoiler features. We observed a 26% incidence of alignment resistance in portions of the dataset where LM-labelers disagreed with human preferences. Furthermore, we find that misalignment often arises from ambiguous entries within the alignment dataset. These findings underscore the importance of scrutinizing both RMs and alignment datasets for a deeper understanding of value alignment...</p></blockquote>

date: 2024-09-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Harris must become president of Twitter before becoming president of the United States.</p>
<p>After the debate, Harris should be interviewed anywhere they'll have her. Go ahead and be overexposed. Answer every question with one of your major positioning statements. Call in to radio talk shows, podcasts, whatever you can think of. Biden hardly ever promoted himself. Not being heard <i>all the time</i> was his biggest sin. Harris should get accustomed to being accessible when she's in office. Keep the <a href="https://www.threads.net/@kamalahq/">kamalahq</a> snark channel going. This will have been Trump's contribution to American politics, no fear of being heard. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS">BRIC</a> countries == Brazil, Russia, India and China.  </p>
<p>Brazil's population is 215 million, US is 333 million, so Brazil is 64% of US.</p>
<p>When we win the Twitter presidency we will have Jumped the Trump. 😇</p>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2024/09/10/twitterPresidentHarris.m4a">12 minute podcast</a>. </p>

## 2024-09-08 WebDAV no more

date: 2024-09-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-08-webdav-no-more">2024-09-08 WebDAV no more</h1>

<p>I must have implemented <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</a> two or three times in the last decade or two. Just now I used <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_dav.html">mod_dav for Apache</a> to enable WebDAV for some directories.</p>

<p>In theory, it&rsquo;s great. You can treat the web server as a file server, connecting to it and using your regular file manager and text editor, using your favourite shell to do things. And if your website already uses permissions to restrict access to some locations, you can use the same config files to handle the making of changes.</p>

<p>In practice, however, the operating systems all have such brittle implementations that none of the solutions I had in production ever worked well. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it&rsquo;s Windows&rsquo; File Explorer, macOS&rsquo; Finder, the Gnome virtual file system via Nautilus or something else. The only thing that works is the command-line client <a href="https://notroj.github.io/cadaver/">cadaver</a>. It&rsquo;s the best. It works. Sooner or later, however, I realize that cadaver is probably not the tool I can expect non-technical people to use. It has the same user-interface as the old ftp command-line client.</p>

<p>I wonder what the issue is. WebDAV is 25 years old. It seems to me that something about the process or the spec must have set it up for failure. Perhaps it was a complex protocol? <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2518">RFC 2518</a> for WebDAV is from February 1999, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a> for HTTP/1.1 is from June 1999. Perhaps the move from HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.1 too away all the thunder. There was the DotCom craze and Web 2.0 and what not. Nobody had time for WebDAV? Nobody had a business model for WebDAV? People used FTP and SSH and all that for remote file access, there was no point doing it using web technology? Or perhaps there wasn&rsquo;t just one library to rule them all and in the darkness bind them?</p>

<p>In any case, I think I need to write this down so I don&rsquo;t fall for it again in two years. I&rsquo;ve been falling for it since 2005. Every wiki of mine gets WebDAV support … Looking at my blog it seems that <a href="2021-10-18_WebDAV_is_tricky">the last time</a> I spent five days to get this right. This time around I&rsquo;m just tired.</p>

<p>Time to disable <code>mod_dav</code> again.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23WebDAV">#WebDAV</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-09-10</strong>. Another option would be an explicit list of endorsed clients like <a href="https://notroj.github.io/cadaver/">cadaver</a>, <a href="http://rei.to/carotdav_en.html">CarotDAV</a>, <a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/DAV">hDAV</a>, <a href="https://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a>, … But I have only used <code>cadaver</code> myself.</p>

## 30th anniversary in a month

date: 2024-09-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Are the Apple announcements like great reunions for people who have been going to these things regularly for 20+ years? If so, I can see the value in it. </p>
<p>I went to a reunion at Berkman, <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/09/08/222335.html">after 20 years</a>, and it was great, made me wonder why we didn't do it every year for the last 20. When you get a group of people together who do great things in a special moment, you should see them from time to time. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/03/22/accordionPlayer.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">But I have a feeling there's a lot of turnover at the Apple events. In any case, I stopped going to them somewhere in the mid-90s, or more accurately they stopped inviting me. Yeah I was disruptive, but only in comparison to how well-behaved the other journos were (at that time I was writing for Wired). </p>
<p>The press was in awe of Apple and other Valley companies. I enjoyed that for a very brief period when my company went public after I had a hit Mac product. Then I became something of a pariah, because I <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">started blogging</a> and believe me the icons of the Valley for the most part <i>did not like it.</i> They were accustomed to fawning attention and rewritten press releases. But because I was an insider, I had an idea where the bodies might be buried, and I wrote about it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Woz</a> liked it. I was popular at the parties, I guess. </p>
<p>BTW, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Roizen">Heidi Roizen</a> once observed that I took a date to an Apple announcement (the one where Steve came back). There weren't many people there, maybe 20 or 25. </p>
<p>Jeff Jarvis wrote in the foreword to his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Web-We-Weave-Internet-Misanthropes/dp/1541604121">upcoming book</a> that I'm like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig">Zelig</a> of tech. This is what he meant, imho. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>We're coming up on the 30th anniversary of my blog, one month from tomorrow. You won't hear anyone from tech applauding, and you probably won't hear anything from the old bloggers. But I have something special in mind myself. Hopefully it'll come together in the next month, or sooner. :-)</p>
<p>Let's go back to 1994, by looking to the future. You won't need an invite, btw. It'll open to everyone.</p>

## Australia Threatens to Force Companies to Break Encryption

date: 2024-09-09, updated: 2024-09-09, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>In 2018, Australia passed the Assistance and Access Act, which&#8212;among other things&#8212;gave the government the <a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/australias-assistance-and-access-act">power</a> to force companies to break their own encryption.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Assistance and Access Act includes key components that outline investigatory powers between government and industry. These components include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical Assistance Requests (TARs): TARs are voluntary requests for assistance accessing encrypted data from law enforcement to teleco and technology companies. Companies are not legally obligated to comply with a TAR but law enforcement sends requests to solicit cooperation.

## Peering in the social web

date: 2024-09-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A very practical issue. </p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l3njg5jhft2k">BlueSky</a> has a 300 character limit, which is less than the other services I cross-post to, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mastodon: 500 (using mastodon.social as benchmark)</li>
<li>Threads: 500</li>
<li>Twitter: 10000 (assume paying the montly fee)</li>
<li>RSS: no specific limit</li>
<li>WordPress: no specific limit</li>
<li>BlueSky: 300</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be a problem when we eventually get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peering">peering</a> working cross-network among twitter-like systems.</p>
<p>It looks to me, just eyeballing this list, that 500 is a good place to start, although I don't think ultimately there should be any specific limits. </p>
<p>We saw that clearly when RSS 0.91 was the most recent version, there were limits in the Netscape doc, but they were ignored by content sources, which is why I took them out in the 0.92 and 2.0 versions. </p>
<p>Peering is simpler than federation. It would enable people to send messages across these boundaries, but wouldn't handle the engagement features, likes, replies, forwarding. It's what many people are starting to do now, by hand. There's no way to put it off, imho -- the Bluesky limit is already hard to deal with. </p>

Supplements are a Rising Cause of Liver Failure by Dr. Jen Gunther &#8230;the risk of supplement-related liver injury and liver injury severe enough that liver transplantation is needed has increased dramatically over the past 20 years. Some estimates suggest supplements may cause up to 43% of drug-induced liver injury in the United States and 19% [&#8230;]

Do you think you've ever had an online chat with an AI impersonating a human without you knowing? Have you had such an experience with someone you know? If no, when do you think you will have such a conversation? Would you mind if a friend used an AI to front for them, so they could do other things while they were "chatting" with you? Would you be liable for anything your avatar did or said?

Also, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall">when the Berlin Wall came down</a> there were no blogs or podcasts. We got what we were given by the news networks and NYT and WSJ.

It's a fascinating moment, somewhat like when the Berlin Wall came down. When it happened, we were all in kind of a daze. That wall had been there my entire life. No one knew, for many years, what its disappearance would mean. Same with the wall betw the Democratic and Republican parties. It was still the same US when one or the other was in power, there were constants that didn't change. There was an agreement that politics ends at the border. But now, are there two parties? What became of the one we call Republican?

## Jony Made a Button

date: 2024-09-07, from: Om Malik blog

TLDR: Jony Ive&#8217;s design agency LoveFrom has reimagined the humble button for Moncler, once again proving that for Sir Jony, everything is up for reinterpretation. It&#8217;s a reminder that innovation often lies in refining the familiar, not just inventing the new. Source: Jony Ive’s LoveFrom Reinvents a Button With Moncler Key Points: Moncler is a &#8230;

I found a bug in <a href="https://github.com/scripting/opmlPackage/blob/main/worknotes.md#9724-95957-am-by-dw">opml.visitAll</a> in the OPML package I use in various software including Drummer and FeedLand. Had to fix it, even though there's a slight chance of breakage.

## Election Countdown, 59 Days to Go: Nippon Steel vs. the Electoral College.

date: 2024-09-07, from: James Fallows, Substack

Why is Joe Biden preparing to block the sale of US Steel? For 19 reasons: Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes. That logic may be irrefutable in an election year. But it has real costs.
