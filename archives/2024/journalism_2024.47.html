Healthcare Foundation hosts watch party in support of Proposition
33</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-18, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Around 70 people gathered at a watch party in Hollywood on Nov. 5 to
show support for Proposition 33, a proposal to expand rent control.
Proposition 33, which was rejected by approximately 60% of voters
according to the Los Angeles Times, would have repealed the
Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, enabling local governments to
expand limits on rental rates for housing.</p>
