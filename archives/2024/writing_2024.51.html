Fans of TJ Klune’s enormously popular <strong>The House in the Cerulean
Sea </strong>were no doubt thrilled to hear about the unexpected sequel,
<strong>Somewhere Beyond the Sea</strong>. The continuing story of
Arthur, Linus, and the group of orphaned magic children they care for is
as heartfelt and political as readers could want. Make no mistake,

<p>“I would argue that the movies, the plays, the stories that endure
and certainly that resonate in the most populist and global way are the
ones where we’re not just observing a piece of storytelling, we’re
participative in some way and it’s connective. How can any of us who are
flawed humans connect with a flawless hero? The beauty of Wade
[Deadpool] and Logan [Wolverine] is that really, they’re two
anti-heroes. They do not abide by typical moral codes. They both have
been scarred deeply. And I think one thing that’s really interesting
about them is that the worst thing that’s ever happened to them is also
the source of their superpowers. Which I think, by the way, is something
worth thinking about in all our lives – that the things that we had to
get over are also the source of our strength,” says writer/director of
<em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> Shawn Levy.  <br> <br>In this episode,
we discuss the elements that Levy thinks make a great hero and also a
powerful villain like Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin).  <br> <br>“There was
something really juicy about [Cassandra’s] twinship with Charles Xavier,
that this villain is a new villain who has never been in a movie, who
has never been anywhere other than the pages of a Marvel comic book. But
there is this connective tissue to deep beloved, extensive mythology
with Professor X and Charles. So we did lean into her resentment, her
envy of Charles. You know, I think maybe one of my favorite couplets of
our writing in this movie is when Cassandra says to Wolverine, ‘He must
have really loved you.’ And he says to Cassandra, ‘He would have loved
you too. He would have torn a hole in the universe if he knew where you
were.’ I get goosebumps saying it now!” says Levy.  <br> <br>We also
break down that hilarious fight scene between <em>Deadpool &amp;
Wolverine</em> that takes place entirely inside a Honda Odyssey. <br>

Sung-il Kim’s 2016 fantasy novel <strong>Blood of the Old Kings
</strong>features heroic characters and an innovative, engaging magic
system. It makes for a breezy fantasy story where exposition is
skillfully allotted in brief bursts that don’t mar its pacing. And the
action scenes are breathlessly propulsive. Those ingredients launch a

in the classic mode, in which a small team of he­roes must outwit and

closer examination, however, finds it taking this classic form

“muting”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, from: IF Database News</p>
IFDB has allowed you to hide a user and their reviews, comments, lists,
and polls since 2008. At that time, the feature was called “plonking,”
which is <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/P/plonk.html">an old term
from Usenet</a>. Now, we use the modern standard term, “muting.” (This
is just a rename; the feature works the same way it did before.)
<details>
<summary>
How muting works
</summary>
<ul>
<li>
If you mute a user, all of her reviews, comments, lists, and polls will
be omitted throughout IFDB.
</li>
<li>
This only affects you - it won’t actually delete the user’s reviews or
hide them when other members view the same game pages.
</li>
<li>
Muted accounts will not know that you’ve muted them.
</li>
<li>
You can change your mind and un-mute someone later via the
<a href="https://ifdb.org/userfilter?list">user filter editor</a>.
</li>
</ul>

There is nothing quite like horror to ring in the holiday cheer. While
the holiday season offers your favorite formulaic rom-com that brings
that feeling of joy to our cold hearts, Christmas-themed horror movies
designed to scare audiences during the most wonderful time of the year
have become more popular than ever. <br><br>While horror films—more
specifically slashers—are often reserved for Halloween, Damien Leone’s
<em>Terrifier 3</em> paid homage to classic Holiday slashers <em>Black
Christmas</em> and <em>Silent Night Deadly Night</em>, all of which make
the season terrifying. But what is it about these movies that works? And
more importantly—how do you write a Christmas horror movie?

<p>“What happens when you disassociate? What happens when you’re
separate from yourself? What happens when you’re no longer yourself? Is
there a camera language that can embody that, that can execute that? In
the film, when Elwood walks into the white house, he looks left he sees
the sawhorse thing that they’re beat on. He looks to the right, he sees
Hamish [Linklater, who plays Spencer]. And then when he looks to the
left again, he’s in front of the camera because he separated from it.
He’s having an out of body experience,” says director and co-writer of
<em>Nickel Boys</em> about his unusual technique for shooting his
protagonist Elwood’s point of view. </p>

<p>On today’s episode of the Write On podcast, we speak with RaMell Ross
about his new film <em>Nickel Boys</em> about two young Black men who
get sent to a reform school in 1960’s Jim Crow South. The film is
heartbreakingly beautiful and already getting plenty of Oscar buzz.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the interview, Ross admits he didn’t know how to write a
screenplay when he decided to adapt Colson Whitehead’s book <em>Nickel
Boys</em>, so he began the process by using written storyboards to
visualize the scenes, which were later converted into a screenplay with
the help of co-writer Joselyn Barnes. We also discuss his decision to
limit the violence depicted on screen. </p>

<p>“It’s a tough space because on one hand, you want people to
understand the things that happened and their horror. But I feel as a
culture, we’ve been overexposed to it and specifically overexposed as it
relates to people of color because we don’t have so many iterations of
visuals of people of color. If that’s most of it, then how does that
work on the culture and psyche?” says Ross. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Ross also shares his take on writing a movie with historical
elements.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>“I don’t think that what we understand to be history is history. I
think that it’s a collection of familiar ways of analyzing or engaging
with the past that fits comfortably in the socio-political language of
reflection. I don’t know what it’s like to be a person in the past. And
I know that a lot of the narratives that we have these days are guided
by a person’s either nefarious unconscious or they have another type of
motivation behind them. And so I want people to think about the past as
something that has the freedom of interpretation, that we would like to
be given to all of the things that we’ve done in our lives. I just don’t
believe in historical reproduction,” he says. </p>

I’m continually interested in how the corona­virus pandemic does – or
commonly doesn’t – make its way into fiction. It’s such a huge event,
but one that “realistic” novels, movies, and television series seem
hesitant to engage with, opting instead for a kind of hazy
