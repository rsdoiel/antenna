<p>Has anyone ever asked you, on the social web, what you think about
something? Not a message to everyone to which you could reply, but a
message specifically to you? I try to do it when I think of it. I find
you can get really interesting ideas that way sometimes. And also it’s a
way spreading some love around the world, because people like to be
asked what they think, I’ve found.</p>

<p>I’m going through
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar
Galactica</a> for the third time. One of the major themes of the show is
that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylons">robots</a> that
the Capricans created went to war with the humans and almost but not
quite wiped them out. Almost every episode is about the conflict between
humans and the AIs. It’s a fantastic show, the acting and the writing is
far beyond most TV series. I’m at the beginning of season 3. I’ll let
you know if I figure anything out from watching the series again.</p>

<p>I watched 15 minutes of the playoff game between the Boston team and
the Indiana team and found that I only gave the very slightest of fucks.
I knew all the players. I like

former Knick we traded for some reason. That’s about it for my inner
fan. I turned it off as it went to overtime and looked up the result

<h2 id="what-to-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What to do about the
climate?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-to-do-about-the-climate">
2024-05-12 What to do about the climate?
</h1>
<p>
The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way
out of this uncertainty? What should or
<a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?
</p>
<p>
Before we even start, let me just say that I’m never interested in
debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It’s real, it’s
here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.
</p>
<p>
The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green,
on all levels of government. And by “green” I mean the most radical
green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends
on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a
one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have
no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something
about local politics, and so on.
</p>
<p>
On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we’re not
sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn’t help much against the
climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many
plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean?
How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The
oil spills? And here’s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop!
I need to stop because there’s no “thinking it through” when things are
so complex unless you’re a scientist working on it. I hope the
scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the
research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and
individuals know what to tackle first.
</p>
<p>
This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly
wrong. They don’t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used
to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid
of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting
involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric
vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency
vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also:
get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing
something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then
medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build
railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special
permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society
with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are
precious.
</p>
<p>
The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I
fear.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.
</p>
<p>

<p>
The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate
Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there’s an answer if anybody is
claiming that we don’t know what to do. But also: there’s your answer if
you’re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top
need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what
little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a
very small number of people that have actually read this report, let
alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.
</p>
<p>
This is why a public “chain of trust” needs to lead from interviews with
public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social
media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with
people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance,
hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders
trust in people.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of
choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or
for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we
need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a>
right.
</p>
<p>
(We don’t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we
cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to
go.)

<p>Trump’s lawyers rested their defense of the former president today,
putting an end to the testimony we will hear in the case. Trump did not
testify. Trump’s refusal to take the stand encapsulates the MAGA
approach to politics. Since the 2020 presidential election, he and his
surrogates have made repeated accusations and statements about how the
system is rigged against them and alleged there is evidence that proves
them right.</p>

be changed. The original had served us well, but it definitely had a

used a magazine? What is it? Right now almost everyone is looking at AI
from the point of view of a world with no AI. And it turns out that once
you have it, it starts solving problems you never thought would be
associated with AI. But there it is. You just have to sit down and start
playing and you find all kinds of amazing things. But if you don’t try
it, you’ll always be looking at it from the past. We’ve seen this kind

<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/"><i>When
Online Content Disappears</i></a> by Athena Chapekis, Samuel Bestvater,
Emma Remy and Gonzalo Rivero reports results from this research:<br />
<blockquote>
we collected a random sample of just under 1 million webpages from the
archives of <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a>, an
internet archive service that periodically collects snapshots of the
internet as it exists at different points in time. We sampled pages
collected by Common Crawl each year from 2013 through 2023
(approximately 90,000 pages per year) and checked to see if those pages
still exist today.<br /> <br /> We found that 25% of all the pages we
collected from 2013 through 2023 were no longer accessible as of October
2023. This figure is the sum of two different types of broken pages: 16%
of pages are individually inaccessible but come from an otherwise
functional root-level domain; the other 9% are inaccessible because
their entire root domain is no longer functional.
</blockquote>
Their results are not surprising, but there are a number of surprising
things about their report. Below the fold, I explain.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The Web is an evanescent medium.
URLs are subject to two kinds of change:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<b>Content drift</b>, when a URL resolves to different content than it
did previously.
</li>
<li>
<b>Link rot</b>, when a URL no longer resolves.
</li>
</ul>
The Pew team found link rot in
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/">Common
Crawl’s collections</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b>A quarter of all webpages that existed at one point between 2013 and
2023 are no longer accessible,</b> as of October 2023. In most cases,
this is because an individual page was deleted or removed on an
otherwise functional website.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>For older content, this trend is even starker.</b> Some 38% of
webpages that existed in 2013 are not available today, compared with 8%
of pages that existed in 2023.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
And in
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/data-labs/2024/05/17/when-online-content-disappears/">news
sites, government sites and Wikipedia</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b>23% of news webpages contain at least one broken link, as do 21% of
webpages from government sites.</b> News sites with a high level of site
traffic and those with less are about equally likely to contain broken
links. Local-level government webpages (those belonging to city
governments) are especially likely to have broken links.
</li>
<li>
<b>54% of Wikipedia pages contain at least one link in their
“References” section that points to a page that no longer exists.</b>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
There is a long history of research into both phenomena. Content drift
is important to Web search engines. To keep their indexes up-to-date,
they need to re-vist URLs frequently enough to capture changes. Thus
studies of content drift started early in the history of the Web. Here
are some examples from more than two decades ago:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=f66149e4bc6109512003acbf844b7f3072c08ca3"><i>The

</ul>
Link rot is a slower process than content drift, so research into it
started a bit later. Here are some examples from more than two decades
ago:<br />

<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search/label/link%20rot">many times</a>,
first in 2008’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/12/persistence-of-poor-peer-reviewing.html"><i>
Persistence of Poor Peer Reviewing</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
I like to cite an example of really bad reviewing that appeared in AAAS
<i>Science</i> in 2003. It was
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1088234">Dellavalle RP,
Hester EJ, Heilig LF, Drake AL, Kuntzman JW, Schillin MGLM: Going,
Going, Gone: Lost Internet References. <i>Science</i> 2003, 302:787</a>,
a paper about the decay of Internet links. The the authors failed to
acknowledge that the paper repeated, with smaller samples and somewhat
worse techniques, two earlier studies that had been published in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/602421.602422"><i>Communications of
the ACM</i></a> 9 months before, and in
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/2.901164"><i>IEEE Computer</i></a> 32
months before. Neither of these are obscure journals. It is particularly
striking that neither the reviewers nor the editors bothered to feed the
keywords from the article abstract into Google; had they done so they
would have found both of these earlier papers at the top of the search
results.
</blockquote>
<p>The first surprise is that the Pew report lacks any acknowledgement
that the transience of Web content is a long-established problem; like
Dellavalle <i>et al</i> it is as if it was a new revelation.<br />
<br /> Even before published research had quantified it, link rot and
content drift were well understood and efforts were underway to mitigate
them. In 1996 Brewster Kahle had founded the
<a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>, the first of several
archives of the general Web. Two years later, the
<a href="https://lockss.org">LOCKSS Program</a> was the first effort to
establish a specialized archive for the academic literature. Both were
intended to deliver individual pages to users. A decade later,
<a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a> was set up to
deliver Web content in bulk to researchers such as the Pew team; it is
not intended as a mitigation for link rot or content drift.<br /> <br />
Although Common Crawl was a suitable resource for their research, the
second surprise is that the Pew report describes and quantifies the
problem of link rot, but acknowledges none of the multiple, decades-long
efforts to mitigate it by archiving the Web and providing users with
preserved copies of individual pages.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="why-tesla-fsd-is-unsafe">Why Tesla FSD is unsafe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/21/teslaModelY.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Here’s
what I’ve learned from
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla">owing</a>
a Tesla Model Y with
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/10/230303.html">Full Self
Driving</a>. I don’t believe it’s safe. It absolutely does require your
full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I’ve seen it
do crazy stuff in simple situations. I’ve seen it panic, basically throw
its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That’s why you
always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because
at any moment you could be. You never know when it’s going to happen.
Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving
over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know
where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If
you’re an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely
programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don’t have to think
at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years
experience with this connection, then I guess it’s probably safe. But
not the way it is.
</p>
<p>
I’m amazed there aren’t more terrible accidents with FSD, and that Tesla
still promotes this as “self-driving,” which it is not.
</p>
<p>
Also, I love my Tesla. Every time I get into that mofo I feel
privileged. It looks like a Toyota Camry but drives like a muscle car. I
might still switch to a
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/ev9">Kia EV9</a>, at some
point, if it drives as well as the Tesla, simply because the nearest

<p>
Apple and Google have launched a new industry standard called
“<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers/01/">Detecting
Unwanted Location Trackers</a>” to
<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-and-google-deliver-support-for-unwanted-tracking-alerts-in-ios-and-android/">combat
the misuse of Bluetooth trackers for stalking</a>. Starting Monday,
iPhone and Android users will receive alerts when an unknown Bluetooth
device is detected moving with them. The move comes after numerous cases
of trackers like Apple’s AirTags being
<a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/story/24/01/12/165230/apple-knew-airdrop-users-could-be-identified-and-tracked-as-early-as-2019">used

<p>
Several Bluetooth tag companies have committed to making their future
products compatible with the new standard. Apple and Google said they
will continue collaborating with the Internet Engineering Task Force to
further develop this technology and address the issue of unwanted
tracking…

<p>There is a curious dynamic at work in politics these days. Trump does
not appear to be trying to court voters to his standard. If he were, he
would be reaching out to Nikki Haley voters and trying to moderate his
stances. Instead, he is rejecting her voters and doubling down on
extreme positions. Rather than trying to appeal to swing voters, he
seems to be trying to whip up his right-wing base to engage in violence
on his behalf.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1792237882679156983">something</a>
you may find funny if you study the evolution of software technology.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
In the 80s there were all kinds of ideas about how to do hypertext.
Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any
direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two
parties work with each other, and that never happened.
</li>
<li>
In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep
developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn’t wait to
figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way
links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on
top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off,
broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.
</li>
<li>
A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants
to layer a new protocol on top of the web – the Semantic Web. He wanted
people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. “show
me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20.” Like that.
</li>
<li>
It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn’t, it
required cooperation. You couldn’t just throw together a demo in an
afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak
from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking
minutes).
</li>
<li>
Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like
functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL’s
Semantic Web. It won’t require any cooperation and that’s why it will
work.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Borgmann opposed devices to what he called focal things. Focal things
demand something of us. They require a measure of care, practice, and
engagement that devices do not. Our use of them induces our focus, which
they invite by design. “The experience of a [focal] thing,” Borgmann
also notes, “is always and also a bodily and social engagement […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-20, updated: 2024-05-20, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
IBM is
<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-analytics/ciso-grapple-with-ibm-unexpected-cybersecurity-software-exit">selling</a>
its QRadar product suite to Palo Alto Networks, for an undisclosed—but
probably surprisingly small—sum.
</p>
<p>
I have a personal connection to this. In 2016, IBM
<a href="https://www.securityweek.com/ibm-acquire-resilient-systems/">bought</a>
Resilient Systems, the startup I was a part of. It became part if IBM’s
cybersecurity offerings, mostly and weirdly subservient to QRadar.
</p>
<p>
That was what seemed to be the problem at IBM. QRadar was IBM’s first
acquisition in the cybersecurity space, and it saw everything through
the lens of that SIEM system. I left the company two years after the
acquisition, and near as I could tell, it never managed to figure the
space out…

<p>Delivering the commencement address to the graduating seniors at
Morehouse College today, President Joe Biden addressed the nation. After
thanking the mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, and all the
people who helped the graduates get to the chairs in front of the stage,
Biden recalled Morehouse’s history. The school was founded in 1867 by
civil rights leader Reverend William Jefferson White with the help of
two other Baptist ministers, the Reverend Richard C. Coulter and the
Reverend Edmund Turney, to educate formerly enslaved men. They believed
“education would be the great equalizer from slavery to freedom,” Biden
said, and they created an institution that would make the term
“Morehouse man” continue to stand as a symbol of excellence 157 years
later.</p>

Over the last year and a half I ran the entirety of the River Thames! In
total it took 20 runs for a total of over 440km.

Let’s get the obvious question out the way first: “why?” And I, errr,
don’t have a good reason. It’s
<a href="/blog/2021/5/3/visiting-the-eu/">not the first time</a> I’ve
done a big themed running project, but it’s by far the biggest I’ve
<em>ever</em> done.
</p>
<p>
Second obvious question: “was it a good idea?” Kinda… I really enjoyed
running through a lot of the countryside, and for the most part the
Thames Path is very easy to run on. It’s also mostly well connected with
public transport, which makes the point-to-point nature of the runs
manageable. But on the other hand I often spent far more time travelling
than running, which made it a much larger time commitment than “just” 20
weekend half marathons.
</p>
<p>
The best part of this project was seeing the contrast in landscapes and
communities across the length of the river. Until now my only
familiarity with the Thames was with its murky, curvy path through
London or the college boathouses in Oxford.
</p>

<p>
An interesting historical pattern with the Thames — as with
<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713101">many
English cities</a> — is that effluence flows downstream and affluence
upstream. A lot of this has to do with the Thames’s role in London’s
history: for centuries waste water was literally dumped in the river.
Land up river became more desirable. It’s no historical accident that
the royal court at Hampton Court Palace was far west of the City of
London.
</p>
<p>
Those historical trends are reflected today, even as sewage practices
have improved
(<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-67357566">a
little</a>) and London de-industrialised. House prices are twice as high
in Richmond-upon-Thames in south-west London than Bexley, in south-east
London. Further out of London, on an Essex-bound train I overheard a
group of men lamenting the loss of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_men%27s_club">working
men’s clubs</a>, an important
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place">third place</a> in
their communities, whilst in Oxfordshire I sat near a
<em>frightfully</em> posh former Home Secretary concluding with a group
of friends that taking the train to a party was a “terrifically smart”
decision. (Decisions they made in government weren’t quite so clever.)
</p>
<p>
Deeper into the country the Thames cuts a path through “green and
pleasant” English countryside. Over the course of my 20 runs I developed
a newfound appreciation for it. I’ve genuinely come to believe that
we’re <em>incredibly</em> fortunate in the UK to be so well connected to
so much accessible, open space.

<p>
I ran with a running vest, a 1.5L Osprey water bladder, a handful of
snacks (Clif bars in particular), gels, AirPods, iPhone, and Apple Watch
Ultra. I experimented with cheaper water bladders but they’re a false
economy: after a few runs they’d start to leak and I’d have to replace
them.

<figcaption>

<p>
The Watch was the MVP of all these: I used
<a href="https://pedometer.app">Pedometer++</a> to display my planned
route and route taken throughout each run. The app supports both
OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey tiles; I generally preferred the
former as they were clearer on the small display.
</p>
<p>
For the most part I was following the Thames Path, but I often deviated
around it to either explore other countryside or take shortcuts on
routes that would otherwise be too long in one go.
</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thamesconditions">
Conditions
</h2>
<p>
I ran mostly in winter and spring 2023 and spring 2024. In the winter
months the path was often <em>very</em> muddy, whilst in spring there
were sections with very overgrown grass (which was joyless with my
hayfever). The Thames burst its banks last year, flooding parts of the
path. The
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-restrictions-and-closures">Environment
Agency has pages monitoring current river conditions</a>.
</p>
<p>
Towards the source of the river the Thames Path is often just a trodden
path along the edge of fields. This makes for a very uneven surface: I
had to slow down to avoid turning an ankle.
</p>
<p>
I only ran in the summer once, but even in spring it was often 20º+ and
sunny. Most of the route is <em>very</em> exposed: by the end I
regularly ran with a baseball cap.
</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thameslogistics">
Logistics
</h2>
<p>
I live in London, which made travel to and from each run easy. (Cities
in the UK are well connected by rail to London and <em>far</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts">less well to one
another</a>.) All in I spent about £400 on train tickets, local buses,
and (only twice) taxis. I used a railcard to decrease costs but
otherwise I generally optimised for time. I’ve no doubt that booking
advance singles, split tickets, or cheaper train lines could reduce the
cost by at least £100.
</p>
<p>
At the end of each run I made a tradition of buying a meal deal (or
equivalent) and extra snacks: I spent a further £200 on these.
</p>
<p>
Between Lechlade, Gloucestershire and Teddington, London the Thames is
interrupted by dozens of locks. These locks often have extra facilities
for boaters, which
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-locks-and-facilities-for-boaters">the
Environment Agency lists here</a>. I learned way, way too late
(literally at the <em>last</em> lock I ran past) that this often
includes drinking water taps that you can use to refill water bottles. A
lock keeper recommended running the tap for 30s before using it.
</p>
<p>
I’ve posted GPX files for all the routes below.

For all the London and Kent routes I took South Western trains, TfL
services, or High Speed 1.
</p>

The best sections were from Battersea Power Station to Greenwich: you
get far more diversity in the built environment on this leg than any
other section of the Thames (beyond these points London is mostly just
suburbs).

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_1_N_Teddington_Lock_to_Barnes_Bridge.gpx">[1/20]
Teddington to Barnes Bridge (12.7km)</a>: I started by running west with
one of the shortest runs. All of the London sections were very flexible
as the Thames path is rarely more than a few hundred meters from a TfL
connection. Teddington is the final lock on the River Thames and
therefore the start of the “tidal Thames”.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_2_N_Barnes_Bridge_to_Tower_Bridge.gpx">[2/20]
Barnes Bridge to Tower Bridge (21.2km)</a>: By far the busiest section
as it includes the Southbank. Stopped at Battersea Power Station
halfway.

on the day.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_4_N_Woolwich_to_Dartford.gpx">[4/20] Woolwich

<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_5_N_Dartford_to_Gravesend.gpx">[5/20] Dartford
to Gravesend (20.3km)</a>: This was by far the least pleasant section to

aren’t much better. Gravesend definitely wins “worst place name” of
anywhere I went.

For all the Essex routes I took c2c trains from West Ham and Fenchurch
Street. I chose to cross to running on the north side of the river and
run the Thames Estuary Path instead of the Thames Path as it was
<em>far</em> better connected to London.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_6_N_Tilbury_to_Stanford_le_Hope.gpx">[6/20]
Tilbury to Stanford-le-Hope (17km)</a>: I ran fairly far inland from the
river (the land immediately next to the river was marshy). I wouldn’t
recommend this path in winter.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_7_N_Stanford_le_Hope_to_Benfleet.gpx">[7/20]
Stanford-le-Hope to Benfleet (19.7km)</a>: This section was again quite
muddy when I ran it in early spring 2023. Benfleet Station was my
starting connection for the next 2 runs.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_8_N_Canvey_Island_Loop.gpx">[8/20] Canvey
Island (23.6km)</a>: I ran a lap of Canvey Island because I’m followed
by a group of pedants on Strava who would’ve called me out if I skipped
it.

<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_9_N_Benfleet_to_Southend_on_Sea_completed_the_tidal_Thames_.gpx">[9/20]
Benfleet to Southend-on-Sea (12km)</a>: I concluded I’d reached the end
of the Thames when I reached a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stone_(riparian)">London
Stone</a> at Chalkwell, which marks the end of the Port of London’s
Authority. However I continued to Southend-on-Sea because I figured if
they’re claiming it’s at the seaside rather than the estuary-side that
was good enough for me. Finished with fish and chips and ice cream on
the beach.

west. At Weybridge I had to cross the river via a ferry. Although it
felt delightfully old-fashioned to cross the river by ringing a bell to
call the ferryman, it was still 2023 so he took Apple Pay.

short at Reading. The area around Reading was the last busy part of the
Thames Path.

Ridgeway</a> rather than the Thames Path. I originally plotted this
route with a plan to take a train back from Wallingford Station … only
to discover it was a heritage station with <em>very</em> infrequent
services so afterwards I looped back and took a train back to London
from nearby Chorley.

a bus to Wallingford for the start of this one. The Thames Path crosses
the river at Benson Lock but at the time the footbridge was closed; a
ferry operated across the river instead. I suffered my worst hay fever
reaction ever towards the end of this run so my pace dropped completely
and I walked the last few kilometers back to Radley, where I then took a
train to Oxford and another back to London.

Radley to Appleton (31.4km)</a>: This section loops through Oxford, so
aside from colleges’ dreaming spires you also see Port Meadow, The Trout
Inn (which features prominently in Philip Pullman’s <em>The Book of
Dust</em>), and the ruins of Godstow Abbey (which features prominently
in <em>Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again</em>). I’d argue these are the last
tourist attractions on the run: the remainder is all through countryside
and very small towns. I had virtually no service for the second half of
the run which made navigating back to Oxford a bit of a challenge; I
eventually walked to the A420 and got a local bus back.

opposite side of the river between Bablock Hythe and Appleton. I believe
<a href="https://theferrymaninn.co.uk">the pub at Bablock Hythe</a>
operates a ferry service, but at the time I was running it was closed. I
therefore took a taxi from Oxford to start this run. St John’s Lock is
the final (or first!) lock on the river, about a kilometer downstream
from Lechlade. At Lechlade I took a local bus to Swindon and trains back
from there.

For all the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire runs I took trains to or via
Swindon and then either local buses or taxis to reach towns or villages
on the Thames.

Lechlade to Cricklade (18.2km)</a>: Lechlade marks the end of the
“navigable Thames” and aside from a few narrowboats anchored around
Lechlade; I only saw one more rowing boat on the rest of the river. This
was the quietest section: I only saw a handful of walkers and no other
runners.

Cricklade to Thames Head (22km)</a>: For the final leg through the
Cotswolds I didn’t push the pace at all. The Thames Path hugged the
river tightly but my route deviated slightly from it. The only challenge
I had was when I encountered a herd of cows that took a little too much
interest in me for my liking … the correct solution was <em>not</em> to
climb through a barbed wire fence but instead to walk around them
calmly, which I unfortunately learned the hard way.
</p>
<p>
By May the spring at Thames Head had dried up, but I instead found the
spring that was the current source of the Thames tucked away in some
woodland between the A433 and the A429. I wouldn’t recommend doing what
I did, which was to wade through the Thames (it was only a few
centimeters deep here!), cut myself on a whole bunch of brambles, and
then get stung by a bunch of stinging nettles to find it. But on the
other hand there was no chance I was going to run 400km and <em>not</em>
find the start.
</p>
<p>
I continued on to Thames Head, the traditional start of the river and of
the Thames Path. There I met a friendly group of walkers and runners,
most of whom were about to set off down the path in the opposite
direction. I considered getting a pint in at the Thames Head Inn nearby,
but instead opted to avoid train delays and cancellations so I caught
the train back to London from Kemble.

The final obvious question: “what’s next?” … A break?! The lesson from
this project has been that I don’t mind travel for runs, just so long as
the travel doesn’t take significantly more time than the run itself.
That said, I’ve definitely got a couple more daft projects in the
pipeline…

I were desiging a system to compete with Twitter, I’d implement a
one-click Block button. It should be as easy to block someone as it is
to follow them. It would make a statement to trolls and users alike. To
users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don’t think about it
too much, and certainly don’t be intimidated into not doing it. It must
be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent
blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an
account but not quite this easy. I think they’re probably heading
there.</p>

<p>Today the Knicks play a game 7 vs the Indiana team at the Garden. If
the Knicks win, they go on to the next round vs the Celtics, starting on
Tuesday. If they lose, we relax for four months or so, when it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%9325_NBA_season">starts
all over again</a>. With love for the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj_kK1j3CV0&t=315s">heart of
gold</a> team. Either way we win, imho. I know you’re not supposed to
feel that way, but that’s how I feel right now. During the game, if
we’re losing, based on recent experience I won’t like that so much.
