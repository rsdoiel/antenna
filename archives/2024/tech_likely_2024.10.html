that he has access to a feature in Threads that we don’t have, which
allows him to follow his Threads account from a Mastodon account. This
is the easy side of interop, the other direction is more difficult, not
technically, but from a regulation and PR standpoint. Facebook (they
call themselves Meta now) heavily regulates what people can see on their
network, and it’s hard to imagine them not having an App Store like the
ones on iOS and Android that allows certain services to peer with them
and disallows the rest. This should be factored into people’s thinking
about the benefits of federating. It probably will feel fairly
one-way.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-03-08 Go routines
</h1>
<p>
Oddmu can be run as a static site generator. It walks the tree and
renders HTML pages. For the 15000+ files on my blog (about a third of
them files that are simply linked and not rendered), it took around
160s. I wondered whether it was possible to push it. How about starting
a go routine that walks the directory tree, adding files to a tasks
channel and then closing it; starting four or five worker go routines
that take files from the tasks channel until there is nothing left to
do; putting errors on a results channel and when they’re done, putting a
true value on a done channel; a watcher go routine that checks the done
channel and if every worker is done, close the results channel; and the
main program goes through all the values on the results channel and sets
up some short-circuiting in the case of errors and otherwise it prints
an animation. What a glorious spaghetti mess of code! I felt so smart
because it was so hard. All those failure states I fixed. Endless waits
because channels ran out of data and my code kept waiting. And now it
runs in 74 seconds with the fans on. And I’m … I’m not quite sure what
to think. Perhaps it was all a waste of time. Was it really worth it?
</p>
<p>
Suddenly I have my doubts.
</p>
<p>
I used just two workers and it was a bit less than 100s. I guess I’ll
just put that on a separate branch should I ever need to look at it
again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Later</strong>. As it turns out, I came back to that branch
after some sleep with the sun shining and cleaned it up and now I don’t
feel so bad about it any more. I think it can stay.

<p>date: 2024-03-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine
</h1>
<p>
If you’re wondering how Israel is going to come back after all this, I
suspect you already forgot how it managed to come back
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_conflict">after
2006</a>. I’m not sure how that makes me feel. On the one hand, I have
completely checked out. The people in charge are utter villains. The
settlements, the cutting down of trees, the terrorizing, the things one
reads in the news if one cares to look are in a vague but emotionally
crushing and morally grinding way similar to how the territory of the US
was built on rape, murder, land grab, death marches and reservations. On
the other hand, I think we cannot let that hold us back from seeking a
better future. We must not stare at the bloody entrails left behind on
this road to war. Yes, the news is grim. We must look past it, however.
What comes after that? Where will we be in forty years? In twenty years?
In five years? In two years? Next year? How will it be better than this?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The disparity in conditions in the north and south is clear evidence
that aid restrictions in the north are costing lives. UNICEF and WFP
malnutrition screenings in the north in January found that nearly 16 per
cent - or 1 in 6 children under 2 years of age - are acutely
malnourished. Similar screenings conducted in the south in Rafah, where
aid has been more available, found 5 per cent of children under 2 years
are acutely malnourished.” –
<a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/statement-adele-khodr-unicef-regional-director-middle-east-and-north-africa-0">Statement
by Adele Khodr, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North
Africa</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And if you think a solution is impossible, then take heart. The world
has managed to come back from two World Wars and countless other brutal
wars. Peace is possible. People are not inherently evil. Most people
want peace. Those in power and the people surrounding them and
supporting them often don’t want peace, however. And once the slaughter
starts, it’s hard to stop. Peace is hard.
</p>
<p>
Often the people arguing for war just can’t imagine peace because of
this detail or that detail. And the details are hard to get right, for
sure. But they are not impossible. Imagination is required. How else are
people going to make plans for after the war? The war will end one day.
And those who survived will be following plans that somebody imagined.
It is important to imagine a happy, prosperous future and then to make
plans of how to get there.
</p>
<p>
I remember how I was a German speaking kid in Portugal in the eighties
and sometimes I’d be greeted by an angry “Heil Hitler!” from kids my
age. And Portugal wasn’t even in the war! But all the killing takes
generations to forgive and forget. The longer it takes us to get to
peace, the longer it will take to forgive. And once there is peace, we
must not squander it. We need to work for it. We need to keep aiming for
that happy, prosperous future and stick to plans that go there. Don’t
follow leaders without a clear plan. If they don’t have one, they don’t
care or they’re unwilling to listen. There are many people with plans
for peace. It’s just that the road is hard. And yet, that is the road we
have.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stop the killing.
</li>
<li>
Respect human rights.
</li>
<li>
Implement justice.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Yes, it’s hard. But the alternative isn’t looking good. And we know how
to do this. We have negotiated countless peace treaties. We have found
solutions to thorny issues all over the world. This is not an impossible
task.

Since the good guys always win in the end, and are typically
outnumbered, this becomes pretty important. The orcs will brutally,
savagely kill a few dozen elves, and the elves will respond in a very
civilized fashion by wiping out the entire orc civilization. You can
even still see this kind of justification in contemporary colonialism

<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Before I get into this, I want to thank you for inviting me to be part
of this special series you do. I look forward to reading them as soon as
they are posted. I’ve missed a few, but I am working my way back through
those. They are the source of many open browser tabs, just as I hope
this one will be for others.
</p>
<p>
Ok, is this where I assert my nerd cred? I grew up in Overland Park,
Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City. My interests were music, comic books,
skateboarding and computers, none of which were cool to many people
then. Despite it all, I had a pretty good childhood with close friends
and supportive parents who loved me. I went to computer camp and learned
BASIC programming on an Apple IIe when I was young. Our first home
computer was a Franklin Ace 1200. It had a dial-up modem, allowing me to
begin exploring BBSes. At some point, my dad bought an IBM PS/1. It was
our first computer with a GUI (Windows), but more importantly, Prodigy
and, later, AOL.
</p>
<p>
I’m a <a href="https://warpcast.com/~/channel/vip">Very Internet
Person</a> with an insatiable appetite and irrational excitement for
cool, weird and fascinating web stuff. I’ve somehow maintained a certain
level of excitement and optimism about the web. I can still recall the
excitement I felt when a friend showed up to my apartment with NCSA
Mosaic on a floppy. I get an unreasonable thrill from discovering web
stuff, which I hoard, tag and share with others.
</p>
<p>
I took a minimal number of credits at the University of Kansas. They
were just enough to make me eligible to work at KJHK, KU’s college radio
station, one of the best in the country. When I wasn’t in class, at the
station or seeing shows at The Bottleneck, I immersed myself in music
and computers. I worked in a recording studio, worked as a College
Marketing Rep for Sony Music, started a record label, built websites and
created interactive things for the web. I most notably built an early
interactive music player in Macromedia Director for the KU student
newspaper’s website.
</p>
<p>
Lawrence, Kansas was one of the first places in the U.S. to have
broadband cable modems, which, of course, I had. I used all that crazy
bandwidth to load web pages faster, listen to music on IUMA and
communicate with strangers on CU-SeeMe. Some of those strangers would
later become friends, co-conspirators and co-workers. Keep in mind this
was in the mid-1990s!
</p>
<p>
One of the first interactive agencies in LA hired the leading developers
of CU-SeeMe away from Cornell. Along with a handful of developers, they
worked to commercialize the technology. I flew to LA and convinced the
founder to hire me as a product manager and cover my moving expenses.
That was during the first <a href="http://dot.com">dot.com</a> boom (and
bust). I’ve lived in LA ever since, working in tech, save for a slight
detour or two. Over the last decade, I’ve worked at the intersection of
consumer hardware and software, most notably at Sonos and Oura. I’m
especially interested in how humans interact with technology and
integrate it into daily life.
</p>
<p>
I live with my wife, eleven-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son, in
the Mar Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles. I’ve been enjoying my first
real career break since May last year. I’ve been spending time with
family, writing, reading, playing, and making new friends, both online
and in real life. I’m currently coaching, running workshops for small
teams and consulting.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I started blogging on
<a href="http://bradbarrish.com">bradbarrish.com</a> in 2001 on
MoveableType. I also started a separate music blog called Jeans And A
T-Shirt in 2002. It had a decent following and I met tons of people
because of it. I started publishing on
<a href="http://whatevernevermind.com">whatevernevermind.com</a> (a
reference to a Nirvana lyric) in 2004. If memory serves, that’s when I
started using WordPress. I enjoyed writing on Tumblr during its heyday,
but when they sold it to Yahoo, I exported my posts and returned to my
domain(s). I’ve continued to publish with varying frequency there ever
since.
</p>
<p>
I’ve never thought about the story behind my blog until now, so what
follows is a lightly edited stream-of-consciousness answer. For some
reason, I still believe there is something magical about being able to
create something on the web that connects with other people. It’s been
exciting to see a renewed interest in personal publishing. All these
cool and weird minimalist CMSes are amazing! Seeing people building
thoughtful, sustainable products, services and platforms for the long
haul is inspiring. I’m here for it!
</p>
<p>
I basically just write about and link to anything interesting to me.
I’ve learned over and over that if something is interesting to me, there
are probably at least a few other people that will be into it too.
Publishing stuff online is, in many ways, a signal or beacon that lets
other people know you’re into a thing and says, ‘Hey! Me too! Let’s hang
out.’
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
RSS is at the heart of my exploration and inspiration. I have thousands
of websites and newsletters that come into
<a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a>. I love Feedbin and have been
using it for many years. I’m constantly pruning feeds, adding new sites
and unsubscribing. When I have more time, I’ll skim the main stream,
which includes everything I subscribe to. When I have less time, I have
a list of about 50 essential sites I skim. Feedbin also allows me to
create saved searches that crawl all my feeds and surface posts with
specific words or phrases. This is especially handy for tracking
something specific, which I almost always do.
</p>
<p>
I use Golden Hill Software’s lovely
<a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/">Unread</a> app with
Feedbin on macOS and iOS. I save lots of links in
<a href="https://raindrop.io/">Raindrop</a>, where I keep all my
bookmarks. I also queue up articles in
<a href="https://read.readwise.io/new">Reader</a>, for highlighting and
annotating. Reading gets me thinking. Thinking leads to writing, so I
can clarify my thinking. Sometimes, it turns into a blog post. But more
often, I’ll write a few sentences with a link on
<a href="https://micro.bradbarrish.com/">my microblog</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve solicited feedback from people on posts, but most of them sit in an
unpublished state. Editing them to integrate the input becomes a thing
that I procrastinate. My interest often shifts or I’ll read it so many
times that I don’t like it anymore. I know this is a thing in talking to
other people who write. I have enough self-awareness to know that,
generally speaking, the more I noodle on a post, the less likely it is
to see the light of day. I open Obsidian, create a new document and
write until I get everything I have to say is on the screen. I’ll do my
best not to edit myself in this phase. Once I get everything in the
document, I’ll lightly edit it to tighten things up. Then it’s a simple
copy/paste into WordPress’ crappy editor, give it a once-over and smash
the publish button.
</p>
<p>
I use a few tools to write posts. Loose ideas get captured in
<a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>. I can go from idea to
Drafts quickly on my phone and I like its simple interface. The loose
ideas I capture in Drafts make their way into
<a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> (shoutout
<a href="https://stephango.com/">Steph</a>), where I process and write
almost everything (including these answers). I’ve used a bunch of other
similar apps, but I like how Obsidian works. It’s reasonably priced, has
an active developer community, and, by all accounts, a sustainable
business model. I pay for <a href="https://grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a>
Premium and mostly like it. I keep it disabled while writing and turn it
on when editing. I do feel like there might be something better, and I
am actually editing the answers with Hemingway.
</p>
<p>
While doing all this writing and editing, I listen to instrumental music
or fire up Endel. Full disclosure: I made a modest investment when Endel
was getting started.

<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My ideal creative environment is a small structure with floor-to-ceiling
windows, surrounded by nature to which I can teleport. I have a big
monitor (at least 4K) connected to an Apple laptop (notifications
disabled), on a sturdy desk with an obligatory Aeron Chair. A
blazing-fast wireless Internet connection is a must. I’ll have all the
delicious coffee and fresh food I need. And, of course, a Sonos system
for listening to music. Oh, and there’s not another human for miles.
</p>
<p>
Physical space absolutely influences my creativity, but it can also
distract me.

<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Most of my domains are registered with
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, which I’ve happily
used since 2011. I currently use
<a href="http://Wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> to host
<a href="https://bradbarrish.com">my main personal blog</a>, which
utilizes
<a href="https://wordpress.com/theme/sten/bradbarrish.com">Automattic’s
Sten theme</a>. I plan to migrate to a
<a href="https://ghost.org/docs/install/">self-hosted Ghost instance</a>
using the <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Zap">Zap theme</a> I’ve
already set up on an Ubuntu server hosted by
<a href="https://vultr.com/">Vultr</a>. My microblog is hosted on
<a href="http://Micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and uses the
<a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-marfa">Marfa theme</a>. I
plan to consolidate everything onto Ghost, which I have unsuccessfully
attempted once. Now that
<a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/notes-from-migrating/">Matt
Haughey’s has shared some notes</a> on the process, I’ll give it another
whirl soon.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I would approach things, more or less, the same way I approached it at
the dawn of the web, and largely still do. That is to say, I would start
writing about anything that was remotely interesting to me without much
thought given to the audience. You are your audience, if that makes
sense. I would link to and follow others who I admire. And for people
I’m especially fond of, I would reach out to them in a non-creepy way
(do I even need to say that?) to say hello and express my admiration
directly, especially if they are lesser known. Who knows? Your note
might be the thing that keeps them going for another day, week or month.
Most people don’t do this, by the way. Generosity stands out, especially
when it’s not done publicly as some performative act. You might even
make some new friends.
</p>
<p>
Like any Very Internet Person, I have too many domains. And while I’ve
often considered having my main site be something other than my name,
I’ve used my real name and identity almost everywhere online. I have to
admit to being a little envious of people with recognizable pseudonyms
or alts, but it all seems like too much work to maintain. I have enough
trouble maintaining things. Besides, there’s something freeing (for me)
and disarming (for others) about moving fluidly between URL and IRL.
Starting a conversation with, “Hey, I’m Brad” is easier.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
In short, not a lot. My domain registration,
<a href="http://bradbarrish.com">bradbarrish.com</a>, costs me about
$16/year on Namecheap. It’s hosted on
<a href="http://Wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a>’s least expensive
Starter plan, which costs me $3.25/month (billed every two years at
$78). It’s an incredible bargain if you don’t have the time or desire to
host your domain and are not bothered by its unpleasant backend.
<a href="http://Micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> hosts my microblog. I pay for
their basic tier, which costs me $5/month and is billed monthly.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned above, I intend to switch to the Ghost instance I set up
with Vultr. It’s basically a dev server at the moment and costs me
around $3/month. I’m looking forward to having everything on a single,
minimalist CMS that I don’t have to futz with often.
</p>
<p>
I’ve never had any intention or desire to generate money from my blog.
That said, I use affiliate links whenever possible, which generate
<em>maybe</em> a few hundred dollars in a good year.
</p>
<p>
It’s lovely that people make a living online from their blog or other
creations. I’m proud to financially support bloggers, artists,
musicians, journalists, podcasters, indie developers, etc. I’ve probably
been paying Kottke the longest of any single blogger. I want to live in
a world where people can make a living doing things they love. The more
niche and nerdy, the better. Financially supporting people with a few
bucks is the simplest way to bring that world about.
</p>
</div>

<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth

<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Final question indeed! Where do I even begin?! Ok, I’m literally setting
a timer to answer this one. Let’s see… (scrolls through hundreds of open
tabs) I love <a href="https://elliot.computer">Elliot Cost</a>’s work a
lot, especially <a href="https://special.fish/">Special Fish</a>. I
think I learned of Elliot through his work on
<a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/">The Creative
Independent</a>, which was co-founded (I think?) by
<a href="https://ystrickler.com/">Yancey Strickler</a>, who turned me on
to <a href="https://album.link/i/1700663637">Time Wharp’s Spiro
World</a>, which I listen to many times per week. I’m excited about
<a href="https://darkforest.metalabel.com/dfc">The Dark Forest Anthology
of the Internet</a> being released on
<a href="https://www.metalabel.com/">Metalabel</a> (Yancey’s latest
thing). <a href="https://johnbengtsson.com/">John Bengtsson</a> designs
pretty things. I recently learned about
<a href="https://lauren-mccarthy.com/">Lauren Lee McCarthy</a> and have
been diving into her work thanks to
<a href="https://www.lerandom.art/editorial/lauren-lee-mccarthy-on-software-values">an
interview</a> she did with
<a href="https://www.gorillasun.de/blog/in-conversation-with-peter-bauman-demystifying-monk-antony/">Peter
Bauman</a>. I could watch <a href="https://bleuje.com/">Etienne
Jacob</a>’s animations all day. <a href="https://kk.org">Kevin Kelly</a>
and <a href="https://craigmod.com/">Craig Mod</a> put together
<a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/how-to-walk-and-talk/">a booklet
that documents the Walk and Talk</a>, which is lovely. Touch grass. My
friend Brian <a href="https://www.feelslikefloating.com/">encourages
people</a> to touch grass while listening to beautiful music. I may have
sent more people to Milan’s amazing
<a href="https://milan.cvitkovic.net/writing/things_youre_allowed_to_do/">Things
you’re allowed to do</a> post more than anything else online. I read
everything <a href="https://sive.rs/">Derek Sivers</a> writes at least
once, but often more than once. I love his
<a href="https://sive.rs/ti">Tech Independence</a> post for obvious
reasons.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr9EPARzXS0&amp;t=334s">Jake
Rush</a> made me laugh recently. I like what’s happening at
<a href="https://thehtml.review/">the html review</a>. I just finished
listening to
<a href="https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-sonos-john-macfarlane/">John
MacFarlane’s appearance on the How I Built This podcast</a>, which I
really loved. I was fortunate enough to work at Sonos when John was CEO.
He was a unique and, in many ways, gifted leader. Sari Azout is doing
something quite special with <a href="https://sublime.app/">Sublime</a>,
but it’s still early. Paul Graham has written so many great essays, but
I recently re-read
<a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/words.html">Putting Ideas Into
Words</a> and it feels like an especially appropriate thing to share
here. I helped put together
<a href="https://github.com/riotgoools/viprss">a little thing</a> with
<a href="https://riotgoools.com/">riotgoools</a> to get people
introduced to RSS in <a href="https://warpcast.com/~/channel/vip">the
VIP channel</a> on <a href="https://www.farcaster.xyz/">Farcaster</a>.
Even though <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/">The Red Hand
Files</a> doesn’t have an RSS feed, I’m happy to visit. I’m quite
excited about <a href="https://www.neverpo.st/">Neverpost</a>. The timer
went off, so that’s where I will stop.

<h2 id="why-do-we-even-blog">2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?
</h1>
<p>
The urge to blog lives in a strange place. One speaks to an imagined
audience. It is not enough to imagine an audience, though. It’s more
than writing into a booklet, “Dear Diary, …” – and yet we do it even if
there are no comments. Sure, I never had a lot of comments. But I think
I’m just as happy getting the occasional email or reply on the
fediverse. The thought of somebody reading the words is terrifying. And
once I got that first comment, once I started linking the blog from my
profiles, putting it out there for others to find, inviting people to
read and implicitly, to judge… I started discovered that the blog was
something I feared. The blog is a thrill. It makes me nervous. The heart
beats. The heart bleeds.
</p>
<p>
Back when the blog had comments, I used to be anxious about comments.
First, there’s a comment. Is it good or bad? Do I read it now? Do I risk
a look? But then the imagined audience is still there and now it’s
worse. How will I react as I am being watched? Blogging turns into a
performance where I feel like I’m demonstrating my moral character. I am
not a racist! I am not a white supremacist! I am not a homophobe! Or am
I? All the discourse online has made me self-conscious. I really don’t
want to be what I fear I might be without knowing it. I keep thinking of
the idea that people who aren’t very observant being unable to perceive
their own faults. The requirements go up when I learn more.
</p>
<p>
The effect of all that anxiety, for me, is that I take things seriously.
Words are serious. I try to put my word where my heart is. I try to
weight them carefully. I weigh my heart. Writing is morally intense. It
doesn’t matter how long or how short the page, how trivial or how
controversial the topic.
</p>
<p>
And above all of it hangs the grey sky of unspoken words, of thoughts
unexamined and all that maladjustment, all the failures, all the
judgements. How often have I found myself falling short of my own
measure.
</p>
<p>
To blog is to wrestle with that. I imagine an audience that is strangely
interested in all the things I am interested in. I write for them, for
me, for my future self that looks back, the heart full of regret. I
struggle for virtue and I put it into words for you and me, the imagined
reader and myself. As proof. “I struggled!” I struggle. I keep on
struggling to discover what is right and to do what is right.
</p>
<p>
Blogging is like writing secret confessions. I write about the things
that I think I did well because I did them wrong and then I changed my
mind. I write about the things I know because I did not know them
before. And who cares about those laborious system administration blog
posts where I struggle with this or that ephemeral problem. All these
issues are lost pages. Nobody cares. People find their answers on Stack
Overflow or Reddit or some other centralized platform where middlemen
gamify the experience so that we can help each other while on the
thread-mill for their pockets. And who cares about those blog posts
about growing old or playing games? People read them and move on. Like I
do, when I’m reading online. Even if I am moved, I will move on. And
there are so many posts to read, the folders on my disk with saved
articles and snippets are more like compost heaps, where layer upon
layer of good stuff gets dropped, never to see the light of day again.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it sparked a thought somewhere, and perhaps that spark starts a
fire, somewhere, much later. There is practically no connection and that
is fine. The world moves and humanity is moved like a dreamer, one
thought knows not the next, and we all partake in that eternal digestion
of the sleepless mind. Our books, our journals, our blogs, our posts,
they all participate. Perhaps we fall for those waves of outrage and the
galaxy brain has a seizure as we all throw our weight around in unison,
crushing innocent lives, leaving those we hurt behind, forgetting them
as quickly as we forget about the outrage.
</p>
<p>
Or perhaps blogging is leaving a trail of blazing sparks, each one
sparking a fire in the next generation. Spending time reading blogs and
posts on social media has certainly changed me.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I would have grown older differently without reading blogs and
blogging. And this is why I cannot stop blogging. To blog in that
half-shadow where perhaps our thoughts are read and perhaps they are
not, where every text lights up and shines and drops and sinks onto that
great pile where thousands of text are rotting, that is to participate
in the galaxy brain that is our world. Some of us can vote and some of
us can talk. Some of us can fight and some of us will weep. I try to
blog.
</p>
<p>
I try to blog to prove to myself that it was a struggle, that I tried to
think long and hard about things and that I tried to do the right thing.
I keep failing and so I must keep blogging.

<h2 id="a-peculiarity-of-the-x-window-system-windows-all-the-way-down">A
peculiarity of the X Window System: windows all the way down</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Every window system has windows, as an entity. Usually we think of
these as being used for, well, windows and window like things;
application windows, those extremely annoying pop-up modal dialogs that
are always interrupting you at the wrong time, even perhaps things like
pop-up menus. In its original state, X has more windows than that. Part
of how and why it does this is that X allows windows to nest inside each
other, in a window tree, which you can still see today with ‘xwininfo
-root -tree‘. One of the reasons that X has copious nested windows is
that X was designed with a particular model of writing X programs in
mind, and that model made everything into a (nested) window. Seriously,
everything. In an old fashioned X application, windows are everywhere.
Buttons are windows (or several windows if they’re radio buttons or the
like), text areas are windows, menu entries are each a window of their
own within the window that is the menu, visible containers of things are
windows (with more windows nested inside them), and so on. ↫ Chris
Siebenmann This is wild.</p>

<p>Fedora Workstation has long defaulted to using GNOME’s Wayland
session by default, but it has continued to install the GNOME X.Org
session for fallback purposes or those opting to use it instead. But for
the Fedora Workstation 41 release later in the year, there is a
newly-approved plan to no longer have that GNOME X.Org session installed
by default. ↫ Michael Larabel Expect more and more of the major
distributions to abandon X.org completely. For the KDE version of
Fedora, X.org will be dropped entirely in Fedora 40 already, so one

<p>If blogging does come back now, it’ll have features it didn’t have
last time we were really working on it. The reason is cheap servers, we
know how to use them, and the software is already written. You’ll get a

potential security risks. What if I told you that to synchronize files

<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: Howard Jacobson blog</p>
<p>He saw her first - no he didn’t: he beheld her first - in the library
of St Ursula’s College, a grammar school in North Manchester which had
agreed to let him research its holdings of once venerated textbooks. Her
head appeared above the stacks like that of a browsing giraffe. She even
swivelled her jaw as though chewing on an acacia leaf. That was a tic he
would come to hate – as for example when it accompanied a confession
that she loved another man, or another woman, or both - but at first it
beguiled him. It suggested the absent-mindedness of a person who was
always somewhere else. She caught his gaze and smiled at him.</p>

consult experts before forming his opinion? Also does he feel it’s fair
for a prosecutor to use his public platform to smear the reputation of
an innocent person? And finally if there is no respect for the president
as a person, what about the office, and the country the president

<h2 id="guestbooks-are-cool">Guestbooks are cool</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in a previous post, this site now has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook&quot;&gt;guestbook&lt;/a&gt;. But, as someone pointed out, I didn’t explain what the heck a guestbook is. I thought it was pretty self-explanatory but I think it’s worth writing a post about it anyway. On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/guestbook&quot;&gt;IndieWeb website&lt;/a&gt;, guestbooks are defined as:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
a way to allow visitors to your site to leave a comment about the
website as a whole, instead of a comment about a specific post.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think it’s a good definition. Guestbooks are a relic of a different
time, back when the web wasn’t dominated by social media and
interactions among people moved at a different pace. A guestbook is like
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_register">summit
book</a>, in a way. It’s something you can use to leave a trace of your
presence.
</p>
<p>
But what do you write on the guestbook? Whatever you want. You can let
me know how you landed here, you can use it to suggest a topic, or you
can use it to just say hi. Just be kind and respectful.
</p>
<p>
I first toyed with the idea of adding a guestbook almost a year ago,
after stumbling on <a href="https://sarajoy.dev/guestbook/">Sara Joy’s
website</a>. I don’t remember how or why I was there but I loved the
guestbook and it took me almost a year to finally code mine.
</p>
<p>
And I’m happy to see that
<a href="https://kevquirk.com/i-have-a-guestbook">Kev</a> now has one on
his site as well! If you decide to add a guestbook to your site send me
an email, and I’ll be happy to come sign it.

<h2 id="how-to-have-sex-2023">How to Have Sex (2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
Last August, Vivian took me to see the film <cite>How to Have
Sex</cite>, which was screening at the Astor as part of the
<abbr title="Melbourne International Film Festival">MIFF</abbr>. What
Viv did <em>not</em> warn me of adequately before we saw the film was
that it’s about an eighteen-year-old girl who gets much too drunk and
loses her virginity in a sexual encounter that was fundamentally not
consensual but also difficult to describe as “rape”, and as someone who
basically <em>was</em> that eighteen-year-old girl a long time ago I’d
<em>really</em> have appreciated more of a heads-up about that. Watching
the film dredged up a <em>lot</em> of long-buried bitterness in me, and
truth be told, all these months later I still haven’t successfully
buried it again. I have been told, of course, that “burying trauma isn’t
the same as dealing with trauma,” which honestly I would like to call
bullshit on because when my trauma was buried, I felt fine, and now it’s
been resurrected, I don’t, and on the surface that seems to me like a
regression.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
To be fair, I don’t think Viv looked that deeply into the movie; I think
he saw “eighteen-year-olds having sex on holiday” and went, “Sounds
amazing, sign me up.” Anyway, what’s done is done. Apparently, the
film’s just entered general release here

so I thought I’d dust off this long-stalled draft and try to polish it
up.
</p>
<p>
The filmmaker herself, Molly Manning Walker, was actually in attendance
on that night in August, and there was a Q&amp;A with her after the
screening. That was really good in and of itself, and I’m glad we stayed
for it. She described her film as (along these lines) “a very personal
story, and one that a lot of people relate to,” and made the excellent
point that our conversations about consent need to be more nuanced,
which I agree with wholeheartedly. She said that “the law, which doesn’t
protect us anyway” has its own legal standard for what sexual assault
is, but it’s such a high bar to clear, and it doesn’t mean that
everything that falls short of that bar is A-OK and acceptable. So, she
said, “since the law doesn’t protect us anyway,” we should move to using
our own definitions and having our own conversations about consent,
which should be human-focused and centre “people just having a good
time”. People shouldn’t just think to themselves, “Is this <em>literally
rape?</em>” but, “How can I make sure this other person has a good
experience?” This is a much more important question.
</p>
<p>
Another thing she talked about is the need to reach out to people (and
<abbr title="Let's Be Real">LBR</abbr>, mostly men) who are currently
engaging in these kinds of coercive, pushy, or not-entirely-consensual
sexual practices, and how you’ll never actually reach them – you’ll
repel them and they won’t listen – if you brand them “rapists” or “evil
scum” or whatever. (Even though, I’ll admit, I’ve succumbed to this
temptation myself.) She talked about a meeting she went to with French
film distributors who were considering screening this film, and said
that one of the men had watched the film and come to the realisation
that: “I am Paddy.” (Paddy being the pushy, manipulative dickhead in the
film. And yes, OF COURSE it would be a Frenchman in her anecdote, of
course.) She said that while on one level it’s obviously shit that he
has been a Paddy, it’s good that he’s been able to come to that
realisation and one can only hope that he won’t be a Paddy in the
future. My experience with my own “Paddy” leads me to believe it’s not
<em>nearly</em> as simple as that, but generally speaking I think it’s
true: there needs to be a “way back” for people who have been
insensitive or, you know, coercive, or sexually cruel, or whatever you
could say. There’s a huge stigma around “being a rapist”, for good
reason obviously and it’s clearly better than society being OK with
rapists, but it’s just so profoundly unhelpful to have this binary where
behaviour is either “rape” <em>or</em> it’s completely fine, or where
men are either “rapists” – forever – <em>or</em> totally innocent. There
has to be a way to say, “What you did was unacceptable, but you can
learn from it; it doesn’t have to define you forever.” Assuming he
actually wants to learn, of course, but convincing such men to want to
learn was one of Manning Walker’s goals with the film.
</p>
<p>
In the critical scene of <cite>How to Have Sex</cite>, the protagonist –
Tara – gets separated from her friends during a night’s partying and
winds up alone on a beach with Paddy, who gets increasingly physical and
pushy before pressuring her to have sex with him. Very drunk, and
vulnerable, she agrees, but her body language makes it clear it’s really
not what she wants. As the ABC article quotes her saying, Manning Walker
finds it interesting the split reactions she gets about what actually
happened in that scene:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Lots of women would come into the room and say ’thank you for making
this film, I’ve been through that, I feel seen’, and a lot of men would
come in quite defensive and say, ‘It’s not an assault because she said
yes’.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I may not have got to tell her so personally, but I absolutely would’ve
been among those women. Because that really is the critical point… in
the moment, she said yes! So did I, to my everlasting shame. I said
more, even, but not because I wanted to. Because I felt trapped, and
scared, and I was always way too much of a people-pleaser. I was so
afraid I’d upset him, because I <em>did</em> really like him, and I
didn’t want to screw my chances for the future when the situation might
actually have felt right. My skin was crawling the entire time, my mind
buzzing with a million and one reasons why I was a fucking idiot to have
even landed myself there. I could never fully, or even mostly, blame
myself – after all, he was the one who stripped me of my clothes without
so much as a word when I was frozen up in panic, and there was a
<em>huge</em> imbalance in power and experience between us that did not
favour me. But of course I blamed myself, in part.
</p>
<p>
So was that rape, or was it not? Believe me, I endured a truly
exhausting number of arguments both ways, to the point that I really
want never to have to try to address that question again. The Q&amp;A
with the filmmaker was really excellent because it gave me the
liberating answer: <em>it doesn’t fucking matter</em>. It doesn’t matter
whether it was <em>technically</em> rape, or whether I
<em>technically</em> consented, or at what exact point of drunkenness
one is <em>technically</em> too drunk to consent, or whether there’s
some kind of sliding scale whereby you can be partially, but not fully,
responsible for “consenting” against your better judgement. Literally
none of the bullshit I had to fight about, over and over again, matters
at all. The only thing that matters is “people having a good time”. And
by that metric, he utterly failed.
</p>
<p>
The problem is, I don’t think we have good language for it, this kind of
callous sexual behaviour that, perhaps, falls short of being rape. The
protagonist of the film is never really able to find the words for what
happens to her; at most, I remember her saying weakly, “It doesn’t
really count though.” I remember trying to use that same line myself,
once, with someone who was trying to “YEAHHH YOU GETTEM GIRL” me just
like Tara’s shitty friend was at that point in the film. But in my case,
I also had other people – <strong>so many
people</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
– arguing with me very sternly that if I was drunk I couldn’t consent
and it was <em>rape</em>, and scolding me if I ever failed to call it
<em>rape</em>, so I did used to call it that, but it always felt
uncomfortably <em>off</em>. I ended up clinging to it anyway, because
what else was I going to call it? It was either that or nothing, and I
was <em>really</em> sure that what happened wasn’t nothing. My “Paddy”
actually became a close friend – not a <em>good</em> friend, but a close
one – but the events of that night were always a sticking point between
us. Interestingly, given the topic, he did actually accept the label
“rapist”, but he also treated it as a bit of joke. I guess he was
defensive; I don’t think he ever truly accepted he’d done anything I
hadn’t wanted that night. I was defensive, too, because I knew that he
had. For all that the word “rape” sat uneasily with me, I used it
because consensual sex isn’t what it felt like either. I clung to it
because it felt like anything else would’ve been letting him off the
hook. If there had been a better word, one that correctly assigned the
blame to him for <em>hurting</em> me without trying to imply consent is
always a black and white yes–no binary, then sure, I’d have preferred to
use that. But that word doesn’t exist. Probably it should.
</p>
<p>
What I really wanted was for him to change. As his friend, I saw all his
good qualities too. I was sure he was capable of doing better, being
better, than he had been with me (…and a bunch of other girls about the
same age, in different ways, but that’s by-the-by). He was a
<em>feminist</em>, he claimed; <em>surely</em> he could come to
understand the complicated interplay between power dynamics and sex! And
so… I really appreciated Manning Walker’s insistence on the same thing,
that men can and must learn to be better, rather than “rapist” becoming
a lifelong label that someone can never, ever grow free from. It’s
something I’ve so rarely heard articulated but it strikes me as
obviously true. I haven’t spoken to my ex-friend in more than a decade
now but I really hope he did, eventually, learn.
</p>
<p>
One last thing I’ll say about this film is that it also depicts that
really obnoxious kind of “British people getting shitfaced at resorts in
southern Europe” subculture, which is definitely not my thing. In fact,
before I realised what the movie was really about, I’d thought I was
going to have to tease Viv for taking me to a movie about the three most
annoying English girls in film history. Basically they arrive in Greece
with two goals: to get wasted and to get laid… and with the life
experience I’ve had, I find it truly gobsmacking that <em>anyone</em>
would still think these are two things that can be combined.
</p>
<p>
I couldn’t quite figure out the position the film took on this. You
might think, given the subject matter, that it came down firmly against
it, but I didn’t feel it did. I felt it kind of implied that it
<em>is</em> possible to have sex (in a healthy, non-abusive way) when
you’re shitfaced, it’s just Paddy didn’t do that, and… that’s not a
message I’m comfortable with. Of course, given my experiences, I gave a
lot of thought back in the day to what it is that <em>makes</em> drunk
sex (potentially) abusive, and the thing I kept coming back to is power.
Two adults who respect each other as equals, and feel comfortable around
each other… it’s unlikely to be abusive in that case. But when you have
a power imbalance – like when one of the parties is a young, frightened,
virgin – it becomes very problematic, very quickly. So… I was very
uncomfortable with the atmosphere of the resort in the film, which is
full of <em>very</em> young adults who seem to have the expectation that
they <em>can</em> get fucked up and <em>also</em> have sex with almost
total strangers… like, of course this is going to end badly, what the
hell! I just think there needs to be a complete division in people’s
minds, where “partying/clubbing” and “hooking up” are completely
unrelated activities. Honestly, there’s basically a zero percent chance
that a drunken hookup with a guy you barely know is going to feel any
good, anyway. I’ll admit it’s easy for me to say now, as an adult very
far removed from that eighteen-year-old girl embarrassed about her
ongoing virginity and insecure about whether anyone would ever find her
attractive (as Tara, in the film, also is, despite her brash exterior).
Even so… caving in to the advances of a pushy drunk guy who doesn’t
really care about you at all is not the way. Which is not to try to
victim-blame… the pushy guys are still, ultimately, the ones with the
responsibility. I just don’t think girls, either, should have this
expectation of getting laid on a holiday where they plan to be drunk
24/7. It’s not worth the risk, man! Save the hookups for when you’re
sober.

<p>Just before the end of 1989, Microsoft made available the first
pre-release version of the long promised 32-bit OS/2 2.0, which was
intended to be the first mass-market 32-bit PC operating system. This
was accompanied by a press release detailing the $2,600 OS/2 2.0
Software Development Kit (SDK). Unfortunately, the December 1989
pre-release of OS/2 2.0 may not have survived to the present day. But in
June 1990, Microsoft shipped the second pre-release of the OS/2 2.0 SDK.
And that version has now turned up, after twenty years of searching, and
nearly a quarter century after its release! ↫ Michal Necasek at OS/2
Museum OS/2 is one of the biggest what-ifs in tech, and the whole origin

<h2 id="googles-changes-to-comply-with-the-dma">Google’s changes to
comply with the DMA</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) comes into force this
week for companies who have been designated. Today, we are sharing some
more details about the changes we are making to comply, following
product testing we announced earlier this year. ↫ Oliver Bethell on the
official Google blog This is Google’s overview of the changes it’s
implementing to comply with the DMA, some of which the company already
announced months ago. Google’s changes don’t have as much of a direct,
noticeable impact as some other company’s changes, mostly since a lot of
the more impactful consequences of the DMA, such as allowing sideloading
and alternative application stores, were already allowed on Android.
Other changes, like to Search, will take longer to be noticed. The one
thing that stands out is the tone – compared to Apple’s communication
around the DMA. Whereas Apple sounds like a petulant whiny toddler,
Google sounds constructive, to the point, and, well, like an adult. That
doesn’t mean Google’s post isn’t also full of shit in places, but at
least they’re being grown-ups about it.</p>

a static IP address with nmtui on Raspberry Pi OS 12 ‘Bookworm’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Set

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old advice for setting a Raspberry Pi IP address to a static IP on the Pi itself said to edit the &lt;code&gt;/etc/dhcpcd.conf&lt;/code&gt; file, and add it there.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
But on Raspberry Pi OS 12 and later, <code>dhcpcd</code> is no longer
used, everything goes through Network Manager, which is configured via
<code>nmcli</code> or <code>nmtui</code>. If you’re booting into the Pi
OS desktop environment,
<a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=2161661&amp;sid=a628ee29ebccfe2e0295fceee8156a08#p2161661">editing
the IP settings there is pretty easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
But setting a static IP via the command line is a little different.
</p>
<p>
First, get the interface information—you can get a list of all
interfaces with <code>nmcli device status</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>$ nmcli device status
DEVICE         TYPE      STATE                   CONNECTION         
eth0           ethernet  connected               Wired connection 1 
lo             loopback  connected (externally)  lo                 
wlan0          wifi      disconnected            --                 
</code></pre>
<p>
In my case, I want to set an IP on <code>eth0</code>, the built-in
Ethernet.

<h2 id="adding-systemd-to-postmarketos">Adding systemd to
postmarketOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>You heard it here first folks: systemd is coming to postmarketOS! As
a mobile oriented OS, our main goal has always been to work for
everyone. From technical folks to casual users. postmarketOS should have
all the benefits you expect from a Linux based distribution, such as
being free software, respecting your privacy, getting updates until your
device physically breaks, respecting your attention and not shoving
advertisements in your face. Your phone should be a tool you use, not
the other way around. This is of course not an easy task, one of the
main blockers we found as we collaborate more closely with KDE and GNOME
developers is that they have a hard time with our OpenRC-based stack. In
order to get KDE and GNOME working at all, we use a lot of systemd
polyfills on top of OpenRC. So while we are technically “not using
systemd”, in practice we already do use a large chunk of its components
to get KDE and GNOME running, just different versions of those
components. While we are very grateful for everybody who works on these
polyfills, we must point out that most aren’t a full replacement, and
take additional effort to support and maintain. As much as we might want
to romanticise the idea of spending 6, 12, 24 months attempting to come
up with an even vaguely competitive alternative to systemd, we would
quite simply rather be working on making postmarketOS better. ↫
postmarketOS blog This is the sensible choice to make, and I’m glad they
made it. It makes no sense for a relatively small project that already
has to deal with the difficulties of supporting smartphones to also have
to deal with shoehorning the smartphone variants of GNOME and KDE into
an init system they’re not at all made for.</p>

<h1>
2024-03-06 Oddµ beta program for Campaign Wiki
</h1>
<p>
Campaign Wiki offers a basic wiki for people wanting to keep campaign
records for their role-playing games. I’ve been developing a new
software that’s now
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/index">available for beta
testing</a>. That is to say: I think it’s ready. I’ve been using it for
this site for a while, now.
</p>
<p>
What hasn’t been tested is 1. its usability (how well can it be used by
people that are mainly interested in their games and not their software)
and 2. it’s permission setup (the new site no longer allows editing by
strangers: you need an account to edit the site).
</p>
<p>
Well, as soon as the first person signed up, problems started showing up
in both areas! 😅
</p>
<p>
So I’ve been busy fixing bugs and writing documentation.

useful content and connecting people with high-quality websites. Today
we’re announcing key changes we’re making to improve the quality of
Search and the helpfulness of your results. ↫ Elizabeth Tucker on the

How did cells evolve a process to end their own lives? Recent research
suggests that apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, first arose
billions of years ago in bacteria with a primitive sociality.

<h2 id="windows-to-add-gobs-of-ai-to-explorer">Windows to add gobs of
“AI” to Explorer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>According to my sources, AI Explorer is the blockbuster AI experience
that will separate AI PCs from non-AI PCs. It’s described as an
“advanced Copilot” with a built-in history/timeline feature that turns
everything you do on your computer into a searchable moment using
natural language. It works across any app and allows users to search for
previously opened conversations, documents, web pages, and images. For
example, you could type, “Find me that list of restaurants Jenna said
she liked,” and Windows can bring up the exact conversation you were
having when Jenna mentioned those restaurants. Even vague prompts should
work, like “Find me that thing about dinosaurs,” Windows will pull up
every word, phrase, image, and related topic about dinosaurs that you’ve
previously opened on your computer. The AI Explorer app can also
understand context, help jumpstart projects or workflows, and even
suggest tasks based on what’s currently on screen. For example, suppose
you’re looking at an image in an app. In that case, the AI Explorer will
automatically show an “edit image” button that lets you type out your
criteria, such as “remove this image’s background using the Photos app.”

id="doaj-and-crossref-renew-their-partnership-to-support-the-least-resourced-journals">DOAJ
and Crossref renew their partnership to support the least-resourced
journals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-06, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Crossref and DOAJ share the aim to encourage the dissemination and use
of scholarly research using online technologies and to work with and
through regional and international networks, partners, and user
communities for the achievement of their aims to build local
institutional capacity and sustainability. Both organisations agreed to
work together in 2021 in a variety of ways, but primarily to ‘encourage
the dissemination and use of scholarly research using online
technologies, and regional and international networks, partners and
communities, helping to build local institutional capacity and
sustainability around the world.’ Some of the fruits of this labour are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
DOAJ added support for Crossref XML to make it easier for publishers to
upload metadata
</li>
<li>
Closer collaboration between customer/member support at both
organisations, making it easier for publishers and journal editors to
navigate both service’s technologies
</li>
<li>
the launch of PLACE: ‘a ‘one-stop shop’ for information to support
publishers in adopting best practices the industry developed’ (together
with other partners)
</li>
<li>
a pilot gap analysis of the journals in DOAJ with the possibility of
helping them start to use and resolve DOIs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The new agreement, signed earlier this month, will slightly shift focus
to build upon existing collaborations, particularly around metadata. One
of the primary sections of the MOU is enhancing support for the
least-resourced journals by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Assigning DOIs and depositing the metadata with Crossref *Finding ways
to improve their DOAJ application experience to help them become indexed
</li>
<li>
Collect and ingest their Crossref metadata into DOAJ
</li>
<li>
Help them to get preserved via JASPER or similar initiatives
</li>
<li>
Help identify other local partners, such as Crossref Sponsoring
Organisations, to support their use of Crossref services
</li>
</ul>
<div class="quotecite">
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s great that we can further underpin what is already a good working
relationship. Both Crossref and DOAJ are central to discovery so it’s a
natural partnership. Helping journals meet better standards and become
indexed to make them more discoverable on a global scale is at the heart
of our strategy. This agreement opens up a new avenue that allows the
community to really focus on supporting those journals and the research
they publish.’

<blockquote>
<p>
‘The collaborations with DOAJ so far only reconfirmed our shared goal to
help make the global scholarly communications system more equitable
wherever we can. Our joint projects aim to seek out and devise support
for resource-constrained journals in multiple ways. DOAJ’s work is
essential in helping journals to develop good practice, while Crossref
offers an open infrastructure to ensure all journals can be included and
discoverable in the global scholarly record.’

<a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">like I love the

hope for a

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_New_York_Mets_season">1986</a>

returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were
that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up
in Queens in the 1960s. We <i>all</i> have to work together to dig out
of the hole we’re in. And that means reporters have to start looking at
themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the
job that we need journalism to do, that it isn’t doing.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-learn-to-art">How we learn to art</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
People learn to make art by studying previous artists. Would we want it
any other way?
</p>
<p>
Imagine if everyone had to reinvent everything that anyone had ever
invented just to make something new.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of that in software, people won’t put in an API so you
have to rebuild the whole house just to get a window.
</p>
<p>
We can make progress when people don’t try to lock up their ideas.
</p>
<p>
Individuals live just a short time, we can’t do that much in a lifetime,
but we are an amazing species, because we leave behind what we learn and
we build.

<p>

We learn by studying ourselves.
</div>
</p>
<p>
So why shouldn’t our machines be able to learn too? They already can do
things vastly more complex than we can. We’ve invented a huge lever.
</p>
<p>
Science fiction tells us that we will lose control and be enslaved by
our machines. I love those stories, like the Matrix and Battlestar
Galactica. But those are stories, they didn’t happen. The future is
rarely so predictable. Things interact in unforseeable ways.
</p>
<p>
We’re at dead-ends in climate and government. We need to make radical
changes, and a fresh invention as radically progressive as any that has
come before is now in our hands.

<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, that was a short run. Announced with much fanfare in 2021,
Microsoft has announced it’s already killing Windows Subsystem for
Android, Microsoft’s solution to run Android applications on Windows 11.
Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for Android™️
(WSA). As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all applications
and games dependent on WSA will no longer be supported beginning March
5, 2025. Until then, technical support will remain available to
customers. Customers that have installed the Amazon Appstore or Android
apps prior to March 5, 2024, will continue to have access to those apps
through the deprecation date of March 5, 2025. Please reach out to our
support team for further questions at support.microsoft.com. We are
grateful for the support of our developer community and remain committed
to listening to feedback as we evolve experiences. ↫ Microsoft’s Learn
website Whenever Microsoft offers a way or an API to run and/or develop
applications for Windows, and it isn’t Win32, you can be certain they’re
going to kill it within a few years.</p>

News)</p>
<p>BTW, in case you’re wondering where “still diggin!” came from –
here’s the deal. I have a feeling that when I develop software it’s a
lot like digging a hole and then starting another, and another and using
the dirt from a new hole to fill in the old holes. At any time there’s
more or less a constant amount of dirt and holes. It seems futile at
first look, and second looks and third looks, but we do eventually get
somewhere, or so we hope, maybe. It’s like “even worse than it appears.”
Still diggin is meant to say we know it’s really futile, you don’t have
to point that out, we never actually go anywhere or do anything, but we
feel somehow that next time it really will work. It’s a Vonnegut-like or
Deadhead-like philosophy, which is also very Postel-like. In other
words, realistic.</p>

<h2 id="running-cpm-on-the-c128">Running CP/M on the C128</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>I owned a C64 and was familiar with the C128, but this one was odd.
It wasn’t running any games, color graphics or playing music. Instead,
it was connected to a monochrome monitor which always displayed either a
weird command line prompt or what seemed to be some boring professional
writing software. I soon came to find that it was running CP/M and
WordStar, one of the first word processors for microcomputers. My daily
obsessive visits to the computer shop led to some friendship with the
owner, to the point that he’d let me in and play with the machines. So,
I played with CP/M and learned how to use WordStar. Well, in case you
didn’t notice, I own a C128DCR now. This blog is about how I got CP/M,
WordStar, and other fun ancient software apps running on it. ↫ Celso
Martinho CP/M, of course, was the primary influence of DOS.</p>

reality, whether it’s about Apple or the EU, is a core requirement for
good management</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Baldur Bjarnason has written an excellent piece to explain why,
exactly, companies like Apple seem wholly incapable of working with the
EU, instead of against it. He argues – quite effectively – that Apple,
and US tech punditry in general, simply do not understand the EU, nor
are they willing to spend even 10 minutes to understand it, which is
really all you need. The core premise of the EU, its very primary
function, is to enable and protect the single market. A great example of
this is the ban on roaming charges – mobile phone carriers in EU are not
allowed to charge extra for using mobile voice and data services in
another EU country. From the EU’s perspective, taking action to prevent
private parties from fragmenting and taking private control over the
single market simultaneously grew the economy and increased consumer
surplus. This is the operating theory behind much of the actions the EU
takes regarding market regulation and product standardisation: a single
market built on standards is more profitable for both businesses and
consumers. ↫ Baldur Bjarnason And because Apple and its tech punditry
refuse to try and understand the party they are dealing with, they get
caught looking like childish idiots every time they open their mouths
about it. Normally when the EU regulates a given sector, it does so with
ample lead time and works with industry to make sure that they
understand their obligations. Apple instead thought that the regulatory
contact from the EU during the lead time to the DMA was an opportunity
for it to lecture the EU on its right to exist. Then its executives made
up some fiction in their own minds as to what the regulation meant,
announced their changes, only to discover later that they were full of
bullshit. This was entirely Apple’s own fault. For months, we’ve been
hearing leaks about Apple’s talks with the EU about the Digital Market
Act. Those talks were not negotiations even though Apple seems to have
thought they were. Talks like those are to help companies implement
incoming regulations, with some leeway for interpretation on the EU’s
side to accommodate business interests. Remember what I wrote about
electrical plugs? The EU is pro-business – often criticised for being
essentially a pro-business entity – and not in favour of regulation for
regulation’s sake. If Apple had faced reality and tried to understand
the facts as they are, they would have used the talks to clarify all of
these issues and more well in advance of the DMA taking effect. But they
didn’t because they have caught the tech industry management disease of
demanding that reality bend to their ideas and wishes. ↫ Baldur
Bjarnason What a lot of people – both inside and outside the EU – do not
grasp is that while we all know the EU has shortcomings and issues, in
general, the EU is uncharacteristically (for a government agency)
popular among EU citizens, no matter the country of origin. That’s
because we, as EU citizens, and especially as EU citizens who do
anything international, know just how ridiculously beneficial the EU has
been for trade, business, the economy, travel, and so much more. Apple
can keep acting like a whiny trust fund boy who thinks the world owes
them everything, but they’ll have to deal with the consequences.
Continued violation of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of
revenue. That’s 38 billion dollars. I secretly hope Apple keeps this
childish behaviour up. It’s deeply entertaining.</p>

crash tester says carmakers must bring back physical controls</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The European organisation for crash testing and car safety, Euro NCAP
has announced that starting in 2026, cars will need physical controls in
their interiors to gain the highest safety ratings. “The overuse of
touchscreens is an industry-wide problem, with almost every
vehicle-maker moving key controls onto central touchscreens, obliging
drivers to take their eyes off the road and raising the risk of
distraction crashes,” said Matthew Avery, Euro NCAP’s director of
strategic development. “New Euro NCAP tests due in 2026 will encourage
manufacturers to use separate, physical controls for basic functions in
an intuitive manner, limiting eyes-off-road time and therefore promoting
safer driving,” he said. ↫ Jonathan M. Gitlin at Ars Technica Excellent
news, and it’s taken regulators and safety organisations way too long to
long to adapt to the growing menace of touch screens in cars.</p>

<h2 id="its-time-to-give-up-on-everything-but-email">It’s Time to Give
Up on Everything but Email</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-05, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I was sitting there, minding my own damn business, surfing the web, clicking around, enjoying my time, when I stumbled on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/email-nightmare-just-give-up/677615/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, by Ian Bogost on The Atlantic, that is so painfully stupid that I had to take the time and comment on it. Because, as you know, I love emails.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
Finally, in step five, you must evangelize your mission. Email is a
public-health concern. Gently correct your mother when she tries to
correspond. Reprimand your email-happy colleagues. Punish email abuse by
withholding your replies. Or, more gently, darken someone’s doorway. In
short, you must show the sort of leadership that will encourage others
to forsake their email too. We’ll never stop the rain of email, no
matter what we do. But if we work together, maybe we can build a kind of
shelter.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The entire premise of this article is that email is an unmanageable mess
filled with all sorts of garbage and dealing with it is a lost cause.
There’s an analogy in there that is so idiotic that is worth quoting:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Alas, there is no opting out from email. As a practical matter, your
inbox cannot be abandoned altogether. The same is true for postal mail:
To function within the normal bounds of contemporary society, you must
be addressable in physical space. You must be able to receive Amex bills
and Amazon baubles, and also, you must subject yourself to lots of junk.
This analogy between your home’s mailbox and your computer’s inbox is so
easily made that it’s often overlooked. Both are stuffed with garbage by
default, but also just a few essential messages.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ian, let me give you some shocking advice: unlike your physical address,
it’s not hard to get an extra email address. Hell, you can get even more
than one. You can go one step further and get a disposable one!
Shocking, I know!
</p>
<p>
In all seriousness, if in 2024 you’re using one single email address for
everything that’s a you problem, not an email problem. Also, Ian, let me
ask you a question: what’s the alternative here? Do we all move to
Slack/Discord/Teams? Do we all move everything to DMs? Do you think
that’s a better solution?
</p>
<p>
There’s a reason why emails are still here. They’re still here because
they work. Is email perfect? No. Is there a better alternative? Also no.

for embedded systems: current state, challenges and open problems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Embedded software is used in safety-critical systems such as medical
devices and autonomous vehicles, where software defects, including
security vulnerabilities, have severe consequences. Most embedded
codebases are developed in unsafe languages, specifically C/C++, and are
riddled with memory safety vulnerabilities. To prevent such
vulnerabilities, RUST, a performant memory-safe systems language,
provides an optimal choice for developing embedded software. RUST
interoperability enables developing RUST applications on top of existing
C codebases. Despite this, even the most resourceful organizations
continue to develop embedded software in C/C++. This paper performs the
first systematic study to holistically understand the current state and
challenges of using RUST for embedded systems. Our study is organized
across three research questions. We collected a dataset of 2,836 RUST
embedded software spanning various categories and 5 Static Application
Security Testing ( SAST) tools. We performed a systematic analysis of
our dataset and surveys with 225 developers to investigate our research
questions. We found that existing RUST software support is inadequate,
SAST tools cannot handle certain features of RUST embedded software,
resulting in failures, and the prevalence of advanced types in existing
RUST software makes it challenging to engineer interoperable code. In
addition, we found various challenges faced by developers in using RUST
for embedded systems development. ↫ Ayushi Sharma, Shashank Sharma,

Apple district manager’s Macintosh Portable in 1989-91 (featuring GEIS
AppleLink and a look at System 7.0 alpha)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few months ago I introduced you to one of the more notable Apple
pre-production units in my collection, a late prototype Macintosh
Portable. But it turns out it’s not merely notable for what it is than
what it has on it: a beta version of System 6.0.6 (the doomed release
that Apple pulled due to bugs), Apple sales databases, two online
services — the maligned Mac Prodigy client, along with classic AppleLink
as used by Apple staff — and two presentations, one on Apple’s current
Macintosh line and one on the upcoming System 7. Now that I’ve got the
infamous Conner hard drive it came with safely copied over, it’s time to
explore its contents some more. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research I
wonder just how rare it is to find old internal presentations from a
company like Apple. It seems like something that doesn’t happen very
often, so it’s great to see this archived and documented.</p>

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-accessibility-in-the-small-web">IndieWeb
Carnival: Accessibility in the Small Web</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;This is my entry for &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/&quot;&gt;this month’s IndieWeb Carnival&lt;/a&gt; hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.basementcommunity.com&quot;&gt;Orchids&lt;/a&gt; on the topic of Accessibility in the Small Web&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<hr />
<p>
I started making websites back in 2010. That’s 14 years. I entered the
web dev world back when the frontend scene was starting to become
exciting thanks to CSS3 and HTML5. Shadows, rounded corners, custom
typefaces! Everything was exciting. Also, new tags! I remember spending
time reading about <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and all the
new things at my disposal. But I never thought about spending time
learning about what all this meant in terms of accessibility.
</p>
<p>
I worked solo my entire career. I still do. I have to wear a thousand
different hats on a daily basis and keeping up with the web as a whole
is a full-time job. And it’s only recently that I started to realize how
much I neglected accessibility when it comes to my sites.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get me wrong, I still try to follow at least some best practices:
I try to pick combinations of colors that have enough contrast, and I
try to structure my documents in a way that makes sense for screen
readers but I’m painfully aware how much my knowledge on the topic is
lacking.
</p>
<p>
These days I find myself hating on the “modern web”. I can’t stand sites
that don’t load if I block some JS. I can’t stand sits that highjack my
scroll. I hate that everything is getting more and more performative and
less functional.
</p>
<p>
And in my retreat towards a simpler and more streamlined web, I’m
rediscovering the pleasure of making sites that are simple and more
accessible.
</p>
<p>
Accessibility becomes easier when sites are simpler. Still, I think I
can and should do better which is why I have my eyes set on
<a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com">Sara Soueidan</a>’s
<a href="https://practical-accessibility.today">Practical
Accessibility</a> course (only waiting to have 400$ to invest).
</p>
<p>
It’s a shame that so much of the web has become an unusable mess. At the
same time though, it’s refreshing to see that a good chunk of the small
web seems to be heading in the right direction: simpler websites, less
complicated and more focused layouts.

<h2 id="ear-cuffs">Ear Cuffs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
For a while now, I’ve been enamoured with a certain style of ear
jewellery demonstrated here by Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor:
</p>

  alt=&quot;Crop of a BBC publicity image, showing Jodie Whittaker in 3/4 profile view. The focus of the shot is her earring: there&amp;#39;s an earlobe stud of two hands shaking, and a little silver chain running from that to an ear cuff in the shape of a bunch of stars at the top of her ear.&quot;

<p>
Basically, jewellery that spans the whole height of the ear! I love it.
I never looked into it too seriously for myself, because I presumed
jewellery like this required multiple piercings, and currently I have
<em>zero</em> piercings (not out of any opposition to them, I’ve just
never gone out of my way to do the research that’d be required to get
any). However, yesterday I decided to finally look it up.
</p>
<p>
I discovered that this whole-ear-spanning jewellery is a variety of
<b>ear cuff</b>, and that actually, ear cuffs don’t necessarily require
any piercings at all! (Although Jodie Whittaker’s specific ear cuff
<em>does</em> require a piercing through the earlobe.) The idea is that
they sit tight around the ear, being shaped to closely hug the contours.
They could hardly be more perfect for me!
</p>
<p>

<p>
(Note: this post is not an ad; having not even ordered anything yet, I
can’t even really vouch for this seller at all. This is just a post of
enthusiasm for ear jewellery.) Basically, I think this style would suit
me well because, as you can see from my photo on
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/">this site’s front page</a>, I tend
to tuck the hair on the left side of my head behind my ear at all times
(somewhat like Jodie Whittaker does as the Doctor, in fact). I’ve always
been a bit self-conscious about this habit because the ear is a bit
flattened compared to a “normal ear”, and when I was a little kid my mum
used to chastise me for “exposing” it to people, as if my very ear were
obscene or something. I was <em>certainly</em> never allowed to get my
ears pierced, because that would only “draw attention to [my]
deformity”. I mean, I thought she was full of shit even at the time, but
after getting scolded so much I can’t help but be hyperaware of it,
either. As an adult, of course, I feel she had completely the wrong end
of it. For a start, you shouldn’t feel ashamed of your natural body in
the first place. But secondly, if you really want to do something, the
way to go is <strong>attention-grabbing accessories</strong>, so what
sticks in people’s mind is how <em>cool</em> your sense of style is. No
one’s going to give a fuck about a mildly flattened ear when there’s an
awesome ear cuff wrapped around it. Nobody.
</p>
<p>
Given the tightness of our budget lately, it’s hard not to feel a little
guilty about spending on something inessential like jewellery… but
Vivian doesn’t share the same reservations about spending, and it’s
unfair if I’m the <em>only</em> one making sacrifices. I still want to
mull it over a bit – narrow it down to <em>one</em> design to buy
initially, and see how it goes – but overall I think these look cool. I
want them!

<h2 id="pg_ivm-1.8-released">pg_ivm 1.8 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
IVM Development Group is pleased to announce the release of
<a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm/releases/tag/v1.8">pg_ivm
1.8</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changes since the v1.7 release include:
</p>
<h3>
Bug fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Consider tuple duplicity in maintenance of EXISTS views (Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
Previously, the duplicity of row was not considered and only one tuple
was inserted even when duplicated tuples are generated as a result of
inserting a tuple into a table in an EXISTS subquery.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix checking for expressions containing an EXISTS subquery (Takuma
Hoshiai, Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
EXISTS subquery is currently allowed only directly under WHERE clause or
in AND expression that is directly under WHERE. However, the check was
insufficient previously so that views using expressions other than AND
containing an EXISTS subquery could be created without an error and it
caused incorrect maintenance results.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Check if PgIvmImmvRelationId is invalid before open it (Colin Zhao)
</p>
<p>
Fix an error that occurs at dropping tables that occurs when pg_ivm is
installed by shared_preload_libraries without executing CREATE EXTENSION
command.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix an error raised when dropping pg_ivm extension (Yugo Nagata)
</p>
<p>
Previously, DROP EXTENSION pg_ivm failed due to the failure of opening
the index on the pg_ivm_immv catalog table, because the index had been
already dropped at that time.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
About pg_ivm
</h3>
<p>
pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance
(IVM) feature.
</p>
<p>
Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views
up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on
views rather than recomputing. pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate
maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately after a
base table is modified.

<p>I’ve wanted an e-bike for ages, ever since I first tried one many,
many years ago, but most of my normal cycling destinations are close
enough that I didn’t really feel I had an excuse to buy one. But then we
started to think that folding bikes would also be useful when
campervanning, and so

up-to-date Chromium for Windows XP, Vista, and 7</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Modern browsers don’t really support older versions of Windows
anymore, so anyone running Windows XP, 2003, Vista, and even Windows 7
and 8 are losing access to secure and capable browsers. While running
those older versions of Windows on production machines isn’t exactly
advised, they’re still great fun as retrocomputing platforms and to keep
older Windows games accessible using period-correct hardware. As such,
there’s some awesome news: there is now a fully up-to-date variant of
Chromium for these older versions of Windows called Supermium. It tracks
current Chromium, supports extensions, sandboxing, Aero Glass, Google
Sync, and even Widevine on Windows 7 and higher. Micheal MJD just
published a video showing Supermium in action in case you’re curious.
You’ll need at least Windows XP SP3 and an Intel Pentium 4 with SSE2 in
order to run it, and Windows 2000 support is in the works, too.</p>

performance boost</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Redox has published the summary of development covering February, and
there’s quite a few interesting leaps forward this month. First and
foremost, the operating system got a major file read/write speed boost
by implementing records in RedoxFS. The migration to UNIX-format paths
is ongoing, Boxedwine is currently being ported, and more and more
programs are getting ported, including complex applications like
Audacity, Celestia, KiCad and Neothesia. There’s a lot more this month,
so be sure to read the whole report.</p>

<p>Agony first. The agony starts with the fact that Elon Musk has a
point; OpenAI, Altman and Brockman <em>have</em> changed their mission
since he gave them his money, his time and his reputation. Here’s what
they told that State of the California in 2015: THIRD: This Corporation
shall be a nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for charitable
and/or educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding
provision of any future United States Internal Revenue law. The specific
purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research,
development and distribution of technology related to artificial
intelligence. The resulting technology will benefit the public and the
corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit
when applicable. The corporation is not organized for the private gain

<h2 id="biden-is-a-fine-president">Biden <i>is</i> a fine president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and
proto-blogger
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/C4Dyym1uc3c">Jeff
Jarvis</a>, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just
made it a blog post.
</p>
<p>
The thing about Gaza is that there’s the rest of the world, and they’re
watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been
such an asshole to the US. He’s a freaking MAGA.
</p>
<p>
So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but
he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all
around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will
die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure.
The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the
right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there’s another path,
compassion and help.
</p>
<p>
Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But
they’re doing it the only way we can, given who we are.
</p>
<p>
Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we
never have. Journos seem to think Americans can’t understand the basics
of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of
the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn’t really any more
complicated.

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-roundup">IndieWeb Carnival: Roundup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;February has come to an end and with it also ended my experience hosting the 9th edition of the IndieWeb Carnival. To be honest with you, I didn’t know what to expect going into this. Foreverliketh.is—who was the host for the month of January—emailed me one day asking me if I wanted to host one of the upcoming months because the carnival was running short on hosts and I obviously accepted.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
His month on the topic of
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive
Internalization </a> saw
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">13
people contributing</a> and so I said to myself “If 10 to 15 people
decide to participate in February I’ll consider that a win”.
</p>
<p>
Well, looks like we got there. I have 44 links in front of me so this is
going to be quite the roundup but before we jump into that let me first
say thank you to all the people who decided to take the time to
participate. You’re all a bunch of awesome people. Also, the Carnival
continues and this month’s topic is going to be
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">Accessibility
in the Small Web</a>. Look forward to reading your posts there. Now it’s
time to dive into the submissions.
</p>
<h2>
Quick overview
</h2>
<p>
As I said before, I have 44 links in front of me. One person contributed
2 posts, 43 of those posts were written specifically for this month’s
carnival and 1 was submitted not by its author but by someone else. They
thought it was a quality entry and they were right so I decided to
include it.

The roundup
</h2>
<p>
It’s 7.42 am, I have my cup of tea in front of me, and it’s time to
review all these entries.

On Digital Relationships: Once Upon A Time, I Was A Voxer

<p>
There’s no way for me to write up my time as a Voxer both online and off
in any way that’s comprehensive or even likely especially coherent.
Between the memory deficiencies and the flood of alcohol with occasional
marijuana digressions, there’s just not enough to form a full picture.
While I appear on the incest map, there are versions that link me to
people with whom I did not have a saliva or semen connection. The
community was a jumbled mess but there’s also a lot of myth wrapped up
in it all. I won’t deny I at least had more than my fair share of
crushes, including a photographer who I didn’t actually know very well,
although we got along fine, and whose later and far too soon funeral to
this day I regret missing. (People still remember you, K.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I love that this was the first post I received. I am a sucker for
stories. I just love them. I love learning about people’s previous
lives, about their adventures, about the way they got where they are
now. I also love when the physical and the digital intersect and
learning about the origin of the name Bix was such a treat.

Digital relationships

<blockquote>
<p>
Understanding that the generalisability of any study can be questioned,
it is worth reflecting that the IndieWeb—made up in large part of
text-heavy websites—can help foster meaningful digital relationships,
strengthen social support and feelings of satisfaction associated with
these relationships. And because a key, if indirect, result of the
IndieWeb movement is to promote a balance of creation and consumption,
it is all the more powerful a tool to employ in strengthening digital
relationships of humans through the web.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
VH post was the starting point for so many interesting deep dives and
I’m going to write at least a few posts thanks to this. I loved the
parallelism between the IndieWeb and the physical interactions.

great moments.

Digital Relationships
</h3>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s a struggle to slow the cadence of the web and our daily social
interactions; to avoid becoming over-stimulated the second we wake up in
the morning. And it’s for this reason I find myself gravitating towards
natural activities of the past—without a screen. Albeit with a slightly
different landscape and a more focused mindset.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is something I’m also experiencing. And it’s paradoxical in a way.
I retreated from social media years ago to hide in my digital corner and
do my own things. I spend more time outside, walking, enjoying nature,
and listening to birds. And yet what’s left of my online life is a lot
more meaningful.

<blockquote>
<p>
How a family sits around a table in public all staring at their phones
carrying on relationships digitally with everyone other than those
sitting in close physical proximity is a tip of the societal scale that
disturbs me. How others begin, navigate and end romantic relationships
exclusively with digital mechanics confuses me. The fact that our world
seems to be trending toward more technology that replaces the
relationship with more digital depresses me.
</p>

<p>
The large-scale implications of technology are something that worries me
a lot. It’s one of those topics I find myself returning over and over
again. Another topic I need to explore more on this site.

The Technology Mediated Relationships

Jakša</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And people are trying to solve this for themselves. Which is why there
are so many different online spaces and different ways of communication
online. But that also means, that there is no way to have one way to
communicate with everybody.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t help to ask myself if that’s necessarily a bad thing. Do we
actually need a way to communicate with everybody? Maybe we want some
friction in the system. Maybe the fact that not everyone is willing to
use emails is why emails are still the best way to have one-to-one
interactions online.

Oh the People You’ll Meet: A Visual Timeline of Human Connections
</h3>
<p>
By <a href="https://andzuck.com/blog/connections-over-time/">Andrew
Zuckerman</a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s not bad to know many people. The value of a substantial social
network is quite high. But having just one close person to go to when
you’re feeling down… how many average relationships is that worth? Who
feels deep happiness for you when something good happens in your life?
Who can you make beautiful memories with?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn’t agree more. Like everything in life, what matters is to find
a good balance. You want plenty of interactions to keep your mind
stimulated and your points of view challenged and the digital world is
perfect for that. But you also want at least a couple of close IRL
relationships.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I try to imagine what my life would look like if I was stuck with only
the relationships geographically close to me. I have those relationships
as well, and I treasure them, but they simply cannot offer the diversity
of thought, background, and experience that digital relationships allow.
I’m so incredibly thankful to live in an era where I can have the best
of both worlds.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The global nature of the web is an underappreciated quality. Like, can

discussions we’ve had for years without a hitch.

<p>
It really is incredible how normal it feels when you finally meet
someone in person. Probably 2 hours after having met Rob in person we
were wandering the woods chasing howls as if that’s the most normal
thing to do with someone you only just met. But it was perfectly normal
because we were friends. And we still are.

there’s no algorithm and no digital gods telling us what we can and
can’t see. It all starts there but it all continues somewhere else. It
continues in our hearts. Because it doesn’t matter what channel or app
we use to communicate, as long as we have the will. Because whatever app
we use, a friend will be on the other side. We can enjoy whatever
platform we have while it exists, and we can move on when it ceases to
exist. It doesn’t matter if the platform stays or not, what matters is
that friends will be there, friends will stay.

I love this. And I love mail! I keep thinking that maybe I should set up
a PO Box and start connecting at an even slower pace. Maybe after I
moved and I finally have a home I’m gonna do just that.

<p>
Belonging and connecting are battles between in-person and screen time.
I struggle to balance digital and in-person interaction; as I push
myself to live in the present, connecting with someone digitally lets me
sometimes feel I’m not since I’m somewhere else with my mind.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is something we as a society have to confront at some
point. Especially with younger generations growing up so connected. The
struggle is real and it is a struggle. And we have to do something about
it.

In a neighborhood everyone knows who is the fool, who is the one who

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is why I try to be as honest with myself as possible on my site. I
don’t try to perform, don’t try to create a persona. I try to be who I
am, following my interests, and not trying to be distracted by anything
else.

Writing As a Relationship

<p>
I believe that co-writing is an excellent practice for long-term
relationship partners. It can keep things fresh and exciting, allowing
you to literally fall in love all over again with someone you’ve been
married to for ten years. More than once I’ve seen something we’re
writing reflect back to me something I’ve been thinking about but not
been able to solve on my own; solving the problem on the page is a
relief.

<p>
As I’m writing this, I can’t help but think maybe this relationship is
strange. Maybe I have too much dependence on my devices and that I
shouldn’t rely on technology so much. I shouldn’t be so materialistic or
be so attached. But when you spend that much time during some of your
most profound years with any one thing, living or otherwise, it is bound
to become sentimental.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s odd how we can feel an attachment to objects but it’s something I
can absolutely relate to. I don’t own many things but there are a bunch
I care about and I’d feel really sad if I were to lose them. Also, this
post made me want to go back to working on a laptop, something I’m
missing these days.

I am careful to remember that you too are just a voice in the dark. We

shaken hands or embraced. We have never stood side by side against a
common enemy with our actual and only lives at stake. As tempting as it
is to forget the body when online, we are not daemons or spirits without
bodies. We are human beings, embodied and earthbound, and any bonds we
forge should take that into account.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The unguided nature of the app allows people to reflect on these
experiences, instead of providing them with a ready-made interpretation
or a written text to read or skip. Left alone, immersed in these
soundscapes, we are forced to reflect on our emotions triggered by sound
and visual elements, thus building a unique relationship with the past
and with the archaeological site.

<p>
I very much enjoyed this entry because it tackles a completely different
type of digital relationship, one I never spent time thinking about. I’m
now so intrigued by the concept of digital archeology.

<p>
Some people think it is impossible to have meaningful exchanges /
relationships with other without seeing each other, but I disagree. It
is even sometime better to talk to people you don’t see, some topics are
easier that way. Yes written communication are more complex because some
information can not be shared (body language, tone - in particular irony
and sarcasm, …), but that doesn’t prevent people to find a way to
interact that works for them and create true companionship, friendship
or more.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think that sometimes not having access to non-verbal communication can
be a good thing. You’re forced to focus on the actual message because
that’s all you have.

All good things come to an end. People moved on as the platform

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is one of the sad truths about the web in general and why I also
think personal sites are the best way to stay online: platforms come and
go. The only place you can count on still being there in 10 or 15 years

<p>
The rules of engagement changed. Where our digital playgrounds once were
about hanging out and shooting the shit with friends, they now became
something else. People started optimising. Optimising what? Everything.
What they said, how they said it and when they said it. All in an effort
to gain more friends. We still called them friends at that point. But
the veil quickly fell away and the term followers eventually took the
place of friends. And rightly so, because you can’t optimise for
friendship.
</p>

<p>
The fact that people managed to build careers out of being active on
social platforms is one of the big tragedies of the modern web.

<p>
On the dominating platforms of today, nobody will ever be a citizen, not
even a customer. We’re only good enough to be a user. But outside of the
walled gardens, there are still ample opportunities. We can form
relationships, participate in debate, cultivate a corner of and shape
the digital medium. All these verbs - nota bene - have in common that
they are active.

<p>
That’s why I always encourage people to write publicly but to also email
others and create connections. The open web requires effort but it will
also reward you for doing so.

on large social media, everything is drowned out, compacted, an endless

which causes more abstractions. Meanwhile, forums tend to lend

previous point, on social media a true conversation is nearly
impossible, always getting drowned out.
