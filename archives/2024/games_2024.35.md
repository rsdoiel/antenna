date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website

date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website

Let’s be honest: This fall will, almost objectively, be a turbulent time, online and off. But if there’s one thing we know to be true about Polygon readers, it’s that at the end of the day, we all love games, movies, TV, and weirdo internet lore. None of that goes away in the challenging moments, [&#8230;]

## The most anticipated movies of fall 2024

date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-23, from: Polygon Website

In summer, movie-studio thinking aims toward big-screen spectacles and as many explosions as possible. In fall, though, the studios’ focus shifts toward darker fare: melancholy stories for fall and winter, a huge influx of horror movies around Halloween, and a wave of grimmer dramas vying for early awards attention. The rest of 2024 isn’t all about dark [&#8230;]

## Star Wars Outlaws proves you can still be Star Wars without the Jedi

date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website

I&#8217;ve been primed, lately, to ask a question that feels important to understanding Star Wars Outlaws, and it&#8217;s this: What is Star Wars, really? What is the core essence, the Star Wars-ness, of the grand dame of the space opera genre? Disney&#8217;s streaming shows set in the Star Wars universe — Andor in particular — [&#8230;]

date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website

My hands-on demo for Sid Meier&#8217;s Civilization 7 ended at the turning point of a decisive military operation. At arm&#8217;s length from the station, I continued clicking the mouse as I stood and packed my bag, desperately trying to claim the capital of Ashoka, leader of the Maurya Empire. Like in any promising Civilization campaign, [&#8230;]
