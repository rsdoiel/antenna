Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CDT Thu Jun 20 2024

Valid 201300Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTH-CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS AND NORTHEAST/NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Storms may produce scattered damaging wind gusts over parts of the
Northeast and New England mainly this afternoon. Scattered severe
storms are also expected over parts of the north-central High
Plains.

...Northeast States/New England...
The prominent upper anticyclone currently centered over the middle
Atlantic will gradually build westward across the CONUS today, while
some flattening of the ridge will occur over the Northeast and
especially New England. The stronger mid-level westerlies will be
located closer to the international border and across eastern
Canada, with weaker winds aloft over the lower Great Lakes into
southern New England. A surface cold front will advance south into
northern Maine, extending westward into southern lower Michigan by
midday, with subsequent southeastward movement expected across the
Northeast through early evening.

This boundary will serve as the focus for intensifying convection
later today as surface temperatures quickly soar through the 80s
into the lower 90 F, with a weak mid-level impulse/MCV near Lake
Ontario this morning being an additional influence. While deep-layer
shear will not be particularly strong in most areas, PW values are
seasonally moist with 1.5-2 inches expected, contributing to upwards
of 2000-3000 MLCAPE this afternoon particularly across upstate New
York and interior New England/southern Maine. Damaging winds will be
possible with the strongest storms this afternoon.

...North-Central Plains...
Weak mid-level height rises will occur over the central Plains
through tonight, with a belt of moderately strong west-southwesterly
flow aloft, and few embedded disturbances, from Utah/Wyoming toward
the Dakotas and Upper Midwest. Surface cyclogenesis, focused across
northeast Colorado later today, will contribute to a
north-northwestward flux of low-level moisture across the central
High Plains/eastern Wyoming and Black Hills vicinity. 

Initial thunderstorm development/intensification will occur over the
mountains toward southeast Wyoming/Colorado Front Range by
mid-afternoon, with subsequent development into the nearby High
Plains this evening, in areas near/north of the surface low/triple
point and east/northeastward-extending front. Initial storm mode
should be supercellular and large hail is expected.

Aided by an early evening strengthening of a southerly low-level
jet, storms will likely consolidate and grow upscale into a possible
MCS within the warm-advection zone focused across western/northern
Nebraska and south-central/southern South Dakota. Severe wind gusts
could materialize along the leading edge of the MCS.

...Central Rockies/Four Corners Area...
While not overly moist regionally, a west-northwestward flux of
moisture and a moderately strong belt of southwesterly mid-level
flow will contribute to sustained thunderstorms, particularly from
mid-afternoon through early evening. Some of these may produce
severe-caliber downbursts.

...South Texas...
Supercell/brief tornado related to Tropical Storm Alberto is
expected to continue to diminish this morning as it moves inland and
weakens over northeast Mexico.

...Central/eastern Montana...
A weak mid-level disturbance, moderately strong flow aloft, and an
adequately moist boundary layer may contribute to some
strong/locally severe storms late this afternoon and early evening,
with hail/gusty winds possible.

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will largely remain low on Friday. High
pressure will continue to build in across the desert southwest,
keeping winds generally light outside of gusty thunderstorm outflow.
Continued widely scattered thunderstorm activity is expected across
much of New Mexico and Arizona as remnant tropical moisture
continues to be in place, with precipitable water generally
0.75-1.00 in and slow storm motions.

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A westerly push of moisture will continue across New Mexico
and Arizona today. Precipitable water values will increase to
around 0.75-1.00 in into northeastern Arizona. Widely scattered
thunderstorm activity is expected, along with cooler temperatures
and higher relative humidity. Initially, thunderstorm activity may
pose a risk for dry lightning, with soundings indicating large
temperature and dewpoint spreads. Storm motion is expected to be
rather slow with most guidance indicating high likelihood of
measurable precipitation and increasing moisture and cloud cover
through the afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1300
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0844 AM CDT Mon Jun 17 2024

Areas affected...Eastern NE

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 171344Z - 171545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail is possible across eastern Nebraska
over the next hour or two. Limited severe coverage will likely
preclude the need for a watch, but convective trends will be
monitored closely.

DISCUSSION...Regional radar imagery has shown an increase in
thunderstorms along a north-south line from the OFK vicinity
southward to around 20 miles southeast of HSI. Surface analysis
reveals a warm front across southern NE, with this new development
likely a result of warm-air advection across this frontal zone.
Moderate elevated buoyancy is in place ahead of this line, with
mesoanalysis estimation MUCAPE around 2000 J/kg. This elevated
buoyancy will likely persist throughout the remainder of the
morning, but the low-level jet is expected to gradually weaken. As a
result, the general expectation is that this line will gradually
diminish in intensity over the next few hours. Even so, sporadic
intensification of the updrafts within this line is possible, with
large hail as the primary severe risk. A strong gust or two is also
possible given the modest low-level stability. Given the anticipated
weakening of these storms, a watch is not currently expected, but
convective trends will still be monitored closely.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024

Valid 162000Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND
MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms appear possible across parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley late this afternoon, with additional storms
likely tonight across the north-central Plains to upper Mississippi
Valley. Large hail and damaging winds are the primary risks. A small
bowing complex, with mainly a severe/damaging wind threat, will
continue across parts of northern Illinois and vicinity this
afternoon.

...20Z Update...

...Northern Illinois/Southern Wisconsin...
A well-defined, compact MCV continues to move northeastward along
the central/northern IA/IL border. Several strong to severe gusts
were measured along the outflow associated with thunderstorm
generated by this vorticity max over the past hour. Ample low-level
moisture and buoyancy exists downstream across northern IL and far
southern WI, which will likely support the development of additional
storms along the outflow. As a result, the potential for strong to
severe gusts is expected to extend into the area this afternoon, and
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #424 was recently issued to address this
threat.

...Northern/Central MN into northern WI/western Upper MI...
A cold front continues to push eastward across western MN this
afternoon. Downstream destabilization has been mitigated by abundant
cloud cover thus far, but continued low-level moisture advection is
still expected to help remove the remaining convective inhibition
over the next few hours. As such, development along the front as it
continues eastward still appears possible this afternoon. Large hail
and damaging gusts are the primary risks, but a tornado or two is
possible if more discrete, cellular activity is realized.

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest/Upper MS Valley...
Recent surface analysis places a low over northeast CO and another
low over west-central MN. Boundary between these two lows has
recently started pushing back northward/northeastward as a warm
front, particularly from southwest into south-central NE. Increasing
cumulus across eastern CO continues to suggest that some
surface-based development may occur later this afternoon, but the
higher coverage is still expected north of the warm front tonight
across northern NE and southern SD amid warm-air advection supported
by a strengthening low-level jet. Large hail remains the primary
severe risk with this elevated development, but isolated damaging
gusts are possible as well, particularly if storms occur in close
proximity to the warm front.

...Elsewhere...
Isolated thunderstorms are still possible along the lee trough
extending from the northeast CO low through the southern High
Plains. Moderate instability and a deeply mixed boundary layer
should support an isolated threat for strong to severe downbursts.
Numerous thunderstorms are also expected to continue across the
central Gulf Coast as tropical moisture continues to advect
northward into the region ahead of a tropical wave. Weak shear
should keep any severe potential very isolated, but a few strong
water-loaded downbursts are possible.

..Mosier.. 06/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024/

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest/Upper Mississippi
Valley...
A strong upper trough/low will continue advancing east-northeastward
across the northern Plains and Canadian Prairie provinces today.
While the primary surface low is expected to remain in central
Canada, a weak secondary low should develop generally eastward
across MN through this evening in tandem with a cold front. Warm
mid-level temperatures associated with a cap should tend to inhibit
robust convective development for at least a few more hours into the
early afternoon. But, most guidance now does show thunderstorm
initiation occurring along the front in northern MN by 20-22Z. There
are still concerns/uncertainty with how many intense thunderstorms
will be able to form given fairly prevalent cloudiness that should
temper daytime heating to some extent. Still, strong deep-layer
shear and steepening mid-level lapse rates atop a gradually
destabilizing low-level airmass should support a threat for
supercells and large hail. Some guidance suggests a fairly quick
progression to a MCS, which seems reasonable given the linear
forcing of the cold front. If this occurs, then a severe/damaging
wind threat may persist through the evening into parts of northern
WI and the U.P. of MI. Enough low-level shear is also forecast to
support low-level updraft rotation and a tornado or two across this
region.

A separate area of intense thunderstorm development is possible late
this afternoon and early evening along the trailing portion of the
cold front in NE/northwest KS and vicinity. If convection can
initiate along this boundary, strong instability and modest
deep-layer shear would support a threat for mainly multicells posing
a risk for severe winds given the well mixed boundary layer
forecast. Some hail could also occur with marginal supercell
structures. The Slight Risk has been expanded southward across the
central Plains to account for this scenario. Otherwise, scattered to
numerous elevated thunderstorms are still expected to develop this
evening and overnight generally north of the front from eastern WY
into NE/SD and southern MN. A strengthening low-level jet in this
time frame across these regions and ample deep-layer shear/MUCAPE
will easily support supercells and a hail threat with initial
development. But, convective mode may quickly become messy, with one
or more bows/clusters possible as thunderstorms move eastward across
the upper MS Valley overnight. Even though this activity should tend
to remain elevated, an isolated severe/damaging wind threat may
persist given the strong MUCAPE forecast. 

...Northern Illinois/Southern Wisconsin...
A well defined MCV remains evident on visible satellite and radar
imagery late this morning over northeast MO and southern IA. This
feature should continue to track northeastward this afternoon and
evening in the modest southwesterly mid-level flow regime across the
mid MS Valley/Midwest. Ample daytime heating of a moist low-level
airmass should support around 1500-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid
afternoon across northern IL and vicinity. Ascent associated with
the MCV and its associated mid-level vorticity maximum will likely
encourage the development of isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms by 20-22Z. Modest but sufficient deep-layer shear for
updraft organization is indicated in various RAP forecast soundings
across this region. Scattered severe/damaging winds, along with
isolated hail, could occur with a small bowing complex that may
develop and move east-northeastward across the Chicago metro area
late this afternoon and early evening. Enough low-level shear is
also forecast to support a low chance for a tornado or two. Given
recent guidance and observational trends, a small Slight Risk has
been added across northern IL/southern WI to account for this
scenario.

...Southern High Plains...
Isolated/widely spaced thunderstorms should form once again this
afternoon along the length of a surface lee trough/dryline extending
southward across the southern High Plains. Although deep-layer shear
is forecast to remain weak, moderate instability and a well-mixed
boundary layer should support an isolated threat for severe
downdraft winds. Occasional hail may also occur with the more robust
cores before convection weakens after sunset.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1237 PM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
NORTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms will be possible Monday over much
of the northern Plains toward the upper Mississippi Valley.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Upper pattern early Monday morning is forecast to feature expansive
ridging centered over the Carolinas that covers much of the eastern
CONUS and a cyclone over the Pacific Northwest with associated
troughing over the much of the western CONUS. Southwesterly flow
aloft will persist across the northern and central Plains between
these two features, with some strengthening of this flow anticipated
as the western CONUS cyclone progresses eastward across the northern
Rockies and northern High Plains, and the ridging over the eastern
CONUS remains in place. 

Scattered showers and thunderstorms will likely be ongoing from the
mid MO Valley into the Upper Midwest, to the north of a warm front
expected to extend from a surface low over the southwest
NE/northwest KS vicinity northeastward to another low near the WI/MI
border. These showers and thunderstorms are expected to gradually
shift northeastward throughout the day, remaining mostly north of
the warm front. There is some chance that this activity
restrengthens during the late afternoon/early evening over
east-central MN and central/northern WI, where the warm front is
expected to make gradual northward progress during the day. Ample
low-level moisture and strong buoyancy south of the warm front
suggests surface-based supercells capable of all severe hazards,
including tornadoes, are possible. However, the overall evolution of
this convective cluster still remains a bit uncertain, with some
guidance keeping it well north of the warm front. This uncertainty
precludes higher probabilities in this outlook.

Farther west, late afternoon thunderstorm development appears
possible along the lee trough arcing from southeast MT south into
far eastern CO/western KS. Highest probabilities for surface-based,
late afternoon/early evening storms appears to be across the central
High Plains. Any storms that do form could produce hail initially,
before quickly becoming more outflow dominant. There is some
potential storms develop close enough to one another for upscale
growth, with the resulting convective line progressing
east-northeastward across southern NE. Thunderstorm development also
appears probable across southeast MT amid moisture upslope flow and
strengthening large-scale ascent ahead of the approaching shortwave
trough. These storms will likely be elevated, with hail as the
primary hazard, but a few strong gusts could still reach the
surface. Isolated storms are possible farther south across the
southern High Plains, but warmer temperatures aloft and displacement
south of the better large-scale ascent should keep coverage
isolated. High-based character to any storms that do develop could
promote damaging gusts.

The low-level jet is expected to strengthen during the evening,
likely increasing to near 60 kt from the central Plains into the
Upper Midwest. Associated warm-air advection will likely result in
thunderstorm development north of the warm front across the northern
Plains and Upper Midwest. Enough vertical shear and elevated
buoyancy is in place for severe storms, with large hail as the
primary hazards. This activity is currently expected to stay north
of the warm front, but this front is forecast to move northward
through much of MN by early Tuesday. As a result, these is some
chance a storms may trend towards becoming surface-based early
Tuesday morning if they develop far enough south.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND
MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms appear possible across parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley late this afternoon, with additional storms
likely tonight across the north-central Plains to upper Mississippi
Valley. Large hail and damaging winds are the primary risks. A small
bowing complex, with mainly a severe/damaging wind threat, may also
develop across parts of northern Illinois and vicinity this
afternoon.

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest/Upper Mississippi
Valley...
A strong upper trough/low will continue advancing east-northeastward
across the northern Plains and Canadian Prairie provinces today.
While the primary surface low is expected to remain in central
Canada, a weak secondary low should develop generally eastward
across MN through this evening in tandem with a cold front. Warm
mid-level temperatures associated with a cap should tend to inhibit
robust convective development for at least a few more hours into the
early afternoon. But, most guidance now does show thunderstorm
initiation occurring along the front in northern MN by 20-22Z. There
are still concerns/uncertainty with how many intense thunderstorms
will be able to form given fairly prevalent cloudiness that should
temper daytime heating to some extent. Still, strong deep-layer
shear and steepening mid-level lapse rates atop a gradually
destabilizing low-level airmass should support a threat for
supercells and large hail. Some guidance suggests a fairly quick
progression to a MCS, which seems reasonable given the linear
forcing of the cold front. If this occurs, then a severe/damaging
wind threat may persist through the evening into parts of northern
WI and the U.P. of MI. Enough low-level shear is also forecast to
support low-level updraft rotation and a tornado or two across this
region.

A separate area of intense thunderstorm development is possible late
this afternoon and early evening along the trailing portion of the
cold front in NE/northwest KS and vicinity. If convection can
initiate along this boundary, strong instability and modest
deep-layer shear would support a threat for mainly multicells posing
a risk for severe winds given the well mixed boundary layer
forecast. Some hail could also occur with marginal supercell
structures. The Slight Risk has been expanded southward across the
central Plains to account for this scenario. Otherwise, scattered to
numerous elevated thunderstorms are still expected to develop this
evening and overnight generally north of the front from eastern WY
into NE/SD and southern MN. A strengthening low-level jet in this
time frame across these regions and ample deep-layer shear/MUCAPE
will easily support supercells and a hail threat with initial
development. But, convective mode may quickly become messy, with one
or more bows/clusters possible as thunderstorms move eastward across
the upper MS Valley overnight. Even though this activity should tend
to remain elevated, an isolated severe/damaging wind threat may
persist given the strong MUCAPE forecast. 

...Northern Illinois/Southern Wisconsin...
A well defined MCV remains evident on visible satellite and radar
imagery late this morning over northeast MO and southern IA. This
feature should continue to track northeastward this afternoon and
evening in the modest southwesterly mid-level flow regime across the
mid MS Valley/Midwest. Ample daytime heating of a moist low-level
airmass should support around 1500-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid
afternoon across northern IL and vicinity. Ascent associated with
the MCV and its associated mid-level vorticity maximum will likely
encourage the development of isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms by 20-22Z. Modest but sufficient deep-layer shear for
updraft organization is indicated in various RAP forecast soundings
across this region. Scattered severe/damaging winds, along with
isolated hail, could occur with a small bowing complex that may
develop and move east-northeastward across the Chicago metro area
late this afternoon and early evening. Enough low-level shear is
also forecast to support a low chance for a tornado or two. Given
recent guidance and observational trends, a small Slight Risk has
been added across northern IL/southern WI to account for this
scenario.

...Southern High Plains...
Isolated/widely spaced thunderstorms should form once again this
afternoon along the length of a surface lee trough/dryline extending
southward across the southern High Plains. Although deep-layer shear
is forecast to remain weak, moderate instability and a well-mixed
boundary layer should support an isolated threat for severe
downdraft winds. Occasional hail may also occur with the more robust
cores before convection weakens after sunset.

Mesoscale Discussion 1278
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0658 PM CDT Sat Jun 15 2024

Areas affected...Northwest MO into western/central IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 152358Z - 160130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A threat for damaging wind, isolated hail, and possibly a
tornado or two will spread eastward this evening. Watch issuance is
likely.

DISCUSSION...A storm cluster is gradually increasing in size across
northeast KS into southeast NE, as the northern portion of a smaller
cluster that developed earlier over central KS begins to merge with
ongoing storms across southeast NE. Moderate downstream buoyancy and
marginally sufficient deep-layer shear will continue to support
organized convection through the evening, and the ongoing storm
cluster is expected to move into parts of northwest MO and
southwest/central IA with time. 

With a linear mode already established, damaging winds may be the
most likely hazard as storms progress east-northeastward this
evening. However, rather strong low-level shear/SRH (as noted on
regional VWPs) will also support potential for a tornado or two.
Downstream watch issuance is likely between 7-8 PM CDT if trends
continue to support a severe threat this evening into northwest MO
and southwest/central IA.

  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will continue to
develop this afternoon into the evening.  The stronger thunderstorms
will mainly be capable of severe gusts (60-80 mph).  Isolated large
hail may also accompany the more intense thunderstorm cores as this
activity moves east into a more unstable airmass over eastern parts
of Kansas towards the early evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles northeast of
Manhattan KS to 40 miles south of Wichita KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 420

355 PM MDT Sat Jun 15 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Montana

  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 85
    mph likely
  Isolated very large hail events to 2 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...An intensifying broken band of thunderstorms is forecast
to grow upscale into a squall line this afternoon and into the
evening across the Watch area.  Severe gusts (60-85 mph) will be the
primary hazard with the band of storms.  Large hail may accompany
any more discrete storm on the south flank of the evolving
thunderstorm activity during the evening, as well as perhaps a brief
risk for a tornado.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 95
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles north northeast
of Glasgow MT to 35 miles south southwest of Miles City MT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
