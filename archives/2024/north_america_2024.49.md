## US state seeks $47.8M fine for air pollution by natural gas processor

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO — New Mexico environmental regulators issued a $47.8 million fine Friday on allegations of excess air pollution at a natural gas processing facility in a prolific oil production region near the Texas state line.


The state Environment Department issued the sanctions including a cease-and-desist order against Houston-based Targa Resources at its processing plant near Jal, New Mexico, alleging permit violations and excess emissions of gases known to cause respiratory issues or contribute to climate change including ozone-producing pollutants.


Representatives for Targa could not immediately be reached for comment. Regulators say Targa has 30 days to respond and comply or request a hearing with the agency secretary.


Regulators also have ordered a series of corrective actions and improvements to the facilities that process gas for transmission by pipeline.


The sanctions are based on allegations of two permit violations, late reporting of emissions and an incomplete requirement for a root cause analysis of excess pollution.


The proposed air-pollution fine against Targa would be the largest in state history by the Environment Department, if upheld. The case also was referred to federal regulators.


Separately, the New Mexico Court of Appeals last month upheld regulations aimed at crushing air pollution in one of the nation’s top-producing oil and gas states.


Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s administration has advanced new restrictions on ozone-precursor pollutants along with regulations to limit methane emissions in its efforts to combat climate change and meet federal clean air standards.

## Austin Tice is alive, family of American journalist says

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — American journalist Austin Tice is still alive, more than 12 years after he was detained in Syria, his mother, Debra Tice, said Friday, citing a source vetted by the U.S. government.


"Austin is alive and being treated well, and I can tell you he is waiting to come home," Debra Tice told VOA. "We have a very reliable source that is totally verified."


A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Austin Tice is an award-winning freelance journalist and photographer who works for outlets that include The Washington Post, CBS and McClatchy.


Austin Tice was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus in August 2012. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been seen or heard of him since.


"He is so ready. And he has known from the very first day that he was detained that he was going to walk free again," Debra Tice told VOA. "And so, we want to see him on the tarmac. We want to see that happen."


Austin Tice's father, Mark, characterized the source as "unimpeachable" but said the family could not share more details because the intelligence was classified.


The U.S. State Department did not immediately reply to VOA's request for comment.


The revelation comes as the Tice family met with White House officials on Friday to push for the U.S. government to do more to secure Austin Tice's release. The meeting occurred amid renewed clashes in Syria, as insurgent fighters who have already captured the northern city of Aleppo, one of the country's largest, are pressing their march against President Bashar Assad's forces.


At a press conference following the White House meeting, the Tice family criticized Biden administration officials for not providing any updates during their meeting.


Debra Tice told VOA she hopes President Joe Biden uses his final weeks in the White House to do everything he can to secure her son's release.


The family's update comes the same week that President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would select Adam Boehler to serve as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. The former chief executive officer of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, Boehler was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords.

## US-China prisoner swap reunites Uyghur families as work continues to secure others' freedom

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Lost in much of the debate over "hostage diplomacy" after last week's rare prisoner swap between the U.S. and China is that in addition to the three Americans, three Uyghurs were on the flight from China. The exchange highlights Beijing's persecution of ethnic minorities prompting renewed international scrutiny.


A U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed to VOA that the three Uyghurs were on the flight but declined to provide additional details "out of respect for their privacy."


"The Biden-Harris administration has continuously advocated for cases of humanitarian concern, including Uyghurs," the spokesperson told VOA. "We are pleased that these [Uyghur] individuals are home with their families."


Among those freed was 73-year-old Ayshem Mamut, the mother of prominent Uyghur rights advocate and Uyghur American lawyer Nury Turkel.


According to Turkel, the last time he saw his mother was 20 years ago, when she traveled to Washington for his graduation from American University.


"Her last trip to the U.S. was in the summer of 2004, when she came to D.C. with my late father for my law school graduation," Turkel told VOA.


Turkel's parents stayed in the U.S. for about five months before returning to China. Since then, his mother had been barred from leaving the country.


"The Chinese authorities never specifically said why my parents couldn't leave the country," Turkel said. "However, I believe a travel ban was imposed on my parents because of my decadeslong advocacy work and my U.S. government service from 2020 to 2024."


Turkel served as a commissioner and chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom from 2020 to 2024. In response to his advocacy for religious freedom for oppressed communities, he was sanctioned by China in 2021 and Russia in 2022.


Turkel described the reunion with his mother as a profoundly emotional moment, crediting years of persistent advocacy by individuals and institutions across multiple U.S. administrations.


"This reunion is a testament to the U.S. government's steadfast commitment to human rights and justice for the Uyghur people," Turkel said. "I am so proud of our country and leadership at the highest level — President [Joe] Biden, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Secretary [Antony] Blinken and countless national security professionals invested so much time and energy over the years."


He added that the reunion has been transformative for his mother.


"For my mother, this moment represents a rebirth of joy and humanity," Turkel said.


"After decades apart, she can finally experience the love and laughter of her grandchildren — a connection that transcends the pain of separation and reminds us of the enduring power of family. She is profoundly grateful to those who made this reunion possible, especially Ambassador Nick Burns, whose compassionate actions reflect the best of humanity."


Advocates push for continued U.S. action


Rayhan Asat, a fellow at the Atlantic Council and a Uyghur lawyer whose brother, Ekpar Asat, remains imprisoned in China, welcomed the release but called for continued efforts to secure freedom for other Uyghurs.


"I urge President Biden to secure Ekpar's release and bring him home during the remainder of his presidency. His continued imprisonment sends a chilling message that participating in U.S. programs comes with grave risk," Asat told VOA.


Ekpar Asat was sentenced to 15 years in prison after participating in a U.S.-China cultural exchange program organized by the State Department.


"As the ambassador emphasized today, the state of U.S.-China relations hinges on the choices China makes, including its support for unjust wars. One of those choices must be to end the ongoing genocide against the Uyghur people," Asat added.


Ferkat Jawdat, another Uyghur American advocate, expressed mixed emotions about the release. Jawdat has lobbied U.S. administrations to secure the freedom of his mother, whom he has not seen since 2006. She has been barred from leaving China for nearly two decades.


"While I'm very happy for @nuryturkel and his family's reunion with their mother, I'm very sad that my mom was excluded from this," he wrote. "I've been asking the U.S. government for years for the same when I met with former Secretary of State @mikepompeo and @SecBlinken," Jawdat said in a tweet on social media platform X.


Turkel offered a message of hope and resilience to the global Uyghur community, encouraging them to remain steadfast in their advocacy.


"To my Uyghur communities around the world, I urge you to hold onto hope and faith," Turkel said. "My family's reunion is a living testament to the possibility of change, even in the face of immense challenges. Share your stories, advocate for your loved ones and know that your voices matter."


He emphasized that international attention and tireless efforts are making a difference.


"The world is listening, and there are people tirelessly working for justice and reconnecting families like ours," he said. "Together, our resilience and solidarity can pave the way for others to experience similar moments of joy and relief."

## Lobito Corridor takes center stage; Angolans pin hopes on Biden's visit

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Angola highlighted the potential of the Lobito Corridor, a 1,300-kilometer, multinational railway project intended to connect markets and jumpstart trade.


The presidential visit raised hopes but also drew skepticism from some Angolans who spoke to VOA about their daily struggles and the need for economic development.


In Luanda, the capital, Angolans told VOA why they are anxious for the benefits they think will come from the investment.


"We are suffering a lot. We're struggling," said Albertina Manuel, a street vendor, who expressed frustration over rising living costs. "School is very expensive; we are not able to pay our children's tuition. It's harder now. We never suffered like this before," she told VOA's Portuguese Service.


Sacamauro Eduardo, a university student, hoped for a meaningful U.S.-Africa relationship.


"I hope to see a strengthened relationship with Africa, and in particular between Angola and the U.S.," he said. "I hope they approach the most important issues for the people, like poverty and investment in education. We don't want them to just talk. They need to bring good benefits to the Angolan people."


Others, like Amelia Joao, another market seller, said they hope the investment can bring down the cost of staple food products.


"Lower our prices," and "help us produce things," she said. "With more production in the country, the prices will lower."


Solia Selende, another Luanda resident, said the United States should look beyond the polished image often presented to foreign leaders. "If they go deeper into the slums, what they will see will make them very sad," he said. "There are people starving to death, not only in Luanda but in all Angolan provinces."


The Lobito Corridor 


The Lobito Corridor project is at the center of Angola's aspirations for economic renewal.


Stretching from the Atlantic port of Lobito through the country's central highlands and into the mineral-rich Democratic Republic of Congo, it could reshape regional trade dynamics, facilitating export of copper, cobalt, and other critical minerals from the DRC and Zambia to global markets.


Initially established during Angola's colonial era, the rail infrastructure suffered years of neglect because of decades of civil war. However, with a $5 billion investment backed by partners including U.S. and European companies, the Lobito Corridor is being refurbished.




Anthony Carroll, senior study group member on critical minerals at the United States Institute of Peace, pointed to its geopolitical and economic significance.


"The Lobito Corridor is a bold effort to refurbish and construct a rail line," he said.


"It will speed access to critical minerals for European and U.S. markets, which have been largely dominated by China in the last 20 years," he said. "It will also give more value to Africans in terms of the return they'll enjoy for enhanced infrastructure investment and development."




Carroll also cited potential problems, including fluctuating global demand for critical minerals and competition from other infrastructure projects, such as the Chinese-funded refurbishment of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, known as TAZARA, which would carry those minerals to the Indian Ocean for shipping to Asia.


Angola's leadership, however, said the projects can complement each other and there should not be a rivalry. Foreign Minister Tete Antonio emphasized the potential of linking the Lobito Corridor to TAZARA.


"Our ambition is to connect the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic," he told VOA. "This is not about competition; in Africa, we see this as an opportunity for collaboration."


Beyond minerals, the corridor could improve sectors such as agriculture, logistics, and manufacturing. Antonio mentioned discussions on expanding agricultural production for export through the railway route.


Economic integration 


The corridor is a centerpiece of the Biden administration's focus on infrastructure development in Africa under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, a G7 initiative to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative.


Frances Brown, White House director for African affairs, told VOA's English to Africa Service the U.S. is committed to ensuring the project benefits the region.


"The Lobito Corridor is about investment, it's about infrastructure, but it's also about ensuring that it benefits communities more broadly," she said.


"It's all about sustainable economic development; it's all about a transparent contracting process. It's about ensuring that it boosts regional trade, that it creates quality jobs and improves lives."




For Angola, the corridor could support exports to the United States through the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which allows duty-free access to the U.S. market for certain goods produced in African countries.


Anderson Jeronimo, director of planning at Angola's Agriculture Ministry, described the corridor as a way to improve Angola's agricultural exports.


"Opportunities like AGOA can help us export more coffee and fruit products to the U.S.," he said. "We need U.S. support to better understand and take full advantage of AGOA."


Hopes and challenges 


Despite the potential benefits of projects such as the Lobito Corridor, many Angolans face issues such as rising food prices, unaffordable education, and inadequate health care.


The country's economy has been hit hard by fluctuating oil prices and its government has struggled to repay more than $17 billion in debt to China.


Luanda resident Rosalina Cativa said she sees the corridor as a lifeline for the struggling economy.


"Our country is in really bad shape," she said. "A lot of things have to change, especially regarding food prices and education. We look at our country's health, and it's really, really bad. We need help."


VOA Portuguese Service's Coque Mukuta and Mayra Fernandes contributed to the report from Luanda, Angola. VOA English to Africa's Peter Clottey and Philip Alexiou contributed from Washington.

## Former Ukrainian President Poroshenko: We can stop the war in 24 hours

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, now leader of the opposition European Solidarity Party, sat down with Voice of America during a visit to Washington to attend the annual forum of the International Democracy Union, an alliance of center-right political parties.


While in the U.S. capital, Poroshenko met with Biden administration officials and members of the incoming Trump administration to share his assessment of the situation Ukraine is facing more than two and a half years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion, and his vision of how to end the conflict.


The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.


VOA: How would you describe the situation on the front lines in Ukraine?


Petro Poroshenko, former Ukrainian president: Every week, I travel to the front lines to deliver needed equipment and armaments. Russia is increasing its pressure. Russia has more sophisticated weapons than even half a year [ago]. Ukrainian soldiers are tired because some have served for over two and a half years, but they still wouldn't allow Russians to break through the Ukrainian positions.


At the moment, we shouldn't think about offensive operations but [how] to strengthen fortifications. I appreciate the decision of the United States government to give us anti-infantry mines. Having three, four, five kilometers of a minefield is an excellent response to the new tactics of Russia, which is penetrating Ukrainian positions with small groups of five to 12 persons with the support of Russian artillery, which has an unlimited number of artillery shells.


If we have fortifications, minefields and reconnaissance drones, including thermal night drones and [an] unlimited number of FPV drones to destroy these small groups, [an] effective radio-electronic warfare system, including against Russian reconnaissance drones, I'm confident we can keep [the] defense lines.


VOA: Ukraine is under pressure to start negotiating. Is this a good time for that?


Poroshenko: No other nation in the world wants peace more than Ukrainians because we pay an enormous price. However, the negotiations should start when both sides are ready. Everybody asks if Ukraine is ready, and nobody asks if [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is ready for these negotiations. Putin is not ready. We should undertake enormous efforts to prepare Putin for these negotiations. What language should we speak to Putin? The language of strength, including sophisticated and modern weapons for Ukraine. Putin should feel that he is paying a high price. We need stronger sanctions to destroy the shadow fleet. The sanctions should lower Russian exports from $600 [billion] to $200 billion to cut Putin's ability to finance the war.


VOA: Do you think the new Trump administration will support your vision?


Poroshenko: I strongly believe in the global leadership of the United States. I worked with [President Donald] Trump in 2016-2019. Meeting him was one of my first meetings as president of Ukraine. Our meeting was scheduled for five minutes — just to shake hands and take a photo — and lasted for two and a half hours. As a result, he gave Ukraine the first lethal weapons after three years of the war, the legendary Javelins [anti-tank missiles]. They saved lots of lives in the Donbas region. Even without additional consultation with our European partners, we agreed that the United States introduce sanctions against the company contractor for the North Stream 2 [natural gas pipeline], which was vital. In President Trump’s presence we discussed with [his former CIA Director Mike] Pompeo the coordination of efforts to recognize the Ukrainian independent church. Trump is a person of results, not process. He is decisive enough to make tough decisions.




VOA: Trump nominated General Keith Kellogg as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine and Russia. What do you think about him and his ideas?


Poroshenko: I've met him several times when he was a member of [then] Vice President [Mike] Pence's team. I welcome President Trump's approach to appoint a special presidential envoy to Ukraine. When President Trump appointed Kurt Volker [as U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations], that was extremely efficient. And now, General Kellogg's level of professionalism gives us careful optimism.


We can stop the war in 24 hours, as President Trump promised, and without a single shot [fired] or a dollar spent. We need just one signature for one treaty — the Washington Treaty [the April 1949 treaty establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance]. Inviting Ukraine to join NATO will be a powerful demonstration to Putin that we are not afraid of his blackmail. We are decisive enough, and we want to have sustainable security on the continent.


I propose my plan — the “Poroshenko Plan.” Within one year, partners guarantee that Ukraine will get a full [NATO] membership if it meets specific criteria and fulfills certain conditions. During that year, while we are not in NATO, we will receive the same security guarantees as Finland and Sweden before their full NATO membership. During that year, I also suggest having peacekeepers under the mandate of the United Nations Security Council to guarantee a ceasefire. That's how to stop the war in 24 hours.

## The Shipping Industry May Have Accidentally Done Some Geoengineering

date: 2024-12-06, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTE1MDYyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjQ0MTQwNH0.5qzDedelUYuUzd5wtxwzQDDjnumaK1pCs17Zkak-JAs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The world has been very hot lately. Like, <em><em>really</em></em> hot. Much hotter than you might expect from climate change alone. </p>
<p>In 2023, the global average temperature was <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2023-hottest-year-record" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly 1.5 degrees Celsius</u></a>, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above its pre-industrial level. It is <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/2024-track-be-hottest-year-record-warming-temporarily-hits-15degc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly certain</u></a> to exceed that milestone in 2024. </p>
<p>These are extreme leaps. For context, 2019 was the second-hottest year on record when it happened, and it was <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global/201913#:~:text=registros%20en%201880-,Global%20Temperatures,C%20(%2B1.71%C2%B0F)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>merely 0.95 degrees Celsius</u></a> above the pre-industrial average. So Earth’s temperature has seemingly surged half a degree Celsius in five years. </p>
<p>These searingly hot temperatures aren’t completely outside the range climate models predict, but they are arriving sooner than most scientists thought, and climate researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/opinion/climate-change-heat-planet.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t yet reached a consensus</u></a> explanation for why they are happening. </p>
<p>This week, though, we got somewhat closer. A new study adds to a growing literature suggesting that a change to global shipping fuels has accidentally contributed to a surge in warming. </p>
<p>In 2020, the International Maritime Organization began enforcing rules that removed a toxic air pollutant, sulfur dioxide, from shipping fuels. Sulfur dioxide can inflame and irritate the heart and lungs, trigger asthma attacks, and can cause acid rain. But it can also reflect heat back into space, cooling the Earth.</p>
<p>These cooling effects of sulfur dioxide are very short-lived, and sulfur dioxide only sticks around in the atmosphere for <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp116-c5.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about a week and a half</u></a>. (Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, can persist in the atmosphere for a millennium.) </p>
<p>It now seems that all those sulfur aerosols were likely reflecting enough heat back into space to make a noticeable difference in the Earth’s temperature rise. The new study, written by the researchers Ilaria Quaglia and Daniele Visioni, finds that removing sulfur dioxide from shipping fuel likely increased the planet’s temperature by 0.08 degrees Celsius. </p>
<p>This change alone can’t explain the Earth’s recent surge in temperature rise. But the new rules likely made the record-breaking temperatures in 2023 roughly 12 times likelier than they would have been had the rules not changed, Visioni, an atmospheric chemistry professor at Cornell, told me. </p>
<p>“The likelihood of something like 2023 happening — was it made larger, was it made bigger, by this contribution? We found, yes,” he said.</p>
<p>The timing of the surge — and the fact that the most anomalously warm part of the planet has been the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean, a popular shipping route — also support the conclusion that the IMO rules are playing an effect.</p>
<p>Other factors — including natural fluctuations in Earth’s multi-year climate cycles, like El Niño — may have helped the surge along too, Visioni said. “If you take a probabilistic approach, you can say, even without the shipping rules, 2023 wouldn’t have been completely impossible,” he added. “But you cannot evaluate the truthfulness of probability from one outcome because you only have one world.” In other words, both climate change and our response to it are part of the same poorly designed experiment — and we can only run that experiment once.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, several other papers have reached a similar conclusion, although they disagree about the magnitude of the IMO’s accidental cooling effect. Quaglia and Visioni’s study finds one of the largest effects.</p>
<p>The literature suggests that sulfur dioxide’s effects are “in the range of 300ths to 800ths of a degree Celsius, but I don’t know that we can say that we're on the high or low end of that,” Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist who studies carbon removal technologies at the tech company Stripe, told me. Hausfather <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-low-sulphur-shipping-rules-are-affecting-global-warming/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has his own estimate</u></a> of how much shipping rules have affected the recent warming episode — about five hundredths of a degree Celsius — which he reached with Piers Forster, a climate physics professor at the University of Leeds.</p>
<p>The exact magnitude of the effect, though, might matter less than the fact that it happened at all. For Visioni, the results demonstrate that policymakers need to think more intentionally about the tradeoffs between cutting toxic air pollution emissions and losing the cooling effect those same toxic emissions produce. </p>
<p>Over the past few decades, humanity has gotten better at cutting toxic air pollution from power plants and industrial activities than previous climate models estimated. That means that, somewhat paradoxically, it might be more difficult to stay below the Paris Agreement’s 2 degrees C warming goal because the same levels of greenhouse gas emissions will now have a greater warming effect than they would have in 2015. </p>
<p>It’s time to <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/em/c3em00178d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>discuss this trade-off</u></a> frankly and head-on, he told me. That also means taking seriously — and beginning research — on the proposition that humanity may want to experiment with intentionally releasing some forms of aerosols to suppress the planet’s warming — something the international shipping community has historically been loath to do. </p>
<p>In 2013, a paper from Finnish researchers <a href="https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/12059/2013/acp-13-12059-2013.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested</u></a> that ships could retain the climate benefits of sulfur aerosol pollution — while mitigating most of their public health downsides — by burning clean fuels near the coasts, but dirtier fuel on the open ocean. Under that scenario, shipping emissions would actually have reflected even more heat than they did at the time. But the group downplayed that scenario in part because it was a potential form of geoengineering. </p>
<p>Is it? It’s not clear where the line of “intentionality” in geoengineering lies, Visioni said. If you stop doing something bad for the environment, but it has a warming effect on the climate, are you geoengineering? Or are you passing prudent environmental policy? The question of where geoengineering begins or ends gets harder and harder to adjudicate — especially while humanity conducts what is in essence <em><em>the largest and most important</em></em> <em><em>geo-engineering experiment possible </em></em>by burning fossil fuels and releasing billions of tons of greenhouse gas pollution into the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Visioni made a point to emphasize that he’s in favor of the IMO’s efforts to clean up shipping emissions. “Do we keep polluting? No. I think we should be forceful and say no,” he said.</p>
<p>“But on the other hand, my wish would be if we started discussions a bit more like, ‘Okay, so do we think that these [warming] thresholds are so important? And if so, are we willing to have a discussion about what we could do to prevent this warming from happening?”</p>
<p>Visioni’s paper is not the only new study that seeks to explain the warming blip. On Friday, a team of German researchers wrote in <em><em>Science </em></em>that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq7280?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--o9r8bM1weCrsevliYOiyF8dJuM3Agx61e6UBx02I0mkDchU8zUN9HBsZp3XiWEiizJAU4hVIrGax0RpInLJhyr60Aeg&_hsmi=337363203&utm_content=337363203&utm_source=hs_email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a recent and mysterious decline in low-altitude clouds</u></a> in the atmosphere has decreased the planet’s brightness. Clouds, like sulfur aerosol emissions, reflect heat back into space, and so their decline would also contribute to a warming surge.</p>
<p>They provide another piece of evidence that the surge in warming is caused by some fundamental change to the climate system and not by a multiu-seasonal hiccup like El Niño. “The big question that we have is: Is this a blip or not?” Hausfather said. “If we're in the world where El Nino is behaving weirdly, that’s kind of the comforting one, because it means we’ll go back to normal — <em><em>normal</em></em> here being a rapidly warming world. If the spike in warming over the past two years is due to natural variability, it means it will likely be shortlived.”</p>
<p>The more worrying possibility, he continued, is that something more fundamental has changed in the climate system. Climate scientists describe these shifts as a change in “radiative forcings,” meaning a change in the basic dynamics that force adjustments in the energy balance between the Earth, the Sun, and outer space. </p>
<p>“If this is a change in forcings — which clouds or aerosols would imply — then that change in forcing would likely persist. It would be a factor that continues affecting the climate in the future, rather than just a blip,” Hausfather said. </p>

## Poll: Most Americans want US leadership on global affairs, increased defense spending

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON  — A majority of Americans want the United States to lead on the global stage with a strong military, and a supermajority want to increase national defense spending, according to the latest Reagan National Defense Survey.


Despite Americans electing a president who ran on an "America First" agenda that focused on domestic issues ranging from the U.S. economy to securing the southern U.S. border, 57% of those surveyed said they wanted to see the U.S. more engaged and taking the lead on international events this year, compared with 42% a year ago.


Nearly 80% of Americans surveyed supported increased government spending on the U.S. military, a slight increase from last year. Increasing military spending ranked high above some of the other U.S. foreign policy priorities, such as promoting freedom abroad (61%) and providing foreign aid (43%).


"The Reagan National Defense Survey demonstrates yet again that Americans are not pacifists, and we are not isolationists. We want a federal government that serves American interests and protects our country," Bradley Bowman, a member of the survey's advisory board and the senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told VOA Friday.


The Ronald Reagan Institute has surveyed U.S. public opinion on national security for the past six years, and the latest poll, released Thursday, included a bipartisan sample of about 2,500 Americans who were surveyed two days after the November presidential election.


Most respondents said they supported continued U.S. security support for Ukraine and allowing Ukraine to fire U.S. weapons inside Russia, with nearly 60% believing the Russia-Ukraine conflict will end with Ukraine negotiating for peace, even if that means giving up some of its sovereign territory.


Ukraine support differed widely among voters for the Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Republican candidate, President-elect Donald Trump, with 74% of Harris voters in support of sending aid compared with 42% of Trump voters.


A supermajority (80%) sees Russia as an adversary.


On Israel, 54% of those surveyed supported continuing U.S. aid, but Americans were split 45% to 45% on whether Israel has a right to continue military action or Israel's military action in Gaza has gone on long enough and needs to transition to a ceasefire.


About half of those surveyed think the United States would prevail in a conflict with China, with nearly the same number finding China to be the greatest threat to the United States.


If China invaded Taiwan, nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said the U.S. should officially recognize Taiwan as an independent nation, with two-thirds agreeing that the U.S. should respond with economic sanctions against China and more than half supporting sending more military equipment to Taiwan (56%) and moving more military assets such as aircraft carriers into the region (58%).


Most Americans surveyed believe the U.S. military should be large enough to win two simultaneous wars.

## Trump taps forceful ally of hardline immigration policies to head Customs and Border Protection

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The picture of who will be in charge of executing President-elect Donald Trump's hardline immigration and border policies has come into sharper focus after he announced his picks to head Customs and Border Protection and also the agency tasked with deporting immigrants in the country illegally.


Trump said late Thursday he was tapping Rodney Scott, a former Border Patrol chief who has been a vocal supporter of tougher enforcement measures, for CBP commissioner.


As acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Trump said he'd nominate Caleb Vitello, a career ICE official with more than 23 years in the agency who most recently has been the assistant director for firearms and tactical programs.


They will work with an immigration leadership team that includes South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as head of the Homeland Security Department; former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement head Tom Homan as border czar; and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff.


Customs and Border Protection, with its roughly 60,000 employees, falls under the Homeland Security Department. It includes the Border Patrol, which Scott led during Trump's first term, and he essentially is responsible for protecting the country's borders while facilitating trade and travel.


Scott comes to the job firmly from the Border Patrol side of the house. He became an agent in 1992 and spent much of his career in San Diego. When he joined the agency, San Diego was by far the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. Traffic plummeted after the government dramatically increased enforcement there, but critics note the effort pushed people to remote parts of California and Arizona.


San Diego was also where wall construction began in the 1990s, which shaped Scott’s belief that barriers work. He was named San Diego sector chief in 2017.




When he was appointed head of the border agency in January 2020, he enthusiastically embraced Trump's policies.


“He’s well known. He does know these issues and obviously is trusted by the administration," said Gil Kerlikowske, the CBP commissioner under the Obama administration.


Kerlikowske took issue with some of Scott's past actions, including his refusal to fall in line with a Biden administration directive to stop using terms like “illegal alien” in favor of descriptions like “migrant,” and his decision as San Diego sector chief to fire tear gas into Mexico to disperse protesters.


“You don’t launch projectiles into a foreign country," Kerlikowske said.


At the time Scott defended the agents’ decisions, saying they were being assaulted by “a hail of rocks.”


While much of the focus of Trump's administration may be on illegal immigration and security along the U.S.-Mexico border, Kerlikowske also stressed the importance of other parts of Customs and Border Protection's mission.


The agency is responsible for securing trade and international travel at airports, ports and land crossings around the country. Whoever runs the agency has to make sure that billions of dollars' worth of trade and millions of passengers move swiftly and safely into and out of the country.


And if Trump makes good on promises to ratchet up tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada, CBP will play an integral role in enforcing them.


“There’s a huge amount of other responsibility on trade, on tourism, on cyber that take a significant amount of time and have a huge impact on the economy if it’s not done right," Kerlikowske said.


After being forced out under the Biden administration, Scott has been a vocal supporter of Trump's hardline immigration agenda. He has appeared frequently on Fox News and testified in Congress. He's also a senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.


In a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, he advocated for a return to Trump-era immigration policies and more pressure on Mexico to enforce immigration on its side of the border.

## Trump offers public show of support for Hegseth, his embattled choice to lead Pentagon

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday offered a public show of support for Pete Hegseth, his embattled choice to lead the Defense Department, whose confirmation by the Senate is in doubt as he faces questions over allegations of excessive drinking, sexual assault and his views on women in combat.


“Pete Hegseth is doing very well,” Trump posted on his social media site. “He will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense." The president added that "Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!”


Hegseth, a former Fox News host, Army National Guard major and combat veteran, spent much of the week on Capitol Hill trying to salvage his Cabinet nomination and reassure Republican senators that he is fit to lead Trump’s Pentagon.


The effort has quickly become a test of Trump’s clout and of how far loyalty for the president-elect goes with Republican senators who have concerns about his nominees. Trump has already met some resistance. Two of his other choices have stepped aside as they faced intense scrutiny: former Congressman Matt Gaetz, his first choice for attorney general; and Chad Chronister, a Florida sheriff who was Trump’s first choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration.


Vice President-elect JD Vance also made a show of support for Hegseth on Friday, part of a full-court press by members of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement.


“If you’re a GOP Senator who voted for Lloyd Austin, but criticize @PeteHegseth, then maybe you’re in the wrong political party!” Vance wrote on X.


Hegseth has promised not to drink on the job and told lawmakers he never engaged in sexual misconduct, even as his professional views on female troops have also come under intensifying scrutiny. He said as recently as last month that women “straight up” should not serve in combat.


Two female senators, Republican Joni Ernst of Iowa and Democrat Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, sit on the Armed Services Committee. Both are combat veterans who served in the Iraq war, and Duckworth lost both legs when a Blackhawk helicopter she was piloting was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.


Ernst, who is also a sexual assault survivor, stopped short of an endorsement after her meeting with Hegseth this week. She said she appreciates his military service and they “had a frank and thorough conversation.”


Hegseth has yet to meet with Duckworth.


Trump's transition team has been looking at potential replacements if Hegseth's nomination cannot move forward, including former Trump rival Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.


DeSantis plans to attend the Army-Navy football game with Trump on December 14, according to a person familiar with the Florida governor’s plans who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss them before a public announcement.


DeSantis and Trump spoke about the defense secretary post when they saw each other Tuesday at a memorial service for sheriff's deputies in West Palm Beach, Florida, according to people familiar with the matter who said Trump was interested in DeSantis for the post, and the governor was receptive.


DeSantis also is poised to select a replacement for the expected Senate vacancy to be created by Marco Rubio becoming secretary of state, and Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump is seen as the preferred choice by those in Trump’s orbit.


Hegseth is facing resistance from lawmakers as reports have emerged about his past, including the revelation that he made a settlement payment after being accused of a sexual assault that he denies.


The New Yorker magazine cited what it described as a whistleblower report and other documents about his time leading a veterans advocacy group, Concerned Veterans for America, that alleged multiple incidents of alcohol intoxication at work events, inappropriate behavior around female staffers and financial mismanagement.


The New York Times obtained an email from his mother, Penelope, from 2018, in which she confronted him about mistreating women after he impregnated his current wife while he was married to his second wife. She went on “Fox & Friends” this week to defend her son.

## Federal appeals court upholds law requiring sale or ban of TikTok in US

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

A federal appeals court panel on Friday upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in a few short months, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S. 


The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the law, which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January, is constitutional, rebuffing TikTok’s challenge that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and unfairly targeted the platform. 


“The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,” said the court's opinion. “Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States.” 


TikTok and ByteDance — another plaintiff in the lawsuit — are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term and whose Justice Department would have to enforce the law, said during the presidential campaign that he is now against a TikTok ban and would work to “save” the social media platform. 


The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, culminated a years-long saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat because of its connections to China. 


The U.S. has said it’s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect. 


However, a significant portion of the government’s information in the case has been redacted and hidden from the public as well as the two companies. 


TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn’t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing’s benefit in the U.S. 


They also have argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government. 


Friday's ruling came after the appeals court panel heard oral arguments in September. 


Some legal experts said at the time that it was challenging to read the tea leaves on how the judges would rule. 


In a court hearing that lasted more than two hours, the panel — composed of two Republican and one Democrat appointed judges — appeared to grapple with how TikTok’s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. 


The judges pressed Daniel Tenny, a Justice Department attorney, on the implications the case could have on the First Amendment. But they also expressed some skepticism at TikTok’s arguments, challenging the company’s attorney — Andrew Pincus —on whether any First Amendment rights preclude the government from curtailing a powerful company subject to the laws and influence of a foreign adversary. 


In parts of their questions about TikTok’s ownership, the judges cited wartime precedent that allows the U.S. to restrict foreign ownership of broadcast licenses and asked if the arguments presented by TikTok would apply if the U.S. was engaged in war. 


To assuage concerns about the company’s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data. 


The company also argues the government’s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient. 


Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it’s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm — the platform’s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan — would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content. 


Still, some investors, including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok’s U.S. business. 


This week, a spokesperson for McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. 


TikTok’s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators — for which the company is covering legal costs — as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. 


If TikTok appeals and the courts continue to uphold the law, it would fall on Trump’s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The penalties would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services that would be barred from supporting it.

## US rebounds, adds 227,000 jobs in November

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — America’s job market rebounded in November, adding 227,000 workers in a solid recovery from the previous month, when the effects of strikes and hurricanes sharply diminished employers’ payrolls.


Last month’s hiring growth was up considerably from a meager gain of 36,000 jobs in October. The government also revised up its estimate of job growth in September and October by a combined 56,000.


Friday’s report from the Labor Department also showed that the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.1% in October to a still-low 4.2%. Hourly wages rose 0.4% from October to November and 4% from a year earlier — both solid figures and slightly higher than forecasters had expected.


The November employment report provided the latest evidence that the U.S. job market remains durable even though it has lost significant momentum from the 2021-2023 hiring boom, when the economy was rebounding from the pandemic recession. The job market’s gradual slowdown is, in part, a result of the high interest rates the Federal Reserve engineered in its drive to tame inflation.


The Fed jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Defying predictions, the economy kept growing despite much higher borrowing rates for consumers and businesses. But since early this year, the job market has been slowing.


Thomas Simons, U.S. economist at Jefferies, wrote in a commentary that the recovery from October’s strikes and hurricanes likely increased last month's payrolls by 60,000, suggesting that the job market is strong enough to absorb most jobseekers but not enough to raise worries about inflation.


Across industries last month, manufacturing companies added 22,000 jobs, reflecting the end of strikes at Boeing and elsewhere. Health care companies added 54,000 jobs, government agencies 33,000, and bars and restaurants 29,000. But retailers shed 28,000 jobs in November.


Americans have been enjoying unusual job security. This week, the government reported that layoffs fell to 1.6 million in October, below the lowest levels in the two decades that preceded the pandemic. At the same time, the number of job openings rebounded from a 3½-year low, a sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has cooled.


The overall economy has remained resilient. The much higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses that resulted from the Fed’s rate hikes had been expected to tip the economy into a recession. Instead, the economy kept growing as households continued to spend and employers continued to hire.


The economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace from July through September on healthy spending by consumers. Annual economic growth has topped a decent 2% in eight of the past nine quarters. And inflation has dropped from a 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 2.6% last month.

## Police think gunman who killed UnitedHealthcare's CEO left NYC on bus

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The gunman who killed the CEO of the largest U.S. health insurer three days ago may have quickly left New York City on a bus after escaping on a bicycle and hopping in a cab, police officials said Friday. 


Video of the gunman fleeing Wednesday's shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson showed him riding through Central Park and later taking a taxi to a bus terminal, directly across from New Jersey, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told CNN. 


Police have video of the man entering the bus station but no video of him exiting, leading them to believe he left the city, Kenny said. "It's a very busy bus terminal, we want to make sure we have the right bus. But we're working through that right now, this is all new information," he said. 


Investigators also believe the shooter left his backpack in Central Park and were carrying out a massive sweep to find it, said police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. 


The reason for the killing remains unknown. New York City police say evidence firmly points to it being a targeted attack. 


The gunman who carried out the brazen ambush made sure to conceal his identity with a mask during the shooting yet left a trail of evidence in view of the nation's biggest city and its network of security cameras.




A law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Friday that surveillance footage shows the suspect riding the subway and visiting establishments in Manhattan, providing more clues about his actions in the days before the ambush. 


Investigators believe the suspect may have traveled to New York last month on a bus that originated in Atlanta, according to the law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. 


Once in New York, he appeared to pay with cash in any establishment where he was captured on camera, the official said. 


Investigators have tested a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper in a hunt for his DNA. They also were trying to obtain additional information from a cellphone recovered from a pedestrian plaza where the gunman fled after shooting Thompson outside his company's annual investor conference at a hotel just blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center. 


Police have released photos of the suspected shooter that were taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The images, showing an unmasked man smiling in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel, add to a collection of photos and video circulated since the shooting — including footage of the attack itself, as well as images of the suspected gunman stopping at a Starbucks beforehand.




Surveillance images from the shooting show the man wearing a hooded jacket and a mask that concealed most of his face — a look that would not have attracted attention on a chilly morning. 


Investigators have learned the man lowered his mask at the front desk of the hostel because he was flirting with the woman who checked him in, the law enforcement official told the AP, leading to a photo of his face. The woman told investigators that during that encounter she asked to see his smile and he pulled down his mask, the official said. 


Investigators believe the suspect used a fake New Jersey identification card, the official said, when he checked in at the hostel, which has a café along with shared and private rooms and is blocks from Columbia University. 


Investigators believe the shooter had at least some firearms training and experience with guns, the official said. 


Security video shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk. 


The words "deny," "defend" and "depose" were scrawled on the ammunition, two law enforcement officials told the AP on Thursday. The messages mirror the phrase "delay, deny, defend," which is commonly used by lawyers and critics about insurers that delay payments, deny claims and defend their actions. 


Thompson, a father of two sons who lived in a Minneapolis suburb, had been with Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years. 


The insurer's parent company, UnitedHealth Group Inc., was holding its annual meeting in New York for investors. The company abruptly ended the conference after Thompson's death. 




UnitedHealth Group said it was focused on supporting Thompson's family, ensuring the safety of employees and assisting investigators. "While our hearts are broken, we have been touched by the huge outpouring," the company said. 


UnitedHealthcare provides coverage for more than 49 million Americans. It manages health insurance coverage for employers and state and federally funded Medicaid programs. 


In October, UnitedHealthcare was named along with Humana and CVS in a Senate report detailing how its denial rate for prior authorizations for some Medicare Advantage patients has surged in recent years. 


The shooting has shaken corporate America and the health insurance industry in particular, causing companies to reevaluate security plans and delete photos of executives from their websites. A different Minnesota-based health care company said Friday it was temporarily closing its offices out of an abundance of caution, telling employees to work from home.

About a third of that land would be in Nevada. But the state’s rural county governments have no authority over federal lands, and most of the state’s territory overall is under control of BLM. This means their ordinances are relatively toothless, county officials say, not to mention they get less revenue from solar farms. Nevada’s Republican Governor Joe Lombardo has therefore asked BLM to cancel the plan. “Opposition from Nevada means that if there’s a way to unravel the programmatic solar plan when Donald Trump takes office in January, there’ll be a will,” Holzman wrote. <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/nevada-joe-lombardo-blm-solar?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_MaXLS1sCGAWWcEE0QpVr7BAJwsMbXuFnD8ArswTP83Pr8MnbbDvzwVptCPabn64R0cuhn" rel="noopener" target="_self">Read more here</a>.</p><h3>2. Decrease in cloud cover linked to rising global temperatures</h3><p>For the last two years or so, climate scientists have been puzzled by the exceptional warmth seen across the planet, because it exceeds their models. But new research points to a possible explanation: fewer clouds. The <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq7280?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_MaXLS1sCGAWWcEE0QpVr7BAJwsMbXuFnD8ArswTP83Pr8MnbbDvzwVptCPabn64R0cuhn" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>, published in the journal <em><em>Science</em></em>, found that 2023 saw “a reduced low-cloud cover in the northern mid-latitudes and tropics,” and especially over the Atlantic. Since clouds help the Earth reflect solar radiation back into space, fewer clouds means more radiation and – you guessed it – more heat. Why might the clouds be disappearing? The scientists say several factors could be at play, including the El Niño weather pattern, and a rapid decline in sulfate aerosol emissions from the shipping industry.

## The EVs to Get Excited About in 2025

Yes, the election’s fallout will no doubt reshape the car market in the years to come. But in the short term, there’s good news in the form of the new slate of EVs already in the pipeline. For those looking to ditch their fossil fuel-burner for an electric model, there’s plenty to be excited about in 2025.</p><h3>A Slate of Shiny New Crossovers</h3><p>Having long since displaced the minivan and the sedan as America’s family car, the crossover is the most important piece of the electric car market, and the biggest seller. Next year, we’ll welcome a slew of new models.</p><p>Hyundai’s Ioniq EVs have been a hit, with the hatchback/crossover hybrid Ioniq 5 selling impressive numbers (more than 30,000 in the first three quarters of 2024) and the quirky Ioniq 6 sedan earning rave reviews. The Korean brand will be filling out more Ioniq numbers in the years to come, and 2025’s major arrival in terms of size and importance is the three-row <strong>Ioniq 9</strong> SUV. The sharp-looking big boy joins the EV9 by Hyundai’s partner brand, Kia, in offering a more affordable EV for those who need to move six or seven people at a time.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

That model’s 204-mile range looks puny and outdated by today’s standards, however. Next year, Audi is slated to roll out a much-anticipated update to the lineup with the <strong>Q6 e-tron</strong> (and its A6 e-tron sedan counterpart) delivering a respectable 350 miles of battery power. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

The story is similar at Polestar, where the upcoming <strong>Polestar 3</strong> SUV looks like an expanded version of the Polestar 2 sedan that’s been on sale for several years now.</p><p>Remember Chrysler? The erstwhile member of Detroit’s Big Three had withered to a brand that, in the U.S., sells only minivans and the obsolete 300 sedan.

## Trump picks former Senator David Perdue as ambassador to China

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he has chosen former Senator David Perdue to be ambassador to China, tapping a former politician with business experience to help steer relations riven by deep mistrust and trade tensions. 


"He will be instrumental in implementing my strategy to maintain Peace in the region, and a productive working relationship with China's leaders," Trump said in a post on Thursday on his social media platform Truth Social. 


Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he will impose an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing does more to stop the trafficking of the highly addictive narcotic fentanyl. 


He also threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods while on the campaign trail. 


Perdue, a Republican from Georgia who served in the Senate from 2015-2021, previously lived in Hong Kong during a 40-year career as a business executive. 


His nomination marks a return to the frequent practice over recent decades of sending former politicians to the U.S. embassy in Beijing, after President Joe Biden tapped veteran career diplomat Nicholas Burns in 2021. 


Perdue posted on X that he understood the gravity of the ambassadorship and looked forward to "implementing President Trump's strategy." He also said he appreciated how Burns had represented U.S. interests in the job, who in turn on the social media site wished Perdue "every success."  


Democrats in the U.S. have complained that in his career as a business executive, including at sporting goods company Reebok, Perdue relied on outsourcing American manufacturing jobs to Asia, a practice Trump has railed against and vowed to end.  


Trump has nominated China hardliners for other senior roles in his administration, including Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, in a signal his policy toward the United States' main strategic rival could go beyond trade measures. 


In his first term as president, Trump named former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad as his ambassador to China. Branstad sought to leverage his ties with Chinese officials, including with Xi Jinping before he became China's top leader, to help navigate trade tensions. But the two sides still plunged headlong into an unprecedented trade war. 


China's Foreign Ministry said at a regular briefing in Beijing that it had "noted the reports" of Perdue's nomination, but did not elaborate.  


The role Trump's ambassador will play in fraught U.S.-China relations remains to be seen. Some analysts say Beijing is likely to seek direct presidential or high-level engagement with Trump and his closest advisers, in order to navigate the potential escalation of trade tensions.

## Biden lights National Christmas Tree

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris attended the annual National Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony Thursday night on the Ellipse, south of the White House.


"During this season of reflection," Biden said, "may we continue to seek the light of liberty and love, kindness and compassion, dignity and decency."


The president said the event is a favorite of his wife's and that she was sorry to miss this year's event. First lady Jill Biden is in Qatar for her initiative on women's health.


Country singing star Mickey Guyton hosted this year's event.




The tree lighting was launched in 1923 when first lady Grace Coolidge allowed the District of Columbia Public Schools to erect a 48-foot balsam fir on the Ellipse. Three thousand people attended the ceremony that year when President Calvin Coolidge lit the tree, which came from Middlebury College in Vermont.


This year's tree, a 30-foot red spruce from Virginia, is anchored by steel cables after strong winds blew over last year's tree.


Americans from every U.S. state and territory and the District of Columbia create the one-of-a-kind ornaments that adorn the tree as it glows with thousands of lights.


Trisha Yearwood, James Taylor, Stephen Sanchez and Trombone Shorty were among the musical guests who performed at this year's holiday event.


The show will be broadcast on December 20 on CBS-TV.

## Iran more comfortable with nuclear saber-rattling, US intelligence warns

date: 2024-12-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Iran is likely to respond to new attacks from Israel or additional Western sanctions by edging ever closer to crossing the nuclear threshold, according to a just-released U.S. intelligence assessment.


The unclassified report, issued Thursday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, finds that while Tehran is not currently poised to build a nuclear weapon, it is undertaking activities "that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses."


The report states that since July, Iran has continued to increase its stockpiles of 20% and 60% enriched uranium while also manufacturing and operating a growing number of advanced centrifuges.


The U.S. intelligence assessment further warns that Iranian officials have been increasingly willing to "publicly discuss the utility of nuclear weapons."


"Tehran has the infrastructure and experience to quickly produce weapons-grade uranium at multiple underground facilities, if it so chooses," the report says. "Iranian leaders recognize that this bolsters the credibility of threats to develop nuclear weapons."


The ODNI report estimates that Iran's existing stockpiles of enriched uranium far exceed what it needs for civilian purposes and that Tehran could build "more than a dozen nuclear weapons if its total uranium stockpile were further enriched."


A U.S. intelligence assessment of Iran's capabilities issued this past July similarly said that officials in Tehran were becoming more comfortable talking about the use of nuclear weapons.


But the new report suggests Tehran is now prepared to push back against Western pressure, attacks or other threats with more nuclear activity.


"Iran probably will consider installing or operating more advanced centrifuges, further increasing its enriched uranium stockpile, enriching uranium up to 90 percent, or threatening to withdraw from the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons," according to the latest ODNI assessment.


U.S. officials have previously warned that Tehran could produce a nuclear warhead in as little as one to two weeks, though they have also said the Pentagon has options to stop an Iranian nuclear breakout.




The Iranian mission at the United Nations has yet to respond to a request for comment.


U.S. intelligence analysts say that their concerns extend beyond nuclear weapons to include Iran's ballistic missile and drone capabilities.


The U.S. assessment says Iran "almost certainly is incorporating lessons learned from its missile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attack against Israel in April and from Russia's operational use of Iranian UAVs against Ukraine."


U.S. intelligence additionally "expects Tehran will incorporate performance data from the close-range ballistic missiles it transferred to Russia once they are used in operational conditions."


And help from Russia could also boost Iran's work on multiple space-launch missiles, possibly shortening the timeline for Tehran to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, the ODNI report warns.


A second unclassified intelligence report released Thursday detailed additional Iranian support for Moscow.


Iran "probably is training and assisting Russian soldiers in UAV [drone] operations," it said, adding, "Moscow and Tehran also have agreed to establish a joint production line in Russia for lethal UAVs."

## Cyclical, secular, seasonal

date: 2024-12-06, from: Market Place

<p>Federal employment numbers come out Friday, so we&#8217;ve got a labor-packed episode. First up, job growth in evergreen or &#8220;secular&#8221; industries is strong (think health care) while cyclical jobs (think manufacturing) have been stagnant. Then, wage gains are outpacing inflation, but some workers aren&#8217;t feelin&#8217; it. We&#8217;ll also hear from seasonal employees in Vermont and a mall manager in Montana who&#8217;s moving on.</p>

## Emerging anti-US axis worrisome but 'not acting as a bloc'

date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Washington's most dangerous adversaries may be working together more closely than ever before, but U.S. intelligence analysts think that for now, they are falling short of forming a tight-knit alliance that could more effectively counter the United States.


Concerns among the United States and its allies about growing cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have been increasing steadily since Moscow launched its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine — sustained by intelligence showing Beijing, Tehran and Pyongyang providing Russia with technology, missiles, drones and even troops for the war effort.


The former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific earlier this year went as far as to describe the growing ties between the four U.S. adversaries as a nascent "axis of evil."




Yet U.S. intelligence officials believe the axis, in some ways, has been bogged down by its own shortcomings.


"They're not acting as a bloc," said Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, speaking Thursday in Washington at the Council on Foreign Relations.


"We don't see them as a sort of four-part alliance or something along those lines," she said. "We don't see them likely as becoming allies in the same way that we are allies with our NATO partners, for example — that kind of level of interoperability and military collaboration."


U.S. intelligence analysts, however, still see the axis as a concern on several fronts.


Haines said the increased cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea has contributed to a further erosion of international norms around weapons of mass destruction.


Where Russia and China were once more willing to cooperate with the United States and the West on nuclear counterproliferation, Moscow and Beijing now seem more inclined to give Iran and North Korea additional leeway.


"In large part, that's because Russia is now beholden to some extent to both the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] and to Iran for advanced weapons, for ammunition, for things that they need in the context of their fight with Ukraine," Haines said.


"They're less likely to push back," she said. "And of course, we've been watching the degree to which they actually, for example, accept DPRK as a nuclear weapon power."


Haines said the increased cooperation among Russia, China, Iran and North Korea has helped all four countries to evade sanctions.


And she said there are even some indications that Russia is willing to take action that would allow Beijing to surpass the U.S. in critical areas.


"They're willing to potentially put more on the table with China to give them things that could actually make China sort of leapfrog in certain technology areas or in other spaces that are of concern to us," Haines said.


Washington's NATO allies have sounded similar alarms in recent months, with some NATO officials telling VOA the axis has already sparked the beginnings of a new global arms race.




Russian sabotage


There are also ongoing concerns about the willingness of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea to engage in so-called gray zone activity.


A declassified U.S. National Intelligence Estimate issued in July warned that the next five to six years are "likely to feature more frequent, diverse and damaging acts of coercion and subversion — particularly by China, Iran, Russia and North Korea — below what constitutes armed conflict but outside the bounds of historically legitimate statecraft."


Haines on Thursday said Russian gray zone activities — including efforts at sabotage in Europe — have been "increasing across the board."


"Russia has just invested money, personnel, just an extraordinary amount of effort in this area and just will continue to do so," she said. "And even though we are getting a little better at disrupting some of this activity, we're certainly not, I think, where it makes anybody really comfortable."


US presidential transition


U.S. intelligence analysts are keeping a close watch on how other countries are behaving as Washington prepares for President-elect Donald Trump to take office in January.


"There are certain actors that are trying to pre-position themselves for a next administration," Haines said.


She said intelligence analysts are preparing reports on the activity to share with the incoming Trump administration, as well as keeping an eye out for the potential that some countries may seek to escalate tensions during the transition period.


"Typically, for example, the DPRK engages in some provocative action during transitions," Haines said. "This is sort of one of the classic things we're constantly looking at."

## Biden Has Just 7 Weeks to Secure His Conservation Legacy

date: 2024-12-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTE1NDY1Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MjYzMjE5OX0.p39dZgFg_THr0ZzElUePE-ucZwxHNDjbuqRFe5kU0LA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Over the course of a presidential term, a mature ironwood tree will add only about four inches to its height. Unless you happen to see one during the 10 or 12 days in May that pale pink flowers cover its branches, it’s not a shrub you’re likely to call one of the Sonoran Desert’s most attractive flora — gnarled and hunched, the ironwood lacks both the alien charm of the Joshua tree and the iconic flamboyance of the Saguaro cactus. It makes up for this with its longevity: Some ironwoods growing in the hills east of the Coachella Valley have clung there 400 years longer than California has been a state. Adequately protected, those very same trees could plausibly still be standing for our successors to marvel at in the year 2724 — 175 presidential terms from now.</p><p>Who knows if they’ll still talk about President Joe Biden then — in 700 years, he’ll be as deep in the past as Edward II of England is now. But if those ironwood trees are still standing, it could be because of him. Biden has called the fight against climate change <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-climate-action-amazon-rainforest/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the defining cause of his presidency</u></a>, and he views conservation and the preservation of biodiversity as part and parcel of that legacy. His 30x30 executive order — which aims to set aside 30% of America’s lands and waters for conservation by 2030 — was a week-one priority once he took office. </p><p>Among his best remaining opportunities to add to his tally would be the designation of Chuckwalla National Monument, a 660,000-acre stretch of desert south of Joshua Tree National Park that is home to one-fifth of the ironwood trees left in the world. The same goes for a sacred and culturally significant region in the southwest corner of California called Kw’tsán; about Sáttítla, a vulnerable volcanic landscape near Mt. Shasta; about the Owyhee, a million-acre Oregon watershed that <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/owyhee-canyonlands-monument-biden" target="_self"><u>sits in the crosshairs</u></a> of mining and energy development; and about the homestead in Maine that belonged to Frances Perkins, the first woman to serve in the U.S. cabinet. The list goes on.</p><p>But with less than two months until Biden’s move-out day, environmental advocates are starting to wonder whether he’ll ever get around to fulfilling his promise. </p><p>“There are still several national monument campaigns that are ready to go and awaiting the president’s signature, and those are the sorts of things that could cement President Biden’s legacy as one of the great conservation presidents of all time — <em><em>if</em></em> he takes those steps here in the last few weeks,” Aaron Weiss, the deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, a nonpartisan conservation advocacy group, told me.</p><p>When Biden took office in 2021, roughly 293 million acres of the United States fell under the protection of various federal laws, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/10/land-water-conservation-biden-environment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about 12% of his 30% goal</u></a>. Since then, Biden has set aside another 1%, or 37 million acres, for protection, including about 1.6 million acres of new monuments under the Antiquities Act. So far, Biden has protected slightly less land than President Bill Clinton did in his first term, per the Center for Western Priorities’ <a href="https://westernpriorities.org/2024/06/president-biden-is-less-than-100000-acres-away-from-setting-a-conservation-record/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accounting</u></a>. And every day that passes matters; the Center for American Progress has found that the U.S. loses a football field’s worth of natural area every 30 seconds. </p><p>Still, conservationists have celebrated Biden’s moves to set aside the National Petroleum Reserve and the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, and to expand Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument and San Gabriel Mountains National Monument in California. “When you look at it from a traditional land protection perspective, I think [the Biden administration has] a strong record,” Chris Wood, the president and chief executive officer of the conservation group Trout Unlimited, told me. </p><p>And Mustafa Santiago Ali, the executive vice president of the National Wildlife Federation, also told me not to discount Biden’s designation of the Springfield 1908 Race Riot National Monument in Illinois, the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument in Illinois and Mississippi, and Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni — Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument in Arizona, even though they don’t add substantial acreage to his totals. “Folks may not pay attention to how important those monuments are — honoring folks who have sacrificed in the past,” Ali said. Weiss, likewise, commended Biden and Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland for “acknowledging that you need Indigenous stewardship to lead and be central to all public land management decisions.”</p><p>As the remaining weeks of Biden’s tenure quietly tick by, there is increasing anxiety about whether and when the president will reach for the Antiquities Act again. Kristen Brengel, the senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association, told me she hopes Biden will announce at least two more national monuments between now and January 20.</p><p>Ultimately, though, when it comes to the question of how much land Biden will choose to set aside in the waning days of his administration, “the limiting factor is time,” Ryan Houston, the executive director of the Oregon Natural Desert Association, which has campaigned extensively for the designation of an Owyhee National Monument, told me. “If we don't take action before Inauguration Day in January, then we’re entering at least a two-, four-, or six-year period where there won’t be opportunities to follow through and protect the Owyhee,” Houston went on. “And that sets us back a long way.”</p><p>Organizers don’t get a tip-off ahead of time about where or what the Biden administration is considering. Chuckwalla, with its ironwood trees, rare reptiles, cultural sites, and Joshua Tree-adjacent wildlife corridors, <em>seems</em> likely — Haaland visited it this spring, a portentous sign according to advocates. Other would-be monuments like the Owyhee in Oregon are less certain and may attract executive attention only if Congress fails to roll it into <a href="https://www.outdooralliance.org/blog/2024/eoy-land-package" target="_blank"><u>a public lands omnibus</u></a> bill expected by the end of the year.</p><p><span></span>The clock has already run out for other key components of Biden’s conservation legacy. “In the first month of his presidency, it seemed like it would be great,” Brendan Cummings, the conservation director of the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit focused on endangered species protections, told me. With the president’s 30x30 executive order and his pause on federal fossil fuel leasing, it’d “seemed like he was going to live up to his promises.” </p><p>Then came <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climate-president-bomb-biden-willow" target="_self"><u>the Willow Project approval</u></a>, new <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-administration-approves-more-exports-major-us-lng-terminals-2022-03-16/" target="_blank"><u>LNG export terminal sign-offs</u></a>, and so many new oil and gas permits that <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/01/30/biden-administration-oil-drilling-permits-outpace-trump-ee-00138376" target="_blank"><u>Biden surpassed even Trump</u></a>. “One of the few areas where Biden has actually been excellent is national monuments,” Cummings conceded. “But everything else is sort of this mix of muddled middle or profoundly disappointing.” He added, “Trump took us two steps back, and Biden took us one step forward — so we’re still behind at the end of the day.”</p><p>Though the other advocates I spoke with for this story weren’t as sour on Biden’s record as Cummings, many had a wishlist of items they’d hoped Biden would address. Brengel of the NPCA had hoped there’d be more climate resiliency funding for the National Parks, which have “been on the frontlines of dealing with some of the most dramatic effects of climate change.” Wood, at Trout Unlimited, was holding out for the creation of a federal fund to deal with the legacy of abandoned mines via a royalty on hard rock metals, the only commodity produced from public lands that <em><em>doesn’t</em></em> have a surcharge or tax. Weiss of Western Priorities wanted to see action on livestock grazing reforms.</p><p>It’s hard to feel <em><em>too</em></em> frustrated with the Biden administration, though. Much of 2021 and 2022 were spent addressing Trump administration policies and roll-backs, including restoring protections for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments. Biden’s executive powers had their limits, too. While one of his administration’s conservation wins had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/02/climate/chaco-canyon-biden-protection.html" target="_blank"><u>blocking the culturally significant lands around New Mexico’s Chaco Canyon</u></a> from new oil and gas leasing, Trump will have a relatively straightforward path <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a26098301/trump-interior-chaco-culture-national-historical-park-oil-gas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to reopening it</u></a> to drilling if he so chooses. “I think with the cards that we had in our hands, Deb Haaland and Biden have done everything they could do to protect this area,” Paul F. Reed, a preservation archaeologist with Archaeology Southwest, which campaigned to protect Chaco Canyon, told me. But “short of congressional action, this area will continue to be a political football.” The same may again be true for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante.</p><p>There is <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-e17-kristina-costa" target="_self"><u>better Trump-proofing</u></a> elsewhere. Jenny Rowland-Shea, the director of public lands at the left-leaning advocacy group the Center for American Progress, told me that for Trump to unwind Biden’s protections in the Arctic, which were <a href="https://foe.org/news/conservation-rule-arctic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>established via a lengthier rule-making process</u></a>, the incoming president would have to prove that the science behind the ecology subsistence isn’t valid — a bigger lift. It’s part of why she feels comfortable calling Biden’s actions in the Arctic one of the more significant pieces of his conservation legacy.</p><p>Others pointed to the Bureau of Land Management’s <a href="https://www.blm.gov/public-lands-rule" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Public Lands Rule</u></a>, which put conservation <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-boosts-conservation-in-blm-public-lands-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on equal footing</u></a> with other land uses like drilling this past spring, as the real gift that Biden leaves behind. Wood, of Trout Unlimited, told me that what he hopes will outlast the 46th president is Biden’s approach to looking at conservation as a part of natural resiliency, the effort to “make our lands more resistant to floods, fires, and drought.” Meanwhile, Ali of NWF told me his wish is that future presidents will use Biden’s accomplishments as a “north star” to measure themselves against and surpass.</p><p>But Cummings of the Center for Biological Diversity believes there is only one way for Biden to cement his legacy in the remaining weeks he has in office. “Almost everything the president does gets forgotten,” he said. “But the land that a president protects is forever.”</p>

## At America’s oldest pet cemetery, humans spend eternity with faithful companions

date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA

HARTSDALE, NEW YORK — On most days, Mark Lindenberg either drives by or walks over to visit with Boots, his beloved pet cat who died in August 2020 at the age of 17. The New York man had his black-and-white tuxedo cat buried at the Hartsdale Pet Cemetery, a picturesque spot with rolling, grassy hills near the main road.


The epitaph on Boots’ tombstone reads, “You taught me how to love and be loved.”


Other tombstones are engraved with phrases such as “A truer friend we never had” and “Our beloved queen.”


“Human cemeteries are sad,” Lindenberg says. “This is one of the most cheerful places. When you look at the love that goes behind every plot here — the sayings, the toys, the pinwheels — it's just, I can't think of a better place.”




Hartsdale is America’s oldest working pet cemetery and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Lindenberg says he paid about $7,000 to bury Boots at Hartsdale. Those costs include the plot, casket, tombstone, burial and site maintenance in perpetuity.


“What have I worked for if I'm not going to do the things that matter most, and this mattered most,” Lindenberg says. “I got instant closure the day I decided I was going to bury her here.”


Pet burials started in Hartsdale in 1896 when veterinarian Samuel Johnson allowed a client to bury her dog in his apple orchard, a hillside spot located about 30 kilometers north of New York City. Since then, about 70,000 animals have been laid to rest in the 2-hectare cemetery. Most of the pets buried at Hartsdale are cats and dogs, but there are a few more exotic animals.




“There's reptiles that are buried here. Mice,” says Edward Martin III, vice president of the Hartsdale Pet Cemetery. “There's a lion cub that was buried here in 1912 by a Russian princess. There's the ashes of Ming, who's a Bengal tiger that was buried here a few years ago. There are some monkeys.”


There’s also Hudson the horse, some birds and singer Mariah Carey’s cat, Clarence. The oldest headstone, dating to 1898, commemorates the life of a dog named Blague.


Martin runs the place alongside his father, Edward Martin Jr., who purchased the cemetery in 1974. The younger Martin is a lawyer and certified public accountant, who eventually opted to help oversee the cemetery, where he once worked as a teenager.


“I've seen what people go through, and they lose their pets, and I feel like I'm in a good position where I can help them,” he says. “And I have helped them, and it makes me want to continue helping them.”




Between 250 and 300 burials are conducted at Hartsdale each year. The cemetery never runs out of space because not all of the graves are permanent. People can pay a one-time forever maintenance fee of $3,500 or an annual fee of $105. If the annual fee stops being paid, that gravesite is eventually offered for sale.


“The pet in the grave will be removed from that plot so someone else who wants it can pay the maintenance. And the pets are taken out, and they're cremated, and they don't leave the cemetery,” says Martin Jr., Hartsdale’s president. “Their remains are scattered over the cemetery grass.”


A centerpiece at the cemetery is the war dog memorial at the top of a hill. Unveiled in 1923, the monument was originally dedicated to World War I service dogs. But these days, the memorial honors service dogs of all kinds.




Although Hartsdale is primarily a resting place for animals, the cremated remains of about 800 humans are buried here with their pets. There’s even a Martin family plot, where the elder Martin plans to eventually be laid to rest with other relatives.


“I have to be buried somewhere. And why would I go to any place other than this?” he says. “My mother and father, and my mother-in-law or father-in-law are buried here, and so, that's a good reason by itself to do it.”


Lindenberg also likes the idea. He has already arranged to be cremated and buried alongside Boots when the time comes.


“I'm single. I don't know if I'll ever get married, and I can't think of a better place,” he says. “I lived with my cat every day for almost 17 years. Why stop now?”


In the meantime, Lindenberg, who lives a 10-minute walk away, will continue to visit his old friend almost daily.

## The Mad Dash to Lock Down Biden’s Final Climate Dollars

date: 2024-12-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTE0MjgxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzY0MTUwMX0.UgP0XIbU9dHODnqQV8U1KV467ug2DRX4JLATkZ5644Q/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>Of the over $13 billion in loans and loan guarantees that the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office has made under Biden, nearly a third of that funding has been doled out in the month since the presidential election. And of the $41 billion in conditional commitments — agreements to provide a loan once the borrower satisfies certain preconditions — that proportion rises to nearly half. That includes some of the largest funding announcements in the office’s history: more than <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-starplus-energy-construct-lithium-ion-battery" target="_blank"><u>$7.5 billion to StarPlus Energy</u></a> for battery manufacturing, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-grain-belt-express-construct-high-voltage-direct" target="_blank"><u>$4.9 billion to Grain Belt Express</u></a> for a transmission project, and nearly <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-rivian-support-construction-ev-manufacturing" target="_blank"><u>$6.6 billion to the electric vehicle company Rivian </u></a>to support its new manufacturing facility in Georgia.</p>
<p>The acceleration represents a clear push by the outgoing Biden administration to get money out the door before President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened to hollow out much of the Department of Energy, takes office. Still, there’s a good chance these recent conditional commitments won’t become final before the new administration takes office, as that process involves checking a series of nontrivial boxes that include performing due diligence, addressing or mitigating various project risks, and negotiating financing terms. And if the deals aren’t finalized before Trump takes office, they’re at risk of being paused or cancelled altogether, something the DOE considers unwise, to put it lightly. </p>
<p>“It would be irresponsible for any government to turn its back on private sector partners, states, and communities that are benefiting from lower energy costs and new economic opportunities spurred by LPO’s investments,” a spokesperson wrote to me in an email. </p>
<p>The once nearly dormant LPO has had a renaissance under the Biden administration and the office’s current director, Jigar Shah. The Inflation Reduction Act supercharged its lending authority to $400 billion, from just $40 billion when Biden took office. Then a week after the election, the office announced that it had recalibrated its risk estimates for the loan guarantees that it makes under the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/energy-infrastructure-reinvestment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment</u></a> program, which works to modernize and repurpose existing energy infrastructure to make it cleaner and more energy efficient. As <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/updates-estimated-remaining-loan-authority-lpo-programs#:~:text=1706%20utility%20loans%20may%20reflect%20a%20relatively%20moderate%20risk%20profile%20in%20comparison%20to%20typical%20projects%20LPO%20finances%20with%20higher%20project%20risk.%20Therefore%2C%20less%20credit%20subsidy%20may%20be%20required%20for%20such%20projects%2C%20allowing%20LPO%20to%20potentially%20finance%20more%20projects.%C2%A0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the office explained,</u></a> these projects “may reflect a relatively moderate risk profile in comparison to typical projects LPO finances with higher project risk.” When there’s less risk involved, LPO doesn’t have to set aside as much money to cover a possible default, which in this case has allowed the office to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/updates-estimated-remaining-loan-authority-lpo-programs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than quadruple</u></a> its funding for qualifying projects. </p>
<p>It’s not just that LPO staffers are working fast, though that’s part of it — it’s also that loan beneficiaries have picked up their pace in responding to the LPO. As Shah emphasized today at the LPO’s second annual <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/events/deploy24" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Demonstrate Deploy Decarbonize </u></a>conference, finalizing conditional commitments largely depends on companies getting their ducks in a row as quickly as possible. “I do think that right now borrowers are sufficiently motivated to move more quickly than they have probably a year ago,” Shah said. “It's up to the borrowers. Our process hasn’t changed. Their ability to move through it faster is in their control.”</p>
<p>Shah noted that though timelines may be accelerating, the office’s due diligence procedures have remained the same. Thus far, the project that has moved the fastest from a conditional commitment to a finalized loan was for a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-first-loan-guarantee-clean-energy-project-nearly-decade" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>clean hydrogen and energy storage facility</u></a> in Utah. That took 43 days, and there are 46 left in Biden’s presidency. Let’s see what the LPO can do. </p>

## 7.0 earthquake off Northern California prompts tsunami warning

date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA — A 7.0 magnitude earthquake shook a large area of Northern California on Thursday, knocking items off grocery store shelves, sending school children scrambling under desks, and prompting a brief tsunami warning for 5.3 million people along the U.S. West Coast.


The quake struck at 10:44 a.m. west of Ferndale, a small city in coastal Humboldt County, about 209 kilometers (130 miles) from the Oregon border, the U.S. Geological Survey said.


It was felt as far south as San Francisco, some 435 kilometers (270 miles) away, where residents felt a rolling motion for several seconds. It was followed by smaller aftershocks.


There were no immediate reports of major damage or injury.


The tsunami warning was in effect for roughly an hour. It was issued shortly after the temblor struck and covered nearly 805 kilometers (500 miles) of coastline, from the edge of California's Monterey Bay north into Oregon.


"It was a strong quake. Our building shook. We're fine, but I have a mess to clean up right now," said Julie Kreitzer, owner of Golden Gait Mercantile, a store packed with food, wares and souvenirs that is a main attraction in Ferndale.


"We lost a lot of stuff. It's probably worse than two years ago. I have to go, I have to try and salvage something for the holidays, because it's going to be a tough year," Kreitzer said before hanging up.




Shortly after the quake, phones in Northern California buzzed with the tsunami warning from the National Weather Service that said, "A series of powerful waves and strong currents may impact coasts near you. You are in danger. Get away from coastal waters. Move to high ground or inland now. Keep away from the coast until local officials say it is safe to return."


South of San Francisco in Santa Cruz, authorities cleared the main beach, closing entrances with police tape.


Numerous cities urged people to evacuate to higher ground as a precaution, including Eureka.


"I thought my axles had fallen apart," said Valerie Starkey, a Del Norte County supervisor representing Crescent City, a town of fewer than 6,000 about 106 kilometers (66 miles)) north of Eureka. "That's what I was feeling ... 'My axles are broken now.' I did not realize it was an earthquake."


Eureka Mayor Kim Bergel said crews were assessing if there was any major damage from the quake. Bergel, who works as a resource aid at a middle school, said lights were swaying, and everyone got under desks.


"The kids were so great and terrified. It seemed to go back and forth for quite a long time," she said. Some children asked, "Can I call my mom?"


The students were later sent home.


Humboldt County Sheriff William Honsal said residents experienced some cracks in their homes' foundations, as well as broken glass and windows, but nothing severe. There also have been no major infrastructure problems, building collapses or roadway issues, and no major injuries or deaths have been reported, he said.


Honsal said he was in his office in the 75-year-old courthouse in downtown Eureka when he felt the quake.


"We're used to it. It is known as 'earthquake country' up here," he said. "It wasn't a sharp jolt. It was a slow roller, but significant."


The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, known as BART, stopped traffic in all directions through the underwater tunnel between San Francisco and Oakland, and the San Francisco Zoo's visitors were evacuated.


Dave Snider, tsunami warning coordinator for the Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska, said the computer models indicated that this was the type of earthquake that was unlikely to cause a tsunami. And gauges that monitor waves then confirmed it, so forecasters canceled the warning.


This quake was a strike-slip type of temblor that shifts more horizontally and is less prone to cause tsunamis, unlike the more vertical types, said National Weather Service tsunami program manager Corina Allen in Washington state.


The California Geological Survey says the state's shores have been struck by more than 150 tsunamis since 1800, and while most were minor, some have been destructive and deadly.


On March 28, 1964, a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in Alaska smashed into Crescent City hours later. Much of the business district was leveled, and a dozen people were killed. More recently, a tsunami from a 2011 earthquake in Japan caused about $100 million in damages along the California coast, much of it in Crescent City.

## US judge rejects Boeing plea deal in fatal 737 MAX crashes

date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA

A U.S. judge on Thursday rejected Boeing's agreement to plead guilty to fraud in the wake of two fatal 737 MAX crashes, faulting a diversity and inclusion provision in the deal.


Boeing did not immediately comment. The U.S. Department of Justice, which brokered the plea bargain with Boeing, is reviewing the opinion, a spokesperson said. Boeing and the DOJ's options could include appealing the judge's rejection of the plea deal or presenting a renegotiated agreement for court approval.


U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, seized on a single sentence in the plea agreement mentioning the DOJ's diversity policy regarding the selection of an independent monitor to audit the plane maker's compliance practices.


Boeing and the DOJ now have 30 days to update the court on how they plan to proceed in the case, O'Connor ruled.


Judges weighing plea deals typically do not upend them over issues that the parties to the agreement have not disputed. In the rare cases that they do, it is usually because the judge wants to impose a different punishment than prosecutors have agreed to.


The plea bargain also marginalizes the judge in the selection and oversight of the independent monitor, and it forbids imposing a probation condition requiring Boeing to comply with the monitor's anti-fraud recommendations, O'Connor said in his decision. He said the agreement was "not in the public interest."


Relatives of the victims of the two 737 MAX crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019 and killed 346 people, have called the plea agreement a "sweetheart" deal that failed to adequately hold Boeing accountable for the deaths of their loved ones.


The two plane crashes occurred in Indonesia and Ethiopia over a five-month period. The families had briefly referenced the DOJ diversity and inclusion policy in court filings opposing the plea agreement, but did not detail concerns about it.


"Judge O’Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between" the government and Boeing "that failed to focus on the overriding concerns: holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future," said Paul Cassell, a lawyer representing the families.


Cassell said he hoped the decision would result in the agreement being renegotiated to specifically address the passengers and crew who perished in the plane crashes.


An accepted plea deal would have branded Boeing a convicted felon for conspiring to defraud the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration about problematic software affecting the flight control systems in the planes that crashed.


Boeing had agreed to pay a fine of up to $487.2 million and spend $455 million to improve safety and compliance practices over three years of court-supervised probation as part of the deal.


Victims' relatives want Boeing and its executives charged with crimes holding them responsible for the deaths of their loved ones and any evidence of wrongdoing presented in a public trial. They have also argued Boeing should have to pay up to $24.78 billion in connection with the crashes.

## An America First Strategy for Renewable Energy?

date: 2024-12-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTE1MzIxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3Nzg2OTMyN30.7DcUopPk7tUGPYxUjnv0X_WoJ4CxLzW0sxQdlanVIHU/image.jpg?width=900&height=410&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>Today we’re talking with Tim Brightbill, a trade attorney at Wiley Rein LLP and lead counsel for a coalition of U.S. solar cell and module manufacturers – the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee. Last week, his <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/12/02/us-anti-dumping-tariffs-southeast-asia-solar-panels/" target="_blank"><u>client won</u></a> a massive victory – fresh tariffs on south Asian solar panel parts – on the premise that Chinese firms are dumping cheap products in the region to drive down prices and hurt American companies. It’s the latest in a long series of decadal trade actions against solar parts with Chinese origin.</p>
<p>We wanted to talk to Tim about how this move could affect developers, if an America-first strategy could help insulate solar from political opposition, and how this could play out in next year’s talks over the future of the IRA. The following conversation was lightly edited for clarity. </p>
<p><strong>If you were talking to a developer, what would you tell them should be their takeaway? </strong></p>
<p>I think the takeaway is that these determinations appear to go a long way toward addressing the unfair trade that’s been present in solar panels, solar cells, for more than a decade. And I think these duties do send a signal that will help build up domestic manufacturing. We’ve seen historic investment next to the Inflation Reduction Act in U.S. solar manufacturing facilities – in places like Georgia with QCells, in Ohio for First Solar – and we’re at a critically important point here. </p>
<p>Those investments were being undercut by this unfair trade by these Chinese-owned companies. We think now hopefully that will be addressed and that should lead to a bright future for solar deployment, the growth of solar power in the United States. </p>
<p><strong>How does the pursuit of a fairer trade landscape globally in the broader sense impact support for solar energy in the U.S.? I hear often that a “made without China” approach can shore up support for renewables. Do you find that to be the case? </strong></p>
<p>Definitely, I find that to be the case. </p>
<p>The U.S. industry invented solar technology and perfected it. And then unfortunately, it was virtually wiped out due to the unfair trade practices of China and these Chinese-owned companies. If we want to have solar and not be dependent on other countries for renewable energy needs, the best way to do that is to have a strong manufacturing base and a strong supply chain. </p>
<p><strong>What do you think the direction of this is going to be under the next administration? Even more ratcheting up of trade measures? </strong></p>
<p>Well the trade laws are a calculation, right? They’re based on rules, they’re not political. I don’t expect this administration to necessarily change individual trade cases. But I do think trade policy will change in a way that tries to address these Chinese-owned companies that undercut the rest of the world. </p>
<p>For example, the IRA provides right now potential benefits for any company that sets up shop here, even if they are owned by a foreign entity of concern. That seems like something this administration is going to address. If you’re going to receive IRA money, you should not be affiliated with a foreign entity of concern. </p>
<p><strong>Given the potential for an impact on pricing, combined with the impacts on limiting the tax credits in that way – wouldn’t that make it harder to build projects in the U.S. short term? </strong></p>
<p>I don’t think so. The solar panels themselves are not anywhere close to the majority of the cost of a project. There are so many other things that impact project cost, from permitting to the land. I don’t think this will impact the costs of deployment of solar. It will just give us a more secure supply chain that is either here in the United States or at least more regional in nature, which is going to be better for the industry. </p>
<p><strong>With foreign entities of concern – are you referring to 45X? You’re anticipating that tax credit will change with respect to the IRA? </strong></p>
<p>I expect the Trump administration will focus on that. There are already other related products under IRA where “foreign entity of concern” participation is not allowed for those tax credits. So it seems like a ready fix to ensure that is the same for solar technologies. </p>
<p><strong>Is that bad news, or is that saving the credit? </strong></p>
<p>I don’t think it’s bad news. I think it’s good news. It means more of the credit will be available to U.S. companies and our allies who might want to set up here as well. </p>
<p>If Chinese companies want to come here and set up in the United States, that’s great, but they shouldn’t also receive subsidies because those are the same companies that have harmed our industry with unfair trade for more than a decade. </p>
<p><strong>Okay enough serious talk. Can I ask you a fun question: what was the last band you listened to? </strong></p>
<p>It’s sort of dad rock-ish right now: Spoon. When I get my Spotify Wrapped, it’s going to be Spoon. That’s my favorite rock band right now. </p>

## US Secret Service chief touts reforms after Trump assassination attempts

date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — The U.S. Secret Service’s acting director told a U.S. House of Representatives panel on Thursday that he has overhauled the agency's security practices after a gunman shot President-elect Donald Trump in July.


Acting Director Ronald Rowe testified to a House task force consisting of seven Republicans and six Democrats that has been investigating two failed assassination attempts on Trump during this year's presidential campaign. Things grew heated at times.


The panel is expected to vote on the approval of a final report later on Thursday.


"It is essential that we recognize the gravity of our failure on July 13, 2024. I personally carry the weight of knowing that we almost lost a protectee and that our failure cost a father and husband his life," Rowe testified.


"This entire incident represents the failure to meet the expectations and responsibilities of the Secret Service."


The Secret Service has faced questions over its staffing levels and communication capabilities following the Trump assassination attempts.


A gunman fired eight shots during a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July, wounding Trump in the ear and killing another attendee. The gunman was shot and killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.


Two months later, a man with a gun holed himself up near a Trump-owned golf course in Florida with what prosecutors have said was an intent to kill the then-Republican candidate while he golfed.


The suspect, Ryan Routh, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges and is awaiting trial.


Rowe earned praise from many Republican lawmakers for cooperating with the investigation, but he erupted at Republican Representative Pat Fallon after the congressman questioned Rowe's appearance at a ceremony this year commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.


"Do not invoke 9/11 for political purposes!" Rowe yelled, adding that he responded to the World Trade Center site following the attack and attended the ceremony to represent the Secret Service. "You are out of line, Congressman."


Fallon said he was asking "serious questions" about whether Rowe was there to provide protection for high-level officials at the ceremony.


Rowe has said he was “ashamed” of security lapses surrounding the Pennsylvania shooting. He defended the agency’s response in the Florida incident, commending an agent who spotted the gunman before he could open fire.


Rowe said he has made a series of changes following the shooting, including increasing training for agents, streamlining communication with local law enforcement and boosting the size of Trump's security detail.


Rowe testified that he has sought to eliminate what he called a "do-more-with-less mindset" at the Secret Service, which he said had a "degrading effect" on the agency. He said the agency was remedying its staffing shortage of recent years and was on pace to hire 650 special agents and 350 uniformed officers in the coming months.


The rally shooting shook confidence in the Secret Service, damaging its elite “zero fail” reputation for protecting presidents and high-level dignitaries to the U.S.


The Secret Service has largely been exempt from Trump’s criticisms of federal law enforcement and vows to overhaul government, but the agency’s response to the Pennsylvania shooting drew bipartisan condemnation.


An interim report from the House task force, released in October, found a lack of planning between the Secret Service and local law enforcement ahead of the July rally.


Republican Representative Mike Kelly, the chair of the task force, credited Rowe with implementing reforms and calling out what he called a culture of complacency in the agency.


Kelly said when Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania, for another rally in October, the difference in the security posture was "like the difference between day and night."

## Police seek suspect in UnitedHealthcare shooting

date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA

New York City police investigators continue to search for the suspect in the shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was attacked by a gunman who apparently was waiting for him on a New York sidewalk early Wednesday.


Police say multiple surveillance cameras captured the shooting and the moments after. In one video taken closest to the shooting at about 6:45 a.m., Thompson, 50, can be seen walking on a sidewalk to UnitedHealthcare’s annual investor conference at a Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan.


A moment later, a figure wearing a hooded jacket, dark glasses and a backpack steps out from behind a parked vehicle and raises a handgun that appears to have a noise suppressor, or silencer, attached and fires several shots.


Thompson was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.


Other cameras caught the gunman mounting an e-bike and heading into the city’s Central Park. Police are now investigating whether the vehicle was an unmarked e-bike or one that is part of the city’s Citi Bike share system, as initially reported.




Police on Thursday revealed the words “Deny,” “Defend” and “Depose" were printed on the 9-millimeter shell casings found at the scene. Some analysts believe the words may have been a reference to strategies insurance companies use to avoid paying claims.


At an initial news conference on Wednesday, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said that while it was clear the attack on Thompson was premeditated, the motive is unclear.


She said the cameras showed that the suspect waited for several minutes for Thompson, and that he had at least some prior firearms training.


Thompson had been with Minneapolis-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years. The New York Times reported that the company, which offers insurance to companies and individuals, has a market valuation of $560 billion, making it one of the country’s largest publicly traded companies.


The Times also reported the company has come under scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators, who accused it of systematically refusing to authorize health care procedures and treatments.


The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a report in October documenting insurance companies' refusal to pay for the care of older people who had suffered strokes or medical emergencies.


UnitedHealthcare in particular was cited for a surge in denials in post-acute care when it increased to 22.7% in 2022 from 10.9% in 2020.


Thompson’s wife, Paulette, told U.S. broadcaster NBC News that he had received death threats.


The Associated Press contributed to this report.

## Inside Nevada’s Solar Energy Revolt

date: 2024-12-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTE1MDc4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODU5MDA1MH0.DnhsmgWVD8Q4M9DEhbIjsuw9kq_P9Y9DnFQVKtEXwn4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Nevada, ground zero for solar development in the American West, is now seeing a different kind of renewables revolution – against development. </p>
<p>It might endanger the Biden administration’s crowning solar permitting achievement, and will mean developers in the Silver State will have to reckon with empowered opponents in the Trump 2.0 era. </p>
<p>The Bureau of Land Management’s Western <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2022371/510" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>solar plan</u></a> would open more than 31 million acres available for utility-scale solar applications across almost a dozen states. About a third of that land would be in Nevada. Nevada is <a href="https://seia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Nevada.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one of the top states</u></a> in the U.S. for solar development and utility-scale construction spiked after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. </p>
<p>Rural county governments are hopping mad over the effort. Many officials want to do what their friends in other states can do – pass moratoria and restrict development in line with local complaints. They’ve been passing their local rules. But there’s a big X factor: They have no authority over federal lands, and most of the state’s territory overall is under control of BLM. </p>
<p>This means their ordinances are relatively toothless, county officials say, not to mention they get less revenue from solar farms. </p>
<p>“There are impacts to residents, to county services, to how we deliver services from solar energy projects, that frankly aren’t being addressed,” said Vinson Guthreau, executive director of the Nevada Association of Counties, which has formally protested the BLM solar plan after backlash with members. “And there’s zero way to capture revenue from resources on federal land — we cannot collect taxes on federal land. We receive all of the impacts and none of the revenue to fund the impacts, frankly.”</p>
<p>Enter Nevada’s Republican Governor Joe Lombardo. In an Oct. 28 letter obtained by Heatmap, Lombardo stated “discouraging feedback” from local officials and state agencies led him to ask BLM to cancel its west-wide comprehensive solar plan. Among his complaints: many objections from local leaders and concerns raised by environmentalists about impacts on imperiled tortoises and sage grouse. (Yes, this means the GOP governor of Nevada is on the same side as <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/center-biological-diversity-tortoise-solar" target="_self"><u>the Center for Biological Diversity</u></a>.)</p>
<p>“The vast tracts of land identified,” Lombardo wrote, “places enormous pressure on our rural counties, many of which rely on public lands for agriculture, grazing, mining, recreation, and community development, and threatens to overwhelm local land-use plans and disrupt the economic and social fabric of our communities.” </p>
<p>Opposition from Nevada means that if there’s a way to unravel the programmatic solar plan when Donald Trump takes office in January, there’ll be a will. That’s what happened with the Obama administration’s <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/feds-to-relax-rules-protecting-sage-grouse-in-nevada-10-other-states/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sage grouse habitat protection</u></a> efforts. Other western states opposed Obama sage grouse protection plans, but Nevada – a key swing state – was a dissenting voice that really counted. Now ironically, instead of scrapping protections for sage grouse, the state is citing the bird to say local objections are being left out of the discourse. </p>
<p>“Everybody knows where the migration corridors are,” said Lander County land use planner Pam Harrington, who previously worked for conservation group Trout Unlimited. “We’re not unsupportive of [solar energy] in our county. We want to see growth. But we want to see smart growth.”</p>
<p>Personally, I think the mining and agriculture concerns here are scant compared to the very real tax issue. We see transmission lines or renewables projects face scrutiny when the power itself doesn’t go to the people directly impacted. The same could easily be true here with taxes. Notably, the hardrock mining industry – also blooming in Nevada – pays state royalties but no federal payments for the resources it collects in the state. </p>
<p>“The mining industry is super prominent and they have set the gold standard around community engagement,” Gurtheau said, adding he believes those companies are doing a much better job at engaging Nevada communities than renewables. “That’s what our [counties] are used to.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the BLM will formally implement the solar plan before Trump takes office. The final environmental review for BLM’s solar plan was released at the end of the summer, but the Bureau has not issued its official action formally opening acreage for development. The agency said it would do this “following resolution of any remaining issues identified” after releasing the final review. </p>
<p>BLM did not respond to a request for comment. </p>

## The myth of “the deserving rich and the undeserving poor”

date: 2024-12-05, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>In the new Trump administration, there may be a greater focus on people pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. But &#8220;this idea that we’re doing this all on our own is a fiction,&#8221; argues Alissa Quart of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project. On today&#8217;s show, we&#8217;ll discuss economic inequality and how the economy is — or isn&#8217;t — working for people. But first: bitcoin&#8217;s meteoric rise in value and a labor market losing momentum.</p>

## Why Climate Change Will Wreck the Municipal Bond Market

date: 2024-12-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTEzMjU0OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDgzMzk2Nn0.1y3np--h-uOBTk7-VhunyPzgalqEhEojg1HztY-T0A8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Unpriced risk undermined the global economy during the financial crisis of 2008. Today, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/home-insurance-climate-change-housing-market/?itid=lk_inline_manual_10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>researchers say</u></a> unpriced physical climate risk will lead to rapid declines in property values — and point out that this is already happening in some Florida markets. They often compare what’s happening now to the run-up to 2008. If the analogy holds, we will likely see disruption in other related financial structures. In particular, as the physical reality of climate change begins to have an effect on the attractiveness of bonds in risky areas, the ability of local governments to raise money to adapt to rapidly changing climate conditions may be undercut.</p><p>But comparing the effect of the 2008 unpriced risk on the municipal bond market with the potential effects of physical climate risk shows the suffering will likely be much greater this time. Today, there’s a direct, rather than indirect, connection between risk and public finance markets.</p><p>The solution? Last week, Tom Doe, CEO and founder of Municipal Market Analytics, <a href="https://podcast.fhnfinancial.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> cities should act now to raise as much money as possible for adaptation before the municipal bond market starts pricing in physical climate risk. It’s only going to get more expensive later, in his view.</p><p>During the 2008 collapse, issuers of municipal bonds suffered. According to the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/GPO-FCIC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>final report on the crisis</u></a>, New York State was stuck making suddenly skyrocketing interest payments to investors — the rate went from about 3.5% to more than 14% — on $4 billion of its debt. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey’s interest rate went from 4.3% to 20% in a single week. Investors who had bought municipal bonds in auctions suffered too, because the pool of new buyers dried up very quickly in early 2008.</p><p>Since then, the muni market has bounced back in a big way, with professional investment managers urging tax-avoidant retail investors to buy individual bonds through separately managed accounts rather than through a mutual bond fund or an exchange-traded fund. Most people think $500 billion in bond issues is likely in 2025, and the group of buyers has a seemingly unending appetite for what they perceive to be safe and highly liquid investments — essentially the equivalent of money market accounts that promise federal tax-free interest payments.</p><p>But the risks now posed by physical climate change to municipal bond issuers and investors are different and likely greater than they were in 2008. The last time around, the municipal bond market suffered because of a domino effect — the insurance companies the issuers were using were exposed to mortgage risk.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/GPO-FCIC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Financial Crisis Inquiry Report</u></a>, so-called “monoline” insurers (writing policies for single financial structures rather than a broad array of products) had gotten into the mortgage-backed securities business, issuing a boatload of guarantees covering more than $250 billion of these structured products. The CEO of one of these monoline businesses, Alan Roseman of ACA, said, “We never expected losses. ... We were providing hedges on market volatility to institutional counterparties.” In other words, ACA believed its risk was limited because it wasn’t directly investing in the underlying assets — that its risk was limited to ups and downs in the market value of the mortgage-backed securities. But when the value of huge numbers of mortgage-backed securities plunged as the credit rating agencies woke up and repriced the risk of the subprime mortgages buried within them, ACA and other insurers were faced with stunning losses.</p><p>Those same insurers (MBIA, ACA, Ambac) were then substantially downgraded. And they hadn’t been insuring only mortgage-backed securities — they were also insuring municipal bonds and “auction rate securities” based on those bonds, structures that allowed local governments to borrow money at variable interest rates. When the insurance companies froze up because of the sudden repricing of mortgage-backed securities and their guarantees became worthless, the auction markets froze, as well. As a result, issuers of muni bonds (and investors in them) suffered. </p><p>In other words, in 2008, it was risk in a different financial arena — mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by insurance companies — that slopped over and caused problems for municipal bonds. By contrast, when it comes to physical climate change today, the municipal bond market is <em><em>directly</em></em> exposed to the central risk: Will the communities that effectively guarantee these bonds continue to be viable? Will these communities be insurable? Will community property values and thus property taxes suddenly decline?</p><p>Not only that, the 2008 risk was different because it could be eventually unwound. Property markets could get going again, as they have in spades. This time, deterioration of the underlying asset — the communities themselves — will likely be irreversible. Chronic flooding will not cease on any human-relevant time scale.</p><p>Issuers are not being penalized — yet — for the physical climate risk facing their communities, according to Tom Doe’s <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tom-doe-on-extreme-weathers-impact-on-the-municipal/id1696177158?i=1000678600217" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>conversation</u></a> with Will Compernolle on the latter’s <em><em>Simply Put</em></em> podcast last week. “This risk is not being priced in,” Doe said. “There’s no evidence of that right now. And in addition, the rating agencies have <a href="https://susanpcrawford.substack.com/p/safe-as-houses-how-muni-credit-rating" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not reflected [physical risk] in their letter scoring</u></a> of credit risk … so there is not a ratings penalty right now. There’s not a pricing penalty.”</p><p>Doe’s suggestion is that local governments may want to get out there and raise as much money as they can for adaptation. “State and local governments who are in harm’s way that need to do this can go to the market right now, and investors are not penalizing them. The market is not. So this is essentially cheap money if they issue [bonds] for these projects today,” Doe said.</p><p>That’s one way of looking at the situation. Public money for adaptation is cheap, there’s a lot of it potentially available, and it is much less expensive to raise that money now than it will be once the credit rating agencies and the investors start pricing in physical risk and demanding higher interest payments in exchange for the use of their cash.</p><p>It’s a race against time: Eventually, as in 2008, the mispriced risk will be correctly assessed. This time, unlike the last crisis, the harm to the underlying assets will be permanent.</p><p><em>A version of this article originally appeared in the author’s newsletter, <a href="https://susanpcrawford.substack.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moving Day</a>, and has been repurposed for Heatmap.</em></p>

## Biden caps Angola visit with stop at train terminal at western port

date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA

LOBITO, ANGOLA — In the blistering midday heat at Angola’s largest port, U.S. President Joe Biden beamed Wednesday as he shook hands, one by one, with nine smiling hard-hatted workers. He had journeyed all the way from Washington to meet them at the terminus of an ambitious 1,300-kilometer, U.S.-financed rail line that brings critical minerals out of Africa’s remote interior.


On this December afternoon, there wasn’t much activity: The usually bustling port of Lobito had been cleared of most workers for his visit. A nearby black and red rail engine was still shiny and new, as were the long chains of blue half-containers that stretched behind it.


Still, said a smiling Biden, this is Africa’s future.


"When I launched this project with our G7 partners last year, I said our goal was to build a better future,” Biden said. “And folks, the future is here. It's now. The future is here.”


The U.S. has invested about $4 billion to refurbish the dilapidated cross-continental Lobito Corridor track, which runs from copper-rich Zambia, through mineral-rich Congo and then to the port. Once the full route is completed — which officials say will happen by the end of this decade — the system will cut a road journey of some 45 days to a rail trip of 45 hours.




On Wednesday, Biden announced the United States will invest $600 million more to upgrade the rail, develop the corridor and expand agriculture. And while this project is small compared to China’s sprawling Belt and Road Initiative, Biden emphasized that the U.S. seeks true partnership with African nations.


"The United States understands that how we invest in Africa is just as important as how much we invest in Africa,” he said, flanked by the leaders of Angola, Congo, Zambia and the vice president of Tanzania, who met with Biden to tout the project and plot a path forward.


Angolan President Joao Lourenco said: "This will be a linchpin for the economic development that will provide the participation of small and medium enterprises in the business value chain, mainly in agriculture, industry and mining in order to increase trade and economic growth of SADC [Southern Africa Development Community] region and the Eastern African region.”


And from Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, whose massive, mineral-rich nation has much to gain: "The corridor is way more than just a transportation access,” he said. “It is a unique opportunity for regional integration, economic transformation, and to improve the living conditions of our fellow citizens."


Analysts are quick to note that this is no charity.


"From the U.S. and an EU point of view, it's like if we don't have access to the critical minerals for the green economy, we'll lag behind in terms of greening the global economy,” said E.D. Wala Chabala, an independent economic policy and strategy consultant.


A top Angolan agricultural official told VOA that Angola hopes to use this boost to one day export higher-value items duty free to the U.S. through the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act.


“We are also very focused on promoting internal production, effectively solving our need to feed and as the process allows us to effectively evolve towards opportunities such as AGOA,” said Anderson Jeronimo, who heads the Planning Statistics Studies Office of the Ministry of Agriculture.


Mayra Fernandes contributed to this report.

## The Town Suing Duke Energy

date: 2024-12-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTE0OTQyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzEyNDMzNX0.CjsWoUlKglDe2gSMPeSjbXahJyg75josyzd_khkDJ18/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Schools in Delhi have reopened but smog levels remain high • Storm Darragh could bring 80 mph winds to parts of the UK • Powerful snow squalls are making life difficult for large parts of the Northeastern U.S.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. An update on the World Court’s big climate case</h3><p>
	A representative from the United States yesterday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/climate/paris-agreement-international-court-justice.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9NMqJdXLCT9EjuJkHPDG8bsAZS2FN98BfwI3XWvldPXrLxigkDd0H_aINHkSzSWH43oTsh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the International Court of Justice that existing climate regimes – and specifically the United Nations framework convention on climate change and the Paris Agreement – are the world’s “best hope for protecting the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations.” The statement drew fire from small island nations and climate campaigners, who want to see the World Court recommend that big emitters like the U.S. be held legally responsible for the harm they do to the global climate. But it seems the U.S. thinks existing guidelines are good enough, even though it’s unclear how long the U.S. will remain committed to the Paris Agreement under another Trump presidency. Other major emitters, including China, Australia, and Saudi Arabia, have made similar arguments as part of the landmark case. “These nations, some of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters, have pointed to existing treaties and commitments that have regrettably failed to motivate substantial reductions in emissions,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/climate/paris-agreement-international-court-justice.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9NMqJdXLCT9EjuJkHPDG8bsAZS2FN98BfwI3XWvldPXrLxigkDd0H_aINHkSzSWH43oTsh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Ralph Regenvanu, special envoy for climate change and environment for the island nation of Vanuatu. “Let me be clear: These treaties are essential, but they cannot be a veil for inaction or a substitute for legal accountability.” The hearings, which started Monday, will go on for two weeks and an opinion from the court is due next year.

<p>The value of bitcoin has soared in the past month, with bets on an incoming crypto-friendly presidential administration. There&#8217;s news that president-elect Donald Trump plans to appoint a crypto-friendly chair for the Securities and Exchange Commission: Paul Atkins. Trump has also announced his pick to head the IRS: Missouri&#8217;s Billy Long. What should we make of these two appointment choices? We discuss. Also: a boiling point in the U.S. and China&#8217;s feud over semiconductor chips.</p>

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The value of the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency has been bolstered by hopes that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will adopt crypto-friendly policies. Then, France&#8217;s Prime Minister Michel Barnier has been ousted in a no-confidence vote.

## Bitcoin storms above $100,000 as bets on Trump fuel crypto euphoria

date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA

Bitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by skeptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets.


Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday's Asian morning, boosted by U.S. President-elect Trump's nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was soon at an all-time high of $103,619, a surge of about 6% on the day. It was last fetching $102,650.


The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record just shy of $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple AAPL.O alone is worth about $3.7 trillion.


Bitcoin's march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularized the concept of "decentralized finance" in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago.


Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump's sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress.


"We're witnessing a paradigm shift," said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of U.S. crypto firm Galaxy Digital.


"Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fueled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path."


Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.


"We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, U.S. investors resumed buying hand-over-fist," said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund.


Bitcoin's proponents cheered Trump's nomination of Atkins to the SEC.


A former SEC commissioner, Atkins has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to "develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms," and the Chamber of Digital Commerce.


"Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem," said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith.


"We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation."


A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council.




Part of the landscape


Bitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns.


Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed.


Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally.


U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election.


"Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money," said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.


"Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalized," he said. "If you fast forward a number of years on trading floors you'll have a sales and trading desk... which will sit alongside FX and rates and commodities."


It is already becoming increasingly financialized, with the launch of bitcoin futures BTCc1 in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock's ETF IBIT.O in November.


Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings MARA.O and exchange operator Coinbase COIN.O each up around 65% in November.


Software firm Microstrategy MSTO.O, which has repeatedly raised funds to buy bitcoin and held an aggregate of about 402,100 bitcoins as of Dec. 1, has gained around 540% this year.


Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies.


'Who can prohibit it'


The cryptocurrency industry has been criticized for its massive energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, and the underlying technology is yet to deliver a major revolution in the way money moves around the globe.


The U.S. and Britain announced on Wednesday they had disrupted what they described as a global money laundering ring which used cryptocurrency to help rich Russians to evade sanction and launder cash for drug traffickers.


Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: "Who can prohibit it? No one." And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience.


"As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the financial landscape," said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney.


"I find it very hard to value it ... it's anyone's guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up."

## China urges US to 'stop sending wrong signals' over Taiwan after Lai-Johnson call

date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING — China on Thursday urged the United States to "stop sending wrong signals" over Taiwan, after the announcement that Republican U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson held a call with the self-ruled island's President Lai Ching-te.


Lai is currently visiting the American territory Guam during a Pacific tour that has angered China.


Taiwan's Presidential Office confirmed to AFP Thursday that the call had taken place, without elaborating on the discussion.


Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory and has refused to rule out the use of force to bring the self-governed island under its control one day.


Beijing's foreign ministry on Thursday urged Washington to "deliver on the promises of American leaders not to support Taiwan independence, to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and to stop sending wrong signals to Taiwan separatist forces."


Spokesperson Lin Jian said the U.S. should "clearly recognize the serious danger that separatist acts of Taiwan independence pose to peace and security across the Taiwan Strait."


"The Taiwan issue is the very core of China's core interests," he said at the regular press briefing, adding that China would take "resolute and effective measures" to defend its sovereignty.


The United States does not have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan but has an arrangement to provide the island with the means to defend itself.


In a separate statement on Thursday, China's foreign ministry announced sanctions on U.S. companies and individuals for selling arms to Taiwan.


The sanctions target 13 firms engaged in the production of drones, unmanned aerial systems, and other military products.


They also cover six top executives at companies including Raytheon and BAE Systems.


The sanctioned companies will have their assets in China frozen and be banned from trading with Chinese firms, while the executives will also be banned from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macau, the statement said.

date: 2024-12-05, from: Market Place

<p>Many provisions of the Trump administration&#8217;s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire next year. That means the incoming Republican-controlled House and Senate will have the privilege of agonizing over which parts to renew and how to pay for them. Plus: Community colleges push up graduation rates, the advantages of owning your own small-business space, and are holiday shoppers buying the sale hype along with the goods?</p>

date: 2024-12-05, from: VOA News USA

State Department — The United States has dismissed Chinese objections to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's stopovers in Hawaii and Guam during a Pacific tour, reaffirming that transits through the U.S. by Taiwan’s democratically elected leaders are routine and consistent with long-standing bipartisan U.S. policy.   


Amid China’s criticism, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and former Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi each spoke separately with Lai, underscoring steadfast U.S. support for Taiwan.  


Johnson held a call Wednesday afternoon with Lai, who had recently arrived in Guam following a visit to Taiwan’s Pacific ally, Tuvalu, according to sources who spoke with VOA on the condition of anonymity.


First call


The call marked the first direct conversation between the House speaker and Lai since the latter assumed office in May. Johnson had previously congratulated Lai upon his election in January and renewed the United States’ commitment to the security and democracy of its Indo-Pacific partners. 


Lai arrived in Guam on Wednesday night for a brief layover and is set to depart Thursday afternoon for Palau, the final stop on his weeklong Pacific tour. The trip, which began on November 30, also included stops in Hawaii and the Marshall Islands. This marks Lai's first overseas trip as president.


VOA has reached out to Johnson’s office for comment.




Bipartisan US policy


“Every democratically elected Taiwan president has transited the United States,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA this week.  


Guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three U.S.-China Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances, the spokesperson added that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has remained consistent across administrations for 45 years.


Senior U.S. officials have also noted that these documents — the foundations of Washington’s “One China” policy — contain no language explicitly prohibiting a Taiwan president from stopping over in a U.S. city.


Beijing opposition


Beijing, however, accused Washington of interfering in what it calls its “internal affairs.”


Chinese officials said they “firmly oppose” any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province.


“Nothing will deter China from upholding national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters this week.


Taiwan has said China's threats over Lai’s visit are counterproductive.




Garnering US support


Lai's transits through Hawaii and Guam come as he seeks to garner support from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has said Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection.


In a closed-door address at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Lai expressed Taiwan’s commitment to deepening cooperation with the U.S. and contributing to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the broader Indo-Pacific region.


Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a prominent China hawk, has sponsored legislation supporting high-level visits by Taiwanese officials to the U.S. and advocating stronger U.S. policy toward Taiwan amid mounting Chinese military and diplomatic pressure.


When asked by VOA if he would maintain his support for Taiwan, Rubio said, “The president sets foreign policy, and our job at the State [Department] will be to execute it.”   


Despite facing sanctions from China, Rubio expressed confidence in finding solutions to engage with Beijing if confirmed. 


Restrictions on Washington  


Under long-standing, self-imposed restrictions by the State Department, a stopover in the capital by a sitting Taiwanese president is considered highly provocative to Beijing.


No sitting Taiwan president, vice president, premier or ministers of foreign affairs and defense has visited Washington for formal meetings while in office.


“I know there's some diplomatic rules related to leaders of Taiwan coming to the United States,” Republican Representative Andy Barr, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told VOA.


“I think we need to remove any of those impediments. I think President Lai should be able to come to the United States, and we should welcome him.”


The Communist Party-led People’s Republic of China has never governed Taiwan but claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democracy.  


The U.S. has “acknowledged” but never endorsed China’s sovereignty claim over Taiwan.


Washington maintains a “One China” policy distinct from Beijing’s One China principle, taking no official position on Taiwan’s sovereignty and not supporting Taiwan independence.


VOA’s congressional correspondent Katherine Gypson and Mandarin Service reporter Yihua Lee contributed to this report.

## US senators vow action after briefing on Chinese Salt Typhoon telecom hacking

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. government agencies held a classified briefing for all senators on Wednesday on China's alleged efforts known as Salt Typhoon to burrow deep into American telecommunications companies and steal data about U.S. calls. 


The FBI, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, Federal Communications Commission Chair Jessica Rosenworcel, the National Security Council and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency were among the participants in the closed-door briefing, officials told Reuters.  


Democratic Senator Ron Wyden told reporters after the briefing he was working to draft legislation on this issue, while Senator Bob Casey said he had "great concern" about the breach and added it may not be until next year before Congress can address the issue. 


Republican Senator Rick Scott expressed frustration with the briefing. 


"They have not told us why they didn't catch it; what they could have done to prevent it," he said. 




Chinese officials have previously described the allegations as disinformation and said Beijing "firmly opposes and combats cyberattacks and cyber theft in all forms." 


Separately, a Senate Commerce subcommittee will hold a December 11 hearing on Salt Typhoon and how "security threats pose risks to our communications networks and review best practices." The hearing will include Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan. 


There is growing concern about the size and scope of the reported Chinese hacking into U.S. telecommunications networks and questions about when companies and the government can assure Americans over the matter. 


A U.S. official told reporters a large number of Americans' metadata has been stolen in the sweeping cyber espionage campaign, adding that dozens of companies across the world had been hit by the hackers, including at least eight telecommunications and telecom infrastructure firms in the United States. 


"The extent and depth and breadth of Chinese hacking is absolutely mind-boggling — that we would permit as much as has happened in just the last year is terrifying," Senator Richard Blumenthal said. 




Incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr said Wednesday he will work "with national security agencies through the transition and next year in an effort to root out the threat and secure our networks." 


U.S. officials have previously alleged the hackers targeted Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, Lumen and others and stole phone audio intercepts along with a large tranche of call record data. 


T-Mobile said it does not believe hackers got access to its customer information. Lumen said there is no evidence customer data was accessed on its network. 


Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg, AT&T CEO John Stankey, Lumen CEO Kate Johnson and T-Mobile took part in a November 22 White House meeting on the issue.  


Verizon said "several weeks ago, we became aware that a highly sophisticated, nation-state actor accessed several of the nation’s telecom company networks, including Verizon" adding the incident was focused on a very small subset of individuals in government and politics. 


AT&T said it is "working in close coordination with federal law enforcement, industry peers and cyber security experts to identify and remediate any impact on our networks." 


CISA told reporters on Tuesday that it could not offer a timetable for ridding America's telecom networks of all hackers. 


"It would be impossible for us to predict when we'll have full eviction," CISA official Jeff Greene said.

## From VOA Mandarin: Biden hits hard at China's AI; Trump may pound harder

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

The Biden administration issued what is likely its final set of export control rules against Beijing earlier this week. The rules forbid companies from exporting an important chip component crucial for training artificial intelligence to China. Experts say it will further constrain the Chinese supply chain for AI. They also expect the next Trump administration to further expand Washington’s strategic tech blockade against China in a more assertive way.

## Pete Hegseth, Trump's pick to lead Pentagon, says he is fighting on for confirmation

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

Pete Hegseth, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s embattled choice to lead the Defense Department, said Wednesday he is continuing his fight to win Senate confirmation, even as news accounts say Trump is considering whether to name someone else.


The nomination of Hegseth, a 44-year-old decorated military officer and Fox News talk show host, to lead the Pentagon has run into headwinds in the Senate, which must confirm his nomination, as he faces questions about allegations of sexual misconduct and excessive drinking.


With no history of managing a large organization, either in the military or corporate world, Hegseth is an unconventional choice to oversee the country’s nearly 2.9 million active duty and reserve troops across the world, along with another 700,000 civilians who work for the military.




But Hegseth said he is not backing down, even as several U.S. news accounts say Trump is reconsidering the appointment, possibly in favor of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis or Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, a former military officer. DeSantis is a Navy veteran who unsuccessfully ran against Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination before withdrawing in January.


On social media platform X, Hegseth said, "I’m doing this for the warfighters, not the warmongers. The Left is afraid of disrupters and change agents. They are afraid of @realDonaldTrump — and me. So they smear w/ fake, anonymous sources & BS stories. They don’t want truth. Our warriors never back down, & neither will I.”


At the U.S. Capitol, as he headed to meet with senators faced with deciding whether to confirm him, Hegseth told reporters, “I spoke to the president-elect this morning. He said, ‘Keep going, keep fighting. I’m behind you all the way.’ … Why would I back down?”


NBC News reported Tuesday that 10 current and former Fox employees told the network that Hegseth’s co-workers at Fox had been concerned by his alcohol consumption, including occasions when he showed up at work smelling of alcohol and talking about being hung over. Other news accounts have raised questions about Hegseth’s partying and drinking at veterans’ groups he oversaw.


Hegseth is also facing questions about a 2017 encounter at a Republican women’s conference in California where a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her after extensive drinking. He told police investigating her claim that the encounter was consensual, and no charges were filed.


A couple of years later, however, Hegseth paid the woman an undisclosed amount to keep her from filing a lawsuit that Hegseth feared would get him fired from his weekend show at Fox.


One Trump ally, Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, on Tuesday called the allegations against Hegseth "very disturbing," and he said that some of them are "going to be difficult" for some senators considering his nomination.


Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the incoming Senate majority leader, said Hegseth must address the troubling allegations he faces.


“There are hard questions being raised, so he’ll have to answer those,” Thune said.


Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate in January, meaning Hegseth can lose the support of no more than three Republicans, with Vice President-elect JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote, if necessary. Hegseth is unlikely to win any Democratic support.


In other presidential transition news, Trump on Wednesday named Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser in his first White House term, to be his senior counsel for trade and manufacturing when he is inaugurated January 20.


Navarro served four months in prison earlier this year for defying a congressional subpoena investigating the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol as about 2,000 Trump supporters tried to block lawmakers from certifying that Trump had lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden.


Trump described Navarro, 75, as “a man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it.”


The president-elect also named Daniel Driscoll, a former soldier and Iraq war veteran, as secretary of the Army. Additionally, Trump plans to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees securities markets and investments.


Trump also announced Wednesday his choice of former Missouri Congressman Billy Long to lead the Internal Revenue Service.


According to the Missouri Independent newspaper’s website, Long represented his Southwest Missouri district in Congress for six terms. The retired auctioneer and conservative talk radio host first ran in 2010.


Long attended the University of Missouri though he does not have a college degree, according to Ballotpedia.org.


"Since leaving Congress, Billy has worked as a Business and Tax advisor, helping Small Businesses navigate the complexities of complying with the IRS Rules and Regulations. ... He is an extremely hard worker, and respected by all, especially by those who know him in Congress," Trump said of Long in his announcement on Truth Social.


Trump has also tapped former U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler to run the Small Business Administration.


"Kelly will bring her experience in business and Washington to reduce red tape, and unleash opportunity for our Small Businesses to grow, innovate, and thrive," Trump said in a statement Wednesday. "She will focus on ensuring that SBA is accountable to Taxpayers by cracking down on waste, fraud, and regulatory overreach."


The New York Times describes Loeffler as a "top donor" to Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. The newspaper’s website said she has "little experience in public service." She received an appointment to the U.S. Senate in 2020 by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp. She was defeated in a special election in January 2021 by the Rev. Raphael Warnock.


Loeffler, who is working on Trump’s inauguration committee, also supported Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election results.


Trump also announced his choice of Fiserv CEO Frank Bisignano to head the Social Security Administration.


So far, two of Trump’s choices for top-level jobs — Chad Chronister to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration and Matt Gaetz for U.S. attorney general — have dropped out.

## Treasury Finalizes Another IRA Tax Credit Before You Know What

date: 2024-12-04, from: Heatmap News

Today, Treasury has released final rules for the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit, which gives project owners (and/or their tax equity partners) 30% back on their investments in clean energy production.</p>
<p>The IRA-amended investment tax credit, plus its sibling production tax credit, are updates and expansion on tax policies that have been in place for decades supporting largely the solar and wind industries. To be clear, today’s announcement does <em><em>not</em></em> contain the final rules for the so-called “<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/clean-electricity-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>technology-neutral</u></a>” clean electricity tax credits established under the IRA, which will supercede the existing investment and production tax credits beginning next year and for which <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/clean-electricity-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>all non-carbon emitting sources of energy</u></a> can qualify.</p><p>But projects that begin construction this year can still qualify for and claim the legacy credits, which were expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act to include things like standalone energy storage. Projects that go into service this year would only be eligible for the legacy credits, while a project that begins construction this year and goes into service next year or later could choose between the legacy credits or the tech neutral credits, but not both. </p>
<p>The proposed rules, <a href="https://www.projectfinance.law/publications/2023/november/new-investment-tax-credit-regulations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>released in November of last year</u></a>, set off a flurry of campaigning and lobbying by the industry, seeking adjustments to their favor. The final regulations largely hew to the earlier release, although they do include clarifications on what precise aspects of an energy system qualify for the credits. Under the final rules, for instance the “upgrading equipment” necessary for “cleaning and conditioning” biogas — i.e. removing other gases to make it a pure gas stream — can qualify for the credit.</p><p>Going into the end of the year, the major items left on the Treasury Department’s agenda were the tech neutral tax credits, rules for the advanced manufacturing tax credit, and rules for credits related to the production of clean hydrogen; advanced manufacturing tax credit rules came <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2671" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>out in late October</u></a>.

## Native American students found to miss school at higher rates

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

SAN CARLOS, ARIZONA — After missing 40 days of school last year, Tommy Betom, 10, is on track this year for much better attendance. The importance of showing up has been stressed repeatedly at school — and at home. 


When he went to school last year, he often came home saying the teacher was picking on him and other kids were making fun of his clothes. But Tommy's grandmother Ethel Marie Betom, who became one of his caregivers after his parents split, said she told him to choose his friends carefully and to behave in class. 


He needs to go to school for the sake of his future, she told him. 


"I didn't have everything," said Betom, an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Tommy attends school on the tribe's reservation in southeastern Arizona. "You have everything. You have running water in the house, bathrooms and a running car." 




A teacher and a truancy officer also reached out to Tommy's family to address his attendance. He was one of many. Across the San Carlos Unified School District, 76% of students were chronically absent during the 2022-2023 school year, meaning they missed 10% or more of the school year. 


Years after COVID-19 disrupted American schools, nearly every state is still struggling with attendance. But attendance has been worse for Native American students — a disparity that existed before the pandemic and has since grown, according to data collected by The Associated Press. 


Out of 34 states with data available for the 2022-2023 school year, half had absenteeism rates for Native American and Alaska Native students that were at least 9 percentage points higher than the state average. 


Many schools serving Native students have been working to strengthen connections with families, who often struggle with higher rates of illness and poverty. Schools also must navigate distrust dating back to the U.S. government's campaign to break up Native American culture, language and identity by forcing children into abusive boarding schools. 


History "may cause them to not see the investment in a public school education as a good use of their time," said Dallas Pettigrew, director of Oklahoma University's Center for Tribal Social Work and a member of the Cherokee Nation. 


On-site health, trauma care 


The San Carlos school system recently introduced care centers that partner with hospitals, dentists and food banks to provide services to students at multiple schools. The work is guided by cultural success coaches — school employees who help families address challenges that keep students from coming to school. 


Nearly 100% of students in the district are Native and more than half of families have incomes below the federal poverty level. Many students come from homes that deal with alcoholism and drug abuse, Superintendent Deborah Dennison said. 




Students miss school for reasons ranging from anxiety to unstable living conditions, said Jason Jones, a cultural success coach at San Carlos High School and an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Acknowledging their fears, grief and trauma helps him connect with students, he said. 


"You feel better, you do better," Jones said. "That's our job here in the care center is to help the students feel better." 


In the 2023-2024 school year, the chronic absenteeism rate in the district fell from 76% to 59% — an improvement Dennison attributes partly to efforts to address their communities' needs. 


"All these connections with the community and the tribe are what's making a difference for us and making the school a system that fits them rather than something that has been forced upon them, like it has been for over a century of education in Indian Country," said Dennison, a member of the Navajo Nation. 


In three states — Alaska, Nebraska and South Dakota — the majority of Native American and Alaska Native students were chronically absent. In some states, it has continued to worsen, even while improving slightly for other students, as in Arizona, where chronic absenteeism for Native students rose from 22% in 2018-2019 to 45% in 2022-2023. 


AP's analysis does not include data on schools managed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education, which are not run by traditional districts. Less than 10% of Native American students attend BIE schools. 


Schools close on days of Native ceremonial gatherings 




At Algodones Elementary School, which serves a handful of Native American pueblos along New Mexico's Upper Rio Grande, about two-thirds of students are chronically absent. 


The communities were hit hard by COVID-19, with devastating impacts on elders. Since schools reopened, students have been slow to return. Excused absences for sick days are still piling up — in some cases, Principal Rosangela Montoya suspects, students are stressed about falling behind academically. 


Staff and tribal liaisons have been analyzing every absence and emphasizing connections with parents. By 10 a.m., telephone calls go out to the homes of absent students. Next steps include in-person meetings with those students' parents. 


"There's illness. There's trauma," Montoya said. "A lot of our grandparents are the ones raising the children so that the parents can be working." 


About 95% of Algodones' students are Native American, and the school strives to affirm their identity. It doesn't open on four days set aside for Native American ceremonial gatherings, and students are excused for absences on other cultural days as designated by the nearby pueblos. 


For Jennifer Tenorio, it makes a difference that the school offers classes in the family's native language of Keres. She speaks Keres at home but says that's not always enough to instill fluency. 




Tenorio said her two oldest children, now in their 20s, were discouraged from speaking Keres when enrolled in the federal Head Start educational program — a system that now promotes native language preservation — and they struggled academically. 


"It was sad to see with my own eyes," said Tenorio, a single parent and administrative assistant who has used the school's food bank. "In Algodones, I saw a big difference to where the teachers were really there for the students, and for all the kids, to help them learn." 


Over a lunch of strawberry milk and enchiladas on a recent school day, her 8-year-old son Cameron Tenorio said he likes math and wants to be a policeman. 


"He's inspired," Tenorio said. "He tells me every day what he learns." 


Home visits 


In Arizona, Rice Intermediate School Principal Nicholas Ferro said better communication with families, including Tommy Betom's, has helped improve attendance. Since many parents are without working phones, he said, that often means home visits. 


Lillian Curtis said she has been impressed by Rice Intermediate's student activities on family night. Her granddaughter, Brylee Lupe, 10, missed 10 days of school by mid-October last year but had missed just two days by the same time this year. 


"The kids always want to go — they are anxious to go to school now. And Brylee is much more excited," said Curtis, who takes care of her grandchildren. 


Curtis said she tells Brylee that skipping school is not an option. 


The district has made gains because it is changing the perception of school and what it can offer, said Dennison, the superintendent. Its efforts have helped not just with attendance but also morale, especially at the high school, she said. 


"Education was a weapon for the U.S. government back in the past," she said. "We work to decolonize our school system."   


This story is part of a collaboration on chronic absenteeism among Native American students between The Associated Press and ICT, a news outlet that covers Indigenous issues.

## Canadians push back on Trump's tariff threat

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

Vancouver, British Columbia  — President-elect Donald Trump’s threat to introduce 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada is getting reaction, not surprisingly, in both countries.


The threat of tariffs on everything coming across the world’s largest undefended border from Canada to the United States got attention but has not been met with overwhelming surprise.


University of British Columbia political scientist Stewart Prest said it is a return to Trump World, where the world is responding to his social media posts. He said Canadian authorities should know from the previous Trump administration to take the threat seriously but not literally.




“But the other piece of it is then to find ways to respond to, address what Mr. Trump is saying, but to do so without simply giving in and waving the white flag,” Prest said. “That the need to push back in creative ways is, I think, an important lesson, as well.”


Trump says he will impose this tariff if Canada and Mexico do not get control of illegal migrants and fentanyl distribution.


According to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, just under 20 kilograms of fentanyl was seized along the Canada-U.S. border in the last fiscal year. During the same time, 9,500 kilograms were seized along the U.S.-Mexican border.


Canada is the largest trading partner of the United States, with goods valued at an average $2.7 billion crossing the almost 9,000-kilometer-long border every day in 2023.


Canada is the United States of America’s largest source of foreign oil. Prest said the proposed tariffs on that would increase costs on everything, and this needs to be effectively communicated.


“[Make] it clear that there are interests that unite the two countries and that they're far greater than whatever divides us,” Prest said. “Those messages need to be put forward in a variety of formats.”


Andreas Schotter, a professor of global strategy at the Ivey Business School at Western University in Ontario, said the proposed tariffs will hurt both countries. But, he added, they can be avoided if Canada makes serious commitments with tangible results.



Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is suggesting it could deploy more law enforcement resources to the border, including personnel, helicopters and unmanned drones.


Schotter’s concern is that the most recent demand from Trump may go beyond fentanyl and migration and lead to the cancellation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated in his first term to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.


“I think he will not wait for 2026 to reopen USMCA,” Schotter said. “I think he will say, ‘Well, you can talk to me now, or I will not talk to you in 2026, and I just cancel it, right?’ So I think he will not respect even the agreed upon timelines, necessarily. And this is worrying me.”


This past weekend, Trudeau, his chief of staff Katie Telford and Minster of Public Safety Dominic LeBlanc flew from Ottawa to Trump’s home in Florida for direct talks.


LeBlanc has told multiple media outlets the dinner meeting went well, with Trump emphasizing the prevalence of fentanyl as a main concern. Also discussed was the large trade deficit between United States and Canada. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, this amounted to $53.5 billion in 2022.


The Canadian Chamber of Commerce predicts that if the threatened tariffs are put in place, they would shrink Canada’s Gross Domestic Product by 2.6%, and the GDP of the United States by 1.6%.

## Where Does Drug Policy Go From Here?

Be careful about overgeneralizing about what lies ahead on drug policy. Whether the next administration supports or hinders state efforts to liberalize laws on cannabis and/or psychedelics, as well as their approach to increasing access to substance use disorder treatment, remains to be seen.

## Russia-related sanctions target illicit digital finance network, US says

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration issued a fresh round of Russia-related sanctions on Wednesday, taking aim at what it called an illicit finance network that allowed Russian elites to leverage digital assets to avoid sanctions.


In a statement, the U.S. Department of Treasury said it was targeting five people and four entities tied to "a sprawling international network of businesses and employees that have facilitated significant sanctions circumvention" known as the TGR Group.


The targets also include an entity based in Wyoming that is owned in part by a sanctioned individual, the department said.


"Through the TGR Group, Russian elites sought to exploit digital assets — in particular U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins — to evade U.S. and international sanctions, further enriching themselves and the Kremlin,” Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley Smith said in a statement.


The international network actions include "the laundering of funds associated with sanctioned entities; providing an unregistered service to exchange cash and cryptocurrency; the receipt of cash and making the value available to clients in the form of cryptocurrency; providing a prepaid credit card service; and obfuscating the source of funds to allow high-net-worth Russian nationals to purchase property in the United Kingdom," according to the department's statement.


Such sanctions generally prohibit any U.S. persons or entities from conducting any transactions with sanctioned targets and freeze any U.S.-held assets belonging to the sanctioned people or entities.


Among those targeted in Wednesday's action are George Rossi, a Russian-born Ukrainian national born in Russia that the Treasury Department said is believed to control the TGR Group, and Rossi's direct subordinate, Russian national Elena Chirkinyan, among others.

## UnitedHealthcare CEO shot dead outside New York hotel

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealth's UNH.N insurance unit, was fatally shot on Wednesday morning outside a midtown Manhattan hotel just before a scheduled company investor conference, the company said in a statement.


The shooting occurred around 6:40 a.m. local time outside the Hilton on Sixth Avenue, where the meeting was taking place. Thompson was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.


Police were still searching for the masked suspect. A police poster offering a reward for information about the shooting shows surveillance stills of a man wearing a gray-colored jacket and a black sweater on a bicycle, and another photo of the individual appearing to be pointing a gun.




"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him," UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. "We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian’s family and all who were close to him.”


The attack appeared to be targeted, the New York Times reported, citing police. Investigators believe the gunman had been waiting in the area for some time before Thompson's arrival ahead of an investors meeting, CNN reported.


The shooting happened not long before a scheduled UnitedHealth investor conference in Manhattan, which was cut short at about 9 a.m., roughly an hour after it kicked off as news of the shooting trickled out.


UnitedHealthcare is the largest U.S. health insurer, providing benefits to tens of millions of Americans, who pay more for healthcare than in any other country.


UnitedHealth Group Chief Executive Andrew Witty took the stage at the Hilton about one hour after the event started to announce the cancellation.


"We're dealing with a very serious medical situation with one of our team members, and as a result, I'm afraid we're going to have to bring to a close the event today," he said.


UnitedHealth did not respond to a request for comment.


Police tape blocked off the area on 54th Street outside the Hilton on Wednesday morning, where blue plastic gloves were strewn about and plastic cups appeared to mark the location of several bullet casings.


"The police were here in seconds. It’s New York. It’s not normal here at 7 in the morning but it’s pretty scary," said Christian Diaz, who said he heard the gunfire from the nearby University Club Hotel where he works.


Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, where the company is based, said in a statement that the state was sending prayers to Thompson's family and the United Healthcare team.


"This is horrifying news and a terrible loss for the business and health care community in Minnesota," he said.


Thompson was named UnitedHealthcare CEO in April 2021 after working at the company since 2004 in several departments, according to the company's web site.


"Sometimes you meet a lot of fake people in these corporate environments, he certainly didn't ever give me the impression of being one of them," said Antonio Ciaccia, CEO of healthcare research non-profit 46brooklyn, who knew Thompson. "He was a genuinely thoughtful and respectable guy."


Consumer frustration with the U.S. healthcare system runs high and was the driving force behind the U.S. Affordable Care Act, which created a new type of health insurance and mandated coverage for preventative care as well as maximum profit levels.


A cyberhack early in 2024 by another UnitedHealth company called Change that provided technology for most U.S. providers affected more than one third of Americans, who had their information stolen.


Millions of providers experienced disruption in their businesses that lasted months, delaying care for patients and even salaries for healthcare employees.

## Transgender rights case lands at US Supreme Court

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Wednesday in just its second major transgender rights case, which is a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming health care for minors.


The justices' decision, not expected for several months, could affect similar laws enacted by 25 other states and a range of efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use.


The case is coming before a conservative-dominated court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people.


There were dueling rallies outside the court in the hours before the arguments. Speeches and music filled the air on the sidewalk below the court's marble steps. Advocates of the ban bore signs like "Champion God's Design" and "Kids Health Matters," while the other side proclaimed "Fight like a Mother for Trans Rights" and "Freedom to be Ourselves."


Four years ago, the court ruled in favor of Aimee Stephens, who was fired by a Michigan funeral home after she informed its owner that she was a transgender woman. The court held that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.


The Biden administration and the families and health care providers who challenged the Tennessee law are urging the justices to apply the same sort of analysis that the majority, made up of liberal and conservative justices, embraced in the case four years ago when it found that "sex plays an unmistakable role" in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate.


The issue in the Tennessee case is whether the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.


Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors, but not "across the board," lawyers for the families wrote in their Supreme Court brief. The lead lawyer, Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, is the first openly transgender person to argue in front of the justices.




The administration argues there is no way to determine whether "treatments must be withheld from any particular minor" without considering the minor's sex.


"That is sex discrimination," Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in her main court filing.


The state acknowledges that the same treatments that are banned for transgender minors can be prescribed for other reasons. But it rejects the claim that it is discriminating on the basis of sex. Instead, it says lawmakers acted to protect minors from the risks of "life-altering gender-transition procedures."


The law "draws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes. And boys and girls fall on both sides of that line," Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in the state's Supreme Court brief.


While the challengers invoke the 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County for support, Tennessee relies on the court's precedent-shattering Dobbs decision in 2022 that ended nationwide protections for abortion and returned the issue to the states.


The two sides battled in their legal filings over the appropriate level of scrutiny the court should apply. It's more than an academic exercise.


The lowest level is known as rational basis review and almost every law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well within their authority.


The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, that applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it.


If the justices opt for heightened scrutiny, they could return the case to the appeals court to apply it.


Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.


But Tennessee is pointing to health authorities in Sweden, Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom that found the medical treatments "pose significant risks with unproven benefits."


None of those countries has adopted a ban like the one in Tennessee, and individuals can still obtain treatment, Prelogar wrote in response.


The Williams family of Nashville, Tennessee, are among those challenging the state law. Brian Williams said that because of puberty blockers and hormone treatments, his transgender daughter, L.W., is a "16-year-old planning for her future, making her own music and looking at colleges."


But because of Tennessee's ban, she has to travel to another state to receive the health care that "we and her doctors know is right for her."

And another official said the administration will exceed its goal of obligating more than 80% of the available IRA grant money by the end of Biden’s term, explaining that this would mean the funds are protected: “They are subject to the terms of the contract, so when those contracts are signed and executed, this becomes a matter of contract law more than a matter of politics.”

## Meta Puts Out the Call for Nuclear Energy Developers

date: 2024-12-04, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTEzNjg4Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTcxNDQ2MH0.5RbiPekooUE-SF98qrROUkOb3IOS142nLzTvJrnHdkU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Monsoon rains caused severe flooding in Thailand and Malaysia that left more than 30 people dead • In Germany, a recent wind lull known as a “Dunkelflaute” has led to a drop in wind power and a rise in gas-fired electricity production • It is chilly and cloudy in Paris, where French lawmakers will vote today on whether to topple the government.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Meta seeks developers for nuclear energy scale-up</h3><p>
	Facebook parent Meta <a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/12/03/accelerating-the-next-wave-of-nuclear-to-power-ai-innovation/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put out a call</a> yesterday for nuclear energy developers who can add 1-4 gigawatts of new nuclear generation capacity by the early 2030s to power the tech giant’s data centers. “Advancing the technologies that will build the future of human connection — including the next wave of AI innovation — requires electric grids to expand and embrace new sources of reliable, clean and renewable energy,” the company said in its announcement. Interested developers are asked to basically write a pitch explaining their qualifications and why they should be considered for the job, with <a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/nuclear-energy-rfp-qualification-intake/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposals</a> due by February 7 of next year. Other big tech companies, including Amazon and Google, are also relying on nuclear to satisfy their growing energy needs as AI becomes more prevalent.
</p><p>
	Somewhat relatedly, the International Energy Agency is hosting a <a href="https://www.iea.org/events/global-conference-on-energy-and-ai?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" target="_blank">conference</a> on energy and AI today and tomorrow. Experts from the tech and energy industries (including Google’s chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt and Kairos’ head of power commercial team Jeffrey Olson) will discuss “how artificial intelligence could transform global energy systems, exploring the key opportunities and challenges ahead.”
</p><h3>2. China bans exports of critical minerals to U.S.</h3><p>
	China is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-tightens-curbs-on-exports-of-materials-with-chip-making-applications-to-u-s-4348a02c?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" target="_blank">banning</a> exports of some critical minerals to the U.S. in retaliation for the Biden administration’s latest decision to curb China’s access to American-made memory chips. The tit-for-tat move bans exports of gallium, germanium, antimony. These materials are key components in semiconductors, and have many varied applications in clean tech. Gallium, for example, is used in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-03/china-gallium-and-germanium-us-export-ban-why-metals-are-key-in-trade-war?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">solar panels</a>, and antimony is used to make <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-looks-abroad-electric-vehicle-metals-blow-us-miners-2021-05-25/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EV battery alloys</a>.

	Speaking of China, General Motors is shaking up its operations in the country, sustaining <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1467858/000119312524270298/d902397d8k.htm?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than $5 billion</a> in losses. The company’s Chinese joint venture, known as SAIC-GM, has gone from being a success to a liability in recent years, losing ground to Chinese competitors that poured money into producing EVs and hybrids. Electric vehicles make up more than half of all car sales in China. “Almost all foreign automakers there, including European, Japanese, and South Korean companies, are struggling as increasingly ambitious Chinese car companies like BYD and Geely introduce new models and slash prices,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/general-motors-china-electric-vehicles.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>, noting that BYD is likely to <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/11/in-a-first-byd-to-soon-topple-ford-on-deliveries/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overtake</a> Ford this year in global sales.
</p><h3>4. Biden administration has awarded more than $100 billion from IRA</h3><p>
	The Biden administration this week is celebrating the milestone of awarding more than $100 billion in grants as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. “Crossing the milestone of $100 billion awarded shows just how quickly we’re getting these funds out the door and into communities so they can make a real difference for the American people,” climate envoy John Podesta <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/biden-pushes-out-over-100-billion-clean-energy-grants-term-winds-down-2024-12-03/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em><em>Reuters</em></em>. And another official said the administration will exceed its goal of obligating more than 80% of the available IRA grant money by the end of Biden’s term, explaining that this would mean the funds are protected: “They are subject to the terms of the contract, so when those contracts are signed and executed, this becomes a matter of contract law more than a matter of politics.”
</p><h3>5. Study: Arctic could see first ice-free day by 2027</h3><p>
	The Arctic could experience its first ice-free summer day before 2030, perhaps even by 2027, according to a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54508-3?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em><em>Nature Communications.</em></em> The international research team behind the study used multiple computer models and simulations to make the projection, which is “unlikely” but becoming more plausible as greenhouse gas emissions rise. Extreme weather events – like a series of exceptionally warm years – <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-12-countdown-ice-free-arctic-timelines.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8O7lD2UatJshYp5wvzgwxl19T8i5wpPhh6_w6ZWLMceHR2x58xjXvBAoN-BPpi6sDG6o7E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could trigger</a> rapid melting leading to an ice-free day or days. Such an event could “have cascading effects on the rest of the climate system,” the authors wrote. “It would notably enhance the warming of the upper ocean, accelerating sea ice loss year round and therefore further accelerating climate change, and could also induce more extreme events at mid-latitudes.”

## Trust, blame and how the American economy feels

date: 2024-12-04, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Today, we&#8217;re taking a closer look at how people are feeling in this economy. Salaries for Americans are still increasing, but many think their pay isn&#8217;t keeping up with inflation. The data doesn&#8217;t bear this out. So what&#8217;s behind the disconnect? We&#8217;re also joined Alissa Quart, executive director of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, who discusses Americans&#8217; perceptions of the economy, the politics of resentment and the importance of building a working-class media.</p>

## A political crisis in South Korea sparks market jitters

date: 2024-12-04, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> South Korea is experiencing political chaos after the president&#8217;s attempt to impose martial law backfired. The turmoil has rattled financial markets in Asia&#8217;s fourth largest economy. We&#8217;ll also journey to France, where the prime minister faces a no-confidence vote today, threatening to topple his minority government. Plus, the cost for live music events is high. We head to Sydney, Australia, to hear how the industry is doing.</p>

## How Democrats Are Trying to Trump-Proof Their Big Climate Law

date: 2024-12-04, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTA4MDA5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTM4NjAyOH0.c8iOin4CRBaQ4-nx6VWyCudbGZgNVfdzl43PMN-82GI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, is the biggest investment in clean energy in American history. It is also in danger. In January, the Trump administration and a GOP Congress will take over the federal government — and they have made a variety of promises about how they’ll disrupt the law, ranging from full repeal to a more “surgical” reform approach.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with <a href="https://www.aspenideas.org/speakers/kristina-costa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kristina Costa</u></a>, who has worked since 2022 to implement the IRA’s climate provisions at the White House. She joins us to discuss what went right about the Biden administration’s rush to implement the law, why state government capacity is holding back Democratic policy goals, and why the federal government needs more tools to support energy innovation if it wants to keep up with China. She also discusses how the administration is trying to Trump-proof the law. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote><strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>What do you hear from the companies? And I guess from your vantage point, are they beginning to do the lobbying work you feel like they should be doing to protect the parts of the law that are working?<br/> <br/><strong>Kristina Costa: </strong>I think they are. You know, we hear a lot of anxiety, as you can imagine, which is —<br/><br/><strong>Meyer: </strong>Theme of this period.<br/><br/><strong>Costa: </strong>Theme of this period is that there’s a lot of anxiety. And our hope is, and our belief is that they will turn that anxiety into action, in terms of educating members of Congress about how the law actually works and how it is underpinning the investments that they’re making.<br/><br/>And I think, you know, to take a step back and talk about policy for a little bit, one of the things, I think, that is not well understood in the rhetoric about how the different pieces of the Inflation Reduction Act actually work together is that — you know, we have provisions that are incentivizing investments in manufacturing, and people are generally pretty excited about that. We also have provisions that are incentivizing adoption of the technologies that are being manufactured. And in some cases people are pretty excited about that, and in other cases, it has been turned into a bit of a political cudgel. But the fact of the matter is that those two things are pretty interdependent.<br/><br/>So, for instance, we have what is called the 45X advanced manufacturing production tax credit, and that is largely a per-unit tax credit that goes to manufacturers of a specified list of clean energy components, including batteries for electric vehicles, as well as for grid storage. And we have seen just gangbusters investment in the EV battery space since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. It has set the United States up to be an EV battery manufacturing powerhouse. And this is, of course, an area of importance for the clean energy transition. It is also an area of incredible importance for U.S. energy security, given the currently dominant market position that China plays, that China holds in the EV battery supply chain.<br/><br/>And I think people generally think this is pretty good. But one of the reasons besides the 45X credit just providing a strong, straight-up incentive to invest in the United States and make these things in the United States is that the much-maligned 30D new clean vehicle tax credit that provides a subsidy to individuals to buy electric vehicles that are made in the United States has a bunch of pretty stringent requirements about the sourcing of batteries and of critical minerals contained within those vehicles in order to be eligible for the tax credit. And so you have both incentives to manufacture, but you also basically have incentives to provide support for the offtake of what those manufacturers are actually producing.<br/> <br/>Those two things go hand in hand, and I don’t think that is well understood in the political rhetoric.<br/></blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule">

## A Standardized Test for Carbon Removal

date: 2024-12-04, from: Heatmap News

In came the <a href="https://www.carbon-direct.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>consulting firms</u></a> staffed by scientists to advise companies on which credits to buy, <a href="https://bezerocarbon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ratings agencies</u></a> to assess individual carbon projects, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/isometric-carbon-credits" target="_self"><u>carbon credit registries</u></a> with new business models that promised to be more scrupulous than those that came before.</p>
<p>But to Peter Minor, none of these players is getting at the root issue. So Minor, an alum of the carbon removal advocacy group Carbon180, is launching his own company, Absolute Climate, to solve what he sees as the two biggest problems in the carbon credit market: inconsistent accounting and conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>“If we don’t fix these things, the carbon removal industry may never get to the trust and adoption that it’s going to need to get to enough scale to actually reduce harms,” Minor told me.</p>
<p>Absolute Climate’s solution is a new standard, or set of rules, for accounting for the climate benefits of carbon removal projects that would ensure carbon credits from different projects are comparable on an apples to apples basis. That is, as long as it’s widely accepted by a market that’s fraught with divisions. </p>
<p>To date, the registries — the businesses that certify and sell carbon credits — have been the ones to create and oversee accounting standards. But the registries have an incentive to set permissive requirements, Minor said, because the more credits they certify, the more they can sell. This arrangement has resulted in standards that all use slightly different criteria to account for how much carbon has been removed. These differences show up not just across registries, but also within registries across different types of projects.</p>
<p>Here’s an illustrative example: Climeworks is a company that builds industrial-scale plants to suck carbon out of the air, compress it, and inject it underground. Under the carbon removal registry Puro’s standard, Climeworks must take into account the emissions related to clearing the land, building the plant, powering it, transporting the captured carbon, and injecting it before coming up with the net total tons of carbon the plant has removed and the number of credits the company can sell. </p>
<p>Compare that to Red Trail Energy, which owned a corn ethanol refinery and <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-is-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>recently began capturing carbon</u></a> emitted from the facility’s fermentation tank and injecting it underground. Corn absorbs carbon from the atmosphere as it grows, and Red Trail puts away some of that carbon permanently. But to calculate how many carbon removal credits Red Trail can sell based on this project, Puro does not require the company to account for the emissions associated with growing the corn, transporting it to the plant, or heating it up using a natural gas boiler. Nor does it require measurement of the emissions released when the ethanol is burned in a vehicle. If it did, all those emissions would exceed the amount of carbon Red Trail is storing.</p>
<p>On the Puro registry, Climeworks’ credits and Red Trail’s credits are identical, both advertised as carbon removal. But to Minor, the credits are fundamentally different — one is a truly net-negative process, the other reduces emissions to the atmosphere from an existing source. Once the world has cut carbon nearly to zero, only the first project could provide a counterweight to any residual emissions and help halt or even reverse warming. Minor worries that if both are called carbon removal, the difference won’t be clear until it’s too late.</p>
<p>“We might get to the point where we’ve scaled up the infrastructure and the political economies around certain projects because they were cheaper or more efficient in our minds, but actually it’s just that they weren’t net-negative,” he said. “So we may put ourselves in a position where we can’t actually meet our climate goals.”</p>
<p>Minor is not alone in this concern. Several recent peer-reviewed papers have <a href="https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wene.540" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>identified this as a pervasive issue</u></a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332224004226" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed ideas for how to solve it</u></a>. “Big picture, we want net flux of carbon out of the atmosphere into storage,” Anu Khan, founder of the non-profit <a href="https://www.carbonremovalstandards.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Carbon Removal Standards Initiative</u></a>, told me. “We want to set rules that motivate this and allow us to add it up over time.”</p>
<p>Absolute Climate’s solution is based on a framework developed by scientists from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Minor described it as a single standard that verifiers can apply in exactly the same way to every method of carbon removal and determine whether a given project is net-negative or not. Each type of carbon removal, like enhanced rock weathering or direct air capture, will still require individualized rules for how it should conduct physical measurements, he said. But the project scope — the question of <em><em>what</em></em> to measure — will be consistent.</p>
<p>In practice this doesn’t seem like a major paradigm shift. It requires project developers to identify all the activities associated with their project that either release or store carbon, measure each one, and add them together to get the net result. The main difference is that they can’t selectively ignore certain emissions in the calculation if, for example, those emissions are related to a co-product like ethanol.</p>
<p>To meet Absolute’s standard, a project must also be able to store carbon for 1,000 years, similar to the amount of time carbon emissions stay in the atmosphere. That’s in contrast to most standards, which have different requirements depending on the project type. For example, reforestation and soil carbon storage projects typically only have to store carbon for 100 years, while any project injecting carbon underground has to promise 1,000 years.</p>
<p>Any carbon credit registry can adopt the standard, and the company will earn a fee for each project certified under it, rather than for the number of credits certified. One registry, called Evident, which sells renewable energy credits, has already agreed to use it.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to imagine other registries that have invested significant time into developing standards — and certified credits using them — throwing those out anytime soon. When I wrote about <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/what-is-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>the questions raised by the Red Trail Energy project</u></a> earlier this year, Puro defended its rules. Marianne Tikkanen, Puro’s co-founder and head of standards, said the point of carbon credits is to pay for an intervention that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. In this case, that meant it was appropriate to isolate the carbon capture and storage part of the project when it came to certifying credits, she said. </p>
<p>Adding yet another layer between buyers and sellers could also increase costs. “There are market pressures that drive towards vertical integration of registries that do everything,” Khan told me. “Cost savings are a really big deal. Companies want to buy credits at the lowest cost that is good enough for the type of claim that they want to make.”</p>
<p>Absolute will face competition, both in the literal market and in the marketplace of ideas, from Isometric, a registry <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/isometric-carbon-credits" target="_self"><u>my colleague Katie Brigham wrote about</u></a> earlier this year. Isometric has tried to address the conflict of interest problem by charging fees to buyers — not sellers — for verifying carbon credits.</p>
<p>In setting such a high bar, Absolute also risks having a chilling effect on the carbon removal industry by blocking promising projects that are working through yet-unproven science or have other early-stage growing pains from a key source of funding. As a solution, Absolute plans to designate some projects as part of an “innovative class.” One example Minor gave me is a new direct air capture company that can’t procure enough renewable energy to power its pilot plant and has to run using dirty power. “We can allow them to take those shortcuts where it makes sense, assuming their buyers or the governments that they’re delivering to are okay with that, but we’re going to be transparent about it,” he said. </p>
<p>In short, there will be two classes of credits under the Absolute standard — those that really, definitely, represent carbon removed from the atmosphere, and those that may or may not but support projects that maybe one day could.</p>
<p>This is all a lot to make sense of, and it’s possible Absolute could introduce <em><em>more</em></em> confusion into the market with all these new terms and definitions. </p>
<p>“This is most valuable, I think, for those people who care about whether or not what they are investing in can play that future role of being actual carbon removal,” Corinne Scown, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory whose work influenced the Absolute standard, told me. But for those who just want to fund projects that help fight climate change, the distinction matters less, she said. “Mitigation is still really valuable. We do want people to have a way to pay for that.”</p>
<p>While there are some companies trying to do the former, most are aiming mainly to reduce the amount of emissions on their annual sustainability reports. Today, these reports are voluntary and companies can use whatever math suits them. But soon they will be required by governments such as the European Union and the state of California, which will have rules about how companies should calculate their carbon footprints. Depending on how those rules are implemented, the distinction between an Absolute-certified carbon credit and a Puro-certified carbon credit could matter a great deal.</p>

## Biden visits US-financed Angolan rail hub

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

Lobito, Angola — U.S. President Joe Biden got a firsthand look Wednesday at a U.S.-financed rail project that weaves together his personal love of railroads with his desire to leave a legacy in Africa that will outlive his administration.


The Lobito Corridor is a 1,300-kilometer rail line stretching from copper-rich Zambia to the port of Lobito in the southwest nation of Angola. The railway is meant to form a “strategic economic corridor” under the Biden administration’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, an initiative meant to counter China’s well-established, sprawling Belt and Road Initiative. So far, the Biden administration says it has committed nearly $4 billion toward the project.


In Angola’s capital, Luanda, on Tuesday, Biden cast the project through his love of passenger rail. As a U.S. senator, he commuted frequently to Washington from Wilmington, Delaware — logging nearly 340 kilometers on every trip, he said.




“I must tell you up front with American press here, I’m probably the most pro-rail guy in America,” Biden said to laughter from the audience gathered to hear him speak at the nation’s slavery museum.


On Wednesday, he toured the Lobito Port terminal and met with Angolan President Joao Lourenco, Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema and Tanzanian Vice President Philip Mpango.


During a visit to a food processing factory, Biden noted the importance of the Lobito Corridor in exporting resources, as well as regional integration and development.


"We're at one of those transition points in world history," the U.S. president said, noting the railway will reduce travel time across Africa.


"All these projects and investments are designed to have high impact,” he said.


Biden announced the United States will invest $600 million more to upgrade the railway and further develop the Lobito Corridor.


"The United States understands that how we invest in Africa is just as important as how much we invest in Africa,” he said.




Same or different?


Senior administration officials said this rail line will, by the end of the decade, be extended to its full length, stretching from Africa’s Indian Ocean coast to the Atlantic port. Initially, it will transport critical minerals such as cobalt and copper from the continent’s deep interior to the coast. When the corridor is completed, a journey that now takes more than 40 days by road can zip across the continent in 40 hours.


“The premise behind the corridor is to be able to take American support and financial capabilities that are limited, and to focus them more deeply in one area, versus spreading that financial support and effort across many countries,” said a senior Biden administration official, who was not identified as is common practice when briefing reporters.


VOA asked the official whether this repeats the colonial narrative of exploiting the continent’s rich, raw resources while not adding value and providing steady work for local populations. A burgeoning youth population on the continent has created an urgent need for jobs, putting strain on many African governments.


“I disagree with the premise that this is for raw products,” the official replied. “Right now, only raw product is coming out. But I think what this rail does — in order to get to higher-value products, you need a few things. One of them is affordable and reliable and abundant energy. So the build out of the energy system allows you to then build the value added.”


Others questioned whether this U.S. effort, coming more than a decade after China launched its ambitious Belt and Road initiative, can compete.


“Upon closer inspection, it appears to be a mimic of China’s playbook, one that tacitly acknowledges that Washington lags behind Beijing in terms of its investments in Africa but does little to fill the void that exists in China’s footprint,” said Chris O. Ogunmodede, an editor, consultant and analyst of African politics, security and international relations.


Wang Peng, a researcher at Renmin University of China, published on a Chinese state thinktank, International Cooperation Center, that Western international projects like the Lobito Corridor don’t pose a challenge to China’s initiative because the United States “can’t provide sufficient funds and material conditions to truly implement its ambitious global infrastructure plan.”


Wang Peng also noted the U.S. could undermine it by exerting "diplomatic pressure on host countries to force them to tear up cooperation agreements with China; exaggerate the negative impact of the 'Belt and Road' project on the local ecological environment and water resources … and hype up the so-called 'debt trap' issue."


Mounting Chinese debt among African nations is something Biden also mentioned indirectly in his remarks Tuesday, in seeking to cast the U.S. as a reliable partner.


“We’ve also pushed to ensure that developing nations do not have to choose between paying down unsustainable debt and being able to invest in their own people,” he said.


But, as Biden also said, his time is running short as he prepares to leave office. Analysts say this project may be well-received by President-elect Donald Trump, as it suits his more transactional approach to the continent and appeals to one of Trump’s biggest backers, billionaire Elon Musk.


“The money has been earmarked already after all,” said James Murphy of Clark University in Massachusetts. “Continuing the Lobito project is a smart idea — Trump does not have to own it except in the sense that it gives him a talking point about our strategic/resource-driven interests in Africa, particularly as a strategy to acquire minerals essential for Elon’s Teslas, as it were.”

## To save a dying swamp, Louisiana aims to restore the Mississippi River's natural flow

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

GARYVILLE, La.  — Louisiana has long relied on a vast levee system to rein in the Mississippi River and protect surrounding communities from flooding. But cutting off the natural flow of the river with man-made barriers has been slowly killing one of the nation's largest forested wetlands.


The 456 square kilometers of Maurepas Swamp just to the west of New Orleans holds Louisiana's second-largest contiguous forest, a state wildlife refuge filled with water tupelo and bald cypress trees, their branches adorned by wisps of Spanish moss. A beloved recreation site, the swamp also houses bald eagles, ospreys, black bears and alligators and serves as a waystation for hundreds of different migratory birds.


Deprived of nutrients from the stanched Mississippi River, the swamp's iconic trees are dying in stagnant water. Yet they're now set to receive a life-saving boost.


State and federal authorities on Tuesday celebrated breaking ground on an ambitious conservation project intended to replenish the ailing trees by diverting water from the Mississippi back into the swamp.


"This is about reconnecting a natural system, actually fixing it to what it used to be," said Brad Miller, who has shepherded the project for the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority since 2006.


Miller likened the $330 million river diversion to watering a garden: "The swamp needs river water to be a good swamp."


The River Reintroduction into Maurepas Swamp will allow for a maximum of 57 cubic meters per second to flow out of a gated opening to be built in the levee system and routed along a 9 9-kilometer diversion channel. The project expects to revitalize around 182 square kilometers of swamp in an area where less than a third of the forest is considered healthy according to the U.S. Geological Survey.


Besides injecting much-needed nutrients and oxygen into the swamp, river water will leave thin layers of sediment deposits that mitigate the effect of subsidence — a natural phenomenon on Louisiana's fragile coast exacerbated by fossil fuel extraction — and climate change-induced sea level rise, said Nick Stevens, a researcher at Southeastern Louisiana University's wetlands ecology and restoration lab. Healthier forests bolster the swamp with decomposing matter from branches and leaves, he added.


"All of that is completely hindered by not having the Mississippi River attached to it anymore," Stevens said. "You've got all this land sinking as a result of just not getting nutrients."


The swamp's diminishing health has had ripple effects on biodiversity, says Erik Johnson, director of conservation science at Audubon Delta, an organization focused on bird ecology in the Mississippi River delta. Some migratory birds like the yellow-throated warbler, prothonotary warbler and the northern parula have had their populations plummet by nearly 50% in the past two decades, Johnson said.


These birds rely on caterpillars who are dependent on water tupelo and bald cypress foliage. When there are fewer healthy leaves for the caterpillars to gorge on, there's less food for the birds.


"That's driving a really rapid decline in these bird populations that depend on this one forest," Johnson said. "The whole system has shifted."


Scientists say they expect to start seeing an increase in canopy cover and new tree growth within a few years of the project's anticipated completion in 2028.


Unlike the state's controversial $3 billion river diversion project intended to combat coastal land loss, the Maurepas project has received widespread support from elected officials and local communities.


The Maurepas project is primarily funded by the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, a multi-state and federal program managing settlement funds from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that devastated the Gulf Coast.


The Maurepas project benefits from an innovative partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is building an adjacent 30-kilometer levee system to protect several southeast Louisiana parishes. The Corps will count 36 square kilometers of Maurepas Swamp restoration towards offsetting environmental damage caused by the new levee construction, meaning it can direct additional federal funds toward the diversion program.


"For every dollar the state can save here, they have more to invest" in other coastal restoration projects, said John Ettinger, director of policy and environmental compliance with Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council.


And conservationists say the Maurepas reintroduction project highlights the importance of coastal protection and wetlands restoration going hand in hand in a hurricane-prone region.


"You're going to have a healthier ecosystem on the outside of that levee, which means you're going to have a better buffer for storm surge and it's going to allow the levees to be more effective," said Amanda Moore, National Wildlife Federation's Gulf Program senior director. "This is how we need to be thinking at large about what's possible and how we can how we can do more effective conservation by working with nature."

## US conducts 'self-defense' strike in Syria

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — The Pentagon says the U.S. military carried out a strike in "self-defense" in eastern Syria on Tuesday, destroying several weapons systems. 


Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters that the military struck three truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers, a T-64 tank and mortars that presented a "clear and imminent threat to U.S. and coalition forces" in the vicinity of Military Support Site Euphrates. 


"The self-defense strike occurred after the mobile multiple rocket launchers fired rockets in the vicinity of MSS Euphrates and mortars were fired toward U.S. forces," he said, adding that the strike was "not linked to any broader activities in northwest Syria by other groups." 


Ryder said the U.S. was "still assessing" who was operating the weapons that were struck on Tuesday. The U.S. was aware of Syrian military forces that operate in the area and Iranian-backed militia groups in the area that have conducted attacks on MSS Euphrates in the past, according to Ryder, but could not confirm who was responsible for Tuesday's attack. 


U.S. forces are in Syria to help Syrian Democratic Forces prevent the Islamic State group from resurging. 


Last week, U.S. Central Command forces used A-10 fighter aircraft to hit a target threatening U.S. and coalition forces at MSS Euphrates.  


"Individuals were observed preparing a rocket rail," Ryder told reporters. 


David Adesnik, vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the U.S. should not consider pulling out its forces from Syria in response to increased fighting across the country, especially if it wants to keep the pressure on Islamic State. 


He said the terror group has already been "substantially more effective" in areas under the control of Syrian President Bashar Assad. 


"We are the ones sort of keeping the cork in the bottle. ISIS would have a lot more room for maneuver. ... It doesn't get much coverage, but they are inflicting pain on Assad's troops," Adesnik said. ISIS is another name for the Islamic State group.

## Trump's lawyers urge judge to toss hush money criminal conviction

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

New York  — President-elect Donald Trump's lawyers formally asked a judge Monday to throw out his hush money criminal conviction, arguing that continuing the case would present unconstitutional "disruptions to the institution of the Presidency."


In a filing made public Tuesday, Trump's lawyers told Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan that anything short of immediate dismissal would undermine the transition of power, as well as the "overwhelming national mandate" granted to Trump by voters last month.


They also cited President Joe Biden's recent pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, who had been convicted of tax and gun charges.


"President Biden asserted that his son was 'selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' and 'treated differently,'" Trump's legal team wrote.


Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, they claimed, had engaged in the type of political theater "that President Biden condemned."


Prosecutors will have until Dec. 9 to respond. They have said they will fight any efforts to dismiss the case but have indicated a willingness to delay the sentencing until after Trump's second term ends in 2029. In their filing Monday, Trump's attorneys dismissed the idea of holding off sentencing until Trump is out of office as a "ridiculous suggestion."


Following Trump's election victory last month, Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed his sentencing, previously scheduled for late November, to allow the defense and prosecution to weigh in on the future of the case. He also delayed a decision on Trump's prior bid to dismiss the case on immunity grounds.


Trump has been fighting for months to reverse his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to suppress her claim that they had sex a decade earlier. He says they did not and denies any wrongdoing.


The defense filing was signed by Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who represented Trump during the trial and have since been selected by the president-elect to fill senior roles at the Justice Department.


Taking a swipe at Bragg and New York City, as Trump often did throughout the trial, the filing argues that dismissal would also benefit the public by giving him and "the numerous prosecutors assigned to this case a renewed opportunity to put an end to deteriorating conditions in the City and to protect its residents from violent crime."


Clearing Trump, the lawyers added, would also allow him to "to devote all of his energy to protecting the Nation."


Merchan hasn't yet set a timetable for a decision. He could decide to uphold the verdict and proceed to sentencing, delay the case until Trump leaves office, wait until a federal appeals court rules on Trump's parallel effort to get the case moved out of state court or choose some other option.


An outright dismissal of the New York case would further lift a legal cloud that at one point carried the prospect of derailing Trump's political future.


Last week, special counsel Jack Smith told courts that he was withdrawing both federal cases against Trump — one charging him with hoarding classified documents at his Florida estate, the other with scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election he lost — citing longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a president from indictment while in office.


The hush money case was the only one of Trump's four criminal indictments to go to trial, resulting in a historic verdict that made him the first former president to be convicted of a crime.


If the verdict stands and the case proceeds to sentencing, Trump's punishments would range from a fine to probation to up to four years in prison — but it's unlikely he'd spend any time behind bars for a first-time conviction involving charges in the lowest tier of felonies.


Because it is a state case, Trump would not be able to pardon himself once he returns to office.

## Chinese hackers still lurk in US telecommunications systems

date: 2024-12-04, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Chinese hackers blamed for compromising U.S. telecommunications infrastructure and spying on American presidential campaigns and American officials are still entrenched in those systems, according to senior U.S. officials who warn it could be years before the hackers are kicked out.


The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI on Tuesday urged U.S. telecommunication companies and their customers to take additional precautions, saying the breach might go deeper than first thought.


"We cannot say with certainty that the adversary has been evicted because we still don't know the scope of what they're doing," Jeff Greene, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a briefing with reporters.


"We cannot with confidence say that we know everything, nor would our partners," Greene said. "We're still trying to understand."


A senior FBI official who also spoke with reporters was equally cautious.


"Understanding the scope of the adversary activity through our investigations, in a situation of this magnitude, is measured in years," the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the breach investigation.


The Chinese-linked hackers have been coy, adjusting their behavior as more information about their activities becomes public.


"As more comes to light they change their TTPs [tactics, techniques and procedures] and their approach," the official warned. "They may go dormant for a while to lower their profile."


Word of the breach emerged in October, when the Chinese-linked cyber gang known as Salt Typhoon was linked to efforts to intercept communications for the presidential campaigns of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris.




Less than a month later, CISA and the FBI warned that the Chinese efforts to spy on the Trump and Harris campaigns were just the start of "a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign" that penetrated multiple U.S. telecommunication companies.




China has repeatedly denied the U.S. allegations, accusing Washington of a smear campaign aimed at undermining Beijing.


"For quite some time, the US side has patched up all sorts of disinformation about threats of 'Chinese hackers' to serve its own geopolitical purposes," Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email Tuesday regarding the latest allegations.


"China firmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks," Liu said. "The US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China."


But U.S. officials have repeatedly pushed back against Chinese denials, and now say the Chinese breach goes even further than initially thought, impacting telecommunication companies around the world, and that it appears to be part of a larger Chinese government effort to gather information about adversaries worldwide.


"Certainly, the way they went about it was very, very specific," the senior FBI official said, noting the focus on telecommunications infrastructure and internet service providers. "But it fits into the cyber espionage bucket to really inform global goals for the Chinese."


Neither CISA nor the FBI would say how many telecommunication companies or how many countries have been impacted.


But the agencies said the Chinese efforts in the U.S. fall into three categories: individual communications, customer call records and U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders.


The focus on individual communications appears to be on intercepting audio of phone calls and the content of text messages for a select number of high-profile U.S. government officials, such as individuals with the Trump and Harris campaigns.


The mass collection of customer call records appears to be more random.


"Essentially, they stole data about where, when and whom individuals were communicating with," said the senior FBI official.


"We don't believe that those were specifically targeted," the official added. "We essentially think that they were essentially swept up by the adversary."


The officials said the third category of intercepted information, related to law enforcement requests and court orders, also appears to have been targeted somewhat by chance.


Forensic analysis in two of the instances in which the Chinese hackers accessed law enforcement information "has indicated that the actors were on other parts of their network conducting reconnaissance before pivoting to the [law enforcement portal] and surrounding devices," the FBI official said.


Just how far the Chinese hackers got, though, is not clear.


Officials said the hacked portal does include some court orders that relate to foreign intelligence collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act but declined to say whether any of that information was taken by the China-linked hackers.


"We're not prepared to answer that question today," the senior FBI official said.


For now, the FBI and CISA are urging telecommunications companies to harden their defenses, issuing an advisory with cyber agencies in Canada, Australia and New Zealand on steps they can take to reduce the threat.


They also urged companies that think they may have been victimized to come forward.


"The companies that have worked closest with us are the furthest along and kicking the actors off their networks," the senior FBI official said.


The FBI and CISA are likewise urging consumers to be more vigilant about security, whether that means keeping mobile phones and other devices current with security updates, or by using encrypted platforms for messaging and other communications.


"We are not seeing any novel techniques," said CISA's Greene, adding that the Chinese-linked hackers seem to have simply exploited known vulnerabilities in the telecommunications infrastructure environment.


"Encryption is your friend, whether it is on text messaging or if you have the capacity to use encrypted voice communications," Greene said. "Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is encrypted, it will make it impossible, if not really hard for them, to detect it."

## Uneven churn

date: 2024-12-04, from: Market Place

<p>About 3.3 million people quit their jobs in October, slightly more than in September. More quits can signal a strong labor market, but quit rates vary across the country. In this episode, why job churn is strong out West and falling in the Northeast.

## Trump's choice to run DEA withdraws from consideration

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Chad Chronister, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to run the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Tuesday he was withdrawing his name from consideration. Chronister is the second person selected by the president-elect to bow out quickly after being nominated for a position.


Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, said in a post on X that he was backing away from the opportunity, which he called "the honor of a lifetime."


"Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I've concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration," Chronister wrote.


He did not elaborate, and Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.


Trump's pick of Chronister for the post drew backlash from conservatives, including for past comments he made that his sheriff's office was not focused on enforcing federal immigration laws.


Chronister follows former Republican congressman Matt Gaetz, Trump's first choice to serve as attorney general, in withdrawing his name for a post in the administration. Gaetz withdrew following scrutiny over a federal sex trafficking investigation that cast doubt on his ability to be confirmed as the nation's chief federal law enforcement officer.


The DEA post requires Senate confirmation.

## From VOA Russian: Russian woman in New York accused of working for FSB: What is known about her?

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

The FBI has charged Nomma Zarubina, a Russian national living in New York, with two counts of making false statements to FBI agents regarding her ties to Russian intelligence services.


According to the FBI, Zarubina sought connections with U.S. journalists, military personnel, and think tank experts on behalf of Russian intelligence agencies. Court documents reveal that she initially lied to U.S. authorities about her ties to FSB but later admitted to cooperating with FSB agents.

## Trump's tariffs: Mapping the economic ripple effects

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs are poised to significantly impact countries with substantial trade volumes with the United States. The primary nations affected include China, Mexico and Canada, which are among the largest U.S. trading partners.


Trump has said that tariffs can help his administration pay for proposed tax cuts. But these tariffs are expected to disrupt trade flows, potentially leading to increased consumer prices in the U.S. and prompting retaliatory measures from the affected countries. Industries such as automotive, agriculture and technology may experience significant impacts due to their reliance on imports and exports with these nations.

## These Battery Startups Think They Can Succeed Where Northvolt Failed

date: 2024-12-03, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTA5ODYzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDI3NDIzNH0.pgODBvHDpijIlXaMOBNl_H7EqsT24o9fdO51xW-3UCw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">By the time the Swedish battery giant Northvolt declared bankruptcy last month, a well-funded U.S. startup, Lyten, had already swooped in to snatch up the company’s previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/lyten-buys-battery-manufacturing-assets-from-beleaguered-northvolt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shuttered Bay Area factory</u></a>. With China flooding the market with its cheap lithium-ion tech, Lyten is betting that creating a fully domestic battery supply chain will require alternate chemistries — like, say, lithium-sulfur, Lyten’s recipe of choice. </p><p>Lithium-sulfur has long been a promising contender, as in theory, these batteries can have a much higher energy density — the amount of energy that can be stored in a given space — than traditional lithium-ion. They also rely primarily on cheap, abundant, and easy to access materials. “We don’t use nickel, we don’t use manganese, we don’t use cobalt, we don’t use graphite,” Keith Norman, Lyten’s chief sustainability officer, told me — all markets where China plays a leading role. Scaling up standard lithium-ion battery production to meet forecasted global demand would <a href="https://techinformed.com/almost-400-new-mines-needed-to-meet-future-ev-battery-demand-data-finds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>require opening nearly 400 new mines</u></a> by 2035, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. “We believe if you could snap your fingers and change that to lithium-sulfur, that mining requirement will be reduced somewhere between 80% and 90%,” Norman said. </p><p>Lyten’s customers, Norman said, want these batteries as soon as possible, and acquiring Northvolt’s old 200-megawatt plant will allow the company to begin commercial production there next year. Lyten also recently announced plans for a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241015561495/en/Lyten-Announces-Plans-to-Build-the-World%E2%80%99s-First-Lithium-Sulfur-Battery-Gigafactory-in-Nevada" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Reno-based gigafactory</u></a>, which is scheduled to come online in 2027. Zeta Energy, a Houston-based lithium-sulfur startup, also aims to commercialize in 2025, and is set to announce the opening of its 100-megawatt plant in the coming weeks. </p><p>While both companies have dreams of enabling more efficient, lightweight, and cost-effective electric vehicles and energy storage systems, there are reasons why lithium-sulfur has yet to be commercialized. </p><p>For one, sulfur is generally a poor conductor of lithium ions, and therefore requires extra conductive material to compensate, increasing the battery’s weight. Lithium-sulfur batteries also have notoriously short cycle lives due to the “polysulfide shuttle effect,” which causes the sulfur in the cathode to dissolve in the liquid electrolyte, damaging the anode and — you guessed it — decreasing the battery’s capacity and cycle life. </p><p>“It could be solved,” Arumugam Manthiram, an engineering professor and battery researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. After being involved in the initial lithium-ion battery breakthroughs of the 1980s, Manthiram said he’s seen traditional battery tech continue to improve year after year. He thinks lithium-sulfur will follow the same trajectory, only quicker. “Can it be solved in five years, 10 years? I’m optimistic.” he told me. He’s currently working with Lyten on a <a href="https://lyten.com/2024/01/30/lyten-secures-4-million-u-s-department-of-energy-grant-to-accelerate-commercialization-of-high-capacity-long-cycle-life-lithium-sulfur-batteries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department of Energy-funded grant</u></a> to accelerate the commercialization of lithium-sulfur batteries for use in EVs. </p><p>Zeta thinks it’s already found the ticket, though. It claims to offer three times the energy density of traditional lithium-ion at less than half the price. While Melissa Schilling, Zeta’s head of strategic marketing and innovation, couldn’t reveal much about Zeta’s proprietary cathode, she did tell me that it’s made of a sulfur-carbon polymer that eliminates the dreaded polysulfide shuttle effect (a claim that’s been <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zeta-energy-receives-third-party-verification-that-its-lithium-sulfur-battery-is-polysulfide-free-301811724.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>externally verified</u></a>) <em><em>and</em></em> allows for greater electrical conductivity. The company’s lithium-metal anode is made of <a href="https://zetaenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/vertically-aligned-CNT-on-foil-07282022.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>carbon nanotubes</u></a>, a.k.a. tiny cylinders composed of carbon atoms. The nanotubes help improve the anode’s stability, thus increasing energy density compared with traditional graphite anodes while also preventing the formation of dendrites, tiny projections on the anode that can cause the battery to break down. </p><p>Zeta’s batteries can go through about eight times more charge/discharge cycles than traditional lithium-sulfur batteries, according to the company’s figures and Manthiram’s estimation of a typical life cycle. Optimizing these batteries for EVs, though, will likely mean a much shorter cycle life, which may not be on par with what lithium-ion can do. Even so, Schilling told me, “what we’re going to beat lithium-ion on is density and cost.” The company has raised $30 million to date, and is in the midst of raising its Series B round. While Schilling couldn’t reveal the names of Zeta’s initial customers, she told me that the company is collaborating with a large automaker and heavy equipment manufacturer. Zeta has also received the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zeta-energy-awarded-us-department-of-energy-grant-for-4-million-project-to-advance-higher-performing-domestic-lithium-sulfur-batteries-for-greater-range-in-evs-302057838.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>same commercialization grant</u></a> from the DOE as Lyten.</p><p>For its part, Lyten currently provides 25% greater energy density than top-of-the-line lithium-ion batteries, Norman told me. The company expects that soon, it will be able to offer twice the energy density at half the material cost. Lyten’s tech relies upon a so-called supermaterial, <a href="https://lyten.com/technology/3d-graphene/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three-dimensional graphene</u></a>, which it’s developing in-house. This gets <a href="https://lyten.com/products/lithium-sulfur-batteries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>combined with sulfur in the cathode</u></a> to form a more conductive and stable composite material. </p><p>Norman said you can think of 3D graphene like a sponge with pore sizes “perfectly designed to hold sulfur atoms.” The graphene “gives [the sulfur] conductivity and gives it a rigid structure that doesn’t allow it to break down as easily,” he told me, meaning the battery is less likely to succumb to the polysulfide shuttle effect. Lyten’s anode is also made of energy dense lithium-metal. </p><p>Lyten hasn’t publicly revealed its battery’s cycle life, however, and in a follow-up email, Norman told me that when it comes to EV batteries, Lyten is “not yet at the cycle life we need,” though the company is “seeing 20-30% improvement in lithium-sulfur battery performance each year.” For customers using lithium-sulfur for earlier-stage applications such as drones, satellites, and two- and three-wheelers, Norman wrote that Lyten’s current cycle life “meets or very nearly meets their requirements.” </p><p>The company seems to have the money to work towards these improvements. Lyten <a href="https://lyten.com/2024/01/04/lyten-is-one-of-only-44-new-unicorns-that-were-minted-in-north-america-in-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>achieved “unicorn” status</u></a> last year, recording a valuation over $1 billion after closing a <a href="https://lyten.com/2023/09/13/lyten-raises-200-million-in-series-b-equity-round/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$200 million Series B round</u></a>. It counts Stellantis and FedEx among its backers, and the Department of Defense is even funding a demonstration of Lyten’s battery tech <a href="https://lyten.com/2024/09/12/lyten-lithium-sulfur-battery-technology-chosen-to-be-demonstrated-on-the-international-space-station/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>aboard the International Space Station</u></a>, where lithium-sulfur cells will be tested for use in everything from satellites to space suits. </p><p>Norman told me the company’s recent purchase of Northvolt’s old Bay Area facility represents an important step in Lyten’s path to scale. The California plant was originally designed to produce lithium-metal batteries for Cuberg, a startup Northvolt acquired in 2021 and closed down this summer. Like Lyten’s and Zeta’s, Cuberg’s batteries used a pure lithium-metal anode, while its cathode was the same old nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry that conventional lithium-ion batteries use. With this kind of chemistry, Norman told me, it would be “very difficult to ever compete on costs.” </p><p>One of the main ways that Northvolt ultimately went wrong, Norman and Schilling agreed, is that it tried to scale standard lithium-ion tech too quickly in a price-sensitive environment. “They kind of went right to these 10, 20, 30 gigawatt-hour facilities,” Norman told me. “As they tried to scale those, they ran into a lot of manufacturing challenges and just the cost and time of trying to learn that on these huge facilities kind of bit them.” Schilling told me she thinks QuantumScape, a manufacturer of solid-state batteries for EVs, is running the same risk. </p><p>To compete with the low-cost Chinese batteries flooding the market, Norman told me domestic tech has to be demonstrably better — incremental improvements in efficiency, cost, or sustainability will not be enough. “Fundamentally, you’ve got to have a differentiated battery that customers are really dying to get their hands on,” Norman told me. But he knows that if Lyten successfully commercializes lithium-sulfur, other companies and countries will quickly get into the game. </p><p>After all, major battery giants such as LG, Samsung, SK, and Panasonic are well aware of what’s going on in the lithium-sulfur space, Manthiram told me, even if they’ve yet to make any noise about it. “They are quietly doing some work, R&D. They don’t hype it because they have a product already made,” Manthiram said, referring to the company’s widely available lithium-ion batteries. “They are also watching what academic labs are doing, what Lyten is doing, what others are doing.”</p><p>These behemoths are sure to pounce when and if the timing is right. Yet Lyten and Zeta still have the opportunity to pioneer a novel battery technology that can be fully made in America — something thus far unheard of in the battery universe. </p>

## US welcomes South Korean president's reversal of martial law

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT  — The United States expressed relief and welcomed South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's decision to rescind the order declaring emergency martial law in accordance with the country's constitution. Yoon's decision followed a unanimous vote by the National Assembly to reject the declaration.


"We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law," U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement late Tuesday. "We reaffirm our support for the people of Korea and the U.S.-ROK alliance based on shared principles of democracy and the rule of law."


South Korea is known officially as the Republic of Korea, or ROK.


The U.S. had been closely monitoring the rapidly unfolding situation in South Korea "with grave concern" after Yoon declared emergency martial law late Tuesday, citing the need to protect the nation from North Korea's communist forces and eliminate anti-state elements.


Just hours later, Yoon announced he would lift the martial law decree after South Korean lawmakers voted to reject his decision and protesters gathered outside parliament.


Taken by surprise, U.S. officials are actively engaging with their South Korean counterparts in Washington and Seoul, gathering facts and assessing the situation on the ground.


"We were not notified of President Yoon's announcement in advance," State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters during a briefing on Tuesday.


"I have no threat assessment analysis to offer as it relates to the DPRK in the context of this," Patel told VOA when asked if the U.S. had received specific threats in the past 24 hours from North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.


Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy in Seoul announced the cancellation of routine consular appointments for American citizens and visa applicants on Wednesday.


The embassy also urged U.S. citizens in South Korea to monitor local news, follow official guidance, avoid demonstration areas, and exercise caution near large gatherings or protests, as even peaceful demonstrations can escalate unexpectedly.  




U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said earlier on Tuesday that the U.S. was watching developments in South Korea "with grave concern" and expressed every hope and expectation that "any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law."


President Joe Biden, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Blinken have been briefed on the developments and are being kept updated as the situation unfolds, according to Campbell.


Biden was briefed on the latest developments in South Korea as his motorcade was en route to his hotel in Luanda, the capital of Angola. Biden is on his first trip to Africa as president.


At the Pentagon, spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters during a news briefing that he did not believe the martial law declaration would significantly affect the approximately 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.


Ryder added that the militaries of the two allies are "in contact," but that there has been no request for assistance from Seoul. 

 




Some U.S. lawmakers have expressed concerns about the fluid developments in South Korea.


Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it was "very frightening to see a key democratic ally in crisis."


Murphy told VOA Mandarin that he was relieved by Yoon's decision to lift martial law but that the initial declaration was "a real stunning turn of developments — stunning and dangerous."


Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, shared those concerns, describing the situation as "a troubling development."


Late Tuesday, Yoon declared martial law during an unannounced late-night address, vowing to eliminate what he described as "anti-state" forces amid a power struggle with the opposition-controlled parliament, which he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea.


Within hours, the National Assembly voted to overturn the declaration. Speaker Woo Won Shik announced that lawmakers "will protect democracy with the people" and called for the immediate withdrawal of police and military forces from the Assembly grounds.


Yihua Lee from VOA Mandarin contributed to this report. Some information for this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.

## Hunter Biden gun case dismissed after President Joe Biden's sweeping pardon

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A federal judge dismissed the gun case against Hunter Biden on Tuesday after President Joe Biden issued a sweeping pardon for his son.


U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika closed the case the week before Hunter Biden was to be sentenced. He could have faced up to 25 years in prison, though as a first-time offender he likely would have gotten far less time or avoided prison entirely.


Prosecutors opposed dismissing the case, arguing in court documents that a pardon shouldn't wipe away the case "as if it never occurred." Hunter Biden was convicted on three felonies after he lied on a federal form to purchase a gun in Delaware by saying he wasn't a drug user in 2018, a period when he has acknowledged being addicted.


The Justice Department special counsel is also opposed to dismissing a case filed in California after he failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes. A federal judge in Los Angeles hasn't yet ruled in that case.


The president's Sunday decision to go back on previous pledges and issue his son a blanket federal pardon for actions over the past 11 years has sparked a political uproar in Washington, drawing criticism from many Democrats as well as Republicans and threatening to cloud Biden's legacy as he prepares to leave office on Jan. 20.


Hunter Biden was originally supposed to strike a plea deal with prosecutors last year that would have spared him prison time, but the agreement fell apart after Noreika questioned unusual aspects of it.

## How is it that we’re still spending so much?

date: 2024-12-03, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Folks in America are spendy this holiday season — especially online. Yet there also seems to be a bit of a disconnect between how people feel about their own financial situations and how they&#8217;re spending. Today, we&#8217;ll examine and discuss some of the data with Sucharita Kodali, vice president of research and advisory firm Forrester.

## Biden visits Angola on first trip to Africa as president

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

LUANDA, ANGOLA — U.S. President Joe Biden received a warm welcome at Angola's pink-hued Presidential Palace Tuesday as he made his first and almost certainly final visit to the African continent as president.


After a red-carpet promenade, renditions of national anthems by a military band, an inspection of troops and a 21-gun salute, he and Angolan President Joao Lourenco, both flanked by diplomats, got down to work.


"I'm very proud to be the first American president to visit Angola, and I'm deeply proud of everything we have done together to transform our partnership thus far," Biden told Lourenco. "There is so much ahead of us, so much we can do.




His administration’s top Africa adviser told VOA that Biden sees Angola as “exhibit A” of a collaborative relationship with Washington.


His administration's top Africa adviser told VOA that Biden sees Angola as "exhibit A" of a collaborative relationship with Washington.


"We, the United States, are working with Angola on a few really important things," said Frances Brown, senior director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking exclusively to VOA. "One is bolstering peace and security in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Another is growing economic opportunities in the region. A third is technological and scientific cooperation."


Unmentioned by Biden — publicly at least — was Angola's poor human rights record. Rights group Amnesty International attempted to summarize the situation.


"Amnesty has repeatedly documented excessive and lethal force to disrupt peaceful demonstrations," Kate Hixon, advocacy director for Africa at Amnesty International USA, told VOA via Zoom. "Not only is lethal force used in these demonstrations, but the victims' families do not have recourse to access to justice. We've also seen several repressive laws passed since 2020. Since 2020 it's been illegal to criticize the president. More recently, this year, we've seen two laws approved that further threaten the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and the media."


Brown told VOA that the president always raises concerns about human rights, privately.


"He never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts," she told VOA. "And I think that's pretty consistent with the way he's been throughout his long, long career in public service."


Angolan opposition groups told local media that Biden missed a "great opportunity" to listen to civil society groups about their concerns.


"The Lobito rail corridor ... is the only concern of Biden's visit to Angola," said Ernesto Mulato of the opposition UNITA party.


Biden also took time to address the deep, painful blood ties between Angola and the Americas, after a short tour of the nation's slavery museum. Angola was once the top source of slaves to the New World.




Biden, speaking at sunset in front of a glittering bay that opened before the white-washed museum, described slavery as his nation's "original sin, one that haunted America and cast a long shadow ever since."


But he painted an optimistic picture — and as he spoke, skies that had been clouded and stormy all day opened to reveal a rainbow.


"Although I don't know exactly what the future will hold, I know the future runs through Angola, through Africa," he said. "I mean it sincerely. I'm not kidding."


Biden is set Wednesday to visit the port city of Lobito, where a new, U.S.-financed rail line brings raw materials from Africa's interior to this bustling port.

## China bans exports to US of gallium, germanium, antimony in response to chip sanctions

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

Bangkok — China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports.  


The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications.  


The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology.  


China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof.  


"China has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China's technological progress," Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday.  


"I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies," Lin said.  


Minerals sourced in China used in computer chips, cars


China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium.  


In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite.  


Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report.  


The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials.  


China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology.  


China says it's protecting itself from US trade restrictions  


After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called "entity list" subject to strict export controls, China's Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China's "rights and interests." Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington's latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.  


Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security.  


China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China's fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology.  


Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology.  


The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, "abuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China."


 "Such behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries," it said in a statement.  


The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies.


 "U.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China's related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips," it said.  


The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year. The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources.


The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite also have mostly risen.

## Trump says he will 'block' Nippon Steel from taking over US Steel

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Monday said he would "block" a planned takeover of US Steel by Japanese company Nippon Steel, a deal worth $14.9 billion including debts.


"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.


"Through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST! As President, I will block this deal from happening."


Embattled US Steel has argued that it needs the Nippon deal to ensure sufficient investment in its Mon Valley plants in Pennsylvania, which it says it may have to shutter if the sale is blocked.




Nippon Steel said after Trump's comments that it was "determined to protect and grow US Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry, domestic supply chain resiliency, and US national security."


"We will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at US Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers," the Japanese firm said in a statement.


Days after the US election last month, Nippon Steel said it expected to close its takeover of the company before the end of the year, while U.S. President Joe Biden was still in office.




Biden, too, has opposed the deal, saying it was "vital" for US Steel "to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated."


The deal is being reviewed by a body helmed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that audits foreign takeovers of US firms, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.


In September, Biden's administration extended their review, pushing a conclusion on the politically sensitive deal until after the November 5 presidential election.


A Nippon Steel earnings presentation on November 7 maintained that "the transaction is expected to close in... calendar year 2024" pending a U.S. national security review.


"Unless the situation changes dramatically, I believe the conclusion will come by the end of the year," during Biden's time in office, vice chairman Takahiro Mori told reporters.


Trump will be inaugurated on January 20.


Protectionist policies


On the campaign trail, he vowed to install protectionist economic policies to help support US businesses, including threats to restart a trade war with the world's second largest economy, China.


While running for the White House, he specifically promised to block Nippon's takeover of US Steel, which is based in the key political battleground state of Pennsylvania.


Trump's vice presidential pick JD Vance also led congressional opposition to the takeover in the U.S. Senate, where the deal has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats.


Analysts had suggested Trump's position could soften after the election was over, but Monday's statement indicated that was not the case.


Major Japanese and American business groups have urged Yellen not to succumb to political pressure when reviewing the proposed acquisition.


The steelworkers union has fought the deal, and criticized a September arbitrators' ruling that Nippon had proven it could assume US Steel's labor contract obligations.


In September, however, some US Steel workers rallied in support of the deal, arguing it would help keep plants open.

## White House: Biden expected to issue more pardons before end of term

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

A day after U.S. President Joe Biden announced the pardon of his son Hunter, the White House said the president is expected to issue more pardons and clemencies before he leaves office next month.


White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday that Biden is “thinking through that process very thoroughly.”


“I don't have a timeline for you,” Jean-Pierre said.  “As you know, this usually happens towards the end.  And so, the president is going through that process, thinking through that process. I'm not going to get ahead of him. But you can expect more announcements to come.”


Hunter Biden was facing sentencing this month for gun and tax offenses and could have been imprisoned for years.


Biden had for months pledged not to pardon his 54-year-old son, a lawyer who for years was caught up in cocaine addiction as his life spiraled out of control. 


But the president said in a statement late Sunday that Hunter Biden’s prosecution was selective and politically motivated, aimed at undercutting his reelection campaign before he dropped out of the race in July for another four-year term. 


“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,” Biden said.  


Hunter Biden was convicted of three felonies in June for a 2018 gun purchase. Prosecutors said he falsely claimed on a federal form to not be illegally using or addicted to drugs.  


He also pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in a case where he was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.  


He faced up to 17 years in federal prison in the tax case during a scheduled sentencing hearing in Los Angeles on December 16, although sentencing experts said that most likely as a first-time offender, he would have served no more than 36 months behind bars. 


Hunter Biden was facing a stiffer maximum sentence, 25 years, in the gun case but was more likely, based on precedent in similar cases, to be handed a much shorter sentence, perhaps up to 16 months during a hearing scheduled in Delaware for December 13. 


The president’s action Sunday pardoned Hunter Biden in both cases, as well as any offense he “has committed or may have committed or taken part” from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2024.   


Hunter Biden said in a statement, "I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport." 


The president said in his statement that he hopes “Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.”   


“For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,” Biden said.  


President-elect Donald Trump criticized the move, calling it “such an abuse and miscarriage of justice” compared to hundreds of Trump supporters who have been imprisoned after being convicted for an array of offenses stemming from the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, while they tried to block Congress from certifying that Biden had defeated Trump’s reelection bid in the 2020 campaign. 


Trump has said he will consider pardoning many of the rioters when he takes power again on January 20 after winning the November presidential election. Some of the rioters have already served their sentences, but many are still in prison for years to come, while other trials have yet to occur. 


Trump, in the late stages of his first term in office, pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was convicted on tax offenses and other charges. On Saturday, Trump said he intends to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. ambassador to France. 


Trump also pardoned one of his former national security advisers, Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former chief strategist Steve Bannon and campaign aide George Papadopoulos, among others.  


Reactions to President Biden pardoning his son varied across the U.S. political landscape and not always predictably along political party lines as is usually the case when contentious decisions are announced. 


Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said that while he understood the “natural desire” of Biden wanting to help his son, he said, “I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.” 


Greg Stanton, a Democratic congressman from Arizona, said, “I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a politically motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies and was convicted by a jury of his peers." 


Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, posted on X that he was “shocked” by the pardon because the elder Biden “said many, many times he wouldn’t & I believed him. Shame on me."  


But Eric Holder, a Democrat who was the U.S. attorney general under former President Barack Obama, said the president’s son was only prosecuted because his last name was Biden. He said no U.S. attorney “would have charged this case given the underlying facts.”

## Trump names billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens as his envoy to Britain

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has named billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens as his envoy to Britain, a prestigious posting for the Republican donor whose contributions this year included $2 million to a Trump-backing super PAC.


Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site Monday evening, announced he was selecting Stephens to be the U.S. ambassador to the Court of Saint James. The Senate is required to confirm the choice.


"Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time. I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top Diplomat, representing the U.S.A. to one of America's most cherished and beloved Allies," Trump said in in his post.


Stephens is the chairman, president and CEO of Little Rock, Arkansas-based financial services firm Stephens Inc., having taken over the firm from his father.


Trump has already named many of his nominees for his Cabinet and high-profile diplomatic posts, assembling a roster of staunch loyalists. Over the weekend, Trump announced he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France.


During his first term, Trump selected Robert "Woody" Johnson, a contributor to his campaign and the owner of the New York Jets football team, as his representative to the United Kingdom.

## Trump to attend Notre Dame Cathedral reopening in Paris

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump will attend the reopening celebration for Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris this weekend, his first foreign trip since the election.


The cathedral is set to reopen Saturday after more than five years of reconstruction following a devastating fire in 2019. The invite-only ceremonies Saturday and Sunday will be high-security affairs, with about 50 heads of state and government expected to attend.


Trump announced his trip in a post on his Truth Social site Monday evening.


"It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris, France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a devastating fire five years ago," he wrote. "President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!"


Trump and Macron have had a complicated relationship.


Macron was the guest of honor at Trump's first state dinner and Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship soured as Trump's term progressed and Macron criticized him for questioning the need for NATO and raising doubts about America's commitment to the mutual-defense pact.


As he ran for a second term this year, Trump often mocked Macron on the campaign trail, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American companies.


After Trump won another term last month, Macron rushed to win favor with the president-elect. He was among the first global leaders to congratulate Trump — even before The Associated Press called the race in his favor — and beat UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the punch in delivering a congratulatory phone call.


"Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump," Macron posted on X early on Nov 6. "Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity."


The reopening of Notre Dame will be an elaborate, multiday celebration, beginning Saturday.


Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will preside at a reopening service that afternoon, banging on Notre Dame's shuttered doors with his staff to reopen them, according to the cathedral's website.


The archbishop will also symbolically reawaken Notre Dame's thunderous grand organ. The fire that melted the cathedral's lead roofing coated the huge instrument in toxic dust. Its 8,000 pipes have been painstakingly disassembled, cleaned and returned.


Macron will attend and address the VIP guests.


After the service, opera singers Pretty Yende, from South Africa, and Julie Fuchs, from France; Chinese pianist Lang Lang; Paris-born cellist Yo-Yo Ma; Benin-born singer Angelique Kidjo; Lebanese singer Hiba Tawaji and others will perform at a concert Saturday evening, according to the show's broadcaster, France Télévisions.


On Sunday morning, the Paris archbishop will lead an inaugural Mass and consecration of the new altar.


Nearly 170 bishops from France and other countries will join the celebration, along with priests from all 106 parishes in the Paris diocese. The Mass will be followed by a "fraternal buffet" for the needy.


Ile de la Cité, where the cathedral sits in the middle of the River Seine, will be blocked off to tourists for the events. A public viewing area with room for 40,000 spectators will be set up along the Seine's southern bank.

## Congress returns, facing spending, disaster relief issues ahead of change in administrations

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Democratic-led U.S. Senate returned on Monday for a showdown with the Republican-controlled House of Representatives over government spending, disaster relief and defense policy before President-elect Donald Trump ushers in a new era of single-party rule next month.


The main challenge for lawmakers over the next three weeks is to avert a pre-Christmas partial government shutdown by striking a bipartisan deal to fund federal agencies beyond Dec. 20, when a current stopgap spending measure is due to expire.


The debate will include a nearly $100 billion emergency disaster relief request from President Joe Biden for areas of the U.S. Southeast hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other communities struck by natural disasters.


Congress also faces a Jan. 1 deadline for raising the federal government's debt ceiling, though lawmakers and aides say that extraordinary measures employed by the Treasury Department are likely to postpone the expected "X" date for default well into 2025.


Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated on Monday that lawmakers are negotiating a short-term stopgap funding bill known as a continuing resolution, or CR, rather than a package of annual spending bills that would fund the government through fiscal year 2025, which ends on Sept. 30.


Schumer did not disclose details about a potential CR, which House Speaker Mike Johnson has said would run into early next year.


Trump's allies are pushing for a three-month stopgap that supporters say would allow their party's incoming political trifecta to dismantle current Democratic spending initiatives and policy priorities early in the new administration.


Legislative action on government funding is not expected to begin in the House until the last of the session's three weeks, timing that could raise risks for Johnson's slim 220-213 Republican majority if they opt for a partisan measure first.


House Republicans failed to pass their own partisan stop-gap measure in September and had to rely on mainly Democratic votes to narrowly avert a shutdown weeks before the Nov. 5 election.


Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment.


Top lawmakers have yet to say how they intend to handle a Biden request for emergency disaster relief.


The head of the Small Business Administration recently testified to Congress that the agency's disaster loan program for homeowners, renters, and businesses ran out of money in October, leaving more than 60,000 loan applicants waiting for assistance.


Congressional aides said a disaster relief package would likely be attached to a CR.


But the first objective for Congress this month is likely to be passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, annual legislation that sets policy for the Defense Department, according to congressional aides. Floor votes could come as early as next week, according to aides.

## Biden seeking additional $24B to support Ukraine, replenish US weapons stockpiles

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — President Joe Biden has asked Congress for an additional $24 billion to support Ukraine and replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles, two U.S. officials tell VOA, as the administration continued Monday to push out new aid packages from the last congressionally approved funds for Kyiv before Biden leaves office on January 20.


Officials who have seen the administration’s request, on condition of anonymity to discuss its details, told VOA, that the new support would include $16 billion to restock U.S. weapons under the Pentagon’s presidential drawdown authority (PDA), along with $8 billion to manufacture weapons under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which focuses on supplying Kyiv’s long-term defense needs.


“This funding not only supports Ukraine’s fight for its sovereignty and degrades Russian military capabilities but also strengthens U.S. military readiness by modernizing our weapons systems and making direct investments in our defense industrial base,” a U.S. defense official told VOA on Monday.


The Biden administration submitted aid for Ukraine in an anomaly funding bill that also includes spending on other matters rather than in a separate supplemental funding request.


“We defer to Congress to determine the most appropriate vehicle for addressing this urgent need,” one official said.


News of the latest request was first reported by Politico.


Some Republicans are already opposing the request.


"Any Biden funding demands should be DOA (dead on arrival),” Senator Mike Lee posted on X.




Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who will determine whether the bill is brought to a vote in the form proposed by the White House, wrote on X that funding decisions “are for the incoming administration, not the outgoing lame duck President.”



“The American people resoundingly elected President [Donald] Trump because he promised to bring an end to wars, not prolong them indefinitely,” Johnson added.


The aid request follows vows from Biden administration officials to seek additional aid approval from Congress for 2025. Last week, the Biden administration also informed Congress of its intention to forgive $4.65 billion worth of Ukrainian debt.




The U.S. announced Monday it was sending another military aid package to Ukraine valued at up to $725 million, its 71st tranche of equipment from Department of Defense inventories for Kyiv since August 2021. Monday’s PDA included air defense capabilities, munitions for rocket systems and artillery, and anti-tank weapons.


The package is the latest round of aid stemming from a $61 billion assistance bill for Kyiv that was approved by Congress in April after several months of delays. The Biden administration still has more than $8 billion in funding from previous aid packages to give to Ukraine.


Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Ukrainian Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov on Monday to discuss battlefield dynamics and U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, according to the Pentagon.


During his call with Umerov, Austin condemned Russia’s recent barrage of missiles and drones targeting Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, along with its use of an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile in Ukraine, which the Pentagon called “another escalation in Russia’s war against Ukraine.”

## Transgender attorney to argue before Supreme Court, challenging health care ban for minors

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — When the Supreme Court this week wades into the contentious issue of transgender rights, the justices will hear from an attorney with knowledge that runs deep.


Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation's highest court, representing families who say Tennessee’s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future.


Arguments in the case come amid heightened pushback to transgender rights, including a presidential campaign where Republican Donald Trumpput his fierce opposition front and center.


Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience.

“I am able to do my job because I have had this health care that transformed and, frankly, saved my life,” he said. “I am a testament to the fact that we live among everyone.”


Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was in law school. Now 42, he's an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at the Supreme Court. He's also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his Army-veteran brother.


He's also an advocate, speaking out as a series of U.S. states banned gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The laws are part of a wave of restrictions on school sports participation and bathroom usage around the country. After the first openly transgender person was elected to Congress, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson declared support for restricting bathroom use to sex assigned at birth.


Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and that its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely.


“Tennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,” state attorneys wrote in court filings.


Arguing for Tennessee is state Solicitor General Matt Rice. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the transgender worker-discrimination case Strangio worked on that term. The state attorney general's office did not make Rice available for an interview ahead of arguments, but his background also includes a couple of years as a minor league baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays before he earned his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley.


The Biden administration is supporting the challenge to Tennessee's law, but the federal government’s position is expected to change after Trump takes office in January. 


Strangio said he'll nevertheless keep advocating for transgender youth to access health care that wasn't available when he was young.


“Many of us think about our childhood and young adulthood as lost years, when we were just simply disembodied from our core,” he said. Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans and have endorsed such care, saying it’s safe when administered properly. 


Strangio also pointed out that many medical interventions for young people, like gastric bypass surgeries for weight loss, carry some risk and it makes sense to inform families and let them decide.


“There is harm that is compounded when we are forcing young people to be denied care that their doctors and their parents and they themselves all agree they need,” he said.


The Supreme Court is expected to decide the case by the summer.

## Trump's tariff threats create division between Canada and Mexico over security at borders

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

Mexico City — Threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to impose tariffs have created a split between Canada and Mexico, after Canadian officials said problems with the two countries’ borders shouldn’t be compared.


On Monday, Mexico’s president rejected those comments, which were made following a meeting between Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.


“Mexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners,” President Claudia Sheinbaum said, after Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told The Associated Press on Sunday that “the message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood.”


Sheinbaum said Canada had its own problems with fentanyl consumption and “could only wish they had the cultural riches Mexico has.”


Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs.



Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries' border are vastly different.


U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Mexico's efforts to seize fentanyl before it reaches the U.S. have been lackluster.


Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia.


On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone, while there were only 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024. During the same period, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico.


Mexico feels especially hurt by the Canadian comments, because Mexican officials claim their government went to bat for Canada in the past. They claim that Trump, during his first term, initially wanted to leave Canada out of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement in 2018, and Mexico demanded it be included. It is unclear if that was actually the case.


Trudeau also got ahead of Sheinbaum by meeting with the U.S. president-elect first. Both leaders are scrambling to get some assurances before Trump takes office.


Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers. She also noted an agreement between Canada and the U.S. that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally to be sent back to Canada. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar agreement.


On Monday, Sheinbaum revealed more about her own conversation last week with Trump, saying he “had agreed” that Mexico wanted to focus on intelligence sharing in anti-drug efforts, noting “he said that in his opinion that was good.”


But she said Mexico would reject any direct U.S. intervention in Mexico and continue to enforce the tight restrictions on U.S. law enforcement agencies in Mexico imposed by her predecessor.


“That is going to maintained,” she said.

## Delaware judge rejects request to restore Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

Wilmington, Delaware — A Delaware judge ruled Monday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it.


The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk's future at the world's most valuable carmaker.


Musk did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.


Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances — and reinstate his compensation.


McCormick said Tesla’s board was not entitled to hit “reset” to restore Musk’s pay package.


“Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable,” she said in her 101-page opinion.


She also said Tesla made multiple material misstatements in its proxy statement regarding the vote and could not claim the vote was a “cure-all” to justify restoring Musk’s pay.


“Taken together,” the problems with Tesla’s arguments “pack a powerful punch,” she wrote.


Tesla shares fell 1.4% in afterhours trade, following the ruling.


McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the $6 billion they initially requested. She said the fee could be paid in cash or Tesla stock.


“We are pleased with Chancellor McCormick’s ruling, which declined Tesla’s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings," said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff.


The law firm also said it looked forward to defending the court's opinion if Musk and Tesla appealed.


Musk and Tesla can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court as soon as McCormick enters a final order, which could come as soon as this week. The appeal could take a year to play out.


After the January ruling, Tesla shareholders flooded the court with thousands of letters arguing that rescinding Musk's pay increased the possibility he would leave Tesla or develop some products like artificial intelligence at ventures other than Tesla.


Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to challenge Musk's compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn the ruling from a trial.


McCormick in January found that Musk improperly controlled the 2018 board process to negotiate the pay package. The board had said that Musk deserved the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market value, revenue and profitability.


But the judge criticized Tesla's board as "beholden" to Musk, saying the compensation plan was proposed by a board whose members had conflicts of interest due to close personal and financial ties to him.


After the January ruling, Musk criticized the judge on his social media platform X and encouraged other companies to follow the lead of Tesla and reincorporate in Texas from Delaware, although it is unclear if any companies did so.


The judge in her January ruling called the pay package the "biggest compensation plan ever — an unfathomable sum." It was 33 times larger than the next biggest executive compensation package, which was Musk's 2012 pay plan.


As of Monday, the pay package was worth $101.4 billion, according to Equilar, a compensation consulting firm.


Musk's 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1% of Tesla's equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals.


Musk did not receive any guaranteed salary. Tornetta argued that shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when they voted on the package.

## US to block sale of cutting-edge, chip-making equipment to China

date: 2024-12-03, from: VOA News USA

The Biden administration announced Monday that it has imposed a new set of export controls on China, restricting the sale of cutting-edge, semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and high-bandwidth computer memory to the communist nation.


The new rules ban the sale of 24 different kinds of equipment and three different software tools, all of which are used to produce what are known as “advanced node” semiconductors, the fastest and most efficient chips on the market.


The export controls, announced by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, also restrict the transfer of high-bandwidth memory products, which advanced node semiconductors need to maximize their performance in high-intensity applications, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.


At the same time, the government added 140 companies, mostly in China’s domestic semiconductor manufacturing industry, to a list of entities that U.S. firms and individuals are restricted from doing business with. In general, exporting certain technologies to companies on the list requires a license from the federal government.


Blocking military development


The latest round of sanctions is specifically aimed at preventing China from fabricating advanced semiconductors on its own, out of concern that it would then incorporate AI into new military hardware and advanced tools of social control.


“Advanced AI models could be used for rapid response scenarios on the battlefield; lowering the barrier to develop cyberweapons or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons; and utilizing facial and voice recognition to repress and surveil minorities and political dissidents,” the department said in a release announcing the sanctions.


“This action is the culmination of the Biden-Harris Administration’s targeted approach, in concert with our allies and partners, to impair [China’s] ability to indigenize the production of advanced technologies that pose a risk to our national security,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement.


“The United States has taken significant steps to protect our technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our national security,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in the same statement. “As technology evolves, and our adversaries seek new ways to evade restrictions, we will continue to work with our allies and partners to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading technologies and know-how so they aren’t used to undermine our national security.”


China responds


In a statement sent to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington condemned the sanctions.


“China strongly opposes the U.S.' latest control measures on semiconductor export. The move is a typical economic coercion and non-market practice,” the embassy said.


The embassy accused the United States of “overstretching” the idea of national security, abusing export control rules and “bullying.”


“The semiconductor industry is highly globalized,” the statement said. “The US' abuse of regulatory measures severely hinders normal economic and trade exchanges among countries, undermines market rules and the international economic and trade order, and poses a serious threat to the stability of the global industrial and supply chains. The global semiconductor industry, including US companies, has been severely affected.”


The statement concluded with the promise that, “China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”




Significant impact


Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told VOA that the new sanctions are likely to do real damage to China’s effort to create a world-class domestic chip manufacturing industry.


In an email exchange with VOA, Ezell said that manufacturing semiconductors is “perhaps the most complex engineering task humanity undertakes,” and that simply building the machinery to manufacture them requires a vast array of inputs, access to many of which the U.S. can meaningfully restrict.


“Those tools … depend on literally dozens of thousands of inputs and components, many provided by specialized suppliers from across the world,” Ezell wrote. “If Chinese toolmakers don’t have ready access to these, it makes their task of recreating a wholly indigenous supply chain that much more difficult and expensive.”


Ezell said the loss of market share in China will hurt U.S. manufacturers unable to sell into the country, but he pointed out that China’s goal has been to eliminate its dependence on foreign chips anyway, which would produce the same result.


“The way to deal with the challenge is for the United States (and like-minded allies) to stimulate the growth of semiconductor industries in places like India or Malaysia, so sales that are lost in China can be recaptured elsewhere, because we’re expanding semiconductor production in like-minded nations,” Ezell said.


He added that it is important that the U.S. team up with other major semiconductor manufacturing and equipment-making nations to institute similar policies toward China.


Advanced chips


The primary target of the new U.S. export controls are so-called “advanced node” chips and the equipment used to manufacture them. Advanced node chips’ distinguishing factor is the size of the transistors used in their manufacture.


Some transistors can be as small as three nanometers — three one-billionths of a meter — in length. The smaller the individual transistors are, means more of them can be placed on a single chip, making them better at processing information, and more energy efficient.


For advanced node chips to operate at their full potential, they need to be paired with high-bandwidth computer memory, which can provide high-speed access to vast amounts of data.

## From VOA Mandarin: How China may react to Trump’s likely changes in climate policy

date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is widely expected to withdraw from the Paris Agreement treaty on climate change after he takes office January 20. China also is a party to the agreement. However, Beijing has long argued that it is not wealthy enough to be forced to provide similar financial assistance that Washington donates to the effort. VOA Mandarin spoke to analysts about how Beijing is likely to position itself on climate talks going forward.

## California lawmakers to begin special session to protect state laws from 2nd Trump presidency

date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California Governor Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Monday to begin a special session to protect the state's progressive policies ahead of another Trump presidency.


The Democratic governor, a fierce critic of President-elect Donald Trump, is positioning California to once again be the center of a resistance effort against the conservative agenda. He is asking his Democratic allies in the Legislature, who hold supermajorities in both chambers, to approve additional funding to the attorney general's office to prepare for a robust legal fight against anticipated federal challenges.


Democratic Assembly member Jesse Gabriel on Monday introduced legislation to set aside $25 million for legal fees to respond to potential attacks by the Trump administration on state policies regarding civil rights, climate change, immigration and abortion access.


“While we always hope to collaborate with our federal partners, California will be ready to vigorously defend our interests and values from any unlawful action by the incoming Trump Administration,” Gabriel said in a statement.


California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times to various levels of success. 


“We’re not going to be caught flat-footed,” Newsom said at a recent news conference.


Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in America. Democrats, which hold every statewide office in California and have commanding margins in the Legislature and congressional delegation, outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 2-to-1 statewide.


Trump called the Democratic governor “New-scum” during a campaign stop in Southern California and has relentlessly lambasted the Democratic stronghold over its large number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, homeless population and thicket of regulations.


Trump also waded into a water rights battle over the endangered delta smelt, a tiny fish that has pitted environmentalists against farmers and threatened to withhold federal aid to a state increasingly under threat from wildfires. He also vowed to follow through with his campaign promise of carrying out the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status and prosecuting his political enemies.


Before the special session was set to begin, state lawmakers swore in more than two dozen new members and elected leaders for the 2025 legislative session.


Hundreds of people also demonstrated around the Capitol on Monday to urge the Legislature to try to stop Trump's mass deportation plans. They carried banners that said “Not one cent for mass deportation” and “MAGA out of California.”


“With the results of the presidential election, we need our state elected officials to use every tool and every resource they have available to them to protect our immigrant Californians,” protester Deborah Lee said.




State Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office will protect the state’s immigrant population, while Newsom last week unveiled a proposal to revive a rebate program for electric vehicle purchases if the incoming Trump administration eliminates a federal tax credit for people who buy electric cars. Newsom is also considering creating a backup disaster relief fund for the wildfire-prone state after Trump’s threats.


Bonta announced legislation Monday aimed at bolstering reproductive rights in the state, including by allowing the attorney general to seek monetary penalties against local governments that infringe on those rights. The proposals are part of the state's efforts to safeguard against threats to abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.


Republican lawmakers blasted Newsom and his Democratic allies over the special session. Representative Vince Fong, who represents the state’s Central Valley farm belt, said California should work with the incoming Trump administration instead.


“Gavin Newsom’s actions are tone-deaf to the concerns of Californians who disapprove of the direction of our state and country,” Fong said in a video on social media.


Legislators also are expected to spend the year discussing ways to protect dozens of laws expected to be targeted by the Trump administration, including one that has made the state a sanctuary for people seeking abortions who live in states where such practices have been severely limited. 


California, the nation’s most populous state, was the first to mandate that by 2035 all new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in California be electric, hydrogen-powered or plug-in hybrids. The state also extends state-funded health care to all low-income residents regardless of their immigration status.


Newsom hasn't provided details about what actions the lawmakers will consider but said he wanted funding in place before Trump's inauguration day, January 20. The state spent roughly $42 million in litigation costs during the first Trump administration, officials said.

## Cyber Monday shoppers expected to set record in online sales

date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA

Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon with Cyber Monday.


Even though e-commerce is now part of many people's regular routines and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday — a term coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation — has become the biggest online shopping day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has created to fuel it.


Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's — and the year's — biggest shopping day for e-commerce.


Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday, per Adobe — reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute.


For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members Sunday afternoon and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern time.


Consumer spending for Cyber Week — the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday — provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.


Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace.


At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use “buy now, pay later” plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.


Many economists have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles.


The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% — compared to 3.9% in 2023.


A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won’t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers.


Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have “exceeded expectations” — and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined.


U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said.


Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double-digits while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%.


E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute — with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company.


Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. “Hot products” included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.


Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes.


RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest.


While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more “experience-driven spending” in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned.


Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this season — with consumers opening their wallets to invest or “trade up” to more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and sporting goods.

## Should the Fed open more regional reserve banks?

## The Corporate Push to End Plastics

date: 2024-12-02, from: Heatmap News

<p>A planet-wide agreement on curbing plastic pollution was <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-world-is-inching-slowly-and-chaotically-towards-a-new-plastics-treaty" target="_self"><u>always going to be a big ask</u></a>. Lacking the existential drama that undergirds the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop29-finance" target="_self"><u>annual climate change conference</u></a>, the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for Plastics (or “the INC-5,” as this fifth round of meetings was seductively named) doesn’t exactly attract the same level of media attention as its parent group. For another thing, the connection of plastics to the cascading effects of global warming is less obvious than that of burning fossil fuels, though by no means less severe: Conventional plastics are made using newly extracted fossil fuels and, as such, are a last resort profit center for <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/sustainable-litter-pet-poop-bags" target="_self"><u>oil companies</u></a> facing the expiration of their social license to operate. Plastic-related emissions are expected to outpace those of coal <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/plastics-outpace-coals-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2030-report-2021-10-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>within the decade</u></a>. </p>
<p>And yet despite fierce resistance from petrochemical-producing industries and nations (more on that later), a curious champion has emerged for a legally binding plastic treaty. Alongside the expected environmental heavyweights in Busan last week were several business coalitions pushing in tandem for more ambitious mandatory regulations. </p>
<p>There are plans to hold an “INC-5.2” next year to resolve the outstanding differences, and mounting pressure from business interests on the <em><em>other</em></em> side of the fight could potentially neutralize at least some of the influence of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/30/climate/saudi-arabia-global-plastic-treaty.html#:~:text=Saudi%20Aramco%2C%20the%20national%20oil%20company%2C%20lists%20%E2%80%9Cincreased%20concerns%20regarding%20the%20safe%20use%20of%20chemicals%20and%20plastics%20and%20their%20potential%20impact%20on%20the%20environment%E2%80%9D%20and%20the%20%E2%80%9Crestrictive%20regulations%E2%80%9D%20those%20concerns%20may%20spur%20as%20risks%20to%20its%20business." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the countries that normally dominate such talks</u></a>. “Businesses cannot solve the crisis alone,” Julia Cohen, the co-founder and managing director of Plastic Pollution Coalition, told me in an emailed statement. But they can “play a key role in shaping national positions, driving scalable solutions, and fostering emerging markets” alongside continued efforts to secure a global treaty. </p>
<p>Two main business coalitions are attempting to do just that. The first is Champions of Change, which works with the Plastic Pollution Coalition, Greenpeace, and Break Free From Plastic, and counts among its 350 signatories household brands like Ben & Jerry’s, Blueland, and Lush Cosmetics. The alliance is <a href="https://championsofchange.breakfreefromplastic.org/open-letter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>demanding</u></a> a cap on plastic pollution, the phase-out of single-use plastics, greater reuse targets, and a justice-focused approach that centers the concerns of frontline communities. “Voluntary corporate pledges are no match for an international legally binding treaty that would require companies to move away from plastic,” Sybil Bullock, the senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace, told me in an email. “We have seen past voluntary business commitments from top polluters fail time and time again to deliver meaningful reductions in plastic pollution.” </p>
<p>The Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, by contrast, <a href="https://www.businessforplasticstreaty.org/latest/business-coalition-open-letter-ahead-of-inc-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stops short</u></a> of calling for a plastic cap, <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/15112024/nations-struggle-to-agree-on-global-plastics-treaty/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>focusing instead</u></a> on phasing out “avoidable plastic products” and calling for a “global criteria for circular product design.” Specifically, the group — convened by the World Wildlife Fund and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which advocates for a circular economy — is pushing for a “treaty based on strong global rules across the full lifecycle of plastics and with a comprehensive financing mechanism.” Its signatories include<em> </em>businesses that have historically been criticized for their reliance on plastic, <a href="https://www.businessforplasticstreaty.org/endorsers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including</u></a> Unilever, Nestle, and PepsiCo, and its softer approach has its skeptics. </p>
<p>“You can only downcycle plastic and currently, how plastic is recycled, it gets contaminated by other plastics that are so toxic we cannot use them for anything that is touching or even close to touching our food,” KT Morelli, a campaign organizer for Breathe Free Detroit, which successfully campaigned to shut down a local plastic incinerator, told me. “There’s no circular answer to plastics.”</p>
<p>Kristen McDonald, the senior director of the plastics program at Pacific Environment, an environmental group focused on the Pacific Rim, agreed that “business actions alone — voluntary steps — have not worked so far, and so I’m very skeptical that they will work in the future.” Still, she said it’s only logical that businesses are as impatient as environmentalists when deciding on plastic regulations. If an international agreement isn’t reached, it creates a “really chaotic business environment where certain plastics are restricted in some places and not in others,” leading to trade problems and an uneven playing field at a global level as different companies face different local rules. As she added, a plastic treaty “actually <em><em>stabilizes</em></em> things for companies” — unless, of course, the company in question happens to be in the petrochemical industry.</p>
<p>Even the environmentalists working with the business groups agree that there isn’t an entirely private-sector solution to the plastic crisis. “We’re not ready to give up on the treaty process,” Erin Simon, the vice president and head of plastic waste and business at WWF, told me over email. But, she pointed out, after the U.S. pulled out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, there had been a “groundswell of support from cities, states, and other non-federal actors,” including corporations that filled in the leadership void with “commitments that would help move the needle toward reaching our global climate goals.”</p>
<p>And yet despite the limitations of the business coalitions, Morelli told me she thinks there is still promise in the private sector. “They have more power than the government,” she stressed, noting that “small companies and large companies can choose to refuse plastic” and push their suppliers to do the same. </p>
<p>This is significant because, as is the case at COP, oil-rich nations (and <a href="https://www.breakfreefromplastic.org/2024/11/27/fossil-fuel-lobbyists-flood-final-scheduled-round-of-global-plastics-treaty-negotiations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>oil-rich lobbyists</u></a>) hold outsized negotiating power at the meetings. Despite more than 100 nations favoring an agreement that would have curbed plastic <em><em>production </em></em>— turning off the tap at the source, as plastic-reduction advocates like to say — Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the American Chemistry Council, a trade group, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/01/plastic-pollution-treaty-global-un-busan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pushed for a treaty</u></a> last week that would have focused on <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/sustainable-litter-pet-poop-bags" target="_self"><u>plastic recycling</u></a> and “<a href="https://american-chemistry.read.axioshq.com/p/acc-news-release/f2029ecb-155c-442a-b3b4-1a27b391b42f?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_location=email_view_in_browser" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mismanaged waste</u></a>,” instead, an insistence that led negotiations straight into an impasse. (<a href="https://grist.org/regulation/us-backtracks-production-caps-global-plastics-treaty-united-nations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>After flip-flopping</u></a>, the United States took a noncommittal middle ground of opposing mandatory production caps but otherwise agreeing that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/24/world-unable-cope-10-years-talks-un-global-treaty-to-end-plastic-waste" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>too much plastic is probably bad</u></a>.) </p>
<p>In the absence of a treaty and with pessimism growing around INC-5.2, business-led action might be the best shot remaining for plastic-free organizers. “Having these companies step up on their own is huge and would help us all,” Morelli said.</p>

## US unveils fresh export curbs targeting China's chip sector

date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States announced new export restrictions Monday taking aim at China's ability to make advanced semiconductors — used in weapon systems and artificial intelligence  as competition intensifies between the world's two biggest economies.

 

"The United States has taken significant steps to protect our technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our national security," said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan in a statement.

 

He added that Washington will keep working with allies and partners to "to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading technologies and know-how."

 

The latest rules include a restriction of exports to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier Technology.

 

They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the Commerce Department.

 

"We are constantly talking to our allies and partners as well as reassessing and updating our controls," added Under Secretary of Commerce for industry and security Alan Estevez.

 

The latest announcement also includes controls on two dozen types of chipmaking equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.

## The (new) reality of retail returns

date: 2024-12-02, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Maybe it broke, maybe it doesn&#8217;t fit, or maybe we realized we don&#8217;t need a Godzilla-shaped humidifier — whatever the reason, returns are expensive for stores, and they’re cracking down. Some 81% of retailers started charging customers for at least one of their return options last year. We&#8217;ll hear more. Plus, the dollar swings after Trump threatens tariffs, and a shipbuilder in Northern Ireland files for bankruptcy.</p>

## Analysts say Biden’s first trip to Africa should’ve come earlier in presidency

date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA

Nairobi — After promising to visit Africa two years ago at the U.S. Africa summit in Washington, President Joe Biden makes his first presidential trip to the continent where he is visiting Angola with a quick stop in Cabo Verde. Analysts in Africa say the trip should’ve come sooner and some are asking why Angola is the primary destination – given its troubling human rights record.


White House officials say President Joe Biden is looking forward to visiting the continent after a promise he made in 2022. But some analysts tell VOA that Biden’s trip, which comes weeks before he steps down, would’ve had more weight if he had done it earlier.  


Louw Nel, senior political analyst for Oxford Economics Africa, spoke to VOA from South Africa. 


“I think his trip is less significant than it would’ve been otherwise just because of the fact that he withdrew as presidential candidate and, of course, now [is] not returning for a second term. So, it really feels like an afterthought to his presidency,” said Nel. 


After a short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde off Africa’s northwestern coast, President Biden heads south to Angola.  


There, officials say he plans to focus on U.S. leadership on trade, investment, and infrastructure in Africa. He’ll also recognize Angola’s President João Lourenço’s regional leadership and global partnership on trade, security, and health. 




More importantly, President Biden will highlight one of his signature initiatives, the investment of the Lobito Corridor — a regional railway project linking natural resource-rich areas stretching from the Angolan port of Lobito to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.  


The corridor is part of a wider joint effort between multiple partners aimed at closing the infrastructure gap in growing economies around the world, officials say.  


Dr. Frances Brown, special assistant to the president and senior director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking about the broader benefits associated with the project. 


“What I found really notable about the Lobito Corridor is that it isn’t just about a railroad or critical minerals. It’s also about the communities that are strengthened along the way, it’s about more access to education, it’s about agricultural products moving to market, and it’s about increases in digital connectivity,” said Brown.


Last year, U.S.-Angola trade totaled approximately $1.77 billion, making Angola America’s fourth-largest trade partner in Sub-Saharan Africa. 


Angola has vast mineral deposits and is Africa’s third largest oil producer. But according to Amnesty International, the country’s natural resource wealth has not translated to prosperity for most of its people, resulting in numerous peaceful protests against poverty, unemployment and high cost of living.  


Nel says some Angolans may see a benefit with this Biden visit. 


“Many ordinary Angolans will recognize that Angola desperately needs to diversify its economy, and this is an enormous opportunity to do so, to move away from oil and gas and bolster other parts of the economy and it has massive potential,” said Nel.  


But others including human rights campaigners and opposition parties, Nel says, will feel aggrieved by President Biden’s visit because they see the Lourenco administration as being rewarded despite growing concerns about the shrinking space for independent civil society organizations and freedom of expression.  


In a new report, Amnesty International said that anyone who publicly criticizes the Lourenço government risks arrest. And “if human rights are central to President Biden’s foreign policy, then he must demand Angola’s government immediately …free arbitrarily detained government critics.”   


Adriano Nuvunga, who runs the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Mozambique, echoes that sentiment.  


“I commend the people of Angola and president Lourenço for hosting President Biden. It means a lot for the people of Angola. While I commend them, I would also want to encourage President Biden to ask those tough questions to President João Lourenço," said Nuvunga. "We have a number of human rights defenders in Angola that are detained unjustly, unfairly for doing nothing. They are languishing in jails, some of them in critical conditions,” said Nuvunga.  


Nuvunga hopes that this could be addressed during this trip.

## Chief of ICC lashes out at US and Russia over threats, accusations

date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA

The Hague, Netherlands — The president of the International Criminal Court lashed out at the United States and Russia for interfering with its investigations, calling attacks on the court "appalling."


"The court is being threatened with draconian economic sanctions by another permanent member of the Security Council as if it was a terrorist organization," Judge Tomoko Akane said in her address to the institution's annual meeting, which opened on Monday.


Akane was referring to remarks made by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose Republican party will control both branches of Congress in January, and who called the court a "dangerous joke" and urged Congress to sanction its prosecutor. "To any ally, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, if you try to help the ICC, we're going to sanction you," Graham said on Fox News.


Graham was angered by an announcement last month that judges had granted a request from the court's chief prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas' military chief for crimes against humanity in connection with the nearly 14-month war in Gaza.


This marks the first time the global court of justice calls out a sitting leader of a major Western ally.


ICC faces challenges on arrest warrants


Graham's threat isn't seen as just empty words. President-elect Donald Trump sanctioned the court's previous prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, with a travel ban and asset freeze for investigating American troops and intelligence officials in Afghanistan.


Akane on Monday also had harsh words for Russia. "Several elected officials are being subjected to arrest warrants from a permanent member of the Security Council," she said. Moscow issued warrants for Khan and others in response to the investigation into Putin.


The Assembly of States Parties, which represents the ICC's 124 member countries, will convene its 23rd conference to elect committee members and approve the court's budget against a backdrop of unfavorable headlines.


The ICC was established in 2002 as the world's permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the most heinous atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. The court only becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute those crimes on their territory. To date, 124 countries have signed on to the Rome Statute, which created the institution. Those who have not include Israel, Russia and China.


The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to execute arrest warrants.


The decision to warrant issues for Netanyahu and Israel's ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has been denounced by critics of the court and given only milquetoast approval by many of its supporters, a stark contrast to the robust backing of an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin last year over war crimes in Ukraine.


U.S. President Joe Biden called the warrants for Netanyahu and the former defense minister "outrageous" and vowed to stand with Israel. A year ago, Biden called the warrant for Putin "justified" and said the Russian president had committed war crimes. The U.S. is not an ICC member country.


France said it would "respect its obligations" but would need to consider Netanyahu's possible immunities. When the warrant for Putin was announced, France said it would "lend its support to the essential work" of the court.


Another member country, Austria, begrudgingly acknowledged it would arrest Netanyahu but called the warrants "utterly incomprehensible." Italy called them "wrong" but said it would be obliged to arrest him. Germany said it would study the decision. Member Hungary has said it would stand with Israel instead of the court.


Global security expert Janina Dill worried that such responses could undermine global justice efforts. "It really has the potential to damage not just the court, but international law," she told The Associated Press.


Milena Sterio, an expert in international law at Cleveland State University, told the AP that sanctions against the court could affect a number of people who contribute to the court's work, such as international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Clooney advised the current prosecutor on his request for the warrants for Netanyahu and others.


"Sanctions are a huge burden," Sterio said.


Accusations against Khan


Also hanging heavy over the meeting in The Hague are the internal pressures that Khan faces. In October, the AP reported the 54-year-old British lawyer is facing allegations he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her.


Two co-workers in whom the woman confided reported the alleged misconduct in May to the court's independent watchdog, which says it interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan was never questioned. He has denied the claims.


The Assembly of States Parties has announced it will launch an external probe into the allegations. It's not clear if the investigation will be addressed during the meeting.


Khan took the floor after Akane. He didn't address the accusations against him or the threats against the court directly, other than to say the institution was facing "unprecedented challenges."


Instead he highlighted his office's recent request for an arrest warrant against the head of Myanmar's military government and said he planned to request warrants related to Afghanistan and Sudan in the coming months.


Late last week, six countries including France, Luxembourg and Mexico asked Khan's office to look into possible crimes in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control in 2021. While Khan isn't obligated to open an investigation in response to such a request, historically court prosecutors have done so.


The court, which has long faced accusations of ineffectiveness, will have no trials pending after two conclude in December. While it has issued a number of arrest warrants in recent months, many high-profile suspects remain at large.


Member states don't always act. Mongolia refused to arrest Putin when he visited in September. Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir is wanted by the ICC over accusations related to the conflict in Darfur, but his country has refused to hand him over. Last week, Khan requested a warrant for the head of Myanmar's military regime, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, for attacks against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority. Judges have yet to decide on that request.


"It becomes very difficult to justify the court's existence," Sterio said.

## The Next Four Years Will Be a Fight. Embrace It.

date: 2024-12-02, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NDk5NDg2OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTE1OTUzNn0.xfL2Iq1IUoHqYm_oOBgAvWVvjjqQt4szCgdBuJ9O9lE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">When Donald Trump was inaugurated in 2017, millions of people participated in hundreds of marches around the country and the world to demonstrate their commitment in the new cause of resistance. No such large-scale protests are materializing for next January 20; those who hoped Trump would lose the presidential election now seem more demoralized than defiant. </p><p>That reaction is understandable. After a period of progress and optimism about the future, and even as the climate crisis grows more dire, we are in for a difficult four years. As Jesse Jenkins <a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/trump-election-climate-fight" target="_self"><u>wrote</u></a> just after the election, the outcome “dealt a devastating blow to U.S. efforts to cut climate-warming pollution.” </p><p>But for those feeling despair, there is a way forward: <em><em>Embrace the fight</em></em>. Sometimes politics is about compromise, sometimes it’s about patience, and sometimes it’s about righteous fury. This time, fury may be just what’s called for. </p><p>There’s no doubt that some very bad vibrations will emanate from Washington. Trump is arriving with the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>Project 2025 blueprint</u></a> in hand, ready to undermine climate progress in every corner of government. Key agencies will be led by a veritable murderer’s row of fossil fuel enthusiasts, from the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy" target="_self"><u>fracking executive</u></a> who will helm the Department of Energy to the “<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/rnc-energy-all-of-the-above" target="_self"><u>all-of-the-above</u></a>” enthusiast who will lead both the Department of the Interior and <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/trump-national-energy-council" target="_self"><u>the new National Energy Council</u></a>, the goal of which is to achieve what Trump calls, in all caps, “ENERGY DOMINANCE.” </p><p>As far as Trump is concerned, “dominance” comes not from wimpy renewables but from pounding holes in the ground and burning what comes out of them, the manly pursuit of those whose hearts beat faster at the thought of America’s foes kneeling in submission before our virile power. And it comes from reversing whatever Joe Biden did, not because Trump necessarily cares whether consumers get subsidies to buy heat pumps, but because undoing his predecessor’s legacy shows that Trump is a winner and everyone else is a loser.</p><p>As much as <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/after-voters-soundly-rejected-it-electing-trump-what-s-next-for-the-radical-climate-agenda/ar-AA1uOC9s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>some</u></a> would like us to believe that by giving Trump one of the <a href="https://paulwaldman.substack.com/p/busting-myths-about-the-2024-election" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>narrowest</u></a> presidential victories in history the voters were explicitly rejecting the Biden administration’s climate policies in favor of Trump’s fossil fuel agenda, there is no evidence that’s true. As much as we would have liked it to be otherwise, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most</u></a> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>polls</u></a> showed climate change ranking low when people were asked what decided their vote. Indeed, the most persuasive explanation for the election outcome is that all over the world, voters have turned out whichever party was in power when the wave of post-pandemic inflation hit; Kamala Harris nearly overcame that anti-incumbent wave, but wasn’t able to in the end. </p><p>So while Trump may not have much of a “mandate” in general, he certainly doesn’t have one to reverse the progress the country has made on climate. That means the politics of opposing the administration’s climate efforts are in advocates’ favor. At the very least, there is plenty of room to persuade the public that the Trump administration is doing something awful on climate. </p><p>Embracing the fight will mean acknowledging that while bipartisanship is sometimes an effective tool, it isn’t an end in itself. Republicans should certainly be welcomed as allies whenever they want to join in <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/conservative-climate-trump" target="_self"><u>defending climate progress</u></a> or pushing back on efforts to undermine it, but the days when Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi6n_-wB154" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>film an ad together</u></a> pledging their commitment to address climate change are long behind us. It would be nice if there was a consensus on the need to transition off of fossil fuels, but there isn’t. Instead, there’s a climate assault on its way, and while appeals to the self-interest of some Republicans (such as those politicians <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/old-school-politics-ira" target="_self"><u>whose districts</u></a> are benefiting enormously from clean energy investments) are possible, a battle is more likely.</p><p>That isn’t a bad thing. Conflicts are energizing — they clarify stakes, focus media attention, and motivate people to get involved. And just as many climate advocates realized that warnings of doom (even accurate ones) are often less effective than an optimistic vision of a future of abundance, we should also understand that one of the most powerful arguments in politics is that someone is trying to take something away from you. Which is exactly what Trump will likely do, and when it happens, people ought to be mad about it.</p><p>This fight will take place both in Washington and between the Trump administration on one side and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/what-can-us-cities-and-states-do-for-the-climate-under-trump-plenty/ar-AA1uRBeQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>states and cities</u></a> on the other. Ambitious Democrats including Governor Gavin Newsom of California are looking for ways to resist the new Trump administration, not only on substantive grounds but also because standing up to Trump is good politics for them. When they do so on climate policy (as Newsom did when he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-newsom-ev-electric-vehicle-rebate-b55ab3d35145384c1bb192cbda536b0a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed</u></a> that his state offer tax credits for electric vehicles if Republicans eliminate the ones provided for in the Inflation Reduction Act), it will highlight climate actions Trump is taking that might otherwise have been overlooked. </p><p>In many ways, the climate story of the past few years has been an encouraging one — the passage of the IRA (the most consequential climate law ever), steadily dropping prices for renewables, innovations in energy and carbon mitigation, and more. The next few years will be characterized by conflict. </p><p>That may not be what climate advocates want, but it’s unavoidable. And no outcome is predetermined. November 5 altered the politics of climate change, but it didn’t end them; there will be plenty of opportunities to create controversies, exploit political opportunities, and get voters justifiably angry. Fighting — thoughtfully, with careful planning and energy — will be more important than ever. </p>

## The World Court’s Biggest Case Is About Climate Change

World Court begins hearings on nations’ climate obligations</h3><p>The International Court of Justice – also known as the World Court – today will start hearing from 99 countries and dozens of organizations on what legal obligations rich countries should have in fighting climate change and helping vulnerable nations recover and adapt. Crucially, the judges will also ponder potential consequences for countries’ actions (or lack thereof) that have caused climate harm. Major oil producers and greenhouse gas emitters, as well as OPEC, will also speak at the hearings. The case is the largest in the history of the top U.N. court. An advisory opinion from the World Court would not be binding, but the outcome “could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits,” <em><em>The Associated Press</em></em> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/un-court-climate-global-warming-island-nations-35d35cb3c8a49b980ce458d27cb24844?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_wr-AyfI1Lidgrvu9YIRLz2Ed86H2piFrFl5lLRC6aI1BpPRRZDfzfMxkCB4tCJgQ87akv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.

The week-long U.N. Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meeting in South Korea was the fifth such summit so far and was to be the last, but because it ended without a deal, leaders decided to kick the can down the road and return for more talks at an undetermined later date. The tensions at this meeting weren’t that different from those hampering the COP climate talks on fossil fuel use, with major oil-producing nations blocking meaningful progress. In this case, while more than 100 countries called for a binding treaty to reduce plastic production, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and others opposed this idea and instead favored a voluntary treaty aimed at improving waste management.

## Big Ten fines Michigan and Ohio State $100,000 each for postgame melee

date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA

ROSEMONT, Ill.  — The Big Ten Conference announced it fined Michigan and Ohio State $100,000 each for violating the conference's sportsmanship policy for the on-field melee at the end of the Wolverines' win in Columbus on Saturday.


"Not only did the actions of both teams violate fundamental elements of sportsmanship such as respect and civility, the nature of the incident also jeopardized the safety of participants and bystanders," the Big Ten said in a statement Sunday.


A fight broke out at midfield after the Wolverines' 13-10 victory when Michigan players attempted to plant their flag on the OSU logo and were confronted by the Buckeyes.


Police used pepper spray to break up the players, who threw punches and shoves. One officer suffered a head injury when he was "knocked down and trampled while trying to separate players fighting," a police union official said. The officer was taken to a hospital and has since been released.


After the Ohio State players confronted their rivals at midfield, defensive end Jack Sawyer grabbed the top of the Wolverines' flag and ripped it off the pole as the brawl moved toward the Michigan bench.


"We respect the Big Ten Conference's decision in this matter," Ohio State said in a statement. "What happened post-game yesterday was unfortunate. Good sportsmanship is always important in everything we do at Ohio State. Moving forward, we will continue to examine and address our post-game protocols to ensure our student-athletes, coaches, visiting teams and staff safely exit the field."


Ohio State police said in a statement that "multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray." Michigan players could be seen rubbing their eyes after exposure to the chemical irritant.


Michigan coach Sherrone Moore said after the game both teams could have handled the situation differently.


"So much emotions on both sides," he said. "Rivalry games get heated, especially this one. It's the biggest one in the country, so we got to handle that better."


A Michigan athletic department spokesman said Sunday night the football program would have no comment beyond the team's remarks Saturday.


The scuffle was one of many that broke out Saturday in rivalry games across the country.

## Biden pardons son Hunter for gun, tax offenses

date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden has pardoned his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing this month for gun and tax offenses and could have been imprisoned for years.   


Biden had for months pledged not to pardon his 54-year-old son, a lawyer who for years was caught up in cocaine addiction as his life spiraled out of control. 


But the president said in a statement late Sunday that Hunter Biden’s prosecution was selective and politically motivated, aimed at undercutting his reelection campaign before he dropped out of the race in July for another four-year term. 


“The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,” Biden said.  


Hunter Biden was convicted of three felonies in June for a 2018 gun purchase. Prosecutors said he falsely claimed on a federal form to not be illegally using or addicted to drugs.  


He also pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in a case where he was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.  


He faced up to 17 years in federal prison in the tax case during a scheduled sentencing hearing in Los Angeles on December 16, although sentencing experts said that most likely as a first-time offender, he would have served no more than 36 months behind bars. 


Hunter Biden was facing a stiffer maximum sentence, 25 years, in the gun case but was more likely, based on precedent in similar cases, to be handed a much shorter sentence, perhaps up to 16 months during a hearing scheduled in Delaware for December 13. 


The president’s action Sunday pardoned Hunter Biden in both cases, as well as any offense he “has committed or may have committed or taken part” from Jan. 1, 2014, to Jan. 1, 2024.   


Hunter Biden said in a statement, "I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport." 


The president said in his statement that he hopes “Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.”   


“For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,” Biden said.  


President-elect Donald Trump criticized the move, calling it “such an abuse and miscarriage of justice” compared to hundreds of Trump supporters who have been imprisoned after being convicted for an array of offenses stemming from the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, while they tried to block Congress from certifying that Biden had defeated Trump’s reelection bid in the 2020 campaign. 


Trump has said he will consider pardoning many of the rioters when he takes power again on January 20 after winning the November presidential election. Some of the rioters have already served their sentences, but many are still in prison for years to come, while other trials have yet to occur. 


Trump, in the late stages of his first term in office, pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was convicted on tax offenses and other charges. On Saturday, Trump said he intends to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. ambassador to France. 


Trump also pardoned one of his former national security advisers, Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former chief strategist Steve Bannon and campaign aide George Papadopoulos, among others.  


Reactions to President Biden pardoning his son varied across the U.S. political landscape and not always predictably along political party lines as is usually the case when contentious decisions are announced. 


Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said that while he understood the “natural desire” of Biden wanting to help his son, he said, “I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.” 


Greg Stanton, a Democratic congressman from Arizona, said, “I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a politically motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies and was convicted by a jury of his peers." 


Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, posted on X that he was “shocked” by the pardon because the elder Biden “said many, many times he wouldn’t & I believed him. Shame on me."  


But Eric Holder, a Democrat who was the U.S. attorney general under former President Barack Obama, said the president’s son was only prosecuted because his last name was Biden. He said no U.S. attorney “would have charged this case given the underlying facts.” 


Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.

## Trump appoints Lebanese American Massad Boulos as Middle East adviser

date: 2024-12-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he had appointed American Lebanese businessman Massad Boulos, the father of one of his sons-in-law, as his Middle East adviser.

"Massad is a skilled negotiator and a steadfast advocate for PEACE in the Middle East. He will be a staunch defender of the United States and its interests," Trump wrote on Truth Social, as the conflict between Israel and Hamas has been plaguing the region for more than a year. 

A longtime Republican, Boulos built his fortune selling automobiles in Nigeria. The 2022 marriage of his son Michael Boulos to Donald Trump’s daughter Tiffany propelled him into the newly elected billionaire’s inner circle.

Boulos took an active part in the presidential campaign, working to convince the Arab community in some key states to vote for Trump.

"Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected business leader with extensive experience on the international stage," the president-elect, who is due to take office on January 20, said.

A Maronite Christian, Boulos had tried to get elected as a parliamentarian in Lebanon, without success.

During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would end the conflict between Israel and Hamas, without ever revealing a plan to do so.

Boulos had explained in October that he shared the same philosophy.

Israel "has military objectives to achieve, namely to get rid of Hamas' infrastructure and its capacity to launch new attacks," he said in an interview with Sky News.

But "they have to do it very quickly. (...), It cannot last forever," he added. 

His appointment comes days after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite Islamist movement allied with Hamas and Iran.

This truce in Lebanon gives hope for progress in the Middle East to the administration of Joe Biden, still in power for a few weeks.

In the wake of the Lebanon deal, the United States is "actively" working toward a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Jake Sullivan, the current White House national security adviser, said Sunday. But "we're not there yet," he said.

On Saturday, Trump also named Charles Kushner, the father of his other son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, as U.S. ambassador to France. 

An unusual choice for a diplomatic role: Kushner spent a year in federal prison for tax fraud before being pardoned by Trump toward the end of his first term in the White House.

## Taiwan's president meets Hawaii's governor, others in visit China condemns

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

Honululu, Hawaii — On a two-day visit to Hawaii, Taiwan’s president Lai Ching-te met with the state's governor and congressional representatives as part of a Pacific island tour that has already triggered criticism from Beijing.


On Sunday, China’s Foreign Ministry said it “strongly condemned” U.S. support for Lai’s visit and had lodged a complaint with the U.S. It also denounced a newly announced U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as its own territory.


“China will closely monitor the situation’s development and take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” said the statement.


Hawaii was Lai's first stop on a weeklong voyage that will later take him to the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau. They account for three of the 12 countries Taipei has formal diplomatic relations with.


Hawaii's Gov. Josh Green on Saturday hosted Lai at the state's emergency management agency where they discussed disaster preparedness. Green, who was a longtime emergency room physician before becoming governor, posted on social media that he and Lai discussed how their experiences in health care informed their governance. Lai is also a physician by training and obtained a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University.


“Together, we extended a warm aloha to Lai and his delegation, highlighting Hawai'i’s shared values of resilience and collaboration with Taiwan,” Green said in an Instagram post.


Lai also visited Bishop Museum, Hawaii’s leading museum of natural history and Native Hawaiian culture.


In the evening, Lai posed for photos with Hawaii congressional representatives and state lawmakers at a dinner banquet with the Taiwanese American community.


U.S. Rep. Ed Case, a Democrat who represents Honolulu in Congress, said on social media that he told the audience that “our ties endured on shared values and interests to advance mutual goals and meet shared challenges.”


It is unclear whether Lai with meet with any senior officials from the Biden administration or anyone from the incoming Trump administration during his Hawaii stay.


President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S.


Trump evaded answering whether he would defend the island from Chinese military action.


The new arms deal announced by the U.S. State Department Friday includes $385 million in spare parts and equipment for a fleet of F-16s, as well as support for a tactical communication system to Taiwan.


The U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act but maintains a position of strategic ambiguity over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by China.


Former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen drew vocal opposition from China when she stopped in New York last year on her way to Latin America. Tsai met with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the time.


The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a “stern warning” over what it called collusion between “separatists and foreign forces” days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped over in the U.S.


China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting the island as it views any official contact with foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.

## Biden has AIDS Memorial Quilt at White House, observing World AIDS Day

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday had the AIDS Memorial Quilt spread on the White House South Lawn for the first time in observance of World AIDS Day.


Gathered with the president and his wife, Jill, were survivors, family members and advocates to memorialize the lives lost to the epidemic. The president emphasized the federal government's support for the 1.2 million people in the United States living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can lead to AIDS.


“This movement is fully woven into the fabric and history of America,” Biden said. “For all the lives lost, for all those that are still alive, look at what you’ve already done to change the hearts and minds, to save lives across the country and around the world. That's the power of this movement.”


There were 124 sections of the quilt on the lawn to commemorate people who died due to AIDS-related illnesses. Conceived in 1985, the quilt made its first public appearance in 1987. There was also a red ribbon, a symbol of support and awareness for those with HIV and AIDS, draped across the South Portico of the White House.


There are 40 million people around the world with HIV, according to the White House.

Introducing Biden was Jeanne White-Ginder, whose son, Ryan White, contracted AIDS through a tainted blood transfusion at the age of 13 and died in 1990 at the age of 18. She said her son's experience taught America that “we needed to fight AIDS and not the people who have it.”


The Ryan White CARE Act became law in 1990, and White-Grinder recalled being at the U.S. Capitol to speak for the measure and met Biden when he was a senator from Delaware.


The president also saluted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert until leaving the government in 2022, Fauci was in attendance at the event as he worked to treat AIDS, though he's known by much of the country for his efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic that made him a target of criticism by many Republican lawmakers.


The Biden administration has sought to make investments to stop the epidemic, and the stigmas attached to people with HIV. Among other steps, it has worked to expand access to PrEP, or the pre-exposure prophylaxis, which at-risk populations use to prevent HIV infections.

## Trump nominates Boulos as Middle East adviser

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday his nomination of Lebanese American businessman Massad Boulos to serve as a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.


Boulos is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter Tiffany.  He was a member of Trump’s election campaign, working on the outreach to Arab American communities in the key state of Michigan amid dissatisfaction with the Biden administration’s response to Israel’s offensives against militants in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.


Trump won the state in last month’s election after losing there to President Joe Biden in 2020.


“Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East,” Trump said on his Truth Social site.  “He will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests, and I am pleased to have him on our team!”


Trump on Saturday named Kash Patel to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation, saying he “is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American people.” 


Patel, 44, held three defense, intelligence and national security posts in the first Trump administration but has endeared himself to the incoming chief executive by vowing to clean out the “deep state” at the FBI. He also said he would launch a campaign of retribution against Trump’s adversaries, including FBI agents who have investigated the once-and-future president, journalists and others.


During his first term, Trump suggested naming Patel as the deputy FBI director, but then-Attorney General William Barr, now a Trump critic, said the appointment would only occur “over my dead body.”


Patel has vowed to close the FBI headquarters in Washington and dispatch many of its agents across the country to fight crime, not launch more intelligence-gathering operations.


Trump’s first hurdle in installing Patel as the FBI director is that there already is an FBI director, Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump and whose 10-year term extends to 2027.


Trump would have to fire Wray or Wray would have to resign before Patel could take over. FBI directors are appointed to decade-long terms by design, so that their tenures and investigative directives are not subject to the political whims of the moment. But Trump already fired one FBI director, James Comey, in 2017, before naming Wray.


Trump says the FBI is “badly broken” and has “lost the confidence of America.”


Patel faces a Senate confirmation hearing and is likely to face tough questioning about how he would run the agency and oversee its more than 10,000 criminal investigative agents and another 25,000 staff members.


Patel’s appointment comes on top of other unconventional Trump appointments: vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to oversee the health and human services department, talk show host Pete Hegseth, a decorated military officer with scant managerial experience, to be the Pentagon chief, and Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic-congresswoman-turned-staunch-Trump-defender, as director of national intelligence.


Trump’s first nominee to be attorney general, former Congressman Matt Gaetz, dropped out after eight days as he faced widespread scrutiny of his alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use; charges Gaetz has denied.


Some Republican senators praised Patel’s appointment. Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate next year, meaning Patel could lose the support of three senators and still be confirmed, with Vice President-elect JD Vance casting the decisive tie-breaking vote if needed.


Senator Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Patel "represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI. ... The entire agency needs to be cleaned out."


“There are serious problems at the FBI,” Hagerty said. “The American public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change, and Kash Patel's just the type of person to do it."

Another Republican senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, said Patel was a "very strong nominee" and he thought Patel would be confirmed.


"All of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI," Cruz told CBS' "Face the Nation."


A third Republican, Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said, "Every president wants people that are loyal to themselves." But he called Wray "a very good man,” adding, "I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now."


Democrats are almost certain to oppose the nomination.


Senator Chris Murphy told NBC, "Patel's only qualification is that he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should punish, lock up and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents."


Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.

## 'Moana 2' has record $221 million opening, Hollywood celebrates moviegoing feast

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

New York — Christmas came early at the box office this year. “Moana 2” brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, setting records with $221 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. That, combined with “Wicked” and “Gladiator II,” made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas and a confluence of blockbusters more like what’s often found in late December.


Expectations were high for Walt Disney Co.’s “Moana 2,” but the film — originally planned as a series for Disney+ before it was redirected to the big screen — blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was $125 million for “Frozen 2” in its second week of release in 2019.) “Moana 2” added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million worldwide, it's the second-best global launch of the year.


At the same time, the sensation of “Wicked” showed no signs of slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2 million. Not accounting for inflation, “Wicked” is now the highest grossing Broadway adaptation over “Grease.” (That 1978 film grossed $190 million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.)


“Gladiator II,” meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its opening weekend. Ridley Scott’s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging, “Gladiator II” has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide.


Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420 million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to Comscore — more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that showed the still-potent power of Hollywood’s blockbuster machine. Before “Wicked,” “Moana 2” and “Gladiator II” arrived in theaters, ticket sales were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels.


Michael O’Leary, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theater Owners, said the weekend showed what’s possible when “all the pieces of the puzzle come together” in compelling big-budget movies with marketing muscle.


“We’re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we believe is a full-on charge into the future,” he said. "The remaining quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and 2026. We’re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this industry has had in a long time.”


Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release calendar — 2023's much-ballyhooed “Barbenheimer" — the movie industry again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, “Venom: The Last Dance," for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks, despite not being particularly successful.


“For a long, long time in Hollywood, there’s been a belief that you don’t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,” said O'Leary. “But the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It’s good for the movies. It’s good for the studios. It’s good for the theater owners. But it’s particularly good for the moviegoing public.”


“Moana 2” was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance between theatrical and streaming. The original “Moana," after all, was the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of $680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger announce the release of “Moana 2," with Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui.


“It just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,” says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “Whoever made that decision to go big screen globally with ‘Moana 2,' that was one of the greatest decisions ever.”


And it helped lead a resurgence for Walt Disney Co., whose last two animated November releases — “Strange World” and “Wish” — fizzled in theaters. “Moana 2” may become the third $1 billion-grossing movie for the studio in 2024, along with “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool & Wolverine.” Though reviews for “Moana 2" have only been 65% “fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes, audiences gave it an “A-” CinemaScore.


“Moana 2” is also part of a major rebound for family moviegoing. According to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, family moviegoing in 2024 is going to account for approximately $6.8 billion in ticket sales, roughly the sums of 2022 and 2023, combined.


After such large debuts, “Moana 2” and “Wicked” are likely to continue to drive moviegoing through December. The only question will be if this year's Christmas movies — historically a much bigger holiday period for theaters — can come anywhere near the Thanksgiving lineup. Among the movies aiming for that holiday corridor are Disney's “Mufasa: The Lion King,” Paramount's “Sonic the Hedgehog 3" and Searchlight's “A Complete Unknown,” with Timothee Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan.


Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:

1. "Moana 2," $135 million.

2. “Wicked,” $80 million.

3. “Gladiator II” $30.7 million.

4. “Red One,” $12.9 million.

5. “The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,” $3.3 million.

6. “Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin,” $2.4 million.

7. “Venom: The Last Dance,” $2.2 million.

8. “Heretic,” $956,797.

9. “The Wild Robot,” $670,000.

10. “A Real Pain,” $665,000.

## Heavy snow and numbing temperatures keep parts of the US in deep freeze

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

LOWVILLE, N.Y.  — Heavy snowfall and numbing temperatures kept parts of the U.S. in a deep freeze Sunday as the Thanksgiving holiday weekend draws to a close. Despite the Arctic-type weather, however, snowmobilers and skiers are reveling in their respective wintry terrains, and weather forecasters gave possible good news ahead of the NFL game in Buffalo.


In the remote Tug Hill region of upstate New York, where lake-effect snow off Lake Ontario can dump several centimeters of snow at a time, there was up to 117 centimeters in the Barnes Corners area.


“We just keep digging out,” Kevin Tyo, a local businessman, said Sunday. “We were out all day yesterday, plowing.”


Like many locals, he has a plow attached to the front of his truck for much of the winter, “and I have a tractor with a bucket, and a snowblower.”


His advice? “If you’re not used to it, stay home. If you’re out, slow down.”


Buffalo Bills kickoff set for Sunday night 


In Buffalo, officials with the NFL’s Bills had sought stadium snow shovelers for the season, including ahead of Sunday night’s game against the San Francisco 49ers. The team said it would pay $20 per hour and provide food and hot drinks.


A lake-effect storm began hitting the area Saturday near the Bills’ stadium in Orchard Park, New York. Snow was continuing to fall near the stadium just hours ahead of the game, according to the State Weather Risk Communication Center in New York.


“Snowfall totals will be highly dependent on whether the current lake effect snow shifts just south of the stadium, or remains in place over the stadium longer,” the center said in a post on the social media site X.


Some motorists stuck for hours along New York-Pennsylvania border


Christine Schintzius, her 4- and 8-year-old sons and 12- and 15-year-old nieces had set out on clear roads Friday from Wales, New York, southeast of Buffalo. The family planned to attend a travel hockey tournament in Cleveland but instead found themselves snowbound for 19 hours, stuck inside Schintzius' Honda Pilot.


The family ran into seemingly endless lines of stopped traffic, first on Interstate 90 near the New York-Pennsylvania border for 9 hours, and again on Route 5 in Pennsylvania for 10 hours, until being plowed out by some residents.


“There were lines and lines of cars. It was packed, there was tons of people, tons,” Schintzius said by phone Sunday.


While stuck on Route 5, Schintzius never turned off her car, afraid it wouldn’t start again in the frigid cold. Two truckers stopped to check on them during the night. In the morning the police checked in, along with a local resident who walked the line of cars with a basket of muffins, handing them out and making sure the stranded drivers had water.


“Thankfully, all of my kids, my nieces, all travel well,” said Schintzius, who had packed a cooler with lunch meats, snacks, yogurt and fruit. "And luckily I had still basically a full tank of gas.”


When they were finally free of the backup Saturday, Schintzius turned around and took a roundabout route home, avoiding the worst of the snow that was still falling.


“We went completely around the storm because I was worried, like I’m not getting stuck in that ever again,” she said.


Arctic air late last week brings bitter temperatures


A blast of Arctic air late last week brought bitter temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 degrees Celsius to minus 7 degrees Celsius) below average to the Northern Plains, the National Weather Service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the U.S. by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees (minus 12 degrees Celsius) below average.


Officials in Erie, Pennsylvania, said Sunday that the heavy lake-effect snow has produced “treacherous” conditions that are causing even snowplows to get stuck as they work around the clock to try to clear city roads.


The city estimated Sunday morning that there were “about 100 cars throughout the city that are blocking roads and need to be towed out of the way so plows can get through.”


Commercial vehicles remained banned in both directions of I-90 in western New York along a nearly 216-kilometer stretch to the Pennsylvania line. The National Weather Service said lake-effect snow was expected to continue east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on Sunday, with additional snowfall of 30 to 60 centimeters possible.


New York, Pennsylvania declare emergencies


In a phone interview Saturday with WWNY-TV, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state prepared for the storm for days by deploying snowplows and thousands of workers and consulting with utility providers. She also dispatched personnel from other parts of the state to assist.


“I know it’s something they’re all accustomed to and they can handle, but I want to let them know we are there with reinforcements and to make sure everyone can travel safely, especially over this really busy holiday weekend,” she said.


Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency proclamation Saturday and said parts of Erie County in the northwest received nearly 61 centimeters of snow with more expected through Monday night.


Pennsylvania State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said. Authorities closed part of I-90 in Pennsylvania and westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania.


Michigan battered by lake-effect snow


Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow rolling off Lake Superior buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 61 centimeters or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Marquette, Michigan.


Motorists were warned of potentially dangerous road conditions for holiday travel on Sunday. 


“Expect rapid changes in traveling conditions in and out of snow bands, including snow covered, slick roads, and reduced visibility,” the National Weather Service said Sunday.


There were 69 centimeters of snow just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula’s western reaches, and another 61 centimeters in Munising, in the eastern area. 


Lake-effect snow could add more than 30.5 centimeters over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 15 to 25 centimeters or higher to the west, Chapman said Saturday.


Gaylord, Michigan, received 63 centimeters of snow Friday, setting a new single-day record for the city in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger of the weather service’s Gaylord office. The previous record of 43 centimeters was set March 9, 1942.


Joseph Delizio, a weather service meteorologist based in Gaylord, said heavy snow, especially lake-effect snow, isn’t unusual this time year, “but that magnitude certainly is not.”


“We’ve got more snow in the forecast, believe it or not,” he added.


The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 32 hectares of ski hill terrain among its 809 hectares. It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will increase before the resort's season opening next weekend, Recreation Director Doug Hoeh said.


“Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it’s great for the snow hills, but it’s bad for the parking lots, so we’re kind of digging out,” Hoeh said.

Los Angeles has approved a so-called sanctuary city ordinance. It’s a response to President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations when he assumes the presidency in January. The ordinance won’t stop federal officials from deporting undocumented immigrants, but it reinforces the city’s vow to protect its immigrant population. Angelina Bagdasaryan has the story, narrated by Anna Rice. Camera: Vazgen Varzhabetian

## US will not return nuclear weapons to Ukraine

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear weapons it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.


Sullivan made his remarks when questioned about a New York Times article last month that said some unidentified Western officials had suggested U.S. President Joe Biden could give Ukraine the arms before he leaves office.


"That is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not [giving them] nuclear capability," he told ABC.


Last week, Russia said the idea was "absolute insanity" and that preventing such a scenario was one of the reasons why Moscow sent troops into Ukraine.


Kyiv inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United States and Britain.

## Biden to spotlight Angola’s Lobito Corridor, his legacy to counter China in Africa

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — When U.S. President Joe Biden visits Angola this week, he will put into focus his legacy infrastructure project aimed at securing crucial supply chains on the African continent. Called the Lobito Corridor, the project is the centerpiece of his administration’s strategy to counter China’s clout in global development.


The Lobito Corridor is a $5 billion investment across multiple sectors that is intended to revitalize and extend the 1,300-kilometer Benguela railway line. It will connect the 120-year-old Angolan port of Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in its second phase, to Zambia.


Announced in September 2023, much of the corridor’s financing comes from the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The PGI is a Biden-led 2022 initiative from the Group of Seven wealthiest economies that evolved from his Build Back Better World plan launched in 2021 as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative.




Once operational, it will boost access to critical minerals for the United States and its partners, including cobalt and copper, that are essential in electric vehicle manufacturing. According to a U.S. congressional report, 80% of the DRC’s copper mines are Chinese owned. China is responsible for mining 85% of the DRC’s rare earth minerals, including 76% of its cobalt.




The Lobito Corridor is expected to cut transportation costs, open access to arable agricultural land and drive climate-resilient economic growth, Helaina Matza, acting special coordinator for the PGI at the U.S. Department of State, said Tuesday in a briefing to reporters.


The PGI’s investments will “amplify the impact of that infrastructure” with projects such as developing solar energy, local electricity networks and desalination efforts, she said.


The project is championed by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. Angola owes about $17 billion to China, more than a third of its total debt. The debt is mostly in the form of infrastructure development loans, backed by oil, that funded the country’s economic recovery following three decades of civil war that ended in 2002.


PGI to counter BRI


Since launching the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, in 2013, China has become the main backer of global development financing. In Africa, Beijing has signed loan commitments with 49 African governments and seven regional institutions.


From 2013 to 2021, China provided $679 billion for infrastructure projects around the world, according to a U.S. government analysis, while the U.S. provided $76 billion.


The U.S., alongside G7 partners, announced in 2022 that the PGI aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 as an alternative to infrastructure financing models that are “often opaque, fail to uphold environmental and social standards, exploit workers and leave the recipient countries worse off.”


That’s a lot of financing to catch up to in a few years, and Lobito is “the first and the most developed” project in that effort, said Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.


“That's the A+ project, but I don’t see a whole lot of other projects,” Schneidman told VOA.


The PGI’s other project, the Luzon Corridor, was launched in April to support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila and Batangas in the Philippines.


In Lobito, the U.S. works mostly with European partners. In Luzon, the U.S. is teaming up with Japan to secure critical industries such as semiconductors.


The White House pushed back against the notion that Biden has scaled back his global infrastructure ambitions to the two corridors.


“We’ve mobilized more than $60 billion, just the U.S., and that’s a part of the larger G7,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA during a briefing last month.


“And that’s not just been for two corridors,” he said. “That’s been for investments across Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.”


US-Africa strategy


In August 2022, the Biden administration launched an Africa strategy that “reframes the region’s importance to U.S. national security interests,” the strategy says.


Later that year, Biden hosted the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, where he pledged the U.S. to invest $55 billion in Africa over three years.


“We are overdelivering on that thus far,” Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said in a briefing Tuesday. “We’ve invested more than 80% of that commitment.”


But much of that $55 billion was allocated under existing programs and does not bring the kind of megaproject that is “visible to the average African that says the United States financed that in the way that the Chinese do,” said Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.


Which is why the Lobito Corridor stands out, Dizolele told VOA. It is the “one palpable project that people can look at and say, ‘If this is implemented, then maybe it would move things forward.’”


On a continent where the presence of Chinese financing, businesses and migrants are so prevalent that many African countries teach Mandarin in schools and incorporate Chinese characters in public signage, that’s a start.


Moving forward, activists hope the U.S. will not set aside social and environmental concerns that have besieged projects under Chinese financing.


“We have to ensure that we can hear all stakeholders engaging in the process,” said Sergio Calundungo, founder of the Social Observatory of Angola.


So far, civil society groups have not been invited to the table, but they are ready to ensure that local communities can “share as much as possible the prosperity through this important infrastructure,” he told VOA.


Will it continue?


President-elect Donald Trump will enter office in January. While some are concerned that the U.S. commitment to Africa might falter under his America First doctrine, analysts point to initiatives taken under his first administration.


In 2018, the Trump administration launched Prosper Africa, an initiative that brings together U.S. government services to help investors do business on the continent. In 2019, it launched the Blue Dot Network, an international certification mechanism to ensure infrastructure projects meet environmental and social standards.




They were aware that infrastructure investments needed “to foster economic growth, to foster stability, but also for U.S. interests globally when competing with China,” said Joseph Lemoine, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Freedom and Prosperity Center. “I'm hopeful that they will continue those efforts,” he told VOA.


Trump also launched the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in 2020. The DFC is an agency that functions as America’s development bank, with $60 billion in lending capacity.


DFC’s first CEO, Adam Boehler, a college roommate of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, spoke openly of linking development aid to foreign policy goals. In a 2020 interview, he admitted promising $2 billion for Indonesia should the country agree to join the Trump administration's Abraham Accords and recognize Israel.


“If you listen to all the Trump people, they want a foreign policy that's transactional,” Schneidman at Brookings said.


Trump has promised to take a confrontational approach to China. Analysts say aligning infrastructure financing needs with Trump’s foreign policy goals may be an element in the U.S.-China rivalry that developing nations can leverage.

## Eggs are available but pricier as the holiday baking season begins

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

U.S. egg prices are rising once more as a lingering outbreak of bird flu coincides with the high demand of the holiday baking season.


But prices are still far from the recent peak they reached almost two years ago. And the American Egg Board, a trade group, says egg shortages at grocery stores have been isolated and temporary so far.


"Those are being rapidly corrected, sometimes within a day," said Emily Metz, the Egg Board's president and chief executive officer.


The average price for a dozen eggs in U.S. cities was $3.37 in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was down slightly from September, and down significantly from January 2023, when the average price soared to $4.82. But it was up 63% from October 2023, when a dozen eggs cost an average of $2.07.


Sometimes, supermarkets may be to blame for price spikes. During testimony in August in the Federal Trade Commission's case seeking to block Kroger's merger with Albertsons, Kroger's senior director for pricing acknowledged that the company has raised the cost of milk and eggs beyond the levels of inflation.


But there are other factors behind the price increases. Metz said the egg industry sees its highest demand in November and December, for example.


"You can't have your holiday baking, your pumpkin pie, your stuffing, without eggs," she said.


Avian influenza is another big reason for the higher prices. The current bird flu outbreak that began in February 2022 has led to the slaughter of more than 111 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens. Anytime the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the spread of the disease.




More than 6 million birds have been slaughtered just this month because of bird flu. They were a relatively small part of the total U.S. egg-laying flock of 377 million chickens. Still, the flock is down about 3% over the past year, contributing to a 4% drop in egg production, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.


The latest wave of bird flu is scrambling supplies of cage-free eggs because California has been among the hardest hit states. California, Nevada, Washington and Oregon all require eggs sold in their states to be cage-free.


"We're having to move eggs from other areas of the country that are producing cage-free to cover that low supply in those states, because those states only allow for cage-free eggs to be sold," Metz said.


Cage-free requirements are set to go into effect in Arizona, Colorado and Michigan next year and in Rhode Island and Utah in 2030.


Demand for such specialty eggs may also be contributing to avian flu, which is spread through the droppings of wild birds as they migrate past farms. Allowing chickens to roam more freely puts them at greater risk, said Chad Hart, a professor and agricultural economist at Iowa State University.


"It's really hard to control that interaction between domesticated birds and wild birds," Hart said. "Some of those vectors have been opened up because we're asking the egg industry to produce in ways that we didn't ask them to before."


Metz said climate change and extreme weather are also blowing some wild birds off course.


"We have birds that have been displaced by hurricanes, by wildfires, and those birds are now circulating in areas that they otherwise might not circulate or at times of the year that they otherwise may not be circulating," she said. "And those are all new variables that our farmers are having to deal with."


Hart said the egg industry is trying to rebuild the flock, but that also can limit supplies, since farmers have to hold back some eggs to hatch into new chickens.


Still, there is some good news on U.S. poultry farms. The price of chicken feed — which represents 70% of a farmer's costs — has fallen significantly after doubling between 2020 and 2022, Hart said.

## More sand is in sight for a Jersey Shore resort town's deteriorating beaches

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

NORTH WILDWOOD, NEW JERSEY — A decade-long conflict over the condition of a New Jersey resort town's beaches, involving tens of millions of dollars in litigation and fines, could come to an end soon.  


Patrick Rosenello, the mayor of North Wildwood, says his town has reached an agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to drop claims on both sides and move forward with measures to widen beaches in the community, popular with tourists from the Philadelphia area.  


The agreement, which is up for a vote Tuesday by North Wildwood's council, would resolve all outstanding disputes between the parties, the Republican mayor said. The tentative timing of the replenishment is sometime in 2025, he said.  


The agreement includes canceling the $12 million New Jersey has fined North Wildwood for unauthorized beach repairs that the state says could actually worsen erosion. It also calls for the city to drop a lawsuit against the state seeking reimbursement for the $30 million it has spent trucking in sand for emergency repairs to eroded sections of its beach over the past decade.   




“We agreed that we will concentrate on protecting our beaches instead of suing each other,” Rosenello said Wednesday.  


At the root of the dispute is the fact that North Wildwood is virtually the only Jersey Shore community that has yet to receive a full beach replenishment project from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Officials say difficulty in getting easements from affected property owners has contributed to the delay.  


Erosion had become so bad in parts of North Wildwood that protective sand dunes were obliterated, leaving homes and businesses vulnerable to flooding and wave damage in the event of a major storm, At one point in January, Rosenello posed for photos on the beach with what was left of a dune barely reaching his knees.  


The state Department of Transportation did an interim replenishment project last summer after Democratic Governor Phil Murphy called the erosion in North Wildwood “shocking.” Rosenello said that work has held up well in the ensuing months.  


The environmental department declined to comment on the proposed agreement. Rosenello predicted it will be approved by the council and signed and sent to the state Tuesday.  


In addition to ending the litigation, North Wildwood will contribute $1 million to the eventual cost of the federal beach replenishment project once it arrives in the city, and will pay $700,000 into a state water pollution control fund, the mayor said.  


The agreement also lays out a clear regulatory path for North Wildwood to obtain the environmental permits it needs to carry out other shore protection work including extension of a sea wall.  


On several occasions, North Wildwood carried out emergency repairs, including construction of an earlier bulkhead without approval from the state. Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environment protection commissioner, warned the town in 2023 that unauthorized work could have more serious consequences if it continues, including potential loss of future shore protection funding.

## US proposes new habitat protections in southern Rockies for Canada lynx

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

BILLINGS, MONTANA — U.S. wildlife officials finalized a recovery plan for imperiled populations of Canada lynx on Wednesday and proposed new habitat protections in the southern Rocky Mountains for the forest-dwelling wildcats that are threatened by climate change.


The fate of the proposal is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump: Officials during the Republican's first term sought unsuccessfully to strip lynx of protections that they've had since 2000 under the Endangered Species Act.


Almost 20,000 square kilometers of forests and mountains in Colorado and northern New Mexico are covered under the habitat proposal. That's different from a previous plan that left out the southern Rockies and concentrated instead on recovery efforts elsewhere, including Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota and Maine.


"This is a significant change and a good one," said Matthew Bishop, an attorney for Western Environmental Law Center who has been involved in efforts to protect lynx through court actions. "They weren't really committing to conserve lynx in Colorado anymore, and now they are."


Areas of protected habitat also are being added in Idaho and Montana. Protected areas in Wyoming would be sharply reduced under Wednesday's proposal.


Wildlife officials said they were removing locations where they consider lynx unlikely to thrive in the future, while adding new areas that the latest science suggests are more suitable to their long-term survival.


Lynx are elusive animals that live in cold boreal forests and prey primarily on snowshoe hares.


They originally received federal protections because the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management didn't have sufficient regulations in place to shield their populations from potential harm. Those protective rules are now in place, but climate change has emerged as a new, worsening threat.




Warmer temperatures are melting away the lynx's snowy habitat and could decrease the availability of snowshoe hares. Declines for lynx are expected across the contiguous U.S. under even the most optimistic warming scenario that officials have considered.


Most areas suitable for lynx are in Canada and Alaska, where the animals are widespread and hunting and trapping of them is allowed.


Their numbers never were great in the contiguous U.S., which is at the southern fringe of the species range, but the hope is to maintain some population strongholds so they can persist in a warmer world.


The changes announced Wednesday follow a 2016 court ruling that faulted federal wildlife officials for not designating protections for lynx habitat in Colorado and some parts of Montana and Idaho.


There are more than 1,100 lynx in the contiguous U.S., according to estimates from scientists. Those numbers are expected to plummet in some areas, and officials are aiming for a minimum contiguous U.S. population of a combined 875 lynx over a 20-year period.


More than 200 lynx were reintroduced in Colorado beginning in 1999 and at the time their prospects were considered uncertain.


"There were concerns about whether it would stick," said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lynx biologist Jim Zelenak. "But they do seem to be hanging on."


Now that area could become one of the future population strongholds, with the southern Rockies in Colorado and the region around Yellowstone National Park are most likely to have temperatures favorable to lynx for the longest time, he said.


Maine has the most lynx currently but is expected to be hit harder by climate change.


"We've got this overarching threat of climate warming, and so we want to do everything we can to minimize the effects that we can control," Zelenak said. "So we don't want to put roads in the wrong places. We don't want to permanently convert very much of the habitat at all in the hopes that we can keep these populations viable coming into a warming future."


Habitat protections in Maine and Minnesota would remain unchanged under the proposal.


A final decision is expected late next year.

## President-elect Trump has sought Orban's take on Ukraine war, sources say

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has held multiple phone conversations with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban since winning the November 5 presidential election, according to sources who spoke to RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service.


Hungarian government sources said Trump has sought Orban’s opinion on ending the Ukraine war, which has continued to drag on since Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022.


On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the billions of dollars that the United States has poured into Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion.


He has also said he could end the war within 24 hours of retaking the White House, a statement that some have interpreted as meaning that Ukraine would have to surrender territory that Russia now occupies.


Orban, who has maintained friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, has been critical of EU aid for Ukraine and has obstructed the bloc’s sanctions regime against Moscow.


Preparations reportedly are under way for Orban to take a second crack at a peace mission in December to bookend Hungary’s rotating EU presidency after his first attempt in July when Budapest’s tenure started.


In a move criticized by several EU leaders, Orban traveled to Moscow to meet Putin in July after a trip to Kyiv with a mystery ceasefire proposal for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He then traveled to China and finally the United States to meet Trump, who was then on the presidential campaign trail.


Details of a potential peace mission in December are not clear, but sources suggested to RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service that it may involve delivering Trump’s messages to Zelenskyy, Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

## Trump set to nominate former prosecutor to head FBI

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday he wanted former National Security official and loyalist Kash Patel to lead the FBI, signaling an intent to replace the bureau's current director, Christopher Wray.


Patel, who during Trump's first term advised both the director of national intelligence and the secretary of defense, has previously called for stripping the FBI of its intelligence-gathering role and purging its ranks of any employee who refuses to support Trump's agenda.


"The biggest problem the FBI has had, has come out of its intel shops. I'd break that component out of it. I'd shut down the FBI Hoover building on day one and reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state," Patel said in a September interview on the conservative "Shawn Ryan Show."




"And I'd take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to chase down criminals. Go be cops. You're cops. Go be cops."


With the nomination of Patel, Trump, a Republican, seems to be preparing to oust Wray, a Republican first appointed by Trump. Wray's 10-year term at the FBI does not expire until 2027.


Asked about Patel's nomination, which will need Senate confirmation, an FBI spokesperson said on Saturday: "Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of threats. Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for."


FBI directors by law are appointed to 10-year terms as a means of insulating the bureau from politics.


Wray, whom Trump tapped after firing James Comey in 2017 for investigating his 2016 campaign, has been a frequent target of Trump supporters' ire.


During Wray's tenure, the FBI carried out a court-approved search at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate to look for classified documents. He also has faced criticism for his oversight role of a directive by Attorney General Merrick Garland aimed at working to protect local school boards from violent threats and harassment.


Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the two federal prosecutions against Trump for his role in subverting the 2020 election and retaining classified documents, asked on November 25 the judges overseeing those cases to dismiss them before Trump takes office on January 20, citing a Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president.


Wray had previously signaled no intention of stepping down early and was busy planning events well into his 2025 calendar, according to a person familiar with the matter.




Patel, 44, previously worked as a federal public defender and a federal prosecutor.


He was instrumental in working to lead House Republicans' probe into the FBI's 2016 investigation into contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia during his time as an aide to former House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes.


Later, during Trump's first impeachment trial, ex-National Security Council official Fiona Hill told House investigators she was concerned Patel was secretly serving as a back channel between Trump and Ukraine without authorization.


Patel denied those allegations.


After Trump left office in January 2021, Patel was one of several people Trump designated as a representative for access to his presidential records. He was one of the few former Trump administration officials who claimed, without evidence, that Trump had declassified all of the records in question.


He was later subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in connection with the probe.


Also Saturday, Trump named Chad Chronister, the sheriff of Hillsborough County, Florida, as his choice for administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency. In that role, Chronister would work closely with Trump's choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi.


Bondi is from the Tampa area that Chronister serves.




"As DEA Administrator, Chad will work with our great Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to secure the Border, stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs, across the Southern Border, and SAVE LIVES," Trump wrote on his social-media platform Truth Social.


Trump also named real estate mogul Charles Kushner to serve as U.S. ambassador to France. Kushner is the father of Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.


"He (Charles Kushner) is a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker, who will be a strong advocate representing our Country & its interests," Trump said in a post on Truth Social announcing the pick.

## Biden makes historic first visit by US president to Angola

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden is "excited" to make his first trip to the African continent next week and will first stop briefly in the small island nation of Cabo Verde before making landfall in the Southwest African nation of Angola, a top White House official told VOA Friday.


"He is excited and really looking forward to the trip," Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, told VOA at the White House. "I think the president really sees this as a way to sum up all that he's tried to put forward during this administration on our Africa strategy."


While there, she said, he will work on three objectives: on bolstering regional security, notably in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo; on growing economic opportunities in the region; and on improving technological and scientific cooperation.




"He sees Angola as the perfect place for this," she said.


Some analysts say the fulfillment of Biden's vow to visit Africa — made in 2022 — is well overdue. Biden originally planned to visit Angola in October; he postponed that trip because Hurricane Milton was bearing down on the eastern United States.


"I think coming, as it does, at the very tail end of his administration, without much to, I think, really celebrate in terms of his involvement in Africa, that I think the visit will ring rather hollow," Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA.


The main attraction of the short visit is a major U.S.-financed development project: the 1,300-kilometer Lobito rail corridor, which connects the mineral-rich African interior to the southwestern port. The U.S. says it has pulled together more than $4 billion in U.S. investment on the project.


When asked by VOA if Biden will attempt to discuss Angola's many documented human rights problems, Brown repeated a refrain often voiced by Biden administration officials, saying: "he never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts."


The short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde could be seen as a way to balance this concern, Michael Walsh, a visiting researcher at the Lasky Center of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, told VOA.


"They're trying to, you know, add a stop that provides an opportunity for the Biden administration to say, look, we actually are visiting a flawed democracy as well as a hybrid regime," he said.


He added, "That provides them with an opportunity to try to, I guess, mitigate some of the criticism that would be forthcoming during the visit by saying that the Biden administration isn't just stopping in one African country. They actually stopped in two and one of those is on the other side of the democracy spectrum."


Angola's president, Joao Lourenco, is a prominent figure on the African continent, using his status as leader of a subcontinental oil giant to build his influence and to work to settle conflicts near and far, both in neighboring Congo and in the West African "coup belt." This, Brown said, ties into one of Biden's core beliefs as he prepares to leave office: That the U.S. sees African nations as partners and problem-solvers.


While there, she said, Biden plans to deliver remarks on how he sees the future of relations between Washington and the continent.


"I think he wants to leave behind his recognition that African leadership for solving some of these challenges is essential, and that's why he'll be amplifying Angola's role mediating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere," she said. "And I think he wants to convey the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angolan partnership, which is in many ways the story of the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-African relationship over many centuries."

## Trump names pardoned real estate developer Charles Kushner for US ambassador

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France.


Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, calling Charles Kushner “a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker."


Kushner is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. Jared Kushner is a former White House senior adviser to Trump who is married to Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka.


The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after pleading guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations.


Prosecutors alleged that after Charles Kushner discovered his brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation, he hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation.


Kushner hired a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law, then arranged to have the encounter in a New Jersey motel room recorded with a hidden camera and the recording sent to his own sister, the man’s wife, prosecutors said.


Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to 18 counts including tax evasion and witness tampering. He was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison — the most he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought.


Christie has blamed Jared Kushner for his firing from Trump’s transition team in 2016, and has called Charles Kushner’s offenses "one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was U.S. attorney."


Trump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles and their children were married in 2009.

## Activists: Mexico breaks up 2 migrant caravans heading to US

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

TAPACHULA, Mexico — Mexican immigration authorities have broken up two small migrant caravans headed to the U.S. border, activists said Saturday. 


Some migrants were bused to cities in southern Mexico, and others were offered transit papers. 


The action comes a week after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican products unless the country does more to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. 


On Wednesday, Trump wrote that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States. Sheinbaum wrote on her social media accounts the same day that "migrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the border." 


Migrant rights activist Luis Garcia Villagran said the breaking-up of the two caravans appeared to be part of "an agreement between the president of Mexico and the president of the United States." 


The first of the caravans started out from the southern Mexico city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, on November 5, the day Trump was elected. At its height it had about 2,500 people. In almost four weeks of walking, it had gone about 270 miles (430 kilometers) to Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca. 


In Tehuantepec, Mexican immigration officials offered the tired migrants free bus rides to other cities in southern or central Mexico. 


"They took some of us to Acapulco, others to Morelia, and others from our group to Oaxaca city," said Barbara Rodriguez, an opposition supporter who left her native Venezuela after that country's contested presidential elections earlier this year. 


Rodriguez said by telephone she later caught a bus on her own to Mexico City. 


The second caravan of about 1,500 migrants set out on November 20 and made it about 140 miles (225 kilometers) to the town of Tonala, in Chiapas state. There, authorities offered a sort of transit visa that allows travel across Mexico for 20 days. 


Sheinbaum has said she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted. But her statement — the day after she held a phone call with Trump — did not make clear who had offered what. 


Apart from the much larger first caravans in 2018 and 2019 — which were provided buses to ride part of the way north — no caravan has ever reached the U.S. border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way, though some individual members have made it. 


For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border.

## Snow blankets parts of US during busy holiday travel weekend

date: 2024-12-01, from: VOA News USA

BUFFALO, NEW YORK — The first big snowfall of the season blanketed towns along Lake Erie on Saturday in the middle of the hectic holiday travel and shopping weekend. Numbing cold and heavy snow are forecast to persist into next week and cause hazards in the Great Lakes, Plains and Midwest regions. 


The heavy snow led to a state of emergency declaration in parts of New York and a disaster declaration in Pennsylvania, with officials warning of dangerous conditions for Thanksgiving travelers trying to return home. 


"Travel will be extremely difficult and hazardous this weekend, especially in areas where multiple feet of snow may accumulate very quickly," the National Weather Service said. 


Part of I-90 in Pennsylvania was closed, as were westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania. Nearly 2 feet (61 centimeters) of snow fell in parts of New York, Ohio and Michigan, and 29 inches (73 centimeters) was recorded in Pennsylvania's northwestern tip. 


With roads in some parts impassable in northwestern Pennsylvania, scores of people took refuge overnight in the lobby and hallways of a fully booked Holiday Inn near I-90. Hotel staffer Jeremiah Weatherley said dozens of people rolled in as the snow piled up, and workers opened the conference room and gave them blankets to sleep on the floor. 


"It was hard to manage, but we had no choice," he said. "They just showed up, and we don't want to turn people away." 


Weatherley was handing out bagels, juice and cereal Saturday morning as people helped one another dig out their cars from the snow. 


"Everyone helped each other," he said. "It was pretty cool." 


This week's blast of Arctic air also brought temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average to the Northern Plains, the weather service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. 


Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the United States by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees below average. 


Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow that have been rolling off Lake Superior for the past three days buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 2 feet (61 centimeters) or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's office in Marquette, Michigan. 


Twenty-seven inches (69 centimeters) of snow was on the ground just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula's western reaches, she said. Another 2 feet (61 centimeters) fell in Munising, in the eastern part of the peninsula. 


Chapman said continued lake-effect snow could add more than a foot (30.5 centimeters) over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 centimeters) or higher to the west. 


Meanwhile steady winds that trained snow bands Friday on Gaylord, Michigan, dumped 24.8 inches (63 centimeters), setting a new single-day record for the city, which sits in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger, a meteorologist with the weather service's Gaylord office. The previous record of 17.0 inches (43 centimeters) was from March 9, 1942. 


The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 80 acres (32 hectares) of ski hill terrain among its 2,000 acres (809 hectares), said Doug Hoeh, the resort's director of recreation. It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will be adding to in the coming days before the resort opens for the season next weekend. 


"Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it's great for the snow hills, but it's bad for the parking lots, so we're kind of digging out," Hoeh said. "But we're close to being ready to pull the trigger on skiing, and the natural snowfall definitely helps." 


In Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro signed a proclamation of disaster emergency and said parts of Erie County in the state's northwest had already received nearly 2 feet (1 meter) of snow with more expected through Monday night. 


State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said.

## Trump threatens BRICS nations with 100% tariff if they replace US dollar

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs Saturday against a bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. 


His threat was directed at countries in the so-called BRICS alliance, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. 


Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members of the alliance, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. 


While the U.S. dollar is by far the most-used currency in global business and has survived past challenges to its preeminence, members of the alliance and other developing nations say they are fed up with America's dominance of the global financial system. 


Trump, in a Truth Social post, said, "We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy." 


At a summit of BRICS nations in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the U.S. of "weaponizing" the dollar and described it as a "big mistake." 


"It's not us who refuse to use the dollar," Putin said at the time. "But if they don't let us work, what can we do? We are forced to search for alternatives." 


Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network, SWIFT, and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. 


Trump said there is "no chance" BRICS will replace the U.S. dollar in global trade and any country that tries to make that happen "should wave goodbye to America."

## What to know about plastic pollution crisis as treaty talks conclude

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA — The world’s nations will wrap up negotiating a treaty this weekend to address the global plastic pollution crisis.


Their meeting is scheduled to conclude Sunday or early Monday in Busan, South Korea, where many environmental organizations have flocked to push for a treaty to address the volume of production and toxic chemicals used in plastic products.


Greenpeace said it escalated its pressure Saturday by sending four international activists to Daesan, South Korea, who boarded a tanker headed into port to load chemicals used to make plastics.


Graham Forbes, who leads the Greenpeace delegation in Busan, said the action is meant to remind world leaders they have a clear choice: Deliver a treaty that protects people and the planet, or side with industry and sacrifice the health of every living person and future generations.


Here’s what to know about plastics:


Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic.


The use of plastics has quadrupled over the past 30 years. Plastic is ubiquitous. And every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic are dumped into the world’s oceans, rivers and lakes, the U.N. said. Most nations agreed to make the first global, legally binding plastic pollution accord, including in the oceans, by the end of 2024.


Plastic production could climb about 70% by 2040 without policy changes.


The production and use of plastics globally is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, according to the intergovernmental Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.


Panama is leading an effort to address the exponential growth of plastic production as part of the treaty, supported by more than 100 countries. There’s just too much plastic, said Juan Carlos Monterrey, head of Panama’s delegation.


“If we don’t have production in this treaty, it is not only going to be horribly sad, but the treaty may as well be called the greenwashing recycling treaty, not the plastics treaty,” he said in an interview. “Because the problem is not going to be fixed.”


China, the United States and Germany are the biggest plastics players.


China was by far the biggest exporter of plastic products in 2023, followed by Germany and the U.S., according to the Plastics Industry Association.


Together, the three nations account for 33% of the total global plastics trade, the association said.


The United States supports having an article in the treaty that addresses supply, or plastic production, a senior member of the U.S. delegation told The Associated Press Saturday.


Most plastic ends up as waste


Less than 10% of plastics are recycled. Most of the world’s plastic goes to landfills, pollutes the environment or is burned.


Sarah Dunlop, head of plastics and human health at the Minderoo Foundation, said chemicals are leaching out of plastics and “making us sick.”


The International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Plastics held an event about the impact of plastics Saturday on the sidelines of the talks. They want the treaty to fully recognize their rights and the universal human right to a healthy, clean, safe and sustainable environment.


Juan Mancias of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation in Texas spoke about feeling a spiritual connection to the land.


“Five hundred years ago, we had clean water, clean air, and there was no plastics,” he said. “What happened?”


Many plastics are used for packaging


About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations. This includes single-use plastic food and beverage containers — water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, straws and shopping bags — that often end up polluting the environment.


U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen told negotiators in Busan the treaty must tackle this problem.


“Are there specific plastic items that we can live without, those that so often leak into the environment? Are there alternatives to these items? This is an issue we must agree on,” she said.

## Taiwan's president arrives in Hawaii as part of South Pacific visit

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

HONOLULU, HAWAII — Taiwan President Lai Ching-te arrived Saturday in Hawaii to begin a two-day transit in the U.S. as part of a trip to the South Pacific, his first since assuming office. 


The stopover in Hawaii and one planned for the territory of Guam have drawn fierce criticism from Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and objects to official exchanges between the self-ruled democracy and the U.S., the island's biggest backer and military provider. 


There were no high-ranking U.S. or Hawaii state officials to greet Lai at the Honolulu hotel where supporters cheered in Mandarin, some waving Taiwanese flags. He visited the Bishop Museum, Hawaii's leading museum of natural history and Native Hawaiian culture. Later, he was expected to attend a banquet with supporters. 




Lai is on a weeklong trip to visit the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — three diplomatic allies of the self-governed island in the Pacific. Though Taiwan retains strong contacts with dozens of other nations, it has only 12 formal diplomatic allies. 


Bishop Museum CEO Dee Jay Mailer presented Lai with a red lei hulu, or feather garland, made by master featherwork artist Kawika Lum-Nelmida. Lai gave Mailer a headdress made by Paiwan Indigenous people of Taiwan, and neck and shoulder decorative pieces made by Atayal Indigenous people, also of Taiwan. 


Lai's visit shows that Taiwan and the United States have a very strong relationship, said Arthur Chen, the president of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce of North America. He flew to Hawaii from his home near Dallas, Texas, to welcome the president to the United States.


Chen said he understood the U.S. has its own foreign policy but he said Lai should be treated as a head of state during his stay. 


Taiwan and the U.S. share common values such as a belief in democracy and human rights, Chen said. "So we should help each other," he said. 


Lai didn't make any public remarks at his initial engagements in Hawaii, but he spoke before his departure from Taiwan. 


"I want to use the values of democracy, peace, and prosperity to continue to expand our cooperation with our allies, to deepen our partnership and let the world see Taiwan not just as a model of democracy, but a vital power in promoting the world's peace and stability, and prosperous development," he said at Taoyuan International Airport. 


It is unclear whether Lai will meet with any members of the incoming U.S. administration during his transit. 


President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S. 


Trump evaded answering whether he would defend the island from Chinese military action. On Friday, the U.S. State Department said it approved the sale of $385 million in spare parts and equipment for a fleet of F-16s, as well as support for tactical communication system to Taiwan. 


While the U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act, it has maintained a position of strategic ambiguity over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by China. 


A second Trump administration is expected to test U.S.-China relations even more than the Republican's first term, when the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion in Chinese products. 


Taiwan is one of the main sources of tension in the bilateral relationship. 


Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday if the U.S. wanted to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it is important for it to handle the Taiwan issue "with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China's peaceful reunification." 


She also said China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, including visits by Taiwan's leaders to the U.S. for any reason. 


China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting the island as it views any official contact with foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.

## Intimate documentary captures the Beatles goofing around as they take America by storm in 1964

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Likely most people have seen iconic footage of the Beatles performing on "The Ed Sullivan Show." But how many have seen Paul McCartney during that same U.S. trip feeding seagulls off his hotel balcony?


That moment — as well as George Harrison and John Lennon goofing around by exchanging their jackets — are part of the Disney+ documentary "Beatles '64," an intimate look at the English band's first trip to America that uses rare and newly restored footage. It streams Friday.


"It's so fun to be the fly on the wall in those really intimate moments," says Margaret Bodde, who produced alongside Martin Scorsese. "It's just this incredible gift of time and technology to be able to see it now with the decades of time stripped away so that you really feel like you're there."


"Beatles '64" leans into footage of the 14-day trip filmed by documentarians Albert and David Maysles, who left behind 11 hours of the Fab Four goofing around in New York's Plaza hotel or traveling. It was restored by Park Road Post in New Zealand.


"It's beautiful, although it's black and white and it's not widescreen," says director David Tedeschi. "It's like it was shot yesterday and it captures the youth of the four Beatles and the fans."


The footage is augmented by interviews with the two surviving members of the band and people whose lives were impacted, including some of the women who as teens stood outside their hotel hoping to catch a glimpse of the Beatles.


"It was like a crazy love," fan Vickie Brenna-Costa recalls in the documentary. "I can't really understand it now. But then, it was natural."


The film shows the four heartthrobs flirting and dancing at the Peppermint Lounge disco, Harrison noodling with a Woody Guthrie riff on his guitar and tells the story of Ronnie Spector sneaking the band out a hotel back exit and up to Harlem to eat barbeque.


The documentary coincides with the release of a box set of vinyl albums collecting the band's seven U.S. albums released in '64 and early '65 — "Meet The Beatles!," "The Beatles' Second Album," "A Hard Day's Night" (the movie soundtrack), "Something New," "The Beatles' Story," "Beatles '65" and "The Early Beatles." They had been out of print on vinyl since 1995.


The Beatles' U.S. visit in 1964 also included concerts at Carnegie Hall, a gig at the Washington Coliseum in Washington, D.C., and a visit to Miami, where the band met Muhammad Ali. The documentary shows members of the band reading newspaper coverage of themselves.


Viewers may learn that the Beatles — now revered — were often met with ridicule or rudeness from the older generation. At the British Embassy in New York, the four were treated as lower class, while renowned broadcaster Eric Sevareid, doing a piece for CBS, compared the reaction to the Beatles to the German measles.


"You're nothing but four Elvis Presleys," one reporter told them during a press conference, to which the boys good-naturedly started gyrating as Ringo Starr screamed "It's not true!"


"Why the establishment was against them is sort of a mystery to me," says Tedeschi. "I think older people believed that music would go back to the big bands."


Musicians like Sananda Maitreya, Ron Isley and Smokey Robinson also discuss the Fab Four and what they took from Black music. There also are interviews with residents of Harlem, critic Joe Queennan and filmmaker David Lynch, who saw the Beatles play the Washington Coliseum.


"Beatles '64" tries to explain why young people were so besotted by John, Paul, George and Ringo. Their visit came just months after the assassination of President John. F. Kennedy and Tedeschi argues Beatlemania was a salve for a nation in mourning.


"Part of it is I think that the light was just off. They were depressed. Everything was dark. And 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' lit them up," says Tedeschi.


As McCartney says in the documentary: "Maybe America needed something like the Beatles to lift it out of mourning and just sort of say 'Life goes on.'"

## Will Trump's return lead to a new wave of bestselling books?

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — As she anticipates her estranged uncle's return to the White House, Mary Trump isn't expecting any future book to catch on like such first-term tell-alls as Michael Wolff's million-selling Fire and Fury or her own blockbuster, Too Much and Never Enough.


"What else is there to learn?" she says. "And for people who don't know, the books have been written. It's all really out in the open now."


For publishers, Donald Trump's presidential years were a time of extraordinary sales in political books, helped in part by Trump's legal threats and angered tweets. According to Circana, which tracks around 85% of the hardcover and paperback market, the genre's sales nearly doubled from 2015 to 2020, from around 5 million copies to around 10 million.


Besides books by Wolff and Trump, other bestsellers included former FBI Director James Comey's A Higher Loyalty, former national security adviser John Bolton's The Room Where it Happened and Bob Woodward's Fear. Meanwhile, sales for dystopian fiction also jumped, led by Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, which was adapted into an award-winning Hulu series.


But interest has dropped back to 2015 levels since Trump left office, according to Circana, and publishers doubt it will again peak so highly. Readers not only showed little interest in books by or about President Joe Biden and his family — they even seemed less excited about Trump-related releases. Mary Trump's Who Could Ever Love You and Woodward's War were both popular this fall, but neither has matched the sales of their books written during the first Trump administration.




"We've been there many times, with all those books," HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham says of the various Trump tell-alls. He added that he still sees a market for at least some Trump books — perhaps analyzing the recent election — because "there's a general, serious smart audience, not politically aligned in a hard way," one that would welcome "an intelligent voice."


"It's like the reboot of any hit TV show," says Eric Nelson, publisher and vice president of Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins that's released books by Jared Kushner, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump Cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Sen. Marco Rubio. "You're not hoping for ratings like last time, just better ratings than the boring show it's replacing."


In the days following Trump's victory, The Handmaid's Tale and George Orwell's 1984 returned to bestseller lists, along with more contemporary works such as Timothy Snyder's On Tyranny, a 2017 bestseller that expanded upon a Facebook post Snyder wrote soon after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Books appealing to pro-Trump readers also surged, including those written by Cabinet picks — Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s The Real Anthony Fauci and Hegseth's The War on Warriors — and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, his 2016 memoir that's sold hundreds of thousands of copies since Trump selected him as his running mate.


First lady Melania Trump's memoir, Melania, came out in October and has been high on Amazon.com bestseller lists for weeks, even as critics found it contained little newsworthy information. According to Circana, it has sold more than 200,000 copies, a figure that does not include books sold directly through her website.


"The Melania book has done extraordinarily well, better than we thought," says Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt. "After Election Day, we sold everything we had of it."


Conservative books have sold steadily over the years, and several publishers — most recently Hachette Book Group — have imprints dedicated to those readers. Publishers expect at least some critical books to reach bestseller lists — if only because of the tradition of the publishing market favoring the party out of power. But the nature of what those books would look like is uncertain. Perhaps a onetime insider will have a falling out with Trump and write a memoir, like Bolton or former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, or maybe some of his planned initiatives, whether mass deportation or the prosecution of his political foes, will lead to investigative works.


A new Fire and Fury is doubtful, with the originally only possible because Wolff enjoyed extraordinary access, spending months around Trump and his White House staff. Members of the president-elect's current team have already issued a statement saying they have refused to speak with Wolff, calling the author a "known peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened."


A publicist for Wolff declined to comment.


Woodward, who interviewed Trump at length for the 2020 bestseller Rage, told The Associated Press that he had written so much about Trump and other presidents that he wasn't sure what he'd take on next. He doesn't rule out another Trump book, but that will depend in part on the president-elect, how "out of control he gets," Woodward said, and how far he is able to go.


"He wants to be the imperial president, where he gets to decide everything and no one's going to get in his way," Woodward said. "He's run into some brick walls in the past and there may be more brick walls. I don't know what will happen. I'll be watching and doing some reporting, but I'm still undecided."


5 bestselling Trump-related books, per Circana



	Too Much and Never Enough, by Mary Trump: 1,248,212 copies
	Fire and Fury, by Michael Wolff: 936,116 copies
	Fear, by Bob Woodward: 872,014 copies
	The Room Where It Happened, by John Bolton: 676,010 copies
	Rage, by Bob Woodward: 549,685 copies


These figures represent total sales provided by Circana, which tracks about 85% of the print market and does not include e-book or audiobook sales.

## Foreign smartphone sales in China drop 44% in October, data show

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

New data released Wednesday from a Chinese government-affiliated research firm showed sales of foreign-branded smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone, fell 44.25% year-on-year in China in October, while overall phone sales in China have increased 1.8%, Reuters reported.


The data released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology revealed sales of foreign-branded phones in China decreased to 6.22 million units last month, down from 11.149 million units a year earlier.


The decrease of foreign phone sales comes in the wake of Chinese tech conglomerate Huawei’s rise to the top of the phone market in China.


Huawei was widely popular in China’s smartphone market last year when it released the Mate 60 Pro, a phone with a tiny computer chip more advanced than any other chip previously made by a Chinese company.


Chinese consumers have eagerly embraced Huawei's smartphones, drawn to the appeal of locally made technology — an option that has swayed many who might have previously chosen iPhones.


On Tuesday, the Chinese phone maker launched the next generation of the Mate 60 Pro, the Mate 70 series. The smartphone was described by Huawei’s consumer group chairman Richard Yu as the “smartest” Mate phone, The New York Times reported.


The Mate 70 series features hardware and software that are the most independent from Western influence to date. Highlights of Huawei’s newest phone include artificial intelligence-enabled functions and improved photography. The phone uses an operating system of HarmonyOS, which allows the smartphones to connect with smart devices.


Huawei’s ability to self-supply the chips required for its hardware and software represents a notable development, following previous U.S. measures to restrict the company’s access to key partners and suppliers.


AI technology relies on advanced semiconductor chips, a critical resource that has received attention amid tensions between Beijing and Washington, as both countries compete to dominate the advanced technology industry.


Apple’s iPhone 16 features AI capabilities, but these features have yet to be implemented in iPhones in China.


Apple, which considers China its second-most important market, has seen its market share decrease substantially. Apple CEO Tim Cook is traveling to China this week for the third time this year to attend an industry conference.

## Biden plans to highlight investment, partnership during Africa trip

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden will make his first presidential trip to Africa next week, visiting Angola and making a stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde, a top White House official told VOA.


Biden's visit will center around the Lobito Corridor, a 1,300-kilometer rail line that brings resources from the continent’s rich interior to Angola’s busiest port.


VOA’s Philip Alexiou spoke exclusively with Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.




VOA: How is the president feeling about this trip and what does he want to accomplish?


Frances Brown, White House director for African affairs: He is excited and really looking forward to the trip. The president often talks about how it's impossible to meet today's global challenges without African leadership and African partnership, and we really see Angola as exhibit A.


We are working with Angola on a few really important things. One is bolstering peace and security in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Another is growing economic opportunities in the region. A third is technological and scientific cooperation.


VOA: What are the deliverables? Are they going to be substantial?


Brown: You will see a lot of announcements and deliverables on the Lobito Corridor. Already the U.S. has mobilized billions of dollars toward the corridor. I think you can expect the president to engage with various components of that infrastructure effort.


I think you can expect to hear more as well on the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which recently signed a compact in Zambia. And I think you'll hear a lot of new deliverables on global health security, on agribusiness, on new forms of security sector cooperation.


VOA: With so many moving parts in these efforts, what level of transparency can the U.S. ensure? What kind of accountability can it offer the people in the region?


Brown: This is something that's really important to the president. The Lobito Corridor is about investment, it's about infrastructure, but it's also about ensuring that it benefits communities more broadly. It's part of the broader initiative, the Partnership on Global Investment and Infrastructure, that the president has laid out. And this is really signaling how under President Biden's administration, we've gone from an aid-driven model on engagement with Africa to an investment-driven model, and how we're thinking creatively about how to demonstrate that value proposition.




When we think about the Lobito Corridor, it's all about sustainable economic development; it's all about a transparent contracting process. It's about ensuring that it boosts regional trade, that it creates quality jobs and improves lives.


VOA: Is President Biden going to bring up human rights issues with Angolan President Joao Lorenzo?


Brown: President Biden never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts. And I think that's pretty consistent with the way he's been throughout his long career in public service.


VOA: Focusing now on Sudan, President Biden has called for peace. It’s one of the worst crises that we've seen in a long time. The U.N. is saying it's a neglected and ignored crisis, the worst humanitarian situation in recent history. Does the administration see it that way? And what can be done?


Brown: President Biden has been really outspoken on Sudan. You might have seen in his big speech at the U.N. General Assembly, he talked about the level of suffering in Sudan. He talked about how it was essential that the generals silence the guns and that we avert a wider famine. He's also been pretty forthright on calling for those who are obstructing humanitarian assistance to let that aid in. He's also talked about outside actors being an important part of this equation.


This month, every member of the Security Council at the U.N., except for Russia, voted in favor of a resolution that would have further called for humanitarian assistance, protections for civilians and an end to the violence. The president has instructed his team to work this hard. Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken, in the last couple of weeks, has continued to engage regional states and other actors to press for unhindered humanitarian access.


VOA: Moving on to the Sahel, a number of Francophone countries are forming new regional blocs, shifting away from the West and sort of aligning themselves with Russian mercenaries, the Wagner Group, and groups of this nature. How concerning is this to the administration?


Brown: Even though there have been those changes that you've mentioned in the Sahelian states — particularly Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali — other West African partners, including those along the coast, have been really clear to us that they want the durability and longevity of U.S. security engagement in the region. So, we continue to work very closely on that.


I'd also say more broadly that President Biden has made it really clear that he thinks it's important we continue to engage particularly with democratic partners. And on this trip that is forthcoming, the president will be stopping as well in West Africa, in Cabo Verde, which is a key democratic partner on the continent.


VOA: Is there anything that the U.S. can do to counter extremism on the continent, especially since U.S. influence has been sort of downgraded since they've had to leave Niger?


Brown: It’s worth remembering that we don't have a military footprint in the majority of countries on the continent. And that's been the case always. We make security arrangements with host countries, with partners based on specific shared interests. And through the administration, we've worked to foster mutually beneficial security partnerships by working by, with and through African partners. So that's how we see those collaborations.


VOA: Finally, the continent is very young — the median age around 19 years old. And its leaders are really old. How does the U.S. leadership deal with that?


Brown: You’re absolutely right. It is an extremely young continent, and it is the future. President Biden often talks about how by 2050, one in four humans on Earth will be from Africa. So that's very much guiding President Biden's engagement with the continent. I think the way the administration takes that forward is by thinking about how no challenge that we're trying to solve globally, we can solve without African partnership and African leadership.


That's why we've championed African voices at the U.N. Security Council, on the boards of the international financial institutions, at the G20 — we successfully got the African Union seat there. So, I think from the administration's perspective, just continuing to elevate and champion African voices so they can be part of shaping the future is how we think that's best approached.


VOA: What does the president want to leave behind when he departs the continent and he winds down as president?


Brown: I think the president wants to leave, first, the recognition of U.S. leadership and partnership, particularly on trade, investment and a new approach to the continent that's not defined by assistance, but instead by investment and partnership.


I think he wants to leave behind his recognition that African leadership for solving some of these challenges is essential, and that's why he'll be amplifying Angola's role mediating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere.


And I think he wants to convey the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angolan partnership, which is in many ways the story of the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-African relationship over many centuries.

## As US faces Iran threats, Trump’s security picks favor ‘maximum pressure’

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

Iran is likely high on the foreign policy agenda of the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The Islamic Republic has engaged in a major escalation of conflict with U.S. ally Israel while advancing its nuclear program to the point it could rapidly produce enough fissile material for a bomb. VOA’s Michael Lipin looks at what Trump and his prospective team members have said should be done about these threats.

## Who were the prisoners in US-China swap?

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — This week’s rare prisoner swap between the United States and China saw each side claim victory and accuse the other of wrongfully detaining its citizens, while Beijing has kept quiet about the identities of the returned Chinese.


China confirmed the repatriation of at least three Chinese nationals convicted of espionage and other crimes in the U.S. Among them was a person whom Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, speaking at a regular briefing Thursday, described as “a fugitive who fled to the U.S. many years ago.”


Some media reports indicated four people were returned to China. Mao did not name those who were returned and did not confirm a prisoner swap, or the release of any Americans detained in China.


But media reports, including one from the Financial Times, cited unnamed U.S. government officials as saying three Americans were exchanged for three Chinese.




Released Chinese


Xu Yanjun


Although U.S. officials have not confirmed their identities, NBC News cited unnamed U.S. officials as saying the prisoner swap included Xu Yanjun, a Chinese intelligence officer sentenced to 20 years in prison for attempting to steal aviation trade secrets from GE Aviation. Records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons show that Xu's status is now listed as "not in federal custody."


Ji Chaoqun


NBC reported that those returned to China also included Ji Chaoqun, a naturalized U.S. citizen convicted in 2022 of providing classified defense information to Chinese intelligence.


Jin Shanlin


The Financial Times on Thursday reported the third Chinese released was Jin Shanlin, a former doctoral student at Southern Methodist University in northern Texas, who was sentenced in 2021 for possessing and distributing child pornography, with his sentence set to end in 2027. Records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons also show Jin’s status as "not in federal custody."


Jin's case has sparked controversy because of his crime and his family's alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The FBI testified that his family had "important political connections," The Dallas Morning News reported in 2022, raising questions about why he was chosen for the exchange over other Chinese nationals in U.S. custody.


Released Americans


The White House National Security Council said Wednesday in a statement that it had secured the release of three Americans it said were “wrongfully detained” in China, although it did not confirm a prisoner swap. Their detentions had drawn international condemnation.


Mark Swidan


Swidan, a Texas businessman, was arrested in 2012 in Dongguan. Despite a lack of direct evidence — no drugs or incriminating records were ever found — he was sentenced to death for drug trafficking but granted a reprieve in 2019. His mother, Katherine Swidan, led a tireless campaign for his release. “I feared I would never see my son again,” she told VOA, recounting his years in a Guangdong prison marked by overcrowding, intense heat and deteriorating health.


Kai Li


Li, a Chinese American businessman, was arrested in 2016 in Shanghai on charges of stealing state secrets. His family has consistently denied the allegations, calling his 10-year sentence politically motivated. “We thank President [Joe] Biden for prioritizing my father’s case,” said his son, Harrison Li. “But we also urge the administration to stand firm against such detentions in the future.”


John Leung


Leung, 79, a Hong Kong-based American citizen, was arrested in 2021 on espionage charges. His case saw minimal public advocacy, and his family remained largely silent throughout his detention.


John Kamm, founder of the San Francisco-based rights group Dui Hua, meaning “dialogue” in Chinese, said his organization played a role in the prisoner swap in negotiations that took years to complete.


“We submitted 54 lists with Mark Swidan’s name to the Chinese government and received 10 responses,” Kamm told VOA Mandarin Serevice. “The process was arduous but ultimately effective.”


A spokesperson for the National Security Council hailed the release of the three Americans as a significant diplomatic achievement for Biden, emphasizing that all Americans classified as “wrongfully detained Americans” in China have now been brought home.


While the move brought relief to the families of the freed Americans, it has sparked concerns about its implications for U.S.-China relations and the growing trend of “hostage diplomacy.”


Kamm cautioned against declaring the issue resolved. “There are at least 200 American citizens under coercive measures in China. Many face exit bans or detentions with little transparency,” he said.


Critics such as Peter Humphrey, a former detainee in China and a nonresident associate at Harvard University’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, argue that no Americans held in China should be considered normal prisoners. He noted to VOA Mandarin that China’s legal processes are fundamentally flawed, as prisoners do not have fair and transparent trials.


"They have never had a trial where they were able to defend themselves properly and freely. They were under tremendous pressure in detention cells, and that pressure amounts to torture,” Humphrey said.


Humphrey called this week’s prisoner swap “capitulation to hostage diplomacy” and warned it could incentivize Beijing to detain more Americans.


Diplomatic balancing act


The prisoner exchange occurred amid strained U.S.-China relations, with both nations navigating a complex mix of strategic competition and occasional cooperation, and just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump is to return to the White House promising to impose hefty tariffs on Beijing.


The U.S. on Wednesday lowered its travel advisory for China from Level 3 (“Reconsider Travel”) to Level 2 (“Exercise Increased Caution”), raising questions about the advisory's role in the negotiations.


Kamm told VOA, “The lowering of the travel warning was part of the deal, as I understand it.”


Humphrey expressed concerns about the change in travel advisory. “China did not suddenly become safer for Americans, or any other foreigners actually, to travel to China,” he told VOA. “It has not become safer.”


Bo Gu contributed to this report.

## Canada's Trudeau meets with Trump after tariffs threat

date: 2024-11-30, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau flew to Florida on Friday to have dinner with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club after Trump threatened to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products.


Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don’t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the United States from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.


A person familiar with the details called it a "positive wide-ranging dinner that lasted three hours.” The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said topics included trade, border security, fentanyl, defense, Ukraine, NATO, China and pipelines, as well as the Group of Seven meeting in Canada next year.


Although Trump once called Trudeau “weak” and “dishonest” during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Trudeau is the first leader from the G7 countries to visit Trump since the November 5 election.


Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary; North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department; Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men's wives.


Also at the dinner were David McCormick, newly elected U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and his wife, Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump; Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security; and Katie Telford, Trudeau's chief of staff.


Trump’s transition team did not respond to questions about what they had discussed or whether the conversation alleviated Trump’s concerns about the border.


A smiling Trudeau declined comment upon returning to his West Palm Beach hotel late Friday.


Trudeau said earlier Friday that he would resolve the tariffs issue by talking to Trump. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday after speaking with Trump that she is confident a tariff war with the United States will be averted.


“We’re going to work together to meet some of the concerns,” Trudeau told reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada. “But ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.”


Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries, but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products including potatoes from Prince Edward Island.


“It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There’s no question about it,” Trudeau said.


“Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for Americans citizens, as well and hurting American industry and business,” he said.


Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully renegotiate the deal, which he calls a “win win” for both countries.


“We can work together as we did previously,” Trudeau said.


Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border.


The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone — and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024.


Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.


Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security.


Trudeau called Trump after he made his social media posts on the border.


When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.


Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the U.S. should Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a senior official told The Associated Press this week.


A government official said Canada is preparing for every eventuality and has started thinking about what items to target with tariffs in retaliation. The official stressed no decision has been made. The person spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.


Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian, or U.S. $2.7 billion, in goods and services cross the border each day.


About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada.


Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.


Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S.
