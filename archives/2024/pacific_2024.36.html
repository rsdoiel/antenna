<p>NATIONAL Novel Writing Month is November. It’s not too late or too
early to start thinking about the book you want to write. September is a
perfect month to ease into writing mode. The best way to do that is to
read. As best-selling author Stephen King said, “If you want to be a
writer you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a
lot.” We’ll write a lot in November, but now is the time to read a
lot.</p>
