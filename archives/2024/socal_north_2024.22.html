<p>UCLA researchers have found that the metabolism of certain lipids is
linked to chronic inflammation in the intestines. The study identified a

broader view’: How science communication is taught across the UC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>A common stereotype of scientists is that they are poor at writing. A
quick internet search brings up a Reddit post that proclaims, “90% of
scientific writers absolutely suck at writing.” However, while
stereotypes about scientists have long existed, science communication –
which focuses on the translation of scientific information to a variety
of scientific and nonscientific audiences – has gained more attention in
recent years, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>“Climate change is a hoax.” “The earth is flat.” “Vaccines have
microchips in them.” These beliefs persist despite having been widely
rejected by scientists. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some conservative
politicians promoted the use of the drug ivermectin, which is used to
kill parasites, as a cure for the virus – even though the United States
Food and Drug Administration did not authorize its use and the National
Institutes of Health explicitly advised against it.</p>
