## The 2024 Colossal Fundraiser has begun!

date: 2024-08-04, from: IF Competition Blog

<p>Hello, friends. We are just under a month out from this year’s IFComp games being released. SO EXCITING!! (Unless you’re an author who is furiously testing and revising and recompiling and testing and revising and recompiling and… yeah. Good luck, authors!)</p><p><b>While we eagerly await the new games to come, we’d like to ask for your help with the Colossal Fund.</b><br/><br/>If you already know about the fund and are able to contribute, please go to <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">ifcomp.org</a> and hit the blue “Donate with PayPal” button.</p><p>If you’d like more information first, keep on reading…</p><p>The Colossal Fund raises money for the cash prizes that are awarded to the top two-thirds of IFComp entries. We use 80% of the funds for that, and the remaining funds are used to provide support for the programs and projects of the <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation</a>, including the <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">Interactive Fiction Competition</a>, the <a href="https://ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>, the <a href="https://ifdb.org/">IFDB</a>, the forums at <a href="https://intfiction.org/">intfiction.org</a>, and other projects.</p><p>This year, as in prior years, we are shooting for $10K.</p><p><b>We’re now accepting donations for 2024!</b><br/>The donation button is live at <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">IFComp.org</a>. See your name listed on our donor page (or listed as “anonymous” if you prefer)! Our fundraising deadline is October 15th - the last day of competition voting. 80% of the proceeds ($8K+ if we hit our goal) will be distributed among the top two-thirds of IFComp finishers. </p><p><b>What does this mean for authors?</b><br/>Because we’re dividing the money among the top two-thirds of games, the exact numbers depend on how many entries there are. If we have 75 entries, then we will divide the money among the top 50. If we have $10K, that would mean that the winner of the competition will be offered a prize of $451, second place will be offered $433, third prize $416… and so on and so forth until 50th place, which will be offered $10.  Our goal is to distribute prizes across a broad range of IF styles and ideas. Any game which does even moderately well is offered a decent prize.</p><p><b>How do I donate?</b><br/>Please go to https://ifcomp.org and push the big blue Donate button.</p><p><b>Is my donation tax-deductible?</b><br/>Yes, to the extent allowed by law. (Consult a tax professional.)</p><p><b>Does the Colossal Fund replace the usual IFComp prize list?</b><br/>Nope! These cash prizes will be in addition to the usual IFComp prize list. We do need more of those non-cash prizes as well! Please visit our prize page to see what objects and services others have donated, get ideas from donations given in previous years, and see how you can contribute.</p><p><b>How will the cash prizes be distributed?</b><br/>Via PayPal or Venmo. (The IFComp entry form has a field for your Paypal address.) If you can’t accept PayPal or Venmo, we can mail a US check to a US address. If that doesn’t work for you, or if you wish to decline the cash prize, we will roll the money into next year’s prize fund, which means it will continue to support authors and IFTF programs.</p>

<p><strong>A Voice Calling</strong>, Christopher Barzak (Psycho­pomp 979-8-89116-001-9, $13.99, 108pp, tp) March 2024.</p>
<p>There has been no shortage of good haunted-house tales in the past year or so, with contri­butions from Elizabeth Hand, Alix E. Harrow, T. Kingfisher, and others. Christopher Barzak’s <strong>A Voice Calling </strong>(his first novella, he tells us in an afterword) might seem to be hopping on the bandwagon, but in fact it’s an expansion of a  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/08/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-a-voice-calling-by-christopher-barzak/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
