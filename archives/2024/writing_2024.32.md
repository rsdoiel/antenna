And check out past episodes of <a href="https://podcast.scrivenerapp.com" target="_blank">Write Now with Scrivener</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Natasha Bell has written two novels, and is a creative writing teacher with a PhD in Autofiction. It took her eight years to finish her first novel, after having started writing it then putting it aside. When she started a Master&rsquo;s course in Creative and Life Writing, &ldquo;it was still kind of bugging me. So I ended up working on that a little bit. I submitted the first book for the anthology that we sent out to agents and editors. I got quite a bit of response from agents, and that kicked me back into gear. I signed with an agent and got an editor for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This shows how starting a piece of fiction, then setting it aside for a while, can help grow that story. &ldquo;If you put a novel aside and you&rsquo;re never thinking about it again, then it probably needs to stay there. But if those characters are really bugging you, tapping you on your shoulder, then you need to return to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Natasha works teaching creative writing, and I pointed out that there is a trope that creative writing cannot be taught, though that has changed in recent decades. Natasha said, &ldquo;my attitude as a tutor is that we&rsquo;re all in this together; writing is a set of problems to be solved. You&rsquo;re always faced with problems, however experienced you are, you&rsquo;re still having to figure out these things and do a lot of creative problem-solving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there is no recipe to teaching creative writing. So many elements in writing are interrelated, and it&rsquo;s hard to grasp them all. Natasha said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s good advice when it comes to teaching writing, but you sometimes need to hear those at specific moments. Someone can tell you until they&rsquo;re blue in the face that you should try and show not tell, which obviously, we can critique that as a piece of advice anyway. But until you&rsquo;re faced with a particular kind of challenge within your own narrative, applying that to fixes, you&rsquo;re not going to really learn that on a deep level. We can read dozens of books telling us exactly how to structure our novels or how to kind of polish our sentences, but you can&rsquo;t take it all in at once. You can only take one thing at a time when it reaches you at the right moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Natasha has long used Scrivener, and said, &ldquo;What I find Scrivener amazing for is the earliest stages, starting to write, vomiting out all of your ideas, collating the research, moving things around, changing point of view. Because you can have everything in one place, it&rsquo;s such a good place to experiment with and to move structure around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Natasha also said, &ldquo;The Corkboard is amazing, because that&rsquo;s what I do on my floor anyway with note cards, so it&rsquo;s nice to be able to visualize it like that. Being able to label chapters, use the icons, move them into folders, move them around. The different functionality of comments, being able to change the colors or label them as different types. But then also being able to turn all of that off and then just look in Composition Mode. So being able to react to where you are in the writing process and what you need on a particular day is really useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Natasha does a lot of revision, and Scrivener helps with that. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something for me about the labor of moving things, compiling things, rewriting even for both my published novels at quite a late stage. I have rewritten them word for word, because it&rsquo;s part of the editing process. I quite like the analog versions of moving things back and forth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked if she meant that she retyped the entire manuscript, and she said, &ldquo;Yeah, it really forces you to think, &lsquo;okay, does this word need to be here?&rsquo; You&rsquo;re asking a reader to read every single word you&rsquo;ve written. Once you get to kind of that almost final draft, you&rsquo;re so numb to everything, you&rsquo;re not even reading your whole sentences because you know them so well. So I think forcing yourself to engage with your work again on the sentence level and think about, &lsquo;what am I asking the reader to spend their time engaging with? And is it? Is it worth it? Is this sentence really earning its weight?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, I asked how Natasha separated her writing time from her teaching time. &ldquo;With difficulty. But the pleasure of teaching is that I get to spend my days talking to people about writing, and craft, and narrative. So all of that feeds into my own writing.&rdquo;</p>

## The 2024 Colossal Fundraiser has begun!

date: 2024-08-04, from: IF Competition Blog

<p>Hello, friends. We are just under a month out from this year‚Äôs IFComp games being released.¬†SO EXCITING!!¬†(Unless you‚Äôre an author who is furiously testing and revising and recompiling and testing and revising and recompiling and‚Ä¶ yeah. Good luck, authors!)</p><p><b>While we eagerly await the new games to come, we‚Äôd like to ask for your help with the Colossal Fund.</b><br/><br/>If you already know about the fund and are able to contribute, please go to¬†<a href="https://ifcomp.org/">ifcomp.org</a> and hit the blue ‚ÄúDonate with PayPal‚Äù button.</p><p>If you‚Äôd like more information first, keep on reading‚Ä¶</p><p>The Colossal Fund raises money for the cash prizes that are awarded to the top two-thirds of IFComp entries. We use 80% of the funds for that, and the remaining funds are used to provide support for the programs and projects of the¬†<a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation</a>, including the¬†<a href="https://ifcomp.org/">Interactive Fiction Competition</a>, the¬†<a href="https://ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>, the¬†<a href="https://ifdb.org/">IFDB</a>, the forums at¬†<a href="https://intfiction.org/">intfiction.org</a>, and other projects.</p><p>This year, as in prior years, we are shooting for $10K.</p><p><b>We‚Äôre now accepting donations for 2024!</b><br/>The donation button is live at¬†<a href="https://ifcomp.org/">IFComp.org</a>. See your name listed on¬†our donor page (or listed as ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù if you prefer)! Our fundraising deadline is October 15th - the last day of competition voting. 80% of the proceeds ($8K+ if we hit our goal) will be distributed among the top two-thirds of IFComp finishers.¬†</p><p><b>What does this mean for authors?</b><br/>Because we‚Äôre dividing the money among the top two-thirds of games, the exact numbers depend on how many entries there are. If we have 75 entries, then we will divide the money among the top 50. If we have $10K, that would mean that the winner of the competition will be offered a prize of $451, second place will be offered $433, third prize $416‚Ä¶ and so on and so forth until 50th place, which will be offered $10.¬† Our goal is to distribute prizes across a broad range of IF styles and ideas. Any game which does even moderately well is offered a decent prize.</p><p><b>How do I donate?</b><br/>Please go to¬†https://ifcomp.org and push the big blue Donate button.</p><p><b>Is my donation tax-deductible?</b><br/>Yes, to the extent allowed by law. (Consult a tax professional.)</p><p><b>Does the Colossal Fund replace the usual IFComp prize list?</b><br/>Nope! These cash prizes will be in addition to the usual IFComp prize list. We do need more of those non-cash prizes as well! Please visit our¬†prize page to see what objects and services others have donated, get ideas from donations given in previous years, and see how you can contribute.</p><p><b>How will the cash prizes be distributed?</b><br/>Via PayPal or Venmo. (The IFComp entry form has a field for your Paypal address.) If you can‚Äôt accept PayPal or Venmo, we can mail a US check to a US address. If that doesn‚Äôt work for you, or if you wish to decline the cash prize, we will roll the money into next year‚Äôs prize fund, which means it will continue to support authors and IFTF programs.</p>
