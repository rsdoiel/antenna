## FEATURE ǀ Building lifelong connections: The strength of compassion and community in the digital and physical classroom

date: 2024-10-01, updated: 2024-10-02, from: Marianas Variety

AS a teacher, I often caught up in lesson planning and evaluating student work, and I didn’t take the time to appreciate the special moments I shared with them. However, in 2019, I decided to make a change and saw an opportunity to create something extraordinary with my students — a virtual diary of our experiences and memories that we could all cherish for years. So, I started a Google Site where I could document every moment, big and small, and make it a part of our shared history.

Forty-eight states are winner-take-all, meaning that the candidate who gets the most popular votes gets all of that state&#8217;s electoral votes. A single-vote victory in California or Texas or Florida or New York yields all those states&#8217; 54 or 40 or 30 or 28 electoral votes, putting a candidate well on their way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. </p>
