## The unfair Electoral College: The Nebraska and Maine plan would be better provided every state divided their votes

				<p>Nebraska has long counted its electoral votes in presidential elections differently than almost every other state in the union. Forty-eight states are winner-take-all, meaning that the candidate who gets the most popular votes gets all of that state&#8217;s electoral votes. A single-vote victory in California or Texas or Florida or New York yields all those states&#8217; 54 or 40 or 30 or 28 electoral votes, putting a candidate well on their way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. </p>
