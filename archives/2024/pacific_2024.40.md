## The unfair Electoral College: The Nebraska and Maine plan would be better provided every state divided their votes

A single-vote victory in California or Texas or Florida or New York yields all those states&#8217; 54 or 40 or 30 or 28 electoral votes, putting a candidate well on their way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. </p>
