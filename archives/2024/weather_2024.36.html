Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0734 AM CDT Tue Sep 03 2024

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES/GREAT BASIN AND ADJACENT HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms developing across the northern Rockies and adjacent
portions of the Great Basin this afternoon may produce occasional
strong to severe wind gusts, before spreading eastward toward the
northern High Plains this evening.

...Northern Great Basin/Rockies into the Adjacent High Plains...
An upper trough/low over the Pacific Northwest this morning will
continue moving eastward today across the northern Rockies. This
feature is forecast to gradually weaken through the period, but
enhanced mid-level west-southwesterly flow will persist across parts
of the northern Great Basin into the northern Rockies and adjacent
High Plains. As large-scale ascent associated with the upper trough
overspreads the northern Rockies, thunderstorms should develop over
the higher terrain through early afternoon in tandem with daytime
heating.

Latest surface observations show somewhat greater low-level moisture
across this region, with surface dewpoints generally in the mid 40s
to low 50s across central ID into southwest MT. Although instability
is forecast to remain fairly modest this afternoon, deep-layer shear
around 25-35 kt should be sufficient to support organized
convection, including the potential for a couple of marginal
supercells initially with associated hail/wind threat. With
steepened low/mid-level lapse rates present, this activity should
continue to pose some threat for isolated strong to severe wind
gusts as it congeals and spreads east-northeastward across parts of
the northern High Plains through this evening.

Somewhat more limited low-level moisture should be present this
afternoon farther south into WY and northern UT. Even so, diurnal
heating will aid in a deeply mixed boundary layer by this afternoon,
and steep mid-level lapse rates are also expected to remain over
this region. The net result will be high-based thunderstorms capable
of producing isolated strong to severe winds initially developing
across northern UT into far eastern ID, and subsequently moving
east-northeastward over WY through the evening. Confidence in a more
concentrated corridor of severe winds remains generally low at this
time given the weak instability and modest deep-layer shear
forecast, especially with southward extent into the northern Great
Basin and WY.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0127 AM CDT Tue Sep 03 2024

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to be limited for Wednesday
across the country. The upper-level low currently over parts of the
Pacific Northwest is forecast to de-amplify and drift east into the
Plains. As this occurs, weak ascent will support widespread cloud
cover as well as isolated to scattered showers and thunderstorms
across the central Rockies to central Plains. The surface pressure
trough currently in place along the High Plains will shift
east/southeast through the day, and while breezy conditions are
likely just ahead of the boundary, increasing moisture return into
the Plains will modulate diurnal RH reductions. Across the West,
building surface high pressure should limit wind speeds.
Consequently, the potential for elevated fire weather concerns
appears limited with no highlights required.

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER MUCH OF THE
NORTHERN ROCKIES AND INTO THE EASTERN GREAT BASIN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong storms with isolated severe may produce damaging
wind gusts and marginal hail from the northern Intermountain region
eastward into the northern High Plains, and southward into Utah.

...Synopsis...
On Tuesday, an upper trough will weaken as it moves from the
Northwest into the northern Rockies, providing cooling aloft and
increased mid and high level flow. To the east, a large upper trough
will exit the northeastern states, with height rises over the
north-central CONUS.

At the surface, a weak cold front will move across the eastern Great
Basin, ID, western WY and southwest MT by early afternoon,
increasing lift/convergence. 

Elsewhere, a moist air mass will remain from TX eastward across the
Gulf Coast, with scattered non-severe storms likely.

...Eastern Great Basin into the Northern Rockies...
As heating accelerates and cooler temperatures overspread the
region, steep lapse rates will yield a large area of thunderstorms,
developing relatively early in the afternoon, from much of UT into
southwest MT. The strongest instability with 500 to 1000 J/kg MUCAPE
will be roughly from far northern UT into MT, where temperatures
aloft will be coolest. Deep-layer effective shear will increase to
around 40 kt, especially across ID, MT, and northwest WY, which will
aid cellular storm mode and hail potential to around 1.00" in
diameter. Otherwise, scattered storms across the entire area will
produce outflows, with progressive clusters of storms producing
strong to locally severe gusts. A few storms may make it as far east
as western SD by late evening, with generally decreasing intensity
after sunset.

An active day of fire weather is anticipated across the Pacific
Northwest, Great Basin, and portions of the High Plains. Morning 12z
observed soundings from SLC (Salt Lake City, UT) and LKN (Elko, NV)
indicate precipitable water values around 0.60". Midlevel moisture
should increase through the day ahead of forcing for ascent with a
midlevel wave currently just offshore in the Pacific Northwest. A
mix of isolated to scattered wet/dry thunderstorms is expected by
the afternoon with potential for new ignitions from lightning. In
addition, Critical conditions are likely in the lee of the Sierra
across Nevada and in the High Plains. No changes have been made to
this forecast. See previous discussion for more information below.

..Thornton.. 09/02/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Mon Sep 02 2024/

...Synopsis...
An active fire weather day is anticipated across the High Plains and
Pacific Northwest/northern Great Basin. Fire weather concerns across
the West will be associated with a progressive upper wave currently
moving onshore along the northern CA coast, which is forecast to
migrate into the interior Pacific Northwest over the next 24 hours.
As this occurs, strengthening low-level winds will support dry/windy
conditions, and lift ahead of the wave will promote isolated to
scattered thunderstorms. To the east, flow across the northern to
central Rockies is forecast to strengthen slightly within the apex
of an upper ridge. This will result in modest surface pressure falls
along the High Plains, which when juxtaposed with a building surface
high over the Midwest will yield strong southerly winds and dry
conditions. Fuels across both regions remain very dry (ERCs at or
above the 90th percentile) after multiple days of dry conditions,
which will support the fire weather concerns.

...Pacific Northwest/Great Basin...
Regional VWPs along the West Coast are beginning to observe the
influence of the approaching wave with winds in the lowest few
kilometers slowly strengthening since 00 UTC. Further
intensification of the low-level wind field is anticipated, which
will strengthen downslope flow off the central to northern Sierra
Nevada. Dry conditions are already in place and will be maintained
within the augmented downslope regime. Latest ensemble guidance
continues to show a strong signal for afternoon RH values to fall
into the teens with 15-25 mph winds. The strongest winds (and
highest probability for sustained critical conditions) are expected
from northeast CA into southern OR and far northwest NV as the
mid-level jet max passes overhead around peak heating. 

Over the past several days, a plume of monsoonal moisture has been
tracked from southern AZ into northern NV and central to eastern OR.
The 00 UTC MFR sounding sampled this air mass well, which is
characterized by sufficient mid-level moisture to support weak
convection, but a very dry boundary layer favorable for dry
thunderstorms. Over the past two days, thunderstorms within this air
mass across the Great Basin have been predominantly dry, and are
expected to mainly be dry once again today for much of the region
(one exception is from the Blue Mountains in northeast OR to the
Salmon River Mountains in central ID where orographic ascent should
support more prolonged convection with a higher probability for
wetting rainfall). Stronger synoptic-scale forcing for ascent should
result in greater thunderstorm coverage compared to previous days,
warranting a scattered dry thunderstorm risk area from eastern OR
into ID, northeast NV, and far northwest UT where latest CAM
guidance shows the best convective signal.

...High Plains...
A recent frontal intrusion into the Plains/Midwest has shunted
seasonally rich moisture southward into the southern Plains. A
strong surface high in the wake of the front will shift east through
the day concurrent with the deepening of a weak lee trough. A dry
return flow regime will become established through the day as winds
become more southerly. Latest deterministic and ensemble solutions
show a fairly strong signal for 20-25 mph winds (gusting to 35 mph)
across western NE into western SD with RH values falling into the
low 20s to teens. Consequently, confidence in sustained critical
conditions over an appreciable area has increased enough to warrant
introducing a Critical risk area.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE INTERIOR PACIFIC NORTHWEST INTO THE NORTHERN GREAT
BASIN/ROCKIES...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms across the northern Great Basin
and parts of the interior Pacific Northwest may be capable of
occasional strong to severe wind gusts this afternoon and evening.

...Interior Pacific Northwest into the Northern Great
Basin/Rockies...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a closed low near the
northern CA/southern OR coast.  This upper feature will move east
through OR and be situated along the OR/ID border by daybreak
Tuesday.  A belt of stronger flow (30-50 kt 500-mb winds) will move
through the base of the larger-scale mid-level trough and overspread
northern NV into southwestern ID and eastern OR this afternoon into
the early evening.  Large-scale ascent associated with the upper
disturbance and the development of weak buoyancy (mainly via
heating), will facilitate the development of isolated to scattered
high-based thunderstorms beginning later this afternoon and
persisting into the evening.  Forecast soundings show large surface
temperature-dewpoint spreads (50 degrees F) with 9+ degrees C lapse
rates into the mid levels and a dry sub-cloud layer.  Evaporative
cooling of the more intense downdrafts will probably yield a risk
for isolated 60-70 mph gusts before weakening later this evening.

latitude 25.3 North, longitude 178.3 West. Hone is moving toward 
the west-northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h). This general motion with 
a decrease in forward speed is expected today as Hone merges with 
the extratropical low. A turn toward the north and an increase in 
forward speed is expected to resume on Monday. On the forecast 
track, Hone, or the extratropical low associated with Hone, will be 
passing near or just west of Kure Atoll near the International Date 
Line late Monday or Monday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Little change in strength is forecast during the next 48
hours.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible within the watch area
Monday and Monday night.
 
RAINFALL: Storm total rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is possible over
Midway and Kure Atolls.

Mesoscale Discussion 2041
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 PM CDT Sun Sep 01 2024

Areas affected...parts of western and northern New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011754Z - 011930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A broken line of storms may produce occasional gusty wind
this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Inhibition has been mostly eroded across western and
northern New York as temperatures have warmed to the upper 70s to
low 80s with mid 60s dewpoints. Expect scattered thunderstorms to
develop along a cold front once it moves east of Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario. Storms may be not be that deep given the relatively shallow
thermodynamic profile shown by the RAP forecast soundings. However,
relatively strong flow through the column and a well-mixed boundary
layer may support efficient transport of gusty winds to the surface
within these storms. Isolated damaging wind gusts are possible
through the afternoon with this threat waning near sunset.

Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  41
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Sep 01 2024
 
The satellite presentation of Hone has become very ragged overnight, 
with the low-level circulation center becoming very difficult to 
locate with much confidence. An 1130z Oceansat-3 pass indicated 
that the low level center of Hone has shifted west-westward since 
the previous and appears to be merging with the mid-level low just 
east of the International Date Line. The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates from PHFO, SAB, and JTWC, all came in 
at 2.5 (35 kt), while the objective intensity estimates were 
similar. As a result, the initial intensity has been held at a 
perhaps generous 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion is quite uncertain due to the low-level of Hone 
being in the process of merging with the mid-level low to the 
west, and is set at 300/12 kt. This general motion is expected 
to  continue today and tonight along with a decrease in forward 
speed as Hone merges with a mid-level low to the west.  Hone should 
begin moving northward with an increase in forward speed Monday and 
Monday night as it moves into a weakness in building mid-level 
ridges to the northwest and east of the system. A shift back toward 
the northwest is then expected late Tuesday through Thursday as a 
low and mid-level ridge builds to the north of Hone. The latest 
track forecast was adjusted to better align with the latest model 
guidance and generally follows the TVCE consensus.
 
Hone will be in a relatively favorable environment during the next
couple days, with warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical
wind shear. The interaction with a mid-level low, ragged LLCC and
entrainment of dry mid-level air should act to minimize the
potential for intensification however. Beyond 48 hours mid-level
moisture drops off considerably and the latest simulated satellite
imagery from the GFS and ECMWF suggest a loss of deep convection by
72 hours. As a result, the intensity forecast holds Hone as a 35 
kt Tropical Storm during the next couple days, with the cyclone 
expected to become a post-tropical remnant low by 72 hours, and 
dissipation occurring by 120 hours. The intensity forecast closely 
follows the latest intensity consensus guidance.
