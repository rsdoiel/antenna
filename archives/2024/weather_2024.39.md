Mesoscale Discussion 2111
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0807 AM CDT Thu Sep 26 2024

Areas affected...Southern and Central Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Tornado Watch 683...

Valid 261307Z - 261500Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 683 continues.

SUMMARY...A tornado threat will continue across the Florida
Peninsula this morning, persisting into the early afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Hurricane Helene is currently located in the eastern
Gulf of Mexico. Several rainbands, with embedded thunderstorms, are
located across the eastern Gulf of Mexico extending across the
Florida Peninsula. The latest RAP has a pocket of moderate
instability across the southern and central Florida Peninsula, with
MLCAPE estimated in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range. This is consistent
with the Miami, Florida 12Z sounding, which also has 0-6 km shear in
the 30 to 35 knot range, and 0-3 km storm-relative helicity around
300 m2/s2. This environment will continue to be favorable for
tornadoes with semi-discrete supercells embedded in the outer
rainbands of Hurricane Helene. The tornado threat should continue
this morning and into the early afternoon as Hurricane Helene moves
northward across the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0755 AM CDT Thu Sep 26 2024

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR COASTAL
AREAS OF NORTHEAST FLORIDA...GEORGIA...AND SOUTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Several tornadoes are expected today into tonight across the coastal
Southeast in association with Hurricane Helene. The greatest threat
is expected across parts of Florida into southeast Georgia, the
Midlands and Low Country of South Carolina, and southern North
Carolina.

...Florida/Georgia and the Carolinas...
Hurricane Helene, centered 300-350 miles southwest of Tampa early
this morning, will continue to move north-northeast and accelerate
over the eastern/northeastern Gulf of Mexico today into tonight,
with landfall expected in the Florida Big Bend region this evening.
Consult National Hurricane Center forecasts and advisories for more
track, intensity, and impact details.

Related to Helene's large size and increasingly fast forward speed,
an associated increase of low-level flow/shear will occur across the
Florida Peninsula today, southeast Georgia and parts of South
Carolina by afternoon, and eventually into parts of North Carolina
tonight. Low-level shear (and moisture/buoyancy) is already
supportive of a tornado risk in some areas regionally, reference 12z
observed soundings from Miami and especially Tampa Bay. However,
this tornado-supportive scenario will diurnally increase and expand
north-northeastward regionally through the afternoon and evening.
Low-level hodographs will become quite large, with 0-1 km SRH
increasing into at least the 250-500 m2/s2 range. This will support
tornado potential with any low-topped supercells that are able to
develop and persist within Helene's rain bands. Some tornado
potential will reach into parts of North Carolina later tonight.

## Hurricane John Forecast Discussion Number 14

<pre>

000
WTPZ45 KNHC 260919
TCDEP5
 
Tropical Storm John Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 AM CST Thu Sep 26 2024
 
Recent TROPICS/TMS and SSMIS microwave passes indicated
an improved inner core with a 70 percent closed small eye feature.
The UW-CIMSS objective intensity guidance ranges from 56 to 65 kt, 
and the latest SATCON analysis indicated an intensity of 61 kt. The 
subjective satellite estimates from TAFB and SAB are 65 and 55 kt, 
respectively. The initial intensity is set at 60 kt using a blend 
of these data.
 
The ocean sea surface temperatures are very warm, and the shear is
low, and there is ample moisture in the low to mid-portions of the
atmosphere for John to quickly strengthen before the cyclone moves
over the coast on Friday.  The UW-CIMSS AI RI index and the SHIPS
statistical-dynamical RI model both continue to show increasing
chances of John quickly strengthening during the next 24 hrs and
the NHC intensity forecast follows suit and shows a peak of 85 kt 
before landfall.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward, or   
285/3 kt and is being steered by a mid-tropospheric ridge centered 
over Northern Mexico.  John should continue in this general motion 
through today, followed by a gradual turn to the northwest by this 
evening.  On the forecast track, the center of John is forecast to 
approach and move along the coast of southwestern Mexico or just 
inland on Friday.  The official track forecast is adjusted a little 
to the left of the previous one and follows a compromise of the 
skilled HCCA consensus model and the ECMWF global model, which has 
been performing the best with this system.
 
The wind radii have been adjusted for this advisory, and was based
on a 0426 UTC METOP-C scatterometer overpass.
 
It cannot be emphasized enough that catastrophic life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides are expected to continue through the
end of the week for portions of the Mexican States of Guerrero,
Oaxaca and Michoacan.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm John will bring additional very heavy rainfall to
coastal portions of southwest Mexico through Friday.  The additional
rainfall totals will be falling across areas that have received very
heavy rainfall amounts over the past few days.  This heavy rainfall
will likely cause significant and catastrophic life-threatening
flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Guerrero,
Oaxaca and Michoacan.
 
2. John is forecast to strengthen to a hurricane before landfall,
and a Hurricane Warning is in effect along the coastline of 
southwestern Mexico, where tropical storm conditions could begin 
during the next few hours.  Tropical Storm Warnings are also 
in effect for portions of the area and has been extended westward 
to Manzanillo.

--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The government of Mexico has adjusted the Tropical Storm
Warning westward from Punta Maldonado to Zihuatanejo.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Punta Maldonado to Zihuatanejo
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case over the
next few hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm John was
located near latitude 17.7 North, longitude 100.3 West. John is
moving toward the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A slow 
westward motion is expected during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Continued rapid weakening is anticipated, and John is
expected to become a tropical depression later today.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for John can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header WTPZ45 KNHC
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDEP5.shtml
 
RAINFALL: Through Thursday, Tropical Storm John is expected to
produce 6 to 12 inches of rain with isolated totals around 15 inches
across the coastal areas of Chiapas. In areas along and near the
Oaxaca coast to southeast Guerrero, between 10 and 20 inches of rain
with isolated totals near 30 inches can be expected through
Thursday.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm John, please see the National Weather Service Storm 
Total Rainfall Graphic, available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are ongoing within portions of the
tropical storm warning area and should continue for the next few
hours. Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of hills and
mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the near-surface
winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated locations
could be even greater.
 
SURF:  Swells associated with John are forecast to continue
affecting the coast of southern Mexico during the next day or so, 
with the potential for dangerous surf and rip currents.  Please see 
local statements for more information.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

## Tropical Storm John Forecast Discussion Number 8

date: 2024-09-24, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>

WTPZ45 KNHC 240852
TCDEP5
 
Tropical Storm John Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 AM CST Tue Sep 24 2024
 
John moved inland at around 0315 UTC as a 105 kt Category 3 
Hurricane. Since that time, the the storm has apparently turned more 
leftward and remains just inland, skirting the southern coast of 
Mexico. While surface observations have been sparse, my best guess 
is that the storm recently passed just to the north of Acapulco, 
where the airport earlier reported tropical-storm-force wind gusts 
and west winds as the pressure dropped to 998 mb. Assuming the 
small core has continued to quickly weaken, John is being 
downgraded to a tropical storm, and the initial intensity is 60 kt 
this advisory.
 
Following fixes from earlier microwave and more recent geostationary 
satellite imagery, John now appears to be moving northwestward at 
310/7 kt. The track forecast, which has been problematic with John 
from the start, is just as difficult now. John has continued to 
deviate westward of the previous forecast track and is now moving 
roughly parallel to the coast of Mexico. To make matters worse, a 
decent chunk of the of the global models guidance (ECMWF, UKMET) and 
hurricane regional models (HWRF, HMON) suggest the circulation could 
continue turning westward and attempt to re-emerge over the Eastern 
Pacific. Even the GFS and CMC solutions, which appear to dissipate 
the surface circulation inland over Mexico, show the mid-level 
circulation persisting and drifting back offshore, leading to the 
development of a new low-level circulation. Because it is becoming 
distinctly possible that John does not move far enough inland to 
dissipate entirely, and the aforementioned continued leftward 
trends, the latest NHC track forecast is altered quite a bit form 
the prior forecast, and now shows the possibility that John, albeit 
as a tropical depression, moving back offshore as it becomes tangled 
in the larger monsoonal flow. By 72 h, most of the track guidance 
shows the system moving back inland. The updated track forecast is 
roughly in between the HCCA and ECMWF trackers, and is of very low 
confidence given John's track history. It also remains possible the 
system could dissipate later today if it moves further inland.
 
Intensity-wise, John should continue to rapidly weaken as long as
it remains onshore, and the NHC intensity forecast shows the
tropical cyclone weakening to a tropical depression later today.
However, the new NHC forecast now maintains the system as a
depression and does not show dissipation beyond 24 h given the
latest track forecast taking the system along the coast of Mexico
and not far enough inland to completely dissipate. Some of the
models (notably the ECMWF) attempt to also re-intensify John as it
gets far enough back offshore, but given the large changes made on
this forecast cycle, the NHC intensity will not show that solution
quite yet.
 
Even if John remains inland, larger-scale moist monsoonal 
southeasterly flow will persist along the southern coast of Mexico, 
likely contributing to catastrophic rainfall both along the coast 
and inland over the up-slope portion of the mountainous terrain. 
This is a very dangerous life-threatening flooding scenario.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm John could still producing tropical storm 
conditions for the next few hours in the tropical storm warning 
area.
 
2. Slow-moving John will bring very heavy rainfall to coastal
portions of southwest Mexico through the upcoming week. This heavy
rainfall will likely cause significant and possibly catastrophic,
life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States
of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southeast Guerrero, particularly in areas
near the coast and along the up-slope portion of areas of higher
terrain.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0434 PM CDT Mon Sep 23 2024

Valid 251200Z - 011200Z

A cutoff low will bring cool/moist conditions to much of the
south-central and eastern CONUS with limited fire weather concerns.
In addition, a tropical system will bring significant rainfall to
much of the southeast CONUS and parts of the East Coast.

West of this cutoff low, ridging will build across the western
CONUS. As this occurs, some warm and dry conditions are expected
from the Southwest to the Great Basin. On Wednesday, some dry and
breezy conditions are possible in the lee of the northern Sierra and
southern Cascades as a mid-level trough traverses the region and
mid-level flow strengthens. Fuels in this region and are not
critically dry. In addition, relative humidity will only drop to
around 18 to 25 percent in the afternoon. Therefore, while some
Elevated fire weather conditions are possible, Critical conditions
seem unlikely due to the combination of unreceptive fuels and only
Elevated winds/relative humidity.

Beyond Wednesday, minimal overlap between low relative humidity and
windy conditions, especially where fuels are critically dry,
precludes any significant fire weather concerns.

## Hurricane John Forecast Discussion Number 6

Hurricane John Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 PM CST Mon Sep 23 2024
 
John continues to rapidly strengthen.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates range from 65 to 77 kt, while the latest 
objective intensity estimates are a little higher, in the 79 to 90 
kt range.  On infrared satellite imagery, the area of cold cloud 
tops continues to grow, and the inner core is becoming more 
symmetric.  The latest visible images have shown hints of a small 
eye, that has become a little more apparent in the last few hours.  
Based on the above data and recent satellite trends, the initial 
intensity is increased to 85 kt, making John a category 2 hurricane.

Environmental parameters continue to be ripe for additional rapid 
intensification, with very warm ocean temperatures, weak vertical 
wind shear and a moist atmosphere.  The only potential limiting 
factor could be how John might interact with the mountainous 
topography of Mexico as the hurricane approaches the coastline.  The 
DSHIPS and LGEM statistical intensity models remain at the higher 
end of the guidance envelope and show John becoming a major 
hurricane as it approaches the coast.  The EC SHIPS Rapid Intensity 
Index is depicting a high likelihood of continued rapid 
intensification over next 12 hours.  The latest NHC forecast is near 
the high end of the intensity guidance and continues to show John 
strengthening to a 105-kt hurricane.  It is possible that John could 
peak even higher than shown below between the 12 h forecast point 
and when it reaches the coast.

John continues to move due northward, now at 5 kt.  The current 
motion and the latest model guidance has again necessitated a 
westward track shift to the NHC forecast. Given the updated track 
forecast, the government of Mexico has extended the hurricane 
warning westward.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. John is expected to continue rapidly intensifying, and is 
forecast to become a major hurricane before the center reaches the 
coast of southern Mexico within the Hurricane Warning area tonight 
or early Tuesday. Damaging hurricane-force winds and a 
life-threatening storm surge are expected within portions of the 
hurricane warning area.

2. John will bring very heavy rainfall to coastal portions of
southern Mexico through this week.  This heavy rainfall will likely
cause significant and possibly catastrophic, life-threatening flash
flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and
southeast Guerrero, particularly in areas near the coast.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Mon Sep 23 2024

Valid 232000Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS NORTHERN
ARKANSAS INTO THE LOWER OHIO AND TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEYS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon
into evening from the Ozarks into parts of the Tennessee and lower
Ohio Valleys.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed based on recent observations and trends in guidance. Latest
surface observations and upper-air analyses show the gradual
organization of a surface low over northern AR/southern MO. The
frontal boundary draped from southeast MO into the upper OH River
Valley has begun to stall and is expected to gradually advance north
through the evening hours. VWP observations along the frontal zone
currently show relatively straight low-level hodographs, but
helicity should slowly improve through the 20-03 UTC period as
isentropic ascent along the front increases. As a result, the
convective environment should become more favorable for organized
convection - particularly during the 22-03 UTC period across far
southeast MO into far southern IL and western KY. 

Latest high-res guidance suggests that storms developing along an
approaching cold front across north-central AR will intensify as
they migrate east towards this zone and should pose the primary
severe threat this evening. However, loosely-organized thunderstorms
recently developing within the mid-MS River Valley cast some
uncertainty onto this scenario due to the potential for overturning
portions of the downstream warm sector. This early convection may
see improving organization in the coming hours as mid-level flow
slowly improves late this afternoon, but limit storm longevity over
the past hour cast some uncertainty onto the propensity for severe
storms. Regardless, this stalled/warm frontal boundary will still
present the best corridor for a more focused severe event through
the evening hours, including the potential for a tornado or two. As
such, the 2% risk probabilities have been expanded east into western
KY. Consideration was given for 15% wind probabilities through this
corridor, but confidence in storm mode and coverage remains too
limited given the aforementioned concerns. 

Farther east across southern KY and TN, the forecast remains on
track. See MCD #2097 for details regarding recent convective trends.

..Moore.. 09/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1143 AM CDT Mon Sep 23 2024/

...Ozarks to TN/OH Valleys and southern Appalachians...
A positive-tilt upper trough will influence the region, with a
general increase in relatively strong deep-layer southwesterly
winds. Severe storms are possible this afternoon, particularly and
initially across the Ozarks including far south-central to southeast
Missouri, as well as far northern Arkansas and far southern
Illinois. This will be in vicinity of a weak surface wave and a
northward-shifting warm front as lingering morning convection
along/north of the Ohio River abates and shifts eastward.
Increasingly strong deep-layer winds could support some supercells.
Some hail is possible given the buoyancy/deep-layer wind profiles,
although mid-level lapse rates are not steep. Locally damaging winds
may also occur, with some potential for a tornado or two mainly near
the warm front.

Although uncertainties linger regarding destabilization and the
magnitude of the severe risk later this afternoon, portions of
southeast Missouri and far southern Illinois will continue to be
reevaluated into mid-afternoon (20Z update) for a potential risk
upgrade.

Farther east, isolated to scattered thunderstorms will probably
develop near the ridge tops of the southern Appalachians and
adjacent parts of the Carolinas Piedmont this afternoon. Moist low
levels coupled with heating will result in around 1000 J/kg MLCAPE.
Some modest multicell organization may occur due to adequately
strong upper-level westerly flow, with a few locally damaging wind
gusts a possibility.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Mon Sep 23 2024

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm potential is uncertain, but limited, on
Wednesday.

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough across the Midwest into the Mid-South is
expected to evolve into a strong trough in the lower Great
Lakes/Northeast and a cut-off low in the Ozarks. A surface cold
front is expected to be positioned from near the upper Ohio Valley
southward into Mid-South and westward into the southern Plains. In
the Gulf of Mexico, current NHC forecasts show a hurricane moving
north-northeastward in parts of the eastern Gulf.

...Western/central New York...
A narrow warm sector may exist ahead of the cold front. Subtle
forcing from the trough to the north may promote storm development
during the afternoon. Given the potential for cloud
cover/precipitation early in the day, along with the strongest
mid-level ascent arriving during the evening, uncertainty is too
high for severe probabilities.

...Mid-South/Southeast...
Strong mid-level flow around the eventual cut-off low could allow
for some storm organization near the cold front. There is a fairly
strong signal for precipitation to be ongoing during morning and
into the afternoon. Surface-based destabilization is at best
uncertain and perhaps not very likely. No severe probabilities will
be added.

...Portions of the Florida Peninsula...
Given the forecast track of the tropical cyclone by NHC and
available model guidance, there is some potential for low-level wind
fields to increase in parts of the southern/central Florida
Peninsula towards Thursday morning. Given the trough to the north of
the expected hurricane and the uncertainty of the exact position of
the system and any related outer convective bands, will continue to
withhold low tornado probabilities.

## Tropical Storm John Forecast Discussion Number 3

date: 2024-09-23, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>

000
WTPZ45 KNHC 230853
TCDEP5
 
Tropical Storm John Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 AM CST Mon Sep 23 2024

Satellite images indicate that John continues to become better 
organized, with very deep convection near the center and some tight 
curved band features.  Earlier microwave imagery also showed some 
inner core development, with perhaps a partial eyewall trying to 
form.  Subjective Dvorak estimates at 06z were 35 kt from both 
TAFB/SAB, though the objective values were between 40-50 kt.  The 
intensity is set to 40 kt as a blend of these data.

The storm is moving slowly to the north-northeast, caught in the 
large-scale southwesterly flow associated with the monsoon trough 
near Central America.  There has been a big change in most of the 
track guidance since yesterday, with a fair number of the models 
now showing a steadier northeastward motion with less eastward 
steering from the incipient tropical cyclone in the northwestern 
Caribbean Sea.  Consequently, the models have shifted leftward and 
faster.  The official forecast is also trended in that direction, 
but could still be too far to the east.  

John is forecast to be over very warm waters with light shear while 
it approaches the coast of Mexico over the next day or so.  While 
none of the regional hurricane models make John a hurricane before 
landfall, the rapid intensification indices are indicating at least 
a 50 percent chance that this system strengthens 30 kt in the next 
24 hours, which would indicate hurricane-strength.  Given the 
uncertainties involved, a Hurricane Watch and a Tropical Storm 
Warning have been issued by the government of Mexico for portions of 
the coast of southern Mexico on this advisory, and interests there 
should closely monitor for future forecast updates.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Slow-moving Tropical Storm John will bring very heavy
rainfall to coastal portions of southwest Mexico through the
upcoming week.  This heavy rainfall will likely cause significant
and possibly catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and
mudslides to the Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southeast
Guerrero, particularly in areas near the coast.
 
2. John is forecast to strengthen before landfall, and a Hurricane 
Watch and a Tropical Storm Warning have been issued for a portion 
of the coastline of southern Mexico, where tropical storm 
conditions could begin late today.
 
3. John could strengthen more than forecast depending on how
long it remains over water. Interests along the coast of southern
Mexico should monitor the latest forecast updates, as Hurricane
Warnings could be required for a portion of the coastline later 
today.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0342 AM CDT Mon Sep 23 2024

Valid 261200Z - 011200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Some severe potential may develop over parts of the South/Southeast
on Day 4/Thu in relation to the potential tropical cyclone currently
over the western Caribbean. Uncertainty in the evolution/track of
this system precludes severe probabilities at this time. Beyond Day
4/Thu, increasing spread among forecast guidance and a somewhat
anomalous mid/upper level pattern lends to low predictability.
However, while uncertainty exists regarding the overall evolution of
an eastern upper trough/cut-off cyclone, severe potential in general
appears low given potential for widespread rainfall along with poor
lapse rates/instability.

## Tropical Depression Ten-E Forecast Discussion Number 1

TCDEP5
 
Tropical Depression Ten-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 PM CST Sun Sep 22 2024
 
Convection has gradually become better organized today in 
association with an area of low pressure that the NHC has been 
monitoring off the coast of southern Mexico. A recent scatterometer 
pass shows the circulation is closed, with a well-defined center and 
peak winds of about 30 kt over the southern semicircle. Therefore, a 
new tropical depression has formed in the eastern Pacific basin.
 
The depression is nearly stationary, but a slow northeastward drift 
is expected to begin later tonight. The track forecast is 
challenging, as there is a large spread in the guidance regarding 
the potential path of the system. Much of the track guidance shows 
the system moving generally east-northeastward as it becomes 
captured within the broader circulation of a developing Central 
American Gyre. However, a couple of global models (ECMWF and UKMET) 
instead show a northward drift over the next couple of days. The NHC 
track forecast favors the first scenario, and generally lies between 
the simple and corrected consensus aids. However, this track 
forecast is of low confidence given the large spread in the models, 
and adjustments will likely be required with future issuances.
 
The moist, unstable environment and very warm waters should be 
conducive for some strengthening of the system during the next 
couple of days. The NHC intensity forecast lies between the IVCN and 
HCCA aids, but it should be noted that there are some models 
indicating the system could reach hurricane strength. While this is 
not explicitly forecast, it certainly cannot be ruled out given the 
environmental and oceanic conditions, and interests along the coast 
of southern Mexico should monitor the latest forecast updates. The 
peak intensity of the system will be highly dependent on how long 
the cyclone remains over water before reaching the coast, which is 
quite uncertain given the track challenges described above.
 
Based on this forecast, the government of Mexico has issued a
Tropical Storm Watch for the southern coast of Mexico from Punta
Maldonado to Salina Cruz.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Slow-moving Tropical Depression Ten-E will bring very heavy
rainfall to coastal portions of southern and southwestern Mexico
through the upcoming week. This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of
significant flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of
Chiapas and Oaxaca, particularly in areas near the coast.
 
2. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm while
moving near the coast of southern Mexico on Monday or Tuesday. A
Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for a portion of the coastline,
where tropical storm conditions could begin on Tuesday.
 
3. The system could strengthen more than forecast if it remains
over water. Interests along the coast of southern Mexico should
monitor the latest forecast updates, as a Hurricane Watch could be
required for a portion of the coastline later tonight or on Monday.
