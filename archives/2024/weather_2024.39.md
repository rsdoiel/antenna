Tropical Storm John Tropical Cyclone Update
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
1000 AM CDT Mon Sep 23 2024
 
Recent satellite imagery indicates that John continues to become 
better organized, and that it is likely to become a hurricane later 
today. Continued strengthening appears likely while John approaches 
the coast of southern Mexico within the Hurricane Warning area.  
This will result in changes to the initial and forecast intensity 
that will be reflected in the next forecast advisory issued by the 
National Hurricane Center at 900 AM CST (1500 UTC).

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Mon Sep 23 2024

Valid 231300Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE OZARKS
TO THE OHIO/TENNESSEE VALLEYS REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible mainly this
afternoon into the early evening from the Ozarks into parts of the
Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys.

...Ozarks into TN/OH Valleys and southern Appalachians...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a digging trough over eastern
MT with it forecast to move into the Dakotas this afternoon.  A
positive-tilt mid-level trough over the central Plains will move
east and deamplify over the MS Valley overnight. This evolution is
expected to aid weak surface wave/low development along the synoptic
front over the Ozarks before moving to the IL/IN border by early
Tuesday morning.  Ongoing showers/thunderstorms over southeast MO
will continue east into the lower OH Valley this morning and temper
destabilization through at least midday.  In its wake, models
indicate MLCAPE in excess of 1000 J/kg developing from AR into
western KY/TN, coincident with modest 0-6km bulk shear.  The surface
boundary will serve as the focus for scattered convection later
today with some of the stronger storms potentially capable of a
localized severe threat.  This activity is expected to diminish
during the evening.

Farther east, isolated to scattered thunderstorms will probably
develop near the ridge tops of the southern Appalachians and
adjacent parts of the Carolinas Piedmont this afternoon.  Moist low
levels coupled with heating will result in around 1000 J/kg MLCAPE. 
Some modest multicell organization may occur due to adequately
strong upper-level westerly flow.  However, weak flow in the lowest
5 km and modest lapse rates will probably temper the overall
potential for localized strong gusts (40-55 mph).

## Tropical Storm John Forecast Discussion Number 3

Tropical Storm John Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 AM CST Mon Sep 23 2024

Satellite images indicate that John continues to become better 
organized, with very deep convection near the center and some tight 
curved band features.  Earlier microwave imagery also showed some 
inner core development, with perhaps a partial eyewall trying to 
form.  Subjective Dvorak estimates at 06z were 35 kt from both 
TAFB/SAB, though the objective values were between 40-50 kt.  The 
intensity is set to 40 kt as a blend of these data.

The storm is moving slowly to the north-northeast, caught in the 
large-scale southwesterly flow associated with the monsoon trough 
near Central America.  There has been a big change in most of the 
track guidance since yesterday, with a fair number of the models 
now showing a steadier northeastward motion with less eastward 
steering from the incipient tropical cyclone in the northwestern 
Caribbean Sea.  Consequently, the models have shifted leftward and 
faster.  The official forecast is also trended in that direction, 
but could still be too far to the east.  

John is forecast to be over very warm waters with light shear while 
it approaches the coast of Mexico over the next day or so.  While 
none of the regional hurricane models make John a hurricane before 
landfall, the rapid intensification indices are indicating at least 
a 50 percent chance that this system strengthens 30 kt in the next 
24 hours, which would indicate hurricane-strength.  Given the 
uncertainties involved, a Hurricane Watch and a Tropical Storm 
Warning have been issued by the government of Mexico for portions of 
the coast of southern Mexico on this advisory, and interests there 
should closely monitor for future forecast updates.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Slow-moving Tropical Storm John will bring very heavy
rainfall to coastal portions of southwest Mexico through the
upcoming week.  This heavy rainfall will likely cause significant
and possibly catastrophic, life-threatening flash flooding and
mudslides to the Mexican States of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and southeast
Guerrero, particularly in areas near the coast.
 
2. John is forecast to strengthen before landfall, and a Hurricane 
Watch and a Tropical Storm Warning have been issued for a portion 
of the coastline of southern Mexico, where tropical storm 
conditions could begin late today.
 
3. John could strengthen more than forecast depending on how
long it remains over water. Interests along the coast of southern
Mexico should monitor the latest forecast updates, as Hurricane
Warnings could be required for a portion of the coastline later 
today.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0342 AM CDT Mon Sep 23 2024

Valid 261200Z - 011200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Some severe potential may develop over parts of the South/Southeast
on Day 4/Thu in relation to the potential tropical cyclone currently
over the western Caribbean. Uncertainty in the evolution/track of
this system precludes severe probabilities at this time. Beyond Day
4/Thu, increasing spread among forecast guidance and a somewhat
anomalous mid/upper level pattern lends to low predictability.
However, while uncertainty exists regarding the overall evolution of
an eastern upper trough/cut-off cyclone, severe potential in general
appears low given potential for widespread rainfall along with poor
lapse rates/instability.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0416 PM CDT Sun Sep 22 2024

Valid 241200Z - 301200Z

Forecast guidance has come to a consensus for a cut off low which
will dominate the weather for much of the central and eastern CONUS
by the middle of this week. In addition, there is some potential for
tropical development which may eventually merge with this upper low
later this week. As this pattern evolves across the eastern CONUS,
ridging will build across the western CONUS. Some warmer conditions
are anticipated, however, winds are expected to be light across
areas with dry fuels. The only period with even elevated
fire-weather conditions forecast is on Day4/Wednesday when some dry
and breezy conditions may develop in the lee of the northern
Sierra/southern Cascades as a mid-level trough moves through the
Pacific Northwest. However, fuels are not critically dry in this
region. Therefore, only elevated conditions forecast at this time
and unreceptive fuels preclude the need for any critical
probabilities given the potential for fire-weather concerns is too
low.

## Tropical Depression Ten-E Forecast Discussion Number 1

WTPZ45 KNHC 222057
TCDEP5
 
Tropical Depression Ten-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP102024
300 PM CST Sun Sep 22 2024
 
Convection has gradually become better organized today in 
association with an area of low pressure that the NHC has been 
monitoring off the coast of southern Mexico. A recent scatterometer 
pass shows the circulation is closed, with a well-defined center and 
peak winds of about 30 kt over the southern semicircle. Therefore, a 
new tropical depression has formed in the eastern Pacific basin.
 
The depression is nearly stationary, but a slow northeastward drift 
is expected to begin later tonight. The track forecast is 
challenging, as there is a large spread in the guidance regarding 
the potential path of the system. Much of the track guidance shows 
the system moving generally east-northeastward as it becomes 
captured within the broader circulation of a developing Central 
American Gyre. However, a couple of global models (ECMWF and UKMET) 
instead show a northward drift over the next couple of days. The NHC 
track forecast favors the first scenario, and generally lies between 
the simple and corrected consensus aids. However, this track 
forecast is of low confidence given the large spread in the models, 
and adjustments will likely be required with future issuances.
 
The moist, unstable environment and very warm waters should be 
conducive for some strengthening of the system during the next 
couple of days. The NHC intensity forecast lies between the IVCN and 
HCCA aids, but it should be noted that there are some models 
indicating the system could reach hurricane strength. While this is 
not explicitly forecast, it certainly cannot be ruled out given the 
environmental and oceanic conditions, and interests along the coast 
of southern Mexico should monitor the latest forecast updates. The 
peak intensity of the system will be highly dependent on how long 
the cyclone remains over water before reaching the coast, which is 
quite uncertain given the track challenges described above.
 
Based on this forecast, the government of Mexico has issued a
Tropical Storm Watch for the southern coast of Mexico from Punta
Maldonado to Salina Cruz.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Slow-moving Tropical Depression Ten-E will bring very heavy
rainfall to coastal portions of southern and southwestern Mexico
through the upcoming week. This heavy rainfall will bring a risk of
significant flash flooding and mudslides to the Mexican States of
Chiapas and Oaxaca, particularly in areas near the coast.
 
2. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm while
moving near the coast of southern Mexico on Monday or Tuesday. A
Tropical Storm Watch has been issued for a portion of the coastline,
where tropical storm conditions could begin on Tuesday.
 
3. The system could strengthen more than forecast if it remains
over water. Interests along the coast of southern Mexico should
monitor the latest forecast updates, as a Hurricane Watch could be
required for a portion of the coastline later tonight or on Monday.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Sun Sep 22 2024

Valid 222000Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM WEST TEXAS
INTO THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible from southwest/west Texas
to western Kentucky.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track with no adjustments required.
Convection across West Texas into central Oklahoma continues to
intensify per GOES IR imagery with further intensification probable
through late afternoon. In general, the Texas Low Rolling Plains and
portions of Ozarks remain relatively more favorable for organized
severe convection due to better diurnal destabilization (MLCAPE has
increased to 1500-2000 J/kg) along and ahead of the front, but
instances of sporadic hail/damaging gusts remain possible across
northwest TX into OK. See the previous discussion below for
additional details.

..Moore.. 09/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1127 AM CDT Sun Sep 22 2024/

...West Texas to the Ozarks and lower Ohio Valley...
Within a split flow regime, a southern-stream shortwave trough will
continue generally eastward while tending to weaken over the
south-central High Plains. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will
remain common near an east/southeastward-moving cold front that
extends from Lake Michigan southwestward across the middle
Mississippi Valley, with convection also occurring along/behind the
south/southeastward-moving portion of the front that extends from
the Ozarks across Oklahoma toward west/southwest Texas.

Outflows and cloud cover extending into the pre-frontal warm sector
will be factors, but somewhat stronger destabilization (possibly
1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE) may occur by peak heating in areas such as
the Texas Low Rolling Plains/Permian Basin, and potentially parts of
the Ozarks. Moderately strong west-southwesterly flow aloft will
largely parallel the frontal zone, with near/pre-frontal effective
shear limited to 20-30 kt, with an exception being the elevated
convection from west/northwest Texas into Oklahoma where some
stronger cores could produce hail in the post-frontal environment.

Where storms intensify near the front this afternoon, strong to
locally damaging wind gusts (50-60 mph) and some hail (up to around
1 inch in diameter) will be possible through the early part of the
evening.

## SPC Sep 22, 2024 1930 UTC Day 3 Severe Thunderstorm Outlook

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day3otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day3otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 3 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Sun Sep 22 2024

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm potential appears low on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
Broad troughing aloft will continue over much of the
northern/central Plains into the Midwest on Tuesday. A lead
shortwave perturbation will initially be located in the Ozarks/lower
Ohio Valley region and move northeastward and weaken with time. In
the Plains, another shortwave perturbation will dig southward into
the southern Plains by Wednesday morning. This feature will get cut
off from the stronger upper-level flow in the Upper Great Lakes.
Overall, a generally weakening upper-level system will promote weak
to modest height falls across parts of the Tennessee Valley with a
weak cold front/surface low moving slowly eastward with time.

...Tennessee Valley...
Early day precipitation potential will again be possible. The
location and degree of surface destabilization remains in question.
It is possible for a few storms to develop during the afternoon
along the cold front. Mid-level flow will be sufficient for modest
storm organization in the strongest storms. However, continued poor
mid-level lapse rates and lack of focused forcing for ascent leaves
coverage of potentially severe storms in doubt. While a conditional
threat for isolated large hail and damaging winds may develop,
severe probabilities will be withheld and trends in guidance will
continue to be monitored.

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes. Fire weather concerns remain minimal on Monday.

..Bentley.. 09/22/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Sun Sep 22 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will be low on Monday across the CONUS. Across
the central US, cool and wet conditions continue beneath mid-level
troughing. Ridging will begin building across the western US with
warming conditions. Though some dry conditions are expected to
continue across the southwest, generally light winds will keep fire
concerns low.
