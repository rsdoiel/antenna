<p>“In most genre fiction where heroes and villains clash, the hero is
intrinsically reactive. The villain starts making trouble and that’s the
beginning of the story. If the villain had never showed up, the hero
would have lived a pleasant and unremarkable life and had a lovely time.
And nothing novel-worthy would have popped up. But the villain comes
along and does something terrible and that makes heroic action
necessary. So if that’s the function of the hero in the story, to be
called to heroic action, then the first conflict that’s readily
available to you is reluctance or a sense of being unworthy… and then
after that, the hero will be called to take on a new shape and often
that will be in response to the shape of the danger, in response to the
shape of the wickedness a foot,” says Oscar-nominated screenwriter, Jon
Spaihts, about the classic hero-villain relationship in <em>Dune: Part
One</em> and <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, based on the books by Frank
Herbert.  <br> <br>In this episode, Jon Spaihts talks about the
importance of hand-to-hand combat in mythic storytelling, his favorite
scene in <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, and we do a deep dive into his most
adored character, Lady Jessica, played by Rebecca Ferguson. We explore
the nature of her mystical powers and why she’s so feared by the men in
the story.  <br> <br>Spaihts also shares his advice about what it really
means to get personal with your writing.  <br> <br>“When people say to
make your story personal, they don’t really mean look at yourself. You
are the least qualified person to say something meaningful about
yourself. What people are really talking about is that you should focus
on the things that obsess you. You can look at the things that are most
plangent to your feelings, that are most itchy and sticky for your
intellect, the things you can’t stop thinking about. You can focus on
the experiences that have impacted you most profoundly. Those things –
the things that push on you and pull on you – that is personal
storytelling. You look not at yourself, you look at the things that have
moved you, that have affected you, that have changed you, redirected
your life and the things that preoccupy you. Those are your seeds of
personal storytelling,” says Spaihts.  <br> <br>To hear more about
writing <em>Dune: Part One</em> and <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, listen to

Despite a screenplay being the blueprint for a movie, screenplay writers
don’t always get the recognition and attention that directors and actors
do. Yes, there are some noteworthy screenwriters like Aaron Sorkin and
Diablo Cody, who have created a great

screenwriters aren’t household names and their resumes are usually only
known by industry professionals or cinephiles. <br><br>Below are <span

<p>Happy Public Domain Day!  Every January 1st the United States adds a
new crop of works to its public domain. Though the term of copyright is
very long, the Constitution provides that it must—eventually—end. This
transition is arguably the most important moment in the life of a
creative work, excepting only its initial creation. The […]</p>

the Witch Queen by Stephanie Burgis: Review by Liz Bourke</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-29, from: Locus Magazine</p>

<strong>Wooing the Witch Queen</strong>, Stephanie Burgis (Bramble
978-1250359599, $19.99, 304pp, tp) February 2025.
</p>
<p>
Given my hit-and-miss track record with fantasy romances – a record far
more miss than hit – I didn’t expect to enjoy Stephanie Burgis’s
<strong>Wooing the Witch Queen </strong>nearly as much as it turns out I
did. But this playful, tongue-in-cheek, not-exactly enemies-to-lovers
romp won me over with aston­ishing rapidity.
