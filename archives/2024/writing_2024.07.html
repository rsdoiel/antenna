Leigh Harlen has only published a collection and one novella, but I
loved the latter so much that they immediately became one of my auto-buy
authors. <strong>Queens of Noise </strong>is a riot of a novella, a
fierce, funny story about were-punks trying to stop a corporate takeover

<strong>Looking Back on 2023 </strong><strong>by Liz Bourke</strong>
</p>
<p>
If there’s a theme that unites the books I enjoyed reading most this
year, it’s power, vio­lence, and survival. The dam­age that violence
inflicts on those who suffer it, and those who wield it, and the
ambigui­ties and challenges inherent in the ethical uses of power.

Of course, some of them were also just plain fun.

Three books stand out most. One is

Geoff Ryman</h2>

<p>
<strong>Him</strong>, Geoff Ryman (Angry Robot 978-1-91520-267-3,
$18.99, 376pp, tp) December 2023.
</p>
<p>
The central conceit of Geoff Ryman’s <strong>Him </strong>is to imagine
an alternative history where Jesus is born biologically female but
identifies as male. It’s a provocative premise that seems designed to
of­fend many people of faith. And yet, while gender identity is a crucial
aspect of the novel, <strong>Him </strong>is, in fact, a respectful and
somewhat authentic rendi­tion

“Curation” is an overworked word these days, when, on the internet,
everything from a collection of Pez dispensers to an Instagram stream of
dinner photos is deemed to be “curated.” And yet there’s really no
better term to be applied to an assemblage of art put together by

I wasn’t on any award juries in 2023, so I’m even less of a completist
than usual when it comes to SF and fantasy in 2023. (When reading purely
for my own enjoyment I tend to mix a lot of crime, comics, romances, and
old stuff I missed the first time around with my shiny new speculative
fiction.) Looking over the list of new

<h2 id="two-ways-of-creating-a-timeline-for-your-scrivener-project">Two
Ways of Creating a Timeline for Your Scrivener Project</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;In some novels, events happen according to a detailed timeline. This is often the case with mysteries and thrillers, where events may occur at specific times, and you, as author, need to keep track of what is happening and when. (Think of the TV series 24.) This is even more complex if you have multiple point of view characters and overlapping timelines; it can be difficult, when you&amp;#39;re writing, to keep track of events.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
In this article, I'm going to show you two ways you can create a
timeline for your Scrivener project.
</p>
<p>Create a timeline using Scrivener's Outliner</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/plan-your-project-with-scriveners-outliner" target="_blank">Scrivener's
Outliner</a> is a great way to get a top-level view of your project. It
reproduces what you see in the Binder - the sidebar at the left of the
Scrivener window - but can display much more information. By default,
the Outliner displays the names of files in the Binder followed by
synopses, if you have added them to the Inspector.
</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/outline1.png" />
</figure>
<p>
But the Outliner is very flexible; you can choose from about two dozen
metadata elements to display in this pane, such as labels, status,
created or modified date, word count, and more. In addition, you can
create custom metadata which you can choose to display in the Outliner.
In
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-add-custom-metadata-to-the-scrivener-inspector" target="_blank">How
to Add Custom Metadata to the Scrivener Inspector</a> we explain how you
can create any of four types of metadata: Text, Checkboxes, Lists, and
Dates. If you add dates to your project files as custom metadata, you
can sort the outline by date, allowing you to view a timeline.
</p>
<p>
Follow the instructions in the article linked above to create custom
metadata. If your story takes place over a short period of time, you may
want to have metadata that allows you to display both the date and the
time; if it's a longer period, the date will be enough. When you've done
this, add dates and/or times to your project files in the Inspector.
Switch to the Outliner (View &gt; Outline), then right-click on the
header just above the outline and choose Date &amp; Time in the menu.
</p>
<p>
In the example below, I'm showing a simple outline with titles,
synopses, and the Date &amp; Time column displayed. In my example,
events take place in a short time period, so both the date and time
display.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/timeline1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;You can display other columns in the Outliner, choosing from the menu that displays when you right-click on the Outliner header. But if you just want to view a timeline, a simple outline like the one above will let you quickly see when events occur in your story.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
If your scenes are not in the timeline order, you can click the Outliner
header labeled Date &amp; Time to sort by that metadata. This can be
useful if part of your novel is flashbacks, and you want to be able to
view them all sequentially, even if they appear scattered among other
chapters in your manuscript. Click the Title and Synopsis header again
to sort by that order.
</p>
<p>Use Scrivener's Corkboard and labels to create a timeline</p>
<p>
The Outliner timeline is simple. It allows you to view when chapters or
scenes occur, but it doesn't allow you to split these elements up and
see individual threads in their own timelines. It's a good way to keep
track of time in a linear story, or a story with just a single
point-of-view character, but if you have multiple characters, you may
want to view a different type of timeline.
</p>
<p>
You can do this using labels and the Corkboard. Labels are a good way to
tag items in the Binder. You can apply labels by right-clicking any item
in the Binder, choosing Label, and then selecting a label. Or you can
select an item in the Binder and click Labels at the bottom of the
Inspector. (See
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/5-tips-for-using-labels-in-scrivener" target="_blank">this
article for more on using labels</a>.)
</p>
<p>
By default, the labels are named according to their colors, but you can
change this. Either right-click a Binder item and choose Label &gt;
Edit, or choose Edit from the Label menu below the Inspector. This
dialogue displays:
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/timeline2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;Double-click any label name to change it, and if you need more labels, click + at the bottom of this dialogue and type a name for the new label. To change any colors, double-click the color circle to bring up a color picker and choose a new color.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
If you have multiple characters, each with their own timelines, you can
set up labels for your POV characters. In the Label List, enter the
names of these characters in different labels. Click the Arrange by
Label button at the bottom of the window.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/timeline3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;The Corkboard displays its cards in threads by label. By default, the cards display in rows, from left to right. Note that I haven&amp;#39;t added synopses to the files in my sample project for better display in this view, but if you have synopses, they display as well, if the cards are large enough.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    






            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/timeline4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;To switch to a vertical view, click the Display in Columns button. This is useful if you want to use split view to keep an eye on the Corkboard while you&amp;#39;re writing.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    






            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/timeline5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;  /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;You can change the size and spacing of the cards by clicking the Corkboard Options button, and if you click the Arrange by Label button again, the Corkboard stops displaying your cards by threads, and returns to the standard Corkboard view.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Working with timelines</p>
<p>
With both types of timeline - Outliner and Corkboard - you can
re-arrange items by dragging them, and you can view the text of any file
by double-clicking the page icon to the left of any outline item, or on
the top left of any index card. These timelines can help you when you're
writing, allowing you, for example, to write all scenes or chapters in
one timeline rather than switching back and forth. They can also help
when you're editing, giving you a better view of each timeline and how
they interrelate. If you've got a complex project where you need to pay
attention to timelines, try out one of these methods.

“You want to write stuff you want to see, that’s the key. Just write
something new something fresh, something interesting,” says director and
co-writer William Eubank of Land of Bad, the new intense, action-packed
movie about a Delta Force team that gets ambushed in enemy
territory. <br><br>Final Draft sat down with Eubank to talk about his
writing process, directing Liam Hemsworth, Russell Crowe and Luke
Hemsworth in this unhinged survival story full of exciting set pieces
and big action moments.
