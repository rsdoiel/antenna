trial of Ozy’s Carlos Watson</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The nation’s attention was recently focused on a courtroom in lower
Manhattan, home to a trial that was endlessly liveblogged, camera ban be
damned. But for news-about-news junkies, there’s another New York City
trial — this one in Brooklyn — that should be drawing attention. It
involves Carlos Watson, the CEO and co-founder of Ozy….</p>

Nexus, an inbox stalwart</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Last week, Zack Colman of Politico reported that Climate Nexus, a
climate communications firm that’s been a stalwart of the climate news
landscape since 2011, will shut down on June 21. The Water Hub, a
Climate Nexus project that focuses on water issues, will be splitting
off into its own organization, but many of the…</p>

signing a deal with OpenAI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Shortly before The Atlantic announced “a product and content”
partnership with OpenAI, the magazine published a piece by The
Information CEO and founder Jessica Lessin that argued “media companies
are making a huge mistake with AI.” “For as long as I have reported on
internet companies, I have watched news leaders try to bend their…</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>A new report from the Reuters Institute offers up insight into how
readers around the world are thinking about the place of generative AI
in their news. The study cast a wide net, surveying the general public
in six countries: Argentina, Denmark, France, Japan, the U.K., and the
U.S. There has been much debate about…</p>

curiosity make you read more hard news? How about anxiety?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Why do people read the news? To journalists, that may sound like a
stupid question. We read news because it’s critical to democracy!
Because it’s the fascinating narrative of human existence! Because it’s
a daily heroic tale of reporters uncovering corruption, malfeasance, and
grift! But to normies, it’s sometimes a real puzzle. News is an…</p>

always thought The Epoch Times was sketchy, but this is really
something</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The Department of Justice has charged the CFO of The Epoch Times
— the shadowy, pro-Trump, conspiracy-embracing, billboard-loving, and
weirdly successful media company — with conspiring to launder at least
$67 million in illegally obtained funds. (If you’d hoped to attend The
Epoch Times School of Journalism, you might want to make other plans.)
The CFO,…</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>On Friday, May 31, front pages around the world blasted the historic
news that a former president of the United States and current leading
presidential candidate had, for the first time, become a felon. Not all
front pages, though. The Seattle Times’ Jeong Park quickly noticed that
several Gannett newspapers (and at least one McClatchy…</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>When Hoodline, a company that runs hyperlocal news sites for cities
across the country, first launched, it sounded promising. The site’s
approach to combining data with granular, on-the-ground reporting got
the attention of my former Nieman Lab colleagues back in 2015, when it
was focused on San Francisco. We wrote about it again in 2018,…</p>

<p>Sally Buzbee is no longer the executive editor of the Washington Post
after nearly three years on the job, the paper announced Sunday evening.
She had been the first woman to hold that position at the paper. The
Post’s CEO and publisher William Lewis, who joined the publication in
November, will replace Buzbee with former…</p>
