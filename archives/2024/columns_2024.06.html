<p>Fascist Germany may feel like a lifetime ago, but it was actually
during my lifetime. And yet many people old enough to remember seem to
have forgotten the horrible lessons of that time. Many more have never
been taught what happened, why, or how. So given the current state of
the world, including the situation in our own country, this is as good a
time as any for review and reminders.</p>

Chapter 18 of Zeke Faux’s
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1"><i>Number
Go Up: Inside Crypto’s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall</i></a> is entitled
“Pig Butchering”. It starts when he receives a supposed wrong-number
text from a “Vicky”:<br />
<blockquote>
I showed my phone to my friend and explained that I was stringing Vicky
along because I’d heard about a new kind of investment fraud that often
started with a random text message. I had a hunch that this was why
“Vicky” was texting me. The scam was called “pig butchering” because the
scammers liked to build up the victim’s confidence with a pretend
romantic relationship and made-up investment gains before stealing all
their money in one fell swoop—like how hogs are fattened up before their
slaughter.
</blockquote>
This is a romance- and cryptocurrency-enabled version of the “Wee Forest
Folk” scam we described in our 2003
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/945445.945451">SOSP paper</a>.<br />

Faux strung “Vicky” along
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">and</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
My short-lived texting flirtation with Vicky confirmed something that I
had suspected: The scammers were using Tether to move the money. I spoke
with several other pig-butchering victims, and they said they’d been
asked to send Tether too.<br /> …<br /> From the scammer’s perspective,
Tether was a clear improvement on bribing bankers or money mules. It was
instant, there was no recourse for refunds, and it didn’t ask for
anyone’s name or address. And unlike other cryptocurrencies, its value
didn’t fluctuate from hour to hour, making it less scary for potential
victims and easier to manage for criminals.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">How
much Tether are we talking?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
News stories revealed that people were losing huge amounts of money. A
project finance lawyer in Boston with terminal cancer handed over $2.5
million. A divorced mother of three in St. Louis was defrauded of $5
million. A twenty-four-year-old social media producer in Tennessee lost
$300,000 she inherited from the sale of her childhood home.<br />
…<br /> I came across a group that claimed to be raising money dedicated
to helping victims. It was called the Global Anti-Scam Organization. The
group said it had helped a huge number of pig-butchering victims: 1,483
worldwide, who’d lost more than $250 million combined.
</blockquote>
Despite Tether’s ability to
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508">freeze
wallets</a>,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">Faux
writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Icetoad and other volunteers from the Global Anti-Scam group told me
that Tether refused to help them by freezing accounts or seizing stolen
money, even when presented with evidence that an account held the
proceeds of fraud.<br /> …<br /> In another exchange provided by Global
Anti-Scam, Tether told a Hong Kong police official that it did have the
ability to intervene. But the company still refused, saying the case was
too small. “We must sometimes decline fraud cases involving relatively
small amounts of stolen USDT,” the Tether representative wrote, using
the ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency. It said they would only
intervene if the case was “directly connected to acts of violence.”
</blockquote>
Faux got Rich Sanders of CipherBlade to trace his
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">payment
to “Vicky”</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
a small dark circle represented Vicky Ho’s wallet. This was where I’d
sent the eighty-one Tethers. Sanders explained that the wallet was
active for about two months and received many deposits from addresses
that were known to be associated with U.S. and Canadian Canadian crypto
exchanges. There were transfers of $3,600, $180, $400, $500, and $9,774,
always in Tether. These were other people who’d been scammed by the same
operation, Sanders said. In other words, I wasn’t Vicky’s only love
interest. Once Vicky Ho had collected the money, they sent it to another
numbered address, represented on the screen by a larger white circle.
This one was likely controlled by the scammers too, Sanders said, and it
held $9.4 million in Tethers. From there, many of the Tethers were sent
to addresses associated with the crypto exchange Binance, and to others
that belonged to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">Global
Anti-Scam told Faux that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
most butchering scams were orchestrated by gangsters based in Cambodia
or Myanmar. These bosses would lure young men and women from across
Southeast Asia to move abroad with the promise of well-paying jobs in
customer service or online gambling. Then, when the workers arrived,
they’d be held captive and forced to work on online scams. Icetoad and
his colleagues told me there were thousands of people who’d been tricked
this way. Entire office towers were filled with floor after floor of
people forced to send spam messages around the clock, under threat of
torture or death. These were the people using Tether to move their
money.
</blockquote>
His next chapter recounts his trip to Cambodia to see the pig-butchering
campuses. Like the rest of the book, it is well worth reading.
Conditions in these campuses were
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-17/crypto-text-message-scams-lead-back-to-cambodia-slave-labor">horrific</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Workers who missed quotas were beaten, starved, made to hit one another.
One said he’d seen people forcibly injected with methamphetamine to
increase productivity. Two others said they’d seen workers murdered,
with the deaths passed off as suicides. They said the bosses would buy
and sell captive laborers like livestock.<br /> …<br /> Local news
reports described a string of suspicious deaths near Chinatown—one body
was found hanging at a construction site, and another corpse was dug up
handcuffed from a shallow grave in a field nearby. A local vendor told a
Cambodian outlet that there had been many suicides at the complex. “If
an ambulance doesn’t go inside at least twice a week, it is a wonder,”
he said.

Faux wasn’t alone in reporting on the pig-butchers. Poppy McPherson and
Tom Wilson of Reuters published a special report entitled
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/"><i>Crypto
scam: Inside the billion-dollar ’’pig-butchering‘‘ industry</i></a>.
They traced funds flowing to Wang Yicheng in Bangkok:<br />
<blockquote>
At a Thai police headquarters in October 2022, Chinese businessman Wang
Yicheng congratulated one of Bangkok’s most senior cybercrime
investigators on his recent promotion, presenting the official with a
large bouquet of flowers wrapped in red paper and a bow.<br /> <br />
Wang, the vice president of a local Chinese trade group, wished the new
cybercrime investigator “smooth work and new achievements,” according to
the group’s website, which displays photographs of the event.<br />
<br /> Over the past two years, Wang has forged relationships with
members of Thailand’s law-enforcement and political elite, the trade
group’s online posts show. During that time, a cryptocurrency account
registered in Wang’s name was receiving millions of dollars linked to a
type of cryptocurrency investment scam known as pig butchering, a
Reuters investigation has found.<br /> <br /> In total, crypto worth
more than $90 million flowed into the account between January 2021 and
November 2022, according to registration documents and transaction logs
reviewed by Reuters. Of that, at least $9.1 million came from a crypto
wallet that U.S. blockchain analysis firm TRM Labs said was linked to
pig-butchering scams. Two other major crypto-tracking firms also said
the account received funds linked to such scams.<br /> …<br /> Lisa
Wolk, a blockchain intelligence analyst at TRM, said the crypto account
in Wang’s name “is a node in a money laundering network and not
necessarily the ultimate recipient of funds.” Reuters was unable to
determine whether anyone else benefited from the account or used Wang’s
identity to open it.<br />
</blockquote>
Where was
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">Wang’s
account?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The crypto account registered to Wang was held at Binance, the world’s
largest crypto exchange, according to three blockchain analysis firms.
Asked about the account, Binance spokesperson Jessica Jung declined to
comment on individual users or Reuters’ findings. In an August post on
its website, the company said the number of reports of pig-butchering
scams it had received this year was double that of 2022, an increase it
attributed to an influx of inexperienced crypto investors and scammers
looking to exploit them.<br /> …<br /> In April, the U.S. Department of
Justice said it seized about $112 million worth of crypto linked to
pig-butchering scams, without identifying suspects. A warrant that
resulted in the seizure of more than half that amount specified a
Binance account registered in Thailand.<br />
</blockquote>
Wang’s account moved a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">lot
of Tether</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The crypto account in Wang’s name was registered in November 2020,
according to the financial records Reuters reviewed. The three
blockchain-analysis firms determined the account was with Binance. The
documents, which relate to the Binance account, span two years to
November 2022. They show that the account was accessed mostly from
Bangkok.<br /> <br /> Deposits started arriving in the account in early
2021 and quickly increased in size to include sums of more than
$100,000, the financial records show.<br /> …<br /> In 2022, the volume
of crypto reaching the account in Wang’s name mushroomed to almost $79
million, a near six-fold increase on the previous year, the account
records seen by Reuters show.<br /> <br /> Coinfirm, the blockchain
analysis firm that reviewed the transaction records for Reuters, said
deposits from funds linked to pig-butchering scams it previously
investigated began entering the account as early as February 2022.
Stolen crypto was moved to the account via a “complex layering scheme,”
involving multiple different wallets, Coinfirm’s then-head of fraud
investigations Roman Bieda told Reuters in May. The crypto moved between
“dozens” of wallets and was mixed with funds from other sources, he
said.<br /> <br /> More than $102,000 originating from fraudsters’
wallets that the California man identified were deposited into the
account in Wang’s name between June 26 and Oct. 23, 2022, according to
Coinfirm.<br /> <br /> Nearly all of the crypto deposited in the
Wang-registered account was moved to other wallets, the transaction
records reviewed by Reuters show. Between January 2021 and October 2022,
about $87.5 million was transferred to almost 50 other crypto wallets,
including at least five registered at regionally based crypto exchanges,
Coinfirm said.
</blockquote>
The pigs weren’t
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">butchered
in Bangkok</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Several scams connected to deposits made into the account in Wang’s name
were run from an industrial park on the Myanmar-Thai border, one of the
blockchain analysis firms told Reuters. Workers are trafficked to the
area, known as KK Park, by gangs that force them to con people online,
according to two former workers and groups that support workers or scam
victims.<br />
</blockquote>
This was clearly a different pig abattoir from the Cambodia-based one
Faux investigated.<br /> <br /> A more detailed account of tracing the
money flows of the pig butchers can be found in
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4687064"><i>Connecting Chinese
and American Scam Victims</i></a>, a collaboration betwween Jonathan
Reiter’s company ChainArgos and BitTrace, a Chinese blockchain tracing
company. The abstract reads:
<blockquote>
The world is experiencing an epidemic of online scams with at least tens
of billions of dollars lost across dozens of countries. One particular
class of scam known as “pig butchering” has grown dramatically and often
involves the use of cryptocurrency both to collect funds from victims
and to launder the proceeds. Here we are going to explore the use of
cryptocurrency in pig butchering scams beginning with victims in both
the People’s Republic of China and United States of America, and
demonstrating the remarkable degree of similarity for cases that have no
reason <i>a priori</i> to be similar at all.<br /> <br /> Specifically
we will show that scammers with victims in both these countries share
cryptocur- rency addresses, use overlapping sets of money-laundering
services, and are therefore likely parts of the same group or syndicate.
Our analysis begins with reports from victims in both countries where we
find source victim and scam wallet addresses. From there we are able to
trace scam proceeds through the cryptocurrency ecosystem to prove these
connections. Finally, a range of exchanges and other service providers
are identified through a combination of on-chain and documentary
research, to demonstrate the cross-border nature of modern scams
leveraging cryptocurrencies, and highlight the challenges facing law
enforcement agencies globally when it comes to such scams.
</blockquote>
The two teams use press accounts of two cases with victims in China and
legal filings from two cases with victims in Florida and California.
They provide detailed traces, including wallet addresses, of flows from
the victims to exchanges including Binance, Bitkub, FTX, OKX, Coinbase,
Huboi, Maskex, Paribu and Peatio amounting to $635M. In particular, one
of the Binance wallets was one of those identified in Reuters’
reporting. The paper

the Proceeds of Crime: Crypto’s Killer App?</i></a>:<br />

Now we are going to connect a few more dots to argue that scamming and
the laundering of scam proceeds was not just a use case for
cryptocurrencies in Asia, but likely a major driver of flows through
several well-known industry players.<br /> <br /> This may well even be,
empirically, crypto’s killer app.
</blockquote>
They note that
<a href="https://protos.com/genesis-block-ftx-had-more-than-prostitutes-in-thailand/">Genesis
Block</a>, whose
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">Charles Yang
admitted</a> maintaining bank accounts in South-East Asia under false
pretences, appears to have been the
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/blockchain-evidence-suggests-genesis">on-
and off-ramp for FTX</a> in the region. The
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4687064">earlier paper</a>
showed
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
FTX was involved in processing over US$250 million in flows downstream
from scams and Bitkub, Thailand’s largest crypto exchange, was involved
in over US$100 million.
</blockquote>
Could this be
“<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">banking
Cambodia’s unbanked</a>”?:<br />
<blockquote>
Cambodia’s population is only 16 million, with a per capita GDP of about
US$1,600 — it’s hard to imagine Cambodia driving hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of stablecoin flows.
</blockquote>
They refer to the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">interview with
Charles Yang</a> and
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">note
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Genesis Block’s head trader explicitly talks about scam proceeds leading
to bank account freezes and how they actively manage this problem.<br />
<br /> So Genesis Block were clearly a downstream service provider and
knew that at least some of their clients were, or at least were dealing
with, criminals.<br /> <br /> With regards to Genesis Block’s Chinese
client base, in a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86eSpiUbKw">different
interview</a> the same person says:<br />
<blockquote>
<i> We’ve been seeing a lot of our partners pretty much disappear…a lot
of our friends over there are kind of in big trouble…it’s not really
about crypto it’s more about the source of the RMB… [which was] a lot of
pyramid schemes, a lot of scams. </i>
</blockquote>
Genesis Block were clearly dealing with people who were either criminals
themselves, or service providers to criminals, and Genesis Block
appeared comfortable talking about such activities on camera.
</blockquote>
Genesis Block was
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">plugged
in to the top level of cryptocurrency infrastructure</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Genesis Block OTC was on the
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/a-walled-garden-full-of-snakes-the">Signet
client list</a>, as were many of the other exchanges referenced in our
earlier work.<br /> <br /> A service provider that talked openly about
dealing with criminals was active on a platform another commentator
described as
“<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/a-walled-garden-full-of-snakes-the">a
walled garden filled with snakes</a>.”<br /> <br /> That service
provider (Genesis Block) was integrated with FTX/Alameda Research),
which was both the
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/usdt-on-tron-ftx-wtf-is-really-happening-ef0cb807019a">largest
recipient of new USDT</a> and a major exchange operator with
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/technology/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-trial-ftx.html">myriad,
sometimes-remarkably-creative, schemes to access fiat currency</a>.
</blockquote>
This leads ChainArgos to
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">argue
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
it is entirely plausible that:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Genesis Block’s client base included many of these scammers and/or
crimionals;
</li>
<li>
the outsized involvement of FTX was this flow; and/or
</li>
<li>
so was the Bitkub flow, via Genesis Block or otherwise;
</li>
</ul>
and this isn’t just plausible, it’s provable, because the illicit flows
documented in our prior work were laundered by someone.<br /> <br /> If
it wasn’t this route it means there is at least one more
multi-billion-dollar laundering pipeline connected to this activity we
know nothing about.<br /> <br /> That is possible of course, but seems
unlikely.<br /> <br /> Certainly the simplest explanation is that no
second as-yet-undiscovered group of scammers or criminals exists and
it’s all the same organization.<br /> <br /> Now remember these actors
specifically mentioned that the traditional financial system was
blocking them and freezing their accounts.
</blockquote>
Thus ChainArgos
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">concludes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We are looking at a gigantic amount of bad flow that was caught by banks
and how cryptocurrencies were used to circumvent those controls.<br />
<br /> The contents of those frozen accounts could have been, and at
least partially would have been, sent back to the victims instead of
being irreversibly exfiltrated.<br /> <br /> So this may well be
crypto’s real killer app — irreversible cross-border transfers for
criminals.
</blockquote>
Taken together, what these documents show is lives being wrecked, both
by the scams themselves leading to suicides, and by the human trafficing
that provides the scammers workforce, leading to beatings, imprisonment
and suicides. Pillars of the cryptocurrency community are enabling
this:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Tether, which refused to freeze wallets despite detailed blockchain
evidence of pig-butchering even from law enforcement. Contrast this with
Tether’s behavior in the case of
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508">The
Victim</a> documented by Patrick Tan, where a simple request from law
enforcement with only suspicion froze a wallet.
</li>
<li>
Major exchanges, including Binance, FTX, Huboi and many others, were on
notice that they were handling funds from the pig butchers. Take Binance
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">for
example</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Binance publicly said it assisted Thai police with a probe into “a
significant pig butchering scam,” and that about $277 million of assets
were confiscated.
</blockquote>
and they
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">blamed
the victims</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the number of reports of pig-butchering scams it had received this year
was double that of 2022, an increase it attributed to an influx of
inexperienced crypto investors and scammers looking to exploit them.
</blockquote>
and they responded to a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">Dept.
of Justice warrant</a> about these funds.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus these businesses cannnot claim ignorance of the flow of
pig-butchering funds, or of their scale. But they are clearly motivated
to turn a blind eye to them whenever possible.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="on-software-liabilities">On Software Liabilities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, updated: 2024-02-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Over on Lawfare, Jim Dempsey published a really interesting
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/standards-for-software-liability-focus-on-the-product-for-liability-focus-on-the-process-for-safe-harbor">proposal</a>
for software liability: “Standard for Software Liability: Focus on the
Product for Liability, Focus on the Process for Safe Harbor.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Section 1 of this paper sets the stage by briefly describing the problem
to be solved. Section 2 canvasses the different fields of law (warranty,
negligence, products liability, and certification) that could provide a
starting point for what would have to be legislative action establishing
a system of software liability. The conclusion is that all of these
fields would face the same question: How buggy is too buggy? Section 3
explains why existing software development frameworks do not provide a
sufficiently definitive basis for legal liability. They focus on
process, while a liability regime should begin with a focus on the
product—­that is, on outcomes. Expanding on the idea of building codes
for building code, Section 4 shows some examples of product-focused
standards from other fields. Section 5 notes that already there have
been definitive expressions of software defects that can be drawn
together to form the minimum legal standard of security. It specifically
calls out the list of common software weaknesses tracked by the MITRE
Corporation under a government contract. Section 6 considers how to
define flaws above the minimum floor and how to limit that liability
with a safe harbor…

Deceptive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, updated: 2024-02-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research:
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2401.05566v3">Sleeper Agents: Training
Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training</a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior:
behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very
differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the
opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we
detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training
techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept
examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For
example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states
that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year
is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so
that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including
supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training
(eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor
behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained
to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training
process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought
is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find
that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their
backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results
suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard
techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false
impression of safety…

<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>Since the security of the U.S.-Mexico border is a top issue for many
Americans, the Republican Party is betting that their strategy will win
the day … or at least the presidential election. But it isn’t much of a
plan. The strategy: Do nothing. The reason: Because Donald Trump said
so.</p>

of code – how to not measure code quality and developer efficiency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Chris Heilmann’s blog</p>
<p>Lately I have a person who pings me daily asking how many lines of
code I have written today. The first time was on the weekend. My answer

my partner” which is an excellent idea. However, lines of code are often
seen as […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I mentioned how we fund Stefan’s work on improving
HTTP(/3) in curl. Now, in similar spirit we are funding Dan Fandrich to
work on further improving test infrastructure. Dan has worked fiercely
on the introduction of parallel tests over the recent year or so and
this is work that builds on …

I am travelling onwards from Brussels as I write.<br /><br />I did 2

<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Robert Reich’s blog</p>
<p>Friends, Several of you have asked me why I spend so much time and
energy on this letter, which is read mainly (if not exclusively) by
people who already share my views and values. “Why are you preaching to
the choir?” you ask. “Wouldn’t your efforts be more useful if you tried
to convince people who aren’t already convinced?”</p>

<h2 id="a-new-joy-in-jazz">A New ’Joy‘ in Jazz</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-04, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>Samara Joy has been called the new voice of jazz, a vocal phenom, a
savior of the genre. This young lady is “joy” personified and today’s
reason to smile, from her stunning jazz singing to her megawatt smile.
The 24-year-old jazz sensation from the Bronx surprised a lot of people
at last year’s Grammy Awards when she won not only Best Jazz Vocal Album
but also Best New Artist, an award given only three times to a jazz
artist. She will be back at the Grammys tonight as a presenter and again
as a nominee. Take a listen to her incredible improvisation on the
Grammy-nominated song “Tight.”</p>
