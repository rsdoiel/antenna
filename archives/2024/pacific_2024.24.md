## Donald Trump’s mob rule

date: 2024-06-09, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>This week, Breitbart interviewed former Trump official Peter Navarro, one of many criminals in the ex-president&#8217;s orbit, from the Miami prison where he is serving four months for contempt of Congress. While life behind bars is difficult, Navarro boasted that his stint has been smoothed by his ties to Donald Trump, which make him something of a made man. The former president, said Navarro, is beloved not just by the guards, but by the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of inmates as well. &#8220;If I were a Bidenite, things would be a lot tougher here &#8212; and yes, they know exactly who I am and respect the fact that I stood up for a principle and didn&#8217;t bow to the government,&#8221; he said.</p>
