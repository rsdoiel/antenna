## Frequency of HBsAg variants in occult hepatitis B virus infected patients and detection by ARCHITECT HBsAg quantitative

date: 2024-05-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo analyze the amino acid substitution caused by mutations in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of the S-region genes in the serum samples of occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI), and to explore the reasons for the missed detection of HBsAg.MethodThe full-length gene of the S-region in hepatitis B virus(HBV) in the chronic hepatitis B virus(CHB)(10 samples) and OBI groups(42 samples) was amplified using a lab-developed, two-round PCR amplification technology. The PCR amplification products were sequenced/clone sequenced, and the nucleotide sequences of the S-region gene in HBV were compared to the respective genotype consensus sequence.ResultsOnly 20 of the 42 samples in the OBI group had the S-region genes successfully amplified, with the lowest HBV DNA load of 20.1IU/ml. As S-region genes in HBV, 68 cloned strains were sequenced. In the OBI and CHB groups MHR region, with a mutation rate of 3.21% (155/4828) and 0.70% (5/710). The genetic mutation rate was significantly higher in the OBI group than in the CHB group (P<0.05). The common mutation types in the MHR region were: I126T, L162R, K122E, C124R, and C147Y.Mutations at s122, s126, and s162 were associated with subgenotypes, most of which being C genotypes. The high-frequency mutation sites L162R and K122E found in this study have not been reported in previous literature.ConclusionThe results of this study confirmed that MHR mutations can cause the missed detection of HBsAg, giving rise to OBI.

## Interaction of Neisseria meningitidis carrier and disease isolates of MenB cc32 and MenW cc22 with epithelial cells of the nasopharyngeal barrier

date: 2024-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Neisseria meningitidis (Nm, the meningococcus) is considered an asymptomatic colonizer of the upper respiratory tract and a transient member of its microbiome. It is assumed that the spread of N. meningitidis into the bloodstream occurs via transcytosis of the nasopharyngeal epithelial barrier without destroying the barrier layer. Here, we used Calu-3 respiratory epithelial cells that were grown under air-liquid-interface conditions to induce formation of pseudostratified layers and mucus production. The number of bacterial localizations in the outer mucus, as well as cellular adhesion, invasion and transmigration of different carrier and disease N. meningitidis isolates belonging to MenB:cc32 and MenW:cc22 lineages was assessed. In addition, the effect on barrier integrity and cytokine release was determined. Our findings showed that all strains tested resided primarily in the outer mucus layer after 24 h of infection (>80%). Nonetheless, both MenB:cc32 and MenW:cc22 carrier and disease isolates reached the surface of the epithelial cells and overcame the barrier. Interestingly, we observed a significant difference in the number of bacteria transmigrating the epithelial cell barrier, with the representative disease isolates being more efficient to transmigrate compared to carrier isolates. This could be attributed to the capacity of the disease isolates to invade, however could not be assigned to expression of the outer membrane protein Opc. Moreover, we found that the representative meningococcal isolates tested in this study did not damage the epithelial barrier, as shown by TEER measurement, FITC-dextran permeability assays, and expression of cell-junction components.

## Unraveling the adaptive strategies of Mycoplasma hominis through proteogenomic profiling of clinical isolates

date: 2024-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMycoplasma hominis (M. hominis) belongs to the class Mollicutes, characterized by a very small genome size, reduction of metabolic pathways, including transcription factors, and the absence of a cell wall. Despite this, they adapt well not only to specific niches within the host organism but can also spread throughout the body, colonizing various organs and tissues. The adaptation mechanisms of M. hominis, as well as their regulatory pathways, are poorly understood. It is known that, when adapting to adverse conditions, Mycoplasmas can undergo phenotypic switches that may persist for several generations.MethodsTo investigate the adaptive properties of M. hominis related to survival in the host, we conducted a comparative phenotypic and proteogenomic analysis of eight clinical isolates of M. hominis obtained from patients with urogenital infections and the laboratory strain H-34.ResultsWe have shown that clinical isolates differ in phenotypic features from the laboratory strain, form biofilms more effectively and show resistance to ofloxacin. The comparative proteogenomic analysis revealed that, unlike the laboratory strain, the clinical isolates possess several features related to stress survival: they switch carbon metabolism, activating the energetically least advantageous pathway of nucleoside utilization, which allows slowing down cellular processes and transitioning to a starvation state; they reconfigure the repertoire of membrane proteins; they have integrative conjugative elements in their genomes, which are key mediators of horizontal gene transfer. The upregulation of the methylating subunit of the restriction-modification (RM) system type I and the additional components of RM systems found in clinical isolates suggest that DNA methylation may play a role in regulating the adaptation mechanisms of M. hominis in the host organism. It has been shown that based on the proteogenomic profile, namely the genome sequence, protein content, composition of the RM systems and additional subunits HsdM, HsdS and HsdR, composition and number of transposable elements, as well as the sequence of the main variable antigen Vaa, we can divide clinical isolates into two phenotypes: typical colonies (TC), which have a high growth rate, and atypical (aTC) mini-colonies, which have a slow growth rate and exhibit properties similar to persisters.DiscussionWe believe that the key mechanism of adaptation of M. hominis in the host is phenotypic restructuring, leading to a slowing down cellular processes and the formation of small atypical colonies. This is due to a switch in carbon metabolism and activation the pathway of nucleoside utilization. We hypothesize that DNA methylation may play a role in regulating this switch.

## Effect of Ducrosia anethifolia methanol extract against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on excision wound in diabetic mice

date: 2024-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundDucrosia anethifolia is an aromatic desert plant used in Saudi folk medicine to treat skin infections. It is widely found in Middle Eastern countries.MethodsA methanolic extract of the plant was prepared, and its phytoconstituents were determined using LC-MS. In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of the methanolic extract were evaluated against multidrug-resistant bacteria. The cytotoxic effect was assessed using HaCaT cell lines in-vitro. Diabetic mice were used to study the in-vivo antibiofilm and wound healing activity using the excision wound method.ResultsMore than 50 phytoconstituents were found in the extract after LC-MS analysis. The extract exhibited antibacterial activity against both the tested pathogens. The extract was free of irritant effects on mice skin, and no cytotoxicity was observed on HaCaT cells with an IC50 value of 1381 µg/ml. The ointment formulation of the extract increased the healing of diabetic wounds. The microbial load of both pathogens in the wounded tissue was also reduced after the treatment. The extract was more effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) than MDR-P. aeruginosa in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Further, skin regeneration was also observed in histological studies.ConclusionsThe results showed that D. anethifolia methanol extract supports wound healing in infected wounds in diabetic mice through antibacterial, antibiofilm, and wound healing activities.

## Regulation of immune responses to infection through interaction between stem cell-derived exosomes and toll-like receptors mediated by microRNA cargoes

date: 2024-05-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Infectious diseases are among the factors that account for a significant proportion of disease-related deaths worldwide. The primary treatment approach to combat microbial infections is the use of antibiotics. However, the widespread use of these drugs over the past two decades has led to the emergence of resistant microbial species, making the control of microbial infections a serious challenge. One of the most important solutions in the field of combating infectious diseases is the regulation of the host’s defense system. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in the first primary defense against pathogens by identifying harmful endogenous molecules released from dying cells and damaged tissues as well as invading microbial agents. Therefore, they play an important role in communicating and regulating innate and adaptive immunity. Of course, excessive activation of TLRs can lead to disruption of immune homeostasis and increase the risk of inflammatory reactions. Targeting TLR signaling pathways has emerged as a new therapeutic approach for infectious diseases based on host-directed therapy (HDT). In recent years, stem cell-derived exosomes have received significant attention as factors regulating the immune system. The regulation effects of exosomes on the immune system are based on the HDT strategy, which is due to their cargoes. In general, the mechanism of action of stem cell-derived exosomes in HDT is by regulating and modulating immunity, promoting tissue regeneration, and reducing host toxicity. One of their most important cargoes is microRNAs, which have been shown to play a significant role in regulating immunity through TLRs. This review investigates the therapeutic properties of stem cell-derived exosomes in combating infections through the interaction between exosomal microRNAs and Toll-like receptors.

## In vitro biofilm formation of Gardnerella vaginalis and Escherichia coli associated with bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis

date: 2024-05-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo determine the optimum biofilm formation ratio of Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) in a mixed culture with Escherichia coli (E. coli).MethodsG. vaginalis ATCC14018, E. coli ATCC25922, as well as five strains of G. vaginalis were selected from the vaginal sources of patients whose biofilm forming capacity was determined by the Crystal Violet method. The biofilm forming capacity of E. coli in anaerobic and non-anaerobic environments were compared using the identical assay. The Crystal Violet method was also used to determine the biofilm forming capacity of a co-culture of G. vaginalis and E. coli in different ratios. After Live/Dead staining, biofilm thickness was measured using confocal laser scanning microscopy, and biofilm morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy.ResultsThe biofilm forming capacity of E. coli under anaerobic environment was similar to that in a 5% CO2 environment. The biofilm forming capacity of G. vaginalis and E. coli was stronger at 106:105 CFU/mL than at other ratios (P<0.05). Their thicknesses were greater at 106:105 CFU/mL than at the other ratios, with the exception of 106:102 CFU/mL (P<0.05), under laser scanning microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy revealed increased biofilm formation at 106:105 CFU/mL and 106:102 CFU/mL, but no discernible E. coli was observed at 106:102 CFU/mL.ConclusionG. vaginalis and E. coli showed the greatest biofilm forming capacity at a concentration of 106:105 CFU/mL at 48 hours and could be used to simulate a mixed infection of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis in vitro.

## Modeling airway persistent infection of Moraxella catarrhalis and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae by using human in vitro models

date: 2024-05-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Moraxella catarrhalis (Mcat) are two common respiratory tract pathogens often associated with acute exacerbations in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as well as with otitis media (OM) in children. Although there is evidence that these pathogens can adopt persistence mechanisms such as biofilm formation, the precise means through which they contribute to disease severity and chronicity remains incompletely understood, posing challenges for their effective eradication. The identification of potential vaccine candidates frequently entails the characterization of the host-pathogen interplay in vitro even though this approach is limited by the fact that conventional models do not permit long term bacterial infections. In the present work, by using air-liquid-interface (ALI) human airway in vitro models, we aimed to recreate COPD-related persistent bacterial infections. In particular, we explored an alternative use of the ALI system consisting in the assembly of an inverted epithelium grown on the basal part of a transwell membrane with the aim to enable the functionality of natural defense mechanisms such as mucociliary clearance and cellular extrusion that are usually hampered during conventional ALI infection experiments. The inversion of the epithelium did not affect tissue differentiation and considerably delayed NTHi or Mcat infection progression, allowing one to monitor host-pathogen interactions for up to three weeks. Notably, the use of these models, coupled with confocal and transmission electron microscopy, revealed unique features associated with NTHi and Mcat infection, highlighting persistence strategies including the formation of intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) and surface-associated biofilm-like structures. Overall, this study demonstrates the possibility to perform long term host-pathogen investigations in vitro with the aim to define persistence mechanisms adopted by respiratory pathogens and individuate potential new vaccine targets.

date: 2024-04-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveExploring the effect of SJQJD on the pulmonary microbiota of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rats through 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing.MethodsA COPD rat model was constructed through smoking and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and the efficacy of SJQJD was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbnent Assay (ELISA). The alveolar lavage fluid of rats was subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. The diversity of lung microbiota composition and community structure was analyzed and differential microbiota were screened. Additionally, machine learning algorithms were used for screening biomarkers of each group of the microbiota.ResultsSJQJD could improve lung structure and inflammatory response in COPD rats. 16s rRNA sequencing analysis showed that SJQJD could significantly improve the abundance and diversity of bacterial communities in COPD rats. Through differential analysis and machine learning methods, potential microbial biomarkers were identified as Mycoplasmataceae, Bacillaceae, and Lachnospiraceae.ConclusionSJQJD could improve tissue morphology and local inflammatory response in COPD rats, and its effect may be related to improve pulmonary microbiota.

## Significance of serum protein electrophoresis in the diagnosis of Tsukayama type IV periprosthetic joint infection

date: 2024-04-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesTo investigate the efficacy of serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after hip and knee arthroplasty.MethodsThe medical records of patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty at a class A tertiary hospital between August 2013 and January 2021 were retrospectively investigated. A total of 179 patients were included and divided into two groups: 66 patients in the PJI group and 113 patients in the aseptic loosening (AL) group. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), D-dimer, Fibrinogen, Serum albumin and the proportion of serum protein in SPE were compared between the two groups. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the diagnostic value was compared using the area under the ROC curve (AUC).ResultsThere was no significant difference in age, sex and body mass index (BMI) between PJI group and AL group (P>0.05), but there was significant difference in the ratio of hip to knee (X2 = 22.043, P<0.001). The CRP, ESR, D-dimer, Fibrinogen and the proportion of α1 globulin band in PJI group was 22.99(10.55,40.58) mg/L, 37.00(23.00,61.70) mm/h, 790.00(500.00,1500.00) ng/ml, 4.84(3.81,5.55) g/L and 5.80(5.00,7.73) % which was higher than that in AL group [1.89(0.50,4.12) mg/L, U=7.984, P<0.001; 10.10(7.00,16.90) mm/h, U=8.095, P<0.001; 570.00(372.50,780.00) ng/ml, U=3.448, P<0.001; 2.84(2.45,3.43) g/L, U=8.053, P<0.001 and 4.20(3.90,4.80) %, U=8.154, P<0.001]. The Serum albumin and the proportion of Albumin band in PJI group was 36.10(33.10,39.00) g/L and 49.00(44.95,52.20) % which was lower than that in AL group [38.10(34.00,41.10) g/L, U=-2.383, P=0.017 and 54.40(51.55,56.70) %, U=-6.162, P<0.001]. The proportion of In PJI group, the AUC of proportion of α1 globulin was 0.8654, which was equivalent to CRP (0.8698), ESR (0.8680) and outperformed that of fibrinogen (0.8025).ConclusionsElevated proportion of α1 globulin in SPE presented with good diagnostic value for Tsukayama type IV PJI, and its accuracy was comparable to those of ESR and CRP. And α1 globulin can assist with CRP and ESR to determining the timing of second-stage revision.

## Incomplete Plasmodium falciparum growth inhibition following piperaquine treatment translates into increased parasite viability in the in vitro parasite reduction ratio assay

date: 2024-04-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Antimalarial resistance to the first-line partner drug piperaquine (PPQ) threatens the effectiveness of artemisinin-based combination therapy. In vitro piperaquine resistance is characterized by incomplete growth inhibition, i.e. increased parasite growth at higher drug concentrations. However, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) remain relatively stable across parasite lines. Measuring parasite viability of a drug-resistant Cambodian Plasmodium falciparum isolate in a parasite reduction ratio (PRR) assay helped to better understand the resistance phenotype towards PPQ. In this parasite isolate, incomplete growth inhibition translated to only a 2.5-fold increase in IC50 but a dramatic decrease of parasite killing in the PRR assay. Hence, this pilot study reveals the potential of in vitro parasite viability assays as an important, additional tool when it comes to guiding decision-making in preclinical drug development and post approval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a compound was tested against a drug-resistant parasite in the in vitro PRR assay.

## Establishment of two serological methods for detecting IgG and neutralizing antibodies against Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus glycoprotein

date: 2024-04-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), the most geographically widespread tick-borne virus, is endemic in Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia, with infection resulting in mortality in up to 30% of cases. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or effective therapies available for CCHF. The CCHFV should only be manipulated in the BSL-4 laboratory, which has severely hampered basic seroprevalence studies. MethodsIn the present study, two antibody detection methods in the forms of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sPVNT) were developed using a recombinant glycoprotein (rGP) and a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based virus bearing the CCHFV recombinant glycoprotein (rVSV/CCHFV) in a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratory, respectively. ResultsThe rGP-based ELISA and rVSV/CCHFV-based sVNT were established by using the anti-CCHFV pre-GC mAb  11E7, known as a broadly cross-reactive, potently neutralizing antibody, and their applications as diagnostic antigens were validated for the specific detection of CCHFV IgG and neutralizing antibodies in experimental animals. In two tests, mAb clone 11E7 (diluted at 1:163840 or 512) still displayed positive binding and neutralization, and the presence of antibodies (IgG and neutralizing) against the rGP and rVSV/CCHFV was also determined in the sera from the experimental animals. Both mAb  11E7 and animal sera showed a high reactivity to both antigens, indicating that bacterially expressed rGP and rVSV/CCHFV have good immunoreactivity. Apart from establishing two serological testing methods, their results also demonstrated an imperfect correlation between IgG and neutralizing antibodies. DiscussionWithin this limited number of samples, the rGP and rVSV/CCHFV could be safe and convenient tools with significant potential for research on specific antibodies and serological samples.

## Hesperidin alleviates zinc-induced nephrotoxicity via the gut-kidney axis in swine

date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionZinc (Zn) is an essential trace element in animals, but excessive intake can lead to renal toxicity damage. Thus, the exploration of effective natural antagonists to reduce the toxicity caused by Zn has become a major scientific problem.MethodsHere, we found that hesperidin could effectively alleviate the renal toxicity induced by Zn in pigs by using hematoxylin-eosin staining, transmission electron microscope, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence quantitative PCR, and microfloral DNA sequencing.ResultsThe results showed that hesperidin could effectively attenuate the pathological injury in kidney, and reduce autophagy and apoptosis induced by Zn, which evidenced by the downregulation of LC3, ATG5, Bak1, Bax, Caspase-3 and upregulation of p62 and Bcl2. Additionally, hesperidin could reverse colon injury and the decrease of ZO-1 protein expression. Interestingly, hesperidin restored the intestinal flora structure disturbed by Zn, and significantly reduced the abundance of Tenericutes (phylum level) and Christensenella (genus level).DiscussionThus, altered intestinal flora and intestinal barrier function constitute the gut-kidney axis, which is involved in hesperidin alleviating Zn-induced nephrotoxicity. Our study provides theoretical basis and practical significance of hesperidin for the prevention and treatment of Zn-induced nephrotoxicity through gut-kidney axis.

## Sporadic clone Escherichia coli ST615 as a vector and reservoir for dissemination of crucial antimicrobial resistance genes

date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

There is scarce information concerning the role of sporadic clones in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) within the nosocomial niche. We confirmed that the clinical Escherichia coli M19736 ST615 strain, one of the first isolates of Latin America that harbors a plasmid with an mcr-1 gene, could receive crucial ARG by transformation and conjugation using as donors critical plasmids that harbor blaCTX-M-15, blaKPC-2, blaNDM-5, blaNDM-1, or aadB genes. Escherichia coli M19736 acquired blaCTX-M-15, blaKPC-2, blaNDM-5, blaNDM-1, and aadB genes, being only blaNDM-1 maintained at 100% on the 10th day of subculture. In addition, when the evolved MDR-E. coli M19736 acquired sequentially blaCTX-M-15 and blaNDM-1 genes, the maintenance pattern of the plasmids changed. In addition, when the evolved XDR-E. coli M19736 acquired in an ulterior step the paadB plasmid, a different pattern of the plasmid’s maintenance was found. Interestingly, the evolved E. coli M19736 strains disseminated simultaneously the acquired conjugative plasmids in different combinations though selection was ceftazidime in all cases. Finally, we isolated and characterized the extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the native and evolved XDR-E. coli M19736 strains. Interestingly, EVs from the evolved XDR-E. coli M19736 harbored blaCTX-M-15 though the pDCAG1-CTX-M-15 was previously lost as shown by WGS and experiments, suggesting that EV could be a relevant reservoir of ARG for susceptible bacteria. These results evidenced the genetic plasticity of a sporadic clone of E. coli such as ST615 that could play a relevant transitional link in the clinical dynamics and evolution to multidrug/extensively/pandrug-resistant phenotypes of superbugs within the nosocomial niche by acting simultaneously as a vector and reservoir of multiple ARGs which later could be disseminated.

## Raising the bar: genus-specific nested PCR improves detection and lineage identification of avian haemosporidian parasites

date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Avian haemosporidian parasites are useful model organisms to study the ecology and evolution of parasite-host interactions due to their global distribution and extensive biodiversity. Detection of these parasites has evolved from microscopic examination to PCR-based methods, with the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene serving as barcoding region. However, standard PCR protocols used for screening and identification purposes have limitations in detecting mixed infections and generating phylogenetically informative data due to short amplicon lengths. To address these issues, we developed a novel genus-specific nested PCR protocol targeting avian haemosporidian parasites. The protocol underwent rigorous testing utilizing a large dataset comprising blood samples from Malagasy birds of three distinct Passeriformes families. Furthermore, validation was done by examining smaller datasets in two other laboratories employing divergent master mixes and different bird species. Comparative analyses were conducted between the outcomes of the novel PCR protocol and those obtained through the widely used standard nested PCR method. The novel protocol enables specific identification of Plasmodium, Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus), and Leucocytozoon parasites. The analyses demonstrated comparable sensitivity to the standard nested PCR with notable improvements in detecting mixed infections. In addition, phylogenetic resolution is improved by amplification of longer fragments, leading to a better understanding of the haemosporidian biodiversity and evolution. Overall, the novel protocol represents a valuable addition to avian haemosporidian detection methodologies, facilitating comprehensive studies on parasite ecology, epidemiology, and evolution.

## Evaluation of IFNAR2 and TYK2 transcripts’ prognostic role in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective study

date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Background and objectivesThis study aimed to investigate the possible prognostic significance of interferon alpha–beta receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) expressions.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study including COVID-19 adult patients. All blood samples were collected before any interventions. The expressions of IFNAR2 and TYK2 were assessed using real-time PCR in venous blood samples of 54 cases and 56 controls. The transcript quantities of IFNAR2 and TYK2 genes were assessed using a Delta-Ct method.ResultsOur findings show no significant differences in gene expression levels for IFNAR2 and TYK2 between patients who required oxygen (O2) therapy and those who did not (p-value = 0.732 and p-value = 0.629, respectively). Likewise, there were no significant differences in IFNAR2 and TYK2 expressions between patients hospitalized for less than 7 days and those hospitalized for 7 days or more (p-value = 0.455 and p-value = 0.626, respectively). We also observed a weak correlation between IFNAR2 expression and CRP (p-value = 0.045, r = 0.192). There was a negative correlation between the expression levels of IFNAR2 and TYK2 transcripts in COVID-19 patients (p-value = 0.044; partial correlation coefficient = -0.283). Additionally, IFNAR2 and TYK2 were significantly downregulated in the COVID-19 group compared to healthy subjects (p-value = 0.002 and p-value = 0.028, respectively). However, neither IFNAR2 nor TYK2 expression was significantly different between the case subgroups based on COVID-19 severity. The IFNAR2 ΔΔCt (B = -0.184, 95% CI: -0.524–0.157, p-value = 0.275) and the TYK2 ΔΔCt (B = 0.114, 95% CI: -0.268–0.496, p-value = 0.543) were not found to be significant predictors of hospitalization duration. The area under the curve (AUC) for IFNAR2 expression is 0.655 (p-value = 0.005, 95% CI: 0.554–0.757), suggesting its poor discriminative value.ConclusionWe were unable to comment definitively on the prognostic power of IFNAR2 and TYK2 expressions in COVID-19 patients, and larger-scale studies are needed. The principal limitations of this study included the lack of longitudinal analysis and limited sample size.

## Incidence and risk factors of active tuberculosis among older individuals with latent tuberculosis infection: a cohort study in two high-epidemic sites in eastern China

date: 2024-04-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe influencing factors of the process from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to the onset of active tuberculosis (TB) remain unknown among different population groups, especially among older individuals in high-incidence areas. This study aimed to investigate the development of active TB among older adults with LTBI and identify groups in greatest need of improved prevention and control strategies for TB.MethodsIn 2021, we implemented an investigation among older individuals (≥ 65 years old) in two towns in Zhejiang Province with the highest incidence of TB. All participants underwent assessment using standardized questionnaires, physical examinations, interferon-gamma release assays, and chest radiography. All the participants with suspected TB based on the clinical symptoms or abnormal chest radiography results, as well as those with LTBI, were referred for diagnostic investigation in accordance with the national guidelines. Those with an initial diagnosis of TB were then excluded, whereas those with LTBI were included in a follow-up at baseline. Incident patients with active TB were identified from the Chinese Tuberculosis Management Information System, and a multivariate Cox regression model was used to estimate the incidence and risk of TB among those with LTBI.ResultsIn total, 667 participants with LTBI were followed up for 1,315.3 person-years, revealing a disease density of 1,292.5 individuals/100,000 person-years (17/1,315.3). For those with LTBI, chest radiograph abnormalities had adjusted hazard ratios for active TB of 4.9 (1.6–15.3).ConclusionsThe presence of abnormal chest radiography findings increased the risk of active TB among older individuals with LTBI in high-epidemic sites in eastern China.
