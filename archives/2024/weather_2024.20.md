Mesoscale Discussion 0794
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0301 PM CDT Wed May 15 2024

Areas affected...Oklahoma Panhandle...Texas Panhandle...and far
eastern New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152001Z - 152130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Watch possible this afternoon as potential for damaging
winds and large hail increases.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite shows areas of cu developing across
portions of eastern New Mexico into the Texas and Oklahoma
Panhandles. Trends in CAM guidance and morning/afternoon WoFS runs
show medium confidence in storm initiation across the Texas
Panhandle by 20-21z. Temperatures are in the mid to upper 80s with
steep mid-level lapse rates around 8.5-9 C/km. Surface objective
analysis shows MLCAPE around 1000-2000 J/kg from the Texas Panhandle
into western Oklahoma with mid-level capping remaining, though
surface temperatures in the mid 80s should remove the cap per the
19z AMA sounding. High-based convection will initially pose a risk
of severe winds, given deeply mixed profiles and large dew point
depressions. A watch may be needed prior to 21z.

Mesoscale Discussion 0793
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Wed May 15 2024

Areas affected...Portions of southern NC into SC

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 245...

Valid 151924Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 245
continues.

SUMMARY...Scattered damaging winds and severe hail should occur with
thunderstorms moving eastward across parts of southern North
Carolina into South Carolina this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Multiple thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
along/near a surface front that remains draped across parts of
western/southern NC, near the SC border. Marginally severe hail has
occurred with some of this initially more discrete activity. Recent
tendency has been for some clustering to occur near the boundary in
southern NC. The threat for scattered damaging winds should increase
as these small clusters spread eastward over the next couple of
hours, as low-level lapse rates continue to steepen with diurnal
heating amid low/mid-level westerly winds gradually strengthening
with height. Farther south into SC, a more isolated/cellular mode
amid 35-40 kt of deep-layer shear should support a continued threat
for severe hail, along with occasional strong/damaging winds.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0242 PM CDT Wed May 15 2024

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE TX
PANHANDLE INTO NORTHWEST OK AND SOUTH KS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN SC AND SOUTHERN
NC...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern Plains this
afternoon and evening, accompanied by severe wind gusts, large hail,
and perhaps a tornado or two. Scattered severe thunderstorms are
also possible into early evening across parts of the Carolinas.

...20Z Update...
Two appreciable changes were made to the outlook. First, the level
2-SLGT risk across FL has been removed in the wake of the primary
convective clusters having moved off the coast. Isolated
thunderstorms may redevelop this evening into tonight, so the level
1-MRGL risk has been maintained for now. The other adjustment was to
add a small 2 percent tornado area in southwest MN where an arc of
low-topped convection has developed ahead of a shortwave trough and
attendant surface cyclone in SD. A brief tornado remains possible
along the edge of mid 50s surface dew points where temperatures have
warmed into the middle 60s to low 70s. This potential should be
short-lived as the corridor of modest low-level SRH shifts
northeastward away from the meager buoyancy plume emanating north
from the Mid-MO Valley.

..Grams.. 05/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Wed May 15 2024/

...Carolinas this afternoon/evening...
Along and south of a slow moving front across southern NC, surface
heating in cloud breaks and boundary-layer dewpoints of 65-70 F are
contributing to MLCAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg and minimal convective
inhibition.  Thunderstorm development is expected by early afternoon
along/south of the front into the warm sector, in advance of
embedded perturbations rotating around the southeast periphery of a
midlevel trough approaching the southern Appalachians.  Mostly
straight hodographs with effective bulk shear of 35-50 kt will favor
a mix of organized clusters and/or supercells capable of producing
large hail of 1-1.75 inches in diameter and damaging winds of 60-70
mph.

...Central FL today...
Convection is ongoing along and north of a diffuse outflow boundary
across central FL, as well as upstream over the eastern Gulf of
Mexico.  VWPs from TBW/MLB/JAX show largely unidirectional,
west-southwesterly wind profiles with straight hodographs, in an
environment with MLCAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg.  Central FL will be along
the southern periphery of the southern Appalachians midlevel trough
with modest forcing for ascent near its peak this afternoon.  It
appears the strongest storms, which will include a mix of
supercells/clusters, will tend to remain along the southern fringe
of the ongoing convection, with more uncertainty farther north based
on more extensive cloud cover.  The strongest storms will be capable
of producing large hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter and 60-70 mph
outflow winds.

...Southern Plains this afternoon into tonight...
A shallow, moist boundary layer is returning to south TX, but areas
farther to the north will rely on residual low-level moisture and
evapotranspiration from moist soil and green vegetation to boost
boundary-layer dewpoints into the 50s/low 60s.  Weak perturbations
will move eastward from northern NM and CO toward the TX
Panhandle/northwest OK/KS, along a weak front from central KS to the
TX Panhandle.  Strong surface heating along and south of the front
will drive a deepening mixed layer, while there will be sufficient
moisture/steep midlevel lapse rates to support MLCAPE of 1000-2000
J/kg.  The moderate buoyancy and inverted-V profiles will favor
hybrid microbursts with severe outflow winds of 60-80 mph,
especially with any organized clusters/high-based supercells and
storm mergers.  Large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter will be
possible with any persistent supercells or favorable storm mergers. 
The tornado threat will be tempered by modest low-level moisture.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Wed May 15 2024

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...2000Z Update...
A few minor changes were made to the Day2 outlook to extend the
Elevated area through the Big Bend and lower Trans Pecos regions.
Westerly downslope flow is expected to increase tomorrow ahead of a
cold front west of the Pecos River valley. Locally sustained wind
speeds will approach or briefly exceed critical limits in and around
the Davis Mountains and Big Bend. A small critical area was
considered for these regions given deeply mixed forecast soundings.
However, relatively weak flow aloft (850-700 mb) and mid to upper
ascent accompanying a shortwave trough during the first half of the
day will preclude the addition of such for the time being.

..Barnes/Lyons.. 05/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Wed May 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the southern Plains tomorrow
(Thursday), encouraging a surface low to form over western TX, which
will shift northeastward during the day. Strong northwesterly
downslope flow behind the low will overspread the Trans Pecos region
of western Texas during the afternoon. Guidance consensus shows
15-20 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds overlapping 10-20
percent for several hours, necessitating the introduction of
Elevated highlights given the presence of dry fuels.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 PM CDT Wed May 15 2024

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM WEST TX TO
THE LOWER MS VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from west Texas to the
Lower Mississippi Valley on Thursday afternoon into Thursday night.
Very large hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes are likely.

..TX to the Lower MS Valley...
Primary change this outlook has been to expand level 2-SLGT risk
eastward for wind and tornado potential on Thursday evening/night
from the Sabine to the Lower MS Valleys. Considered an upgrade to
level 3-ENH risk for very large hail across the Permian Basin to
Concho Valley, but enough uncertainty exists to defer to later
outlooks.

A southern-stream shortwave trough will progress east from the
AZ/NM/northwest Mexico border area into the southern Great Plains on
Thursday. Strong mid/upper-level flow will be displaced south of
this wave across northern Mexico through most of TX. Early morning
convection will likely be ongoing within the low-level warm theta-e
advection regime focused along and north of a northeast to
southwest-oriented cold front bisecting OK into west TX.  While the
low-level jet will subside after 12Z, large spread exists across
guidance with the degree of warm-advection convection persisting
into early afternoon. It is plausible that given a pronounced
low-level moisture gradient persisting from southeast to north TX,
renewed storm development may continue through the morning into the
afternoon in parts of north and central TX. Outflows from this
activity could yield an emerging MCS that spreads east-southeast in
parts of central to southeast TX during the afternoon, while
simultaneously impacting the most favorable corridor for upstream
supercell development. This latter corridor should be focused in a
mesoscale area be near the dryline/frontal intersection from the
Permian Basin to Concho Valley vicinity. Conditionally, this area
would favor potential for long-lived supercells with a vertical wind
profile conducive to very large hail and a couple tornadoes. 

Eventual upscale growth from one or both regimes is likely amid both
cold pool amalgamation and increasing large-scale ascent as the
low-level jet further intensifies across the Sabine to Lower MS
Valleys. A mix of damaging winds with a nocturnal tornado threat
will be possible Thursday evening/night. 

...Mid-MS Valley...
A remnant MCV from a D1 MCS in parts of OK/KS should be a focus for
renewed thunderstorm development on Thursday afternoon. Mid-level
lapse rates will be weak near the MCV, but enhanced mid to
lower-level flow should support a threat for a couple supercells
capable of isolated severe. 

...South FL...
A weak baroclinic zone will sag south during the day. Morning
convection may be ongoing along it with a marginally supportive
environment for weak mid-level rotation. This activity should
diminish, but renewed development may occur along the Atlantic coast
sea breeze. Isolated, marginally severe wind and hail are possible.

...Western Great Lakes vicinity...
With another day of warm/moist-sector modification, a few strong to
marginally severe storms will be possible on Thursday afternoon
ahead of a lower-amplitude shortwave trough and attendant surface
front. Instability will still be limited, but moderate vertical
shear could support a couple transient supercell structures around
peak heating.

SOUTHERN KS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SURROUNDING THE
ENHANCED AREA...AND OVER PORTIONS OF KS/OK/TX...SC/SOUTHERN NC...AND
CENTRAL FL...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern Plains this
afternoon and evening, accompanied by severe wind gusts, large hail,
and perhaps a tornado or two. Scattered severe thunderstorms are
also possible through this afternoon over parts of the
central/northern Florida Peninsula, as well as the Carolinas.

...Carolinas this afternoon/evening...
Along and south of a slow moving front across southern NC, surface
heating in cloud breaks and boundary-layer dewpoints of 65-70 F are
contributing to MLCAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg and minimal convective
inhibition.  Thunderstorm development is expected by early afternoon
along/south of the front into the warm sector, in advance of
embedded perturbations rotating around the southeast periphery of a
midlevel trough approaching the southern Appalachians.  Mostly
straight hodographs with effective bulk shear of 35-50 kt will favor
a mix of organized clusters and/or supercells capable of producing
large hail of 1-1.75 inches in diameter and damaging winds of 60-70
mph.

...Central FL today...
Convection is ongoing along and north of a diffuse outflow boundary
across central FL, as well as upstream over the eastern Gulf of

the southern periphery of the southern Appalachians midlevel trough
with modest forcing for ascent near its peak this afternoon.  It
appears the strongest storms, which will include a mix of
supercells/clusters, will tend to remain along the southern fringe
of the ongoing convection, with more uncertainty farther north based
on more extensive cloud cover.  The strongest storms will be capable
of producing large hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter and 60-70 mph
outflow winds.

...Southern Plains this afternoon into tonight...
A shallow, moist boundary layer is returning to south TX, but areas
farther to the north will rely on residual low-level moisture and
evapotranspiration from moist soil and green vegetation to boost
boundary-layer dewpoints into the 50s/low 60s.  Weak perturbations
will move eastward from northern NM and CO toward the TX
Panhandle/northwest OK/KS, along a weak front from central KS to the
TX Panhandle.  Strong surface heating along and south of the front
will drive a deepening mixed layer, while there will be sufficient
moisture/steep midlevel lapse rates to support MLCAPE of 1000-2000
J/kg.  The moderate buoyancy and inverted-V profiles will favor
hybrid microbursts with severe outflow winds of 60-80 mph,
especially with any organized clusters/high-based supercells and
storm mergers.  Large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter will be
possible with any persistent supercells or favorable storm mergers. 
The tornado threat will be tempered by modest low-level moisture.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 AM CDT Wed May 15 2024

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...17Z Update...
Few changes were made to the previous forecast. There was a minor
shift southward for elevated conditions impacting the Davis
Mountains region, where sustained winds near 10 to 15 mph should
persist through the afternoon as RH drops into the low teens.
Critical conditions were considered for the Guadalupe Mountains and
portions of southeast New Mexico where sustained wind speeds near or
just under 20 mph are expected for a few hours. Slightly weaker flow
aloft should preclude the need for a small Critical area.

..Barnes/Lyons.. 05/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Wed May 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the eastern seaboard as a second
mid-level trough overspreads the Rockies and ejects into the
southern Plains today. Low-level moisture return and/or appreciable
rainfall accumulations should limit significant wildfire-spread
potential across most locales east of the Rockies. Dry downslope
flow should develop over southern New Mexico into Far West Texas as
a surface low becomes established over the southern High Plains. 15
mph sustained westerly surface winds amid 10-20 percent RH will
overspread dry fuels during the afternoon, warranting the
continuation of Elevated highlights.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0758 AM CDT Wed May 15 2024

Valid 151300Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern Plains this
afternoon and evening, accompanied by severe wind gusts, large hail,
and perhaps a couple of tornadoes. Scattered severe thunderstorms
are also possible this morning into the afternoon over parts of the
central/northern Florida Peninsula, as well as the Carolinas.

...Central/northern Florida Peninsula...
Thunderstorms will likely continue to focus along, and perhaps later
redevelop a bit north of, a modestly convergent effective baroclinic
zone that extends southwest-northeastward across the region. A warm
and moist (at least middle 70s F surface dewpoints) air mass resides
across  much of the Peninsula. On the southern periphery of
moderately strong cyclonically curved westerlies, related to a
Tennessee Valley-centered upper trough, a moderately unstable
environment and 40+ kt effective shear have been supportive of
several embedded supercells in the pre-dawn hours.

A further increase in convective coverage and intensity appears
likely through the morning as the boundary layer warms, with some
semi-discrete supercells expected. Damaging winds and large hail
will be possible aside from a tornado risk. For additional
short-term details, see Mesoscale Discussion 790. The overall severe
risk seems likely to diminish/focus offshore by late afternoon.

...Carolinas...
Ahead of the weak surface low, adequate boundary layer heating and
moistening should occur beneath 6.5-7 C/km mid-level lapse rates,
supporting a marginally unstable but uncapped airmass by afternoon.
The combination of surface heating, and some dynamic lifting induced
by the approaching mid-level trough, will support late morning/early
afternoon thunderstorm initiation. Stronger westerly flow aloft from
the mid-level trough will overspread the warm sector, contributing
to 30-40 kt of effective bulk shear. Surface temperatures warming
into the low 80s F amid mid 60s F dewpoints will boost MLCAPE to at
least 1500 J/kg. Given relatively elongated, straight hodographs,
splitting supercells and merging multicells should occur through the
afternoon, accompanied by a severe wind and hail risk.

...Southern Plains...
A weak triple point will become increasingly established near the
Oklahoma/Kansas border vicinity into this afternoon, with a
moist/moderate unstable air mass to the east of a surface
trough/dryline extending southwestward toward the Texas Panhandle
and Texas South Plains. The region may be further influenced by a
subtle northeastward-developing mid-level speed max later today. 

Multiple zones of sub-regional thunderstorm development and
intensification are expected during the mid/late afternoon. This
includes high-based thunderstorm development across west/northwest
Texas within a deeply mixed environment. Ample evaporative cooling
within the deep, well-mixed boundary layer will yield the
development of deep, strong cold pools with a tendency to merge
through evening. Other storms should develop this afternoon in
vicinity of the Raton Mesa in an evolving low-level upslope flow
regime, and near and east of the Oklahoma/Kansas border vicinity
triple point. Supercells are most probable (potential and duration
thereof) with any development near/east of this surface triple
point, and with the evolving post-frontal upslope flow regime from
far northeast New Mexico into the Oklahoma/northern Texas
Panhandles.

Large hail will be possible especially within the first few hours of
deep convective initiation, but severe-wind-producing clusters are
expected to rapidly propagate from the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles
into northwestern Oklahoma and eventually far southern Kansas by
late afternoon/early evening, preceded by richer low-level moisture
and a strengthening low-level jet. 

Storms should gradually weaken overnight as they either become
undercut by cold pools, or they outpace the buoyancy axis by the
time they reach far eastern Kansas and northeast Oklahoma. 

...Southern High Plains...
Farther south, more isolated thunderstorms may initiate along a
diffuse dryline across west/southwest Texas toward the Rio Grande.
Given overall weak forcing, confidence in thunderstorm development
and sustenance is not overly high, but any storm that can form and
mature may become supercellular, accompanied by severe wind and
hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 0781
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0930 AM CDT Tue May 14 2024

Areas affected...Portions of the northern/central FL Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 141430Z - 141630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A cluster of thunderstorms should approach the Tampa metro
and vicinity around 15-16Z (11 AM - Noon EDT), while posing a threat
for mainly damaging winds. New watch issuance is possible to address
this potential.

DISCUSSION...A loosely organized cluster of convection is ongoing
this morning over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Recent forward motion
of this activity suggests it should approach the FL Gulf Coast by
15-16Z. The 12Z sounding from TBW shows relatively cool mid-level
temperatures for FL (-10 C at 500 mb), along with steepened lapse
rates associated with an EML above 700 mb. But, there is still a
residual cap noted between 800-700 mb, which may tend to limit
updraft intensity over land in the short term. Recent surface
observations and visible satellite imagery also show strong
thunderstorms have developed along trailing outflow from earlier
convection across the north-central FL Peninsula. As robust daytime
heating of a very moist low-level airmass continues along/south of
this boundary, lingering MLCIN should gradually erode. Around
2000-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE will conditionally support intense
updrafts, with sufficiently strong mid-level westerly flow and
related deep-layer shear also fostering organized convection.

Thunderstorm evolution through the afternoon remains somewhat
unclear, as recent IR satellite trends show warming cloud tops with
the eastern Gulf convection. There is still some chance that strong
to severe thunderstorms consolidate along the outflow boundary over
the next couple of hours, and continue spreading eastward across the
central FL Peninsula this afternoon. If this scenario materializes,
then scattered damaging winds around 50-70 mph would likely be the
main threat as low-level lapse rates continue to steepen. A brief
tornado or two may also occur, although low-level flow has had a
tendency to veer to southwesterly this morning per latest VWPs from
KTBW, which has reduced 0-1 km SRH. Marginally severe hail also
appears possible with the more robust updrafts. It remains unclear
whether a new watch will be needed, but observational trends will be
closely monitored.

AL this morning. A warm front is draped east-southeastward across
southern AL into the western FL Panhandle based on latest surface
observations. Recent velocity data from KMOB show strong inbound
velocities at low levels. A greater threat for severe/damaging winds
should be focused along and south of the warm front into parts of
the western FL Panhandle, where there will be a better likelihood
for downdraft winds to reach the surface. Enhanced low-level flow
and strong boundary-layer shear noted on recent VWPs from KMOB may
also support some threat for an embedded tornado.

Mesoscale Discussion 0763
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0833 AM CDT Mon May 13 2024

Areas affected...Portions of south-central TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 131333Z - 131530Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The threat for very large hail and damaging winds should
continue to increase this morning. Watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...The 12Z sounding from DRT shows rich low-level moisture
beneath steep mid-level lapse rates, with resulting MUCAPE
approaching 4000 J/kg. Strong deep-layer shear of 50-60 kt will
easily support supercell structures, and multiple thunderstorms have
already developed near Eagle Pass TX with a weak mid-level
perturbation ejecting from northern Mexico across TX. Current
expectations are for this ongoing activity to gradually spread
eastward across south-central TX this morning, while posing a threat
for very large hail (around 2-3 inches in diameter) with any
sustained supercells. Occasional severe/damaging downdraft winds may
also occur as low-level lapse rates gradually steepen with filtered
daytime heating. Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance will likely be
needed to address the increasing threat for very large hail this
morning.
