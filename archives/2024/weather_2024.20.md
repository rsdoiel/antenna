Mesoscale Discussion 0801
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1026 AM CDT Thu May 16 2024

Areas affected...parts of central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161526Z - 161800Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will likely increase in coverage and intensity over
the next several hours, with damaging wind and areas of hail.

DISCUSSION...Widespread rain and storms currently exist along and
north of an outflow boundary, extending from just south of the MAF
to SJT area and curling into northeastern TX. Surface observations
indicate the outflow continues to push south, resulting in an
undercutting action to the existing convection. 

As of 15Z, the most notable area of storms was just northeast of
SJT. This convection may be developing into a small MCS, with
northern portions clearly elevated and additional development
occurring along the southern flank. These storms may continue to
grow upscale, ingesting the very moist and unstable air, and
translating east/southeast along the cold front/outflow. 

Additional storms are also developing just southwest of SJT, where
robust moisture has pushed westward beneath slightly cooler
temperatures aloft with less capping.  The deepening boundary layer
should generally reduce CIN through the day, with the end result
increasing coverage of strong to severe storms. Damaging winds will
be the primary threat, although large hail may occur with the more
discrete storms before they merge into an MCS.

## SPC May 16, 2024 1730 UTC Day 2 Convective Outlook

date: 2024-05-16, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day2otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day2otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 2 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 PM CDT Thu May 16 2024

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF THE
GULF COAST STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms with a few tornadoes, very large
hail, and damaging winds are possible across parts of the Gulf Coast
States on Friday through Friday night.

...South-central to Southeast States...
A messy severe weather setup is expected on Friday into Friday night
amid a series of low-amplitude impulses ejecting within and around
the positive-tilt, southern-stream shortwave trough across the
southern Great Plains. Synoptic surface pattern appears nebulous and
likely driven on the mesoscale by several rounds of convection today
through the end of D2. Primary changes with this outlook are to
expand severe probabilities west and east, while reducing
probabilities across the northern portion of the threat area.

An MCS or clustered remnants of an early morning one should be
ongoing at 12Z Friday across parts of the central Gulf Coast region.
Outflow from this preceding D1 activity will serve as the focus for
renewed thunderstorm development later in the day. Most guidance
suggests a separate area of upstream convection may be ongoing or
will develop by midday across parts of south TX and the TX Gulf
Coast along and behind the composite outflow/cold front that will
surge southeast in TX on D1. With the fastest mid-level
southwesterlies expected to overlie the western to central Gulf
Coast during the first half of the period, supercells capable of
very large hail will be possible. This threat should be focused in a
narrow corridor along the TX Gulf Coast initially, and then develop
later in the afternoon to evening in the central Gulf Coast. Some of
this latter activity will have relatively greater potential for
tornado/wind threats, focused along the outflow in the wake of the
early-morning MCS. 

Additional isolated to scattered thunderstorm development should
occur within the post-frontal/outflow air mass centered on parts of
the Red River Valley and in south-central TX near the Rio Grande.
This activity will likely be aided by the embedded low-amplitude
impulses within the southern-stream shortwave trough. Residual
buoyancy should be adequate for an isolated hail/wind threat amid
more muted deep-layer shear closer to the trough axis.

...Northern Great Plains...
A vigorous, northern-stream shortwave trough will move across the
northern Rockies into the Prairie Provinces and adjacent parts of
MT/ND through early Saturday. Primary surface cyclone will occlude
over SK/MB, with secondary cyclogenesis occurring near the SD/WY/MT
border area along the trailing Pacific cold front. With only
modified moisture return ahead of the front, MLCAPE will remain
rather weak. Initial convective development will probably occur
within the post-frontal upslope flow regime during the early to mid
afternoon. This activity should spread east and likely expand during
the late afternoon into the evening. With deeply mixed thermodynamic
profiles ahead of the front, and steep lapse rates being maintained
behind it, high-based thunderstorms with amalgamating outflows are
expected. While the bulk of strong 700-500 mb westerlies will lag
behind the front, the strengthening flow should support a threat for
strong to isolated severe surface gusts before convection wanes
after dusk.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Thu May 16 2024

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

...1700Z Update...
A cold front has moved through most of the Permian Basin this
morning, with a dryline already pushing eastward into the lower
Trans Pecos and Big Bend region. This eastward moving trend of the
dryline will continue through afternoon as mostly clear skies allow
for good to excellent mixing conditions. Very warm afternoon
temperatures from the Davis Mountains southward into the Big Bend,
along with dewpoints in the upper teens to low 20s, will result in
RH dropping as low as the single digits. West to northwest sustained
15-20 mph winds are still anticipated, with localized Critical
sustained winds of 20-25 mph later this afternoon near and south of
the Davis Mountains. The only minor change to the Elevated area was
to eliminate a small portion of the northern extent based on the
current position of the cold front and its slow progression to the
south throughout the afternoon.

..Barnes/Nauslar.. 05/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0121 AM CDT Thu May 16 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the southern Plains as a weak
surface low develops near the Rio Grande today. Behind the low,
isallobaric and downslope northwesterly flow will overspread the
Trans Pecos region of Texas during the afternoon. 15+ mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds will coincide with 10-20 percent RH and
dry fuels, warranting the continuation of Elevated highlights.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1133 AM CDT Thu May 16 2024

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO EARLY TONIGHT FROM CENTRAL/SOUTHEAST TX INTO SOUTHWEST LA...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of large hail and damaging winds are expected
to increase across parts of central/southeastern Texas into
southwest Louisiana this afternoon into tonight. A couple of
tornadoes are also possible.

...Central TX to southern LA through tonight...
Multiple clusters of thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across
north and central TX, generally along and to the immediate cool side
of a composite outflow boundary.  Rich low-level moisture (100 mb
mean mixing ratios 16-18 g/kg), steep midlevel lapse rates of 8-9
C/km and large buoyancy (MLCAPE near or above 3000 J/kg) are present
south of the storms, along with sufficient deep-layer shear for
organized clusters/supercells.  Thus, some upscale growth and
increased storm organization is expected from late morning into the
afternoon, as storms move east-southeastward along the
moisture/buoyancy gradient across central and southeast TX. 
Damaging wind of 60-75 mph will be possible with embedded bowing
segments, while isolated very large hail will be possible with
supercells on the south flank of the larger storm cluster(s).  A
couple of tornadoes will also be possible with embedded circulations
and/or favorable storm interactions near or south of the composite
outflow boundary.  One or more clusters/bowing segments could
persist into tonight across southern LA.

Other storms will likely form immediately ahead of the primary
shortwave trough moving from southern NM toward west TX.  Given the
ongoing reinforcement of the rain-cooled air mass, any convection
this afternoon from the Permian Basin into the Edwards Plateau will
likely be elevated atop the outflow spreading southwestward.  Wind
profiles will favor supercells, with the primary threat of large
hail.

...Elsewhere...
No substantial changes to the low-end severe threats in the MRGL
areas across the Ozarks, WI, and southeast FL.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 248
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1050 AM CDT Thu May 16 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central Texas

* Effective this Thursday morning and afternoon from 1050 AM
  until 500 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Clusters of storms, including both supercells and bowing
segments, are expected to continue to increase in coverage and
intensify into the afternoon, mainly along and south of an outflow
boundary that continues to move southward.  Damaging winds of 60-70
mph will be the most common threat, though any more
discrete/supercell storms could produce large hail of 1-2 inches in
diameter.  An isolated tornado or two could also occur with
favorable storm/boundary interactions.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles north and south of a line from 60 miles north
northwest of Junction TX to 50 miles southeast of Temple TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean storm motion vector
29030.

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
CENTRAL/EASTERN TEXAS TO SOUTHWEST LOUISIANA...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of large hail and damaging winds are expected
to increase across parts of central and southeastern Texas this
afternoon into tonight. A couple of tornadoes are also possible, and
an organized cluster of storms might eventually evolve, accompanied
by a more substantive risk for damaging wind gusts.

...Texas/Louisiana to Lower Mississippi Valley...
Initially, a small but well-organized cluster of storms is moving
southeastward across North Texas early this morning. These initially
elevated storms should grow further upscale and intensify into the
afternoon, owing to the diurnal destabilization trends and the
progressive interaction with a northward advance of richer low-level
moisture via a northward-shifting maritime warm front out of south
Texas this morning.

An evolving post-frontal upslope regime and stronger/differential
heating will likely also aid additional peripheral deep convective
development this afternoon from portions of the Pecos and Rio Grande
Valleys into central Texas. This is where MLCAPE may reach 2000-4000
J/kg beneath relatively strong southwesterly mid/high-level flow.
Deep-layer shear will be supportive of supercells, aided by veering
with height of initially modest low-level wind fields, which are
forecast to strengthen by this evening across central into
southeastern Texas.

Large hail and locally damaging wind gusts appear the primary severe
threat with initial east-southeastward propagating supercells by
late afternoon. As low-level hodographs enlarge, the risk for a
couple of tornadoes may increase by this evening in both lingering
supercells and upscale-growing convection. At least one prominent
cluster may gradually evolve and organize across central into
southeastern Texas by evening, accompanied by increasing potential
for damaging wind gusts. These storms may persist eastward into
Louisiana and other areas of the Gulf Coast through late tonight as
the near-coastal boundary shifts northward.

...Ozarks/Middle Mississippi Valley...
Potentially aided by a weak MCV, a sizable cluster/corridor of
thunderstorms is ongoing across the Ozarks early this morning. This
convection and related cloud cover will largely tend to hinder warm
sector destabilization. However, stronger heating/moderate
destabilization could eventually occur later this afternoon on the
southern fringe of these remnants. Scattered thunderstorms would
likely redevelop and intensify by late afternoon. A belt of
moderately strong mid-level westerlies (45+ kt) would support some
supercells and more prevalent multicells, with the potential for
large hail and damaging winds, and possibly a tornado.

...Parts of Wisconsin/northern Illinois/eastern Iowa...
Preceding a shortwave trough overspreading Minnesota toward Lake
Superior, a semi-moist warm sector, with upper 50s/some lower 60s F
surface dewpoints, will become established ahead of an
east/southeast-moving cold front. Thunderstorms should
develop/intensify this afternoon to the south-southwest of residual
early day precipitation and cloud cover, with MLCAPE potentially
exceeding 1000 J/kg. Low/mid-tropospheric winds will remain somewhat
weak, but enough to support multicells potentially capable of hail
and locally damaging winds.

...Southern Florida...
Although the primary mid-level wave and associated convection has
shifted eastward offshore, thunderstorms may redevelop and intensify
through the diurnal heating cycle along/south of the residual front,
enhanced by the east coast sea breeze. Even as mid-level heights
begin to rise, mid-level temperatures will remain cool (-10 to -11C
at 500 mb) with steep mid-level lapse rates, in the presence of
strong deep-layer wind profiles. While any severe storms should
remain isolated, these profiles could support a supercell or two and
sustained multicells capable of large hail and locally damaging
winds, especially across the southeast Florida Peninsula.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152001Z - 152130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Watch possible this afternoon as potential for damaging
winds and large hail increases.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite shows areas of cu developing across
portions of eastern New Mexico into the Texas and Oklahoma
Panhandles. Trends in CAM guidance and morning/afternoon WoFS runs
show medium confidence in storm initiation across the Texas
Panhandle by 20-21z. Temperatures are in the mid to upper 80s with
steep mid-level lapse rates around 8.5-9 C/km. Surface objective
analysis shows MLCAPE around 1000-2000 J/kg from the Texas Panhandle
into western Oklahoma with mid-level capping remaining, though
surface temperatures in the mid 80s should remove the cap per the
19z AMA sounding. High-based convection will initially pose a risk
of severe winds, given deeply mixed profiles and large dew point
depressions. A watch may be needed prior to 21z.

0224 PM CDT Wed May 15 2024

Areas affected...Portions of southern NC into SC

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 245...

Valid 151924Z - 152130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 245
continues.

SUMMARY...Scattered damaging winds and severe hail should occur with
thunderstorms moving eastward across parts of southern North
Carolina into South Carolina this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Multiple thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
along/near a surface front that remains draped across parts of
western/southern NC, near the SC border. Marginally severe hail has
occurred with some of this initially more discrete activity. Recent
tendency has been for some clustering to occur near the boundary in
southern NC. The threat for scattered damaging winds should increase
as these small clusters spread eastward over the next couple of
hours, as low-level lapse rates continue to steepen with diurnal
heating amid low/mid-level westerly winds gradually strengthening
with height. Farther south into SC, a more isolated/cellular mode
amid 35-40 kt of deep-layer shear should support a continued threat
for severe hail, along with occasional strong/damaging winds.

## SPC May 15, 2024 2000 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0242 PM CDT Wed May 15 2024

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE TX
PANHANDLE INTO NORTHWEST OK AND SOUTH KS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN SC AND SOUTHERN
NC...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across the southern Plains this
afternoon and evening, accompanied by severe wind gusts, large hail,
and perhaps a tornado or two. Scattered severe thunderstorms are
also possible into early evening across parts of the Carolinas.

...20Z Update...
Two appreciable changes were made to the outlook. First, the level
2-SLGT risk across FL has been removed in the wake of the primary
convective clusters having moved off the coast. Isolated
thunderstorms may redevelop this evening into tonight, so the level
1-MRGL risk has been maintained for now. The other adjustment was to
add a small 2 percent tornado area in southwest MN where an arc of
low-topped convection has developed ahead of a shortwave trough and
attendant surface cyclone in SD. A brief tornado remains possible
along the edge of mid 50s surface dew points where temperatures have
warmed into the middle 60s to low 70s. This potential should be
short-lived as the corridor of modest low-level SRH shifts
northeastward away from the meager buoyancy plume emanating north
from the Mid-MO Valley.

..Grams.. 05/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Wed May 15 2024/

...Carolinas this afternoon/evening...
Along and south of a slow moving front across southern NC, surface
heating in cloud breaks and boundary-layer dewpoints of 65-70 F are
contributing to MLCAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg and minimal convective
inhibition.  Thunderstorm development is expected by early afternoon
along/south of the front into the warm sector, in advance of
embedded perturbations rotating around the southeast periphery of a
midlevel trough approaching the southern Appalachians.  Mostly
straight hodographs with effective bulk shear of 35-50 kt will favor
a mix of organized clusters and/or supercells capable of producing
large hail of 1-1.75 inches in diameter and damaging winds of 60-70
mph.

...Central FL today...
Convection is ongoing along and north of a diffuse outflow boundary
across central FL, as well as upstream over the eastern Gulf of
Mexico.  VWPs from TBW/MLB/JAX show largely unidirectional,
west-southwesterly wind profiles with straight hodographs, in an
environment with MLCAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg.  Central FL will be along
the southern periphery of the southern Appalachians midlevel trough
with modest forcing for ascent near its peak this afternoon.  It
appears the strongest storms, which will include a mix of
supercells/clusters, will tend to remain along the southern fringe
of the ongoing convection, with more uncertainty farther north based
on more extensive cloud cover.  The strongest storms will be capable
of producing large hail up to 1.5 inches in diameter and 60-70 mph
outflow winds.

...Southern Plains this afternoon into tonight...
A shallow, moist boundary layer is returning to south TX, but areas
farther to the north will rely on residual low-level moisture and
evapotranspiration from moist soil and green vegetation to boost
boundary-layer dewpoints into the 50s/low 60s.  Weak perturbations
will move eastward from northern NM and CO toward the TX
Panhandle/northwest OK/KS, along a weak front from central KS to the
TX Panhandle.  Strong surface heating along and south of the front
will drive a deepening mixed layer, while there will be sufficient
moisture/steep midlevel lapse rates to support MLCAPE of 1000-2000
J/kg.  The moderate buoyancy and inverted-V profiles will favor
hybrid microbursts with severe outflow winds of 60-80 mph,
especially with any organized clusters/high-based supercells and
storm mergers.  Large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter will be
possible with any persistent supercells or favorable storm mergers. 
The tornado threat will be tempered by modest low-level moisture.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Wed May 15 2024

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...2000Z Update...
A few minor changes were made to the Day2 outlook to extend the
Elevated area through the Big Bend and lower Trans Pecos regions.
Westerly downslope flow is expected to increase tomorrow ahead of a
cold front west of the Pecos River valley. Locally sustained wind
speeds will approach or briefly exceed critical limits in and around
the Davis Mountains and Big Bend. A small critical area was
considered for these regions given deeply mixed forecast soundings.
However, relatively weak flow aloft (850-700 mb) and mid to upper
ascent accompanying a shortwave trough during the first half of the
day will preclude the addition of such for the time being.

..Barnes/Lyons.. 05/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Wed May 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the southern Plains tomorrow
(Thursday), encouraging a surface low to form over western TX, which
will shift northeastward during the day. Strong northwesterly
downslope flow behind the low will overspread the Trans Pecos region
of western Texas during the afternoon. Guidance consensus shows
15-20 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds overlapping 10-20
percent for several hours, necessitating the introduction of
Elevated highlights given the presence of dry fuels.

Mesoscale Discussion 0781
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0930 AM CDT Tue May 14 2024

Areas affected...Portions of the northern/central FL Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 141430Z - 141630Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A cluster of thunderstorms should approach the Tampa metro
and vicinity around 15-16Z (11 AM - Noon EDT), while posing a threat
for mainly damaging winds. New watch issuance is possible to address
this potential.

DISCUSSION...A loosely organized cluster of convection is ongoing
this morning over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Recent forward motion
of this activity suggests it should approach the FL Gulf Coast by
15-16Z. The 12Z sounding from TBW shows relatively cool mid-level
temperatures for FL (-10 C at 500 mb), along with steepened lapse
rates associated with an EML above 700 mb. But, there is still a
residual cap noted between 800-700 mb, which may tend to limit
updraft intensity over land in the short term. Recent surface
observations and visible satellite imagery also show strong
thunderstorms have developed along trailing outflow from earlier
convection across the north-central FL Peninsula. As robust daytime
heating of a very moist low-level airmass continues along/south of
this boundary, lingering MLCIN should gradually erode. Around
2000-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE will conditionally support intense
updrafts, with sufficiently strong mid-level westerly flow and
related deep-layer shear also fostering organized convection.

Thunderstorm evolution through the afternoon remains somewhat
unclear, as recent IR satellite trends show warming cloud tops with
the eastern Gulf convection. There is still some chance that strong
to severe thunderstorms consolidate along the outflow boundary over
the next couple of hours, and continue spreading eastward across the
central FL Peninsula this afternoon. If this scenario materializes,
then scattered damaging winds around 50-70 mph would likely be the
main threat as low-level lapse rates continue to steepen. A brief
tornado or two may also occur, although low-level flow has had a
tendency to veer to southwesterly this morning per latest VWPs from
KTBW, which has reduced 0-1 km SRH. Marginally severe hail also
appears possible with the more robust updrafts. It remains unclear
whether a new watch will be needed, but observational trends will be
closely monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0764
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0900 AM CDT Mon May 13 2024

Areas affected...Portions of coastal MS/AL into the western FL
Panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 234...

Valid 131400Z - 131530Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 234
continues.

SUMMARY...A greater threat for severe/damaging winds should focus
along the Mississippi/Alabama Coast into the western Florida
Panhandle this morning.

DISCUSSION...A small bowing cluster is ongoing over southern/coastal
AL this morning. A warm front is draped east-southeastward across
southern AL into the western FL Panhandle based on latest surface
observations. Recent velocity data from KMOB show strong inbound
velocities at low levels. A greater threat for severe/damaging winds
should be focused along and south of the warm front into parts of
the western FL Panhandle, where there will be a better likelihood
for downdraft winds to reach the surface. Enhanced low-level flow
and strong boundary-layer shear noted on recent VWPs from KMOB may
also support some threat for an embedded tornado.

Mesoscale Discussion 0763
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0833 AM CDT Mon May 13 2024

Areas affected...Portions of south-central TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 131333Z - 131530Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The threat for very large hail and damaging winds should
continue to increase this morning. Watch issuance is likely.

DISCUSSION...The 12Z sounding from DRT shows rich low-level moisture
beneath steep mid-level lapse rates, with resulting MUCAPE
approaching 4000 J/kg. Strong deep-layer shear of 50-60 kt will
easily support supercell structures, and multiple thunderstorms have
already developed near Eagle Pass TX with a weak mid-level
perturbation ejecting from northern Mexico across TX. Current
expectations are for this ongoing activity to gradually spread
eastward across south-central TX this morning, while posing a threat
for very large hail (around 2-3 inches in diameter) with any
sustained supercells. Occasional severe/damaging downdraft winds may
also occur as low-level lapse rates gradually steepen with filtered
daytime heating. Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance will likely be
needed to address the increasing threat for very large hail this
morning.
