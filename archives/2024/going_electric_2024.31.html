The world (and life) moves fast and we humans can only do enough in our
lives to keep up with it as best we can. One growing aspect that many
are trying to find solutions to in the modern world is how to get to all
our daily appointments – work, school, social events – in the most
affordable and environmentally conscious way. While EVs are certainly
the best current answer to the growing questions, they can often fall
outside of reach for many due to costs. Solution: conversion kits, like
<a href="https://clip.bike/products/clip?variant=43939127525632">the
CLIP</a>, which boasts the title of “the world’s first &amp; only
plug-and-play e-bike upgrade.” While many existing kits fall into the
category of mountable hub motors, this device, on the other hand, uses
inventive new ideas by building upon decades-old technology. That’s why
I was absolutely giddy when I was first approached to test out
<a href="https://clip.bike/products/clip?variant=43939127525632">the
CLIP</a> and visit the office here in NYC. You can continue reading
below to get my hands-on impressions of this ingenious new device – and
be sure to check out the short video of my ride too!

Ever since the federal government
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/08/07/the-new-climate-bill-abandoned-the-type-of-electric-vehicle-that-can-make-the-biggest-difference/">gave
up on including electric bikes</a> in its broader electric vehicle
incentive programs, alternative incentives at the local and state levels
have been met largely with success—except, of course, in California. In
stark contrast to most other incentive programs around the US,
California’s partially developed program has spent years in shambles
with no apparent launch date in sight.

<p>
Here’s how California screwed the pooch so badly with its own
state-sponsored electric bicycle incentive program.

In today’s massive new episode of <em>Quick Charge</em>, Tesla issues a
massive 1.8 million EV recall to keep their hoods from flying open,
Liebherr puts out a massive, 264-ton electric haul truck, and a massive
2.2 MW wind farm gets one step closer to reality.

<p>
Part of positive EV ownership is having a convenient home charging
solution. While public charging stations are great for travel, home
charging is both a time and cost savings. The
<a href="https://getneocharge.com/products/neocharge-smart-splitter">NeoCharge
Smart Splitter</a> has been key for making home EV charging smooth for
me.
</p>
<p>
Adding a second 240V outlet to my house as a renter is a tall order.
Continually swapping the dryer plug and mobile charging plug is
inconvenient and ill-advised. The Smart Splitter solves both those
problems easily and affordably.

<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/byd/">BYD</a> is best known for its
low-cost electric cars, but that hasn’t stopped the Chinese EV maker
from taking on new markets. Its latest: luxury electric supercars. BYD’s
first electric supercar, the Yangwang U9, has entered production ahead
of deliveries later this summer.

I love getting the chance to see and test new and innovative designs in
the world of micromobility, especially since many of the repetitive
designs we so often see turn out to be cookie-cutter rehashes of other
models. But the designers of the

definitely went in a new direction, creating something innovative and

The Kandi Mini is unlike any other golf cart in the world in two key
ways. First, it’s less than half the price of your average golf cart.
And second, it’s a lot more compact than your average golf cart.

<p>
Both of these are key features for folks who have become golf cart
curious but don’t have the space in their garages or their wallets for a
new full-size cart.
