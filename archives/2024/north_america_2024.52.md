## Big Tech Will Rule the Grid in 2025

Will the clean energy tax credits survive? What about advanced manufacturing? Or will it just be the electric vehicle credits that get tossed aside?</p><p>In any case, one thing seems far closer to certain: Big companies, especially large technology companies, will continue to buy renewable and clean power to fulfill their own sustainability goals and keep up their massively expanding data center operations. For them, speed may be the thing that matters most, and reasonable costs and carbon abatement will have to come along with it.</p><p>From 2025 to 2028, Morgan Stanley estimates that there will be 57 gigawatts worth of demand from new data centers, with around 6 gigawatts of that currently under construction, and a substantial shortfall in available power to build everything hyperscale technology companies want. This means that there will be a huge need to buy power, no matter the tax credit situation, which would mean continued upward pressure on prices.</p><p>Even before the election, power purchase agreement prices for solar power were creeping up due to <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/solar-tariffs-us-china" target="_self"><u>tariffs on solar equipment</u></a>, according to LevelTen Energy. Those will likely be maintained and could be ramped up in the new administration.</p><p>“Repeal of the tech neutral tax credits and of the manufacturing production tax credits has the potential to increase PPA prices by almost 40%,” Nidhi Thakar, the senior vice president for policy of the Clean Energy Buyers Association, told me, referring to two of the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/clean-electricity-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>most</u></a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-ira-tax-credit-45x" target="_self"><u>powerful</u></a> provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. She added that repeal would “essentially have an inflationary effect.”</p><p>“We have this opportunity right now to capture that economic development if we do things right,” Thakar said. “That is going to require having critical policies in place that are going to support the deployment of more clean firm resources on the grid.”</p><p>At least so far, the prospect of repeal has not slowed energy procurement among the biggest buyers. This month, <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/google-exxon-gas" target="_self"><u>Alphabet announced a $20 billion investment plan</u></a> with Intersect Power and TPG to build carbon-free power near datacenters with the hope of bringing power and data centers online more quickly. Meta, meanwhile, announced earlier in December that it would build a $10 billion data center campus in Northeast Louisiana, complete with gas and renewable power provided by Entergy, the local utility. The project will come with “at least” 1.5 gigawatts of new renewable power, Entergy said; it also filed an application with the Louisiana utilities regulator for over 2 gigawatts of new gas-fired power plants, including two plants adjacent to the data center site, <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/entergy-s-status-as-one-stop-shop-helped-lure-massive-meta-deal-8211-ceo-86677258" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to S&P Global Commodities Insights</u></a>.</p><p>While a “double digit” increase in power purchase agreement sale prices could result from tax credits vanishing, there is still “more demand for renewable energy than supply for a whole bunch of reasons,” Peter Freed, the former director of energy strategy at Meta and the founding director of the consultancy Near Horizon Group, told me.</p><p>“Obviously the tax credits are pretty central to the pricing on projects,” he said.</p><p>Freed was enthusiastic about grid technologies that could enhance capacity, but he also acknowledged “it is very likely we’re going to have a variety of compromises that have to be made over the course of next seven, eight, nine years, in terms of how we’re going to accommodate load that’s coming in the cleanest possible way.”</p><p>“That probably means we’re seeing more gas built,” he added.<br/></p><p>A significant portion of that gas could be built on-site. Anything involving the grid — whether fossil or renewable — involves large investments of cash and time for hyperscalers and developers. “Given the increasing time required to connect to power grids, especially in the U.S., we believe there could be more upcoming ‘off grid’ approaches to powering data centers,” Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd wrote in a note to clients. “Batteries and smaller gas-fired turbines could be combined with large combined cycle natural gas turbines to provide a robust power source.”</p><p>Elon Musk’s xAI has done this the <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/elon-musks-xai-data-center-adding-to-memphis-air-quality-problems-campaign-group/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quick-and-dirty way</u></a> by installing mobile natural gas generators to power its facility in Memphis. GE Vernova, the turbine manufacturer, is also “having direct conversations with hyperscalers for gas orders,” according to Jefferies analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith in a note to clients, with the first order from a hyperscaler possibly coming in the second half of next year.</p><p>Gas isn’t the only answer, however — at least not on its own. A group of energy researchers from Stripe, Paces, and Scale Microgrids, wrote in a white paper published mid-December saying that solar microgrids could provide a “<a href="https://www.offgridai.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fast, scalable, clean, and cheap enough</u></a>” option for data center power.</p><p>These “off-grid solar microgrids” could potentially be put into operation in “around two years” and would combine solar panels, batteries, and some natural gas backup. Installed across the Southwest, they would be able to power some 1,200 gigawatts of data center demand with 90% solar power, <a href="https://x.com/duncan__c/status/1869428063261573175" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to Scale Microgrids’ Duncan Campbell</u></a>, at costs below repowering Three Mile Island. A 44% solar system would be “essentially the same cost” as off-grid gas turbines, the whitepaper said.</p><p>No matter what solution hyperscalers pursue — bringing their own power behind the grid, locating near power on the grid, or building out more clean, firm power on local grids — the question will ultimately always be how fast they can get online.</p><p>“I think people are initially thinking about colocating a large load with a project — renewable, gas, or anything else — as a fact track to getting load online, and there’s some truth to that,” Freed told me.</p><p>“My perspective as someone who is adding new load is that you should be indifferent to location for generation,” Freed said. “What you really should be caring about is when you can interconnect and turn lights on at the scale you desire.”</p>

## Richard Parsons, prominent Black executive at Time Warner, Citigroup, dies at 76

date: 2024-12-27, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Richard Parsons, one of corporate America's most prominent Black executives who held top posts at Time Warner and Citigroup, died Thursday. He was 76. 


Parsons, who died at his Manhattan home, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2015 and cited "unanticipated complications" from the disease for cutting back on work a few years later. 


The financial services company Lazard, where Parsons was a longtime board member, confirmed his death. 


David Zaslav, the president and CEO of Time Warner successor Warner Bros. Discovery, remembered Parsons as a "great mentor and friend" and a "tough and brilliant negotiator, always looking to create something where both sides win." 


"All who got a chance to work with him and know him saw that unusual combination of great leadership with integrity and kindness," Zaslav said, calling him "one of the great problem solvers this industry has ever seen." 


Parsons' friend Ronald Lauder told The New York Times that the cause of death was cancer. Parsons stepped down on December 3 from the boards of Lazard and Lauder's company, Estee Lauder, citing health reasons. He had been on Estee Lauder's board for 25 years. 




Parsons, a Brooklyn native who started college at 16, was named chairman of Citigroup in 2009, one month after leaving Time Warner Inc., where he helped restore the company's stature following its much-maligned acquisition by internet provider America Online Inc. 


He steered Citigroup back to profit after financial turmoil from the subprime mortgage crisis, which upended the economy in 2007 and 2008. 


Parsons was named to the board of CBS in September 2018 but resigned a month later because of illness. 


"Dick's storied career embodied the finest traditions of American business leadership," Lazard said in a statement. The company, where Parsons was a board member from 2012 until this month, praised his "unmistakable intelligence and his irresistible warmth." 


"Dick was more than an iconic leader in Lazard's history — he was a testament to how wisdom, warmth, and unwavering judgment could shape not just companies, but people's lives," the company said. "His legacy lives on in the countless leaders he counseled, the institutions he renewed, and the doors he opened for others." 


Parsons was known as a skilled negotiator, a diplomat and a crisis manager. 


Although he was with Time Warner through its difficulties with AOL, he earned respect for the company and rebuilt its relations with Wall Street. He streamlined Time Warner's structure, pared debt and sold Warner Music Group and a book publishing division. 


He also fended off a challenge from activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006 to break up the company and helped Time Warner reach settlements with investors and regulators over questionable accounting practices at AOL. 




Parsons joined Time Warner as president in 1995 after serving as chairman and chief executive of Dime Bancorp Inc., one of the largest U.S. thrift institutions. 


In 2001, after AOL used its fortunes as the leading provider of internet access in the U.S. to buy Time Warner for $106 billion in stock, Parsons became co-chief operating officer with AOL executive Robert Pittman. 


Parsons became CEO in 2002 and was named chairman the following year, replacing AOL founder Steve Case, who had also championed the combination. 


The newly formed company's internet division quickly became a drag on Time Warner. The promised synergies between traditional and new media never materialized. AOL began seeing a reduction in subscribers in 2002 as Americans replaced dial-up connections with broadband from cable TV and phone companies. 


Parsons stepped down as CEO in 2007 and as chairman in 2008. A year later AOL split from Time Warner and began trading as a separate company. 


A board member of Citigroup and its predecessor, Citibank, since 1996, Parsons was named chairman in 2009 at a time of turmoil for the financial institution. Citigroup had suffered five straight quarters of losses and received $45 billion in government aid. Its board had been criticized for allowing the bank to invest so heavily in the risky housing market. 


Parsons, a Republican, previously worked as a lawyer for Nelson Rockefeller, a former Republican governor of New York, and in Gerald Ford's White House. Those early stints gave him grounding in politics and negotiations. He also was an economic adviser on President Barack Obama's transition team. 


Parsons, whose love of jazz led to co-owning a Harlem jazz club, served as chairman of the Apollo Theater and the Jazz Foundation of America. He held positions on the boards of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. 


Parsons played basketball at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and received his law degree from Albany Law School in 1971. He is survived by his wife, Laura, and their family.

## Bird flu virus shows mutations in first severe human case in US, agency says

date: 2024-12-27, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday its analysis of samples from the first severe case of bird flu in the country last week showed mutations not seen in samples from an infected backyard flock on the patient's property.


The CDC said the patient's sample showed mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, the part of the virus that plays a key role in it attaching to host cells.


The health body said the risk to the public from the outbreak has not changed and remains low.


Last week, the United States reported its first severe case of the virus, in a Louisiana resident above the age of 65, who was suffering from severe respiratory illness.


The patient was infected with the D1.1 genotype of the virus that was recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the United States, and not the B3.13 genotype detected in dairy cows, human cases and some poultry in multiple states.


The mutations seen in the patient are rare but have been reported in some cases in other countries and most often during severe infections. One of the mutations was also seen in another severe case from British Columbia, Canada.


No transmission from the patient in Louisiana to other persons has been identified, the CDC said.

## US Congress fails to extend North Korean Human Rights Act

date: 2024-12-27, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Congress once again failed to pass a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the North Korean Human Rights Act, or NKHRA, painting a bleak picture for the future of the measure originally adopted by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2004 to ensure the U.S. continues to promote basic freedoms of speech, press and religion in North Korea.


Last Friday, the Congress ended its 118th session at midnight without the Senate approving the extension of the NKHRA, which expired at the end of September 2022.


The bill to extend the NKHRA was not even brought to the floor at the Senate this year, as the lawmakers were more focused on other issues, including averting a government shutdown.


The bill called for measures such as reuniting Korean Americans with their families in North Korea, appointing a special envoy for North Korean human rights issues and supporting U.S. broadcasting efforts in North Korea.


The 119th U.S. Congress starts next year, and the NKHRA reauthorization bill will have to be reintroduced at the new session and again go through a process of discussion, deliberation, changes and eventually voting.


Lawmakers vow to try again


It marks the first time since the NKHRA, became law that the reenactment bill has been dead for more than two years. Congress reapproved the measure three times, in 2008, 2012 and 2018.


Lawmakers vowed to work toward the reenactment of the NKHRA during the next congressional session.


Representative Young Kim, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific, said she was "extremely disappointed that the Senate failed to take up the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act." The House passed the bill last month.


"Kim Jong Un subjects his own people to gross human rights abuses as he grows his nuclear arsenal, and the Senate is turning a blind eye to North Korean aggression by failing to pass this bill," Kim said in an emailed statement to VOA Korean on Monday.



"This remains a top priority of mine," she stressed. "I will keep fighting to get this across the finish line to counter North Korea and promote U.S. leadership and values around the world."


The office of Representative Ami Bera, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific, said in an emailed statement to VOA Korean that Bera "looks forward to working with his Senate colleagues to pass this bipartisan legislation in the 119th Congress."


Kim and Bera led the bill in the House, while senators Marco Rubio and Tim Kaine introduced the Senate version of the bill.



VOA Korean reached out to Rubio's and Kaine's offices for comments but did not receive a reply.


VOA Korean also sought comment from the Permanent Mission of North Korea to the United Nations, but did not receive a response.


Competing priorities 


Human rights experts in Washington said getting the NKHRA passed in Congress is challenging because North Korean human rights must compete with other seemingly more urgent issues.


"It's very hard to — when you're competing with Gaza and Ukraine — to get people to focus on what's going on," said Robert King, who served as special envoy for North Korea human rights issues at the U.S. State Department from November 2009 to January 2017.


"The effort continues, and people are still concerned, and people still reflect the views that North Korea needs to make progress on human rights, but there's a lot of competition. There are a lot of other issues and concerns that are also important," King told VOA Korean on Tuesday by phone, adding that he doesn't see any skepticism among U.S. lawmakers about the effectiveness of the NKHRA.


Greg Scarlatoiu, president of the Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told VOA Korean in a Zoom interview Tuesday that the two-year absence of the NKHRA is "a matter of prioritizing other crises."


Scarlatoiu emphasized that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's monolithic power and pursuit of nuclear weapons have come at the cost of North Korean people's human rights.


"By means of oppressing and exploiting its own people at home and abroad, there is a clear nexus between human rights violations and the security challenges that North Korea poses to the world," he said.


Scarlatoiu also pointed out that the recent deployment of North Korean soldiers in Russia is clear evidence of the Kim regime's violation of human rights.


"Now, as unbelievable as that might have sounded two years ago, it poses a security threat to Europe, so this is a very, very urgent issue for the Congress," he said.



South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday there are indications that North Korea is preparing to send more troops and weapons to support Russia's war effort in Ukraine. North Korea so far has sent about 12,000 troops to Russia, according to South Korea, the United States and Ukraine.




North Korean defectors say Pyongyang has likely kept the deployment of that nation's soldiers secret from its own people, including the soldiers' families.




A State Department spokesperson declined to comment in response to VOA Korean's inquiry about Congress' failure to pass the bill.


"As a general matter, we do not comment on pending legislation," the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.


The State Department maintains, however, that North Korea is one of the most repressive regimes in the world.



"The DPRK [North Korea] is among the most repressive authoritarian states in the world. Its human rights situation is deplorable," a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to VOA Korean on October 15, after North Korea criticized the U.S. in its annual Universal Periodic Review, a process through which each United Nations member state undergoes a peer review of its human rights records.

## US says it pushed retraction of famine warning for north Gaza

date: 2024-12-27, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A lead organization monitoring for food crises around the world withdrew a new report this week warning of imminent famine in north Gaza under what it called Israel's "near-total blockade," after the U.S. asked for its retraction, U.S. officials told The Associated Press. The move follows public criticism of the report from the U.S. ambassador to Israel.


The rare public challenge from the Biden administration of the work of the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning System, which is meant to reflect the data-driven analysis of unbiased experts, drew accusations from aid and human-rights figures of possible U.S. political interference. A finding of famine would be a rebuke of close U.S. ally Israel, which has insisted that its 15-month war in Gaza is aimed against the Hamas militant group and not against its civilian population.


U.S. ambassador to Israel Jacob Lew earlier this week called the warning by the internationally recognized group inaccurate and "irresponsible." Lew and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which funds the monitoring group, both said the findings failed to properly account for rapidly changing circumstances in north Gaza.


The U.S. Embassy in Israel and the State Department declined comment. FEWS confirmed Thursday it had retracted its famine warning, and said it expected to re-release the report in January with updated data and analysis. The group declined further comment.


"We work day and night with the U.N. and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible," Lew said Tuesday.


USAID confirmed to the AP that it had asked the famine-monitoring organization to withdraw its stepped-up warning of imminent famine, issued in a report dated Monday.


The dispute points in part to the difficulty of assessing the extent of starvation in largely isolated northern Gaza, where thousands in recent weeks have fled an intensified Israeli military crackdown that aid groups say has allowed delivery of only a dozen trucks of food and water since roughly October.


FEWS Net said in its withdrawn report that unless Israel changes its policy, it expects the number of people dying of starvation and related ailments in north Gaza to reach between two and 15 per day sometime between January and March.


The internationally recognized mortality threshold for famine is two or more deaths a day per 10,000 people.




FEWS was created by the U.S. development agency in the 1980s and is still funded by it. But it is intended to provide independent, neutral and data-driven assessments of hunger crises, including in war zones. Its findings help guide decisions on aid by the U.S. and other governments and agencies around the world.


A spokesperson for Israel's foreign ministry, Oren Marmorstein, welcomed the U.S. ambassador's public challenge of the famine warning. "FEWS NET - Stop spreading these lies!" Marmorstein said on X.


In challenging the findings publicly, the U.S. ambassador "leveraged his political power to undermine the work of this expert agency," said Scott Paul, a senior manager at the Oxfam America humanitarian nonprofit. Paul stressed that he was not weighing in on the accuracy of the data or methodology of the report.


"The whole point of creating FEWS is to have a group of experts make assessments about imminent famine that are untainted by political considerations," said Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch and now a visiting professor in international affairs at Princeton University. "It sure looks like USAID is allowing political considerations -- the Biden administration's worry about funding Israel's starvation strategy -- to interfere."


Israel says it has been operating in recent months against Hamas militants still active in northern Gaza. It says the vast majority of the area's residents have fled and relocated to Gaza City, where most aid destined for the north is delivered. But some critics, including a former defense minister, have accused Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing in Gaza's far north, near the Israeli border.


North Gaza has been one of the areas hardest-hit by fighting and Israel's restrictions on aid throughout its war with Hamas militants. Global famine monitors and U.N. and U.S. officials have warned repeatedly of the imminent risk of malnutrition and deaths from starvation hitting famine levels.


International officials say Israel last summer increased the amount of aid it was admitting there, under U.S. pressure. The U.S. and U.N. have said Gaza's people as a whole need between 350 and 500 trucks a day of food and other vital needs.


But the U.N. and aid groups say Israel recently has again blocked almost all aid to that part of Gaza. Cindy McCain, the American head of the U.N. World Food Program, called earlier this month for political pressure to get food flowing to Palestinians there.


Israel says it places no restrictions on aid entering Gaza and that hundreds of truckloads of goods are piled up at Gaza's crossings and accused international aid agencies of failing to deliver the supplies. The U.N. and other aid groups say Israeli restrictions, ongoing combat, looting and insufficient security by Israeli troops make it impossible to deliver aid effectively.


Lew, the U.S. ambassador, said the famine warning was based on "outdated and inaccurate" data. He pointed to uncertainty over how many of the 65,000-75,000 people remaining in northern Gaza had fled in recent weeks, saying that skewed the findings.


FEWS said in its report that its famine assessment holds even if as few as 10,000 people remain.


USAID in its statement to AP said it had reviewed the report before it became public, and noted "discrepancies" in population estimates and some other data. The U.S. agency had asked the famine warning group to address those uncertainties and be clear in its final report to reflect how those uncertainties affected its predictions of famine, it said.


"This was relayed before Ambassador Lew's statement," USAID said in a statement. "FEWS NET did not resolve any of these concerns and published in spite of these technical comments and a request for substantive engagement before publication. As such, USAID asked to retract the report."


Roth criticized the U.S. challenge of the report in light of the gravity of the crisis there.


"This quibbling over the number of people desperate for food seems a politicized diversion from the fact that the Israeli government is blocking virtually all food from getting in," he said, adding that "the Biden administration seems to be closing its eyes to that reality, but putting its head in the sand won't feed anyone."


The U.S., Israel's main backer, provided a record amount of military support in the first year of the war. At the same time, the Biden administration repeatedly urged Israel to allow more access to aid deliveries in Gaza overall, and warned that failing to do so could trigger U.S. restrictions on military support. The administration recently said Israel was making improvements and declined to carry out its threat of restrictions.


Military support for Israel's war in Gaza is politically charged in the U.S., with Republicans and some Democrats staunchly opposed any effort to limit U.S. support over the suffering of Palestinian civilians trapped in the conflict. The Biden administration's reluctance to do more to press Israel for improved treatment of civilians undercut support for Democrats in last month's elections.

## Panama president rules out talks with Trump over canal threat

date: 2024-12-26, from: VOA News USA

PANAMA CITY, PANAMA — Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday ruled out negotiations with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump over control of the Panama Canal, denying that China was interfering in its operation.


Mulino also rejected the possibility of reducing tolls for U.S. vessels in response to Trump's threat to demand control of the vital waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans be returned to Washington.


"There's nothing to talk about," Mulino said at a press conference.


"The canal is Panamanian and belongs to Panamanians. There's no possibility of opening any kind of conversation around this reality, which has cost the country blood, sweat and tears," he added.


The canal, inaugurated in 1914, was built by the United States but handed to Panama on December 31, 1999, under treaties signed some two decades earlier by then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian nationalist leader Omar Torrijos.


Trump on Saturday slammed what he called "ridiculous" fees for U.S. ships passing through the canal and hinted at China's growing influence.


"It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. "We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!"


If Panama could not ensure "the secure, efficient and reliable operation" of the channel, "then we will demand that the Panama Canal be No Chinese returned to us, in full, and without question," he said.


US accounts for 74% of canal cargo


An estimated 5% of global maritime traffic passes through the Panama Canal, which allows ships traveling between Asia and the U.S. East Coast to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America.


The United States is its main user, accounting for 74% of cargo, followed by China with 21%.


Mulino said the canal's usage fees were "not set at the whim of the president or the administrator" of the interoceanic waterway, but under a long-established "public and open process."


"There is absolutely no Chinese interference or participation in anything to do with the Panama Canal," Mulino said.


Trump claims Chinese operate canal


On Wednesday, Trump alleged on Truth Social, without evidence, that Chinese soldiers were "lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal."


Mulino denied that allegation.


"There are no Chinese soldiers in the canal, for the love of God," he said.


Panama established diplomatic relations with China in 2017, after breaking off ties with Taiwan — a decision criticized by Trump's first administration.

## Taiwan seeks clarity on Trump team policy amid Chinese pressure

date: 2024-12-26, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As the world prepares for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Taiwan finds itself sandwiched between Washington and Beijing as it grapples with uncertainties about the outlook of U.S.-Taiwan relations and growing military pressure from China.


Trump has already picked several politicians known for their hawkish stances on China as potential nominees for his Cabinet, including Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, but analysts say the president-elect's comments about Taiwan on the campaign trail and in recent interviews have not offered much clarity about how he might handle one of Washington’s most delicate relationships.


“We don't know if [Trump] means it when he wants to return the United States to a more isolationist position,” said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with the Global Taiwan Institute.


During an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in July, Trump said Taiwan should pay the United States for defense and compared U.S. military spending on Taiwan to an insurance policy.


“I know the people very well. Respect them greatly. They did take 100% of our chip business. I think Taiwan should pay us for defense,” he said.




In October, Trump pledged to impose additional tariffs on China if Beijing were to “go into Taiwan.”


“I would say: If you go into Taiwan, I'm sorry to do this, I'm going to tax you, at 150% to 200%,” the President-elect said during an interview with The Wall Street Journal.


In his first post-election interview with NBC News on Dec. 8, Trump didn’t publicly say whether the U.S. would militarily defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.


“I’d prefer that they don’t do it,” Trump said, adding that he has a “very good relationship” with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that the two have been communicating since last month’s election.


During his time in office, U.S. President Joe Biden has on multiple occasions said his administration would defend Taiwan if it was attacked.


Not panicking, but concerned


Some Taiwanese residents worry about what they describe as a lack of clarity from the Trump administration.


“I’m slightly concerned about how Trump’s return to the White House might affect relations between the U.S. and Taiwan because he always prioritizes U.S. interests, which makes it hard to predict how his administration might form their Taiwan policies,” Angel Chi, a 28-year-old medical worker, told VOA in a recent interview on the streets of Taipei.


Others say while Trump’s position on Taiwan seems uncertain, they do not think his administration will reduce support for Taipei.


“I still have faith in the U.S. democratic system because he can’t decide everything by himself,” Christine Chiu, a 42-year-old accountant, told VOA.


The strong bipartisan support for Taiwan in Congress and some potential Trump Cabinet members’ track records on foreign policy could prevent U.S.-Taiwan relations from undergoing major changes during Trump’s second term, experts said.


“I don’t think there is panic in Taipei because we dealt with this situation before and we have confidence in our congressional support in the U.S.,” said Lai I-Chung, president of The Prospect Foundation, a Taiwan-based think tank made up of academics and government officials.


“The mood [in Taiwan] is we will be careful and watchful about the development, but we are not panicking,” he told VOA in an interview in Taipei.


Taiwan-US relations


In recent weeks, Taiwan’s government has been reaching out to Republican congressional leaders and Trump’s transition team. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te spoke with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on the phone during his first overseas trip to the Pacific region in early December. On that trip, Lai had stopovers in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam.




Additionally, two senior national security officials from Taiwan traveled to the U.S. last week to meet members of Trump’s transition team, hoping to establish ties before next month’s inauguration, Reuters news agency reported last on Dec. 19.


Cole said there should be enough “institutional resistance” in the U.S. government to prevent longstanding policies toward Taiwan from being abruptly altered.


During a regular press conference on Dec. 6, China’s Foreign Ministry responded to a question on Lai’s stopover in Guam and Hawaii and said, “No one should underestimate the firm resolve, will and ability of the Chinese government and people to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity.”


China’s military pressure campaign


As Taiwan tries to deepen its engagement with U.S. officials and the incoming Trump administration, China has been increasing military pressure on the island throughout 2024.


Beijing has conducted two blockade-style military exercises around Taiwan since Lai took office in May.




Last week, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Beijing deployed the largest number of naval and coast guard vessels to regional waters in almost three decades.




Apart from military exercises, China has increased pressure on Taiwan through a range of what are called gray zone operations, measures that involve irregular tactics but stop short of combat.


China’s use of its coast guard to intimidate and test Taiwan is one example of those gray zone tactics.


Beijing has repeatedly sent coast guard vessels to patrol waters near Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands since February. Kinmen and Matsu are closer to China than they are to the main island of Taiwan.




The Prospect Foundation’s Lai said China has some coast guard vessels that are similar in size to naval destroyers, making it harder for Taiwan’s coast guard to respond proportionately.


“It would be difficult for Taiwan to [deploy] naval vessels against the Chinese coast guard, and when Taiwan responds by deploying its coast guard forces, the vessels are smaller ships [while] the Chinese coast guard vessels are as big as navy ships,” he told VOA.


Countering China


To counter the growing military pressure and gray zone operations from Beijing, Taiwan has incorporated more unscripted, real-combat drills into its annual military exercises.




The island has also increased its defense budget in recent years, which is set to reach a new high of $19.74 billion dollars in 2025.


This year, Taiwan’s government also established a committee to help strengthen the island’s civil defense capabilities.


Cole said Taiwan still faces challenges in that regard.


“There is still quite a bit of resistance not only within the security apparatus and armed forces, which don’t like the idea of involving citizens in defense, the opposition parties have also sought to derail [relevant] plans and fundings,” he told VOA.


What may come next depends on Taiwan’s actions and Beijing’s assessment of Trump’s policies toward the island after he takes office in January.

## Poll: Exhausted by political news, Americans are tuning out

date: 2024-12-26, from: VOA News USA

New York — As a Democrat who immersed himself in political news during the presidential campaign, Ziad Aunallah has much in common with many Americans since the election. He's tuned out. 


"People are mentally exhausted," said Aunallah, 45, of San Diego. "Everyone knows what is coming and we are just taking some time off." 


Television ratings — and now a new poll — clearly illustrate the phenomenon. About two-thirds of American adults say they have recently felt the need to limit media consumption about politics and government because of overload, according to the survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 


Smaller percentages of Americans are limiting their intake of news about overseas conflicts, the economy or climate change, the poll says. Politics stand out. 


Election news on CNN and MSNBC was taking up too much of Sam Gude's time before the election, said the 47-year-old electrician from Lincoln, Nebraska. "The last thing I want to watch right now is the interregnum," said Gude, a Democrat and no fan of President-elect Donald Trump. 


Poll finds more Democrats than Republicans stepping away from news 


The poll, conducted in early December, found that about 7 in 10 Democrats say they are stepping back from political news. The percentage isn't as high for Republicans, who have reason to celebrate Trump's victory. Still, about 6 in 10 Republicans say they've felt the need to take some time off too, and the share for independents is similar. 


The differences are far starker for the TV networks that have been consumed by political news. 


After election night through Dec. 13, the prime-time viewership of MSNBC was an average of 620,000, down 54% from the pre-election audience this year, the Nielsen company said. For the same time comparison, CNN's average of 405,000 viewers was down 45%. 


At Fox News Channel, a favorite news network for Trump fans, the post-election average of 2.68 million viewers is up 13%, Nielsen said. Since the election, 72% of the people watching one of those three cable networks in the evening were watching Fox News, compared to 53% prior to election day. 


A post-election slump for fans of the losing candidate is not a new trend for networks that have become heavily identified for a partisan audience. MSNBC had similar issues after Trump was elected in 2016. Same for Fox in 2020, although that was complicated by anger: many of its viewers were outraged then by the network's crucial election night call of Arizona for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, and sought alternatives. 


MSNBC had its own anger issues after several "Morning Joe" viewers became upset that hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski visited Trump shortly after his victory last month. Yet while the show's ratings are down 35% since Election Day, that's a smaller drop than the network's prime-time ratings. 


CNN points out that while it has been suffering in the television ratings, its streaming and digital ratings have been consistent. 


Will political interest rebound when Trump takes office? 


MSNBC can take some solace in history. In previous years, network ratings bounce back when the depression after an election loss lifts. When a new administration takes office, people who oppose it are frequently looking for a gathering place. 


"I'll be tuning back in once the clown show starts," Aunallah said. "You have no choice. Whether or not you want to hear it, it's happening. If you care about your country, you have no choice but to pay attention." 


But the ride may not be smooth. MSNBC's slide is steeper than it was in 2016; and there's some question about whether Trump opponents will want to be as engaged as they were during his first term. People are also unplugging from cable television in rates that are only getting more rapid, although MSNBC believes it has bucked this trend eating away at audiences before. 


The poll indicates that Americans want less talk about politics from public figures in general. After an election season where endorsements from celebrities like Taylor Swift made headlines, the survey found that Americans are more likely to disapprove than approve of celebrities, large companies and professional athletes speaking out about politics. 


Still, Gude is among those discovering other ways to get news to which he does want to pay attention, including on YouTube. 


MSNBC is also in the middle of some corporate upheaval that raises questions about potential changes. Parent company Comcast announced last month that the cable network is among some properties that will spin off into a new company, which will give MSNBC new corporate leadership and cut its ties to NBC News. 


Advice for networks who want to see the viewers return 


Some of the Americans who have turned away from political news lately also had some advice for getting them engaged again. 


Gude said, for example, that MSNBC will always have a hard-core audience of Trump haters. But if the network wants to expand its audience, "then you have to talk about issues, and you have to stop talking about Trump." 


Kathleen Kendrick, a 36-year-old sales rep from Grand Junction, Colorado, who's a registered independent voter, said she hears plenty of people loudly spouting off about their political opinions on the job. She wants more depth when she watches the news. Much of what she sees is one-sided and shallow, she said. 


"You get a story but only part of a story," Kendrick said. "It would be nice if you could get both sides, and more research." 


Aunallah, similarly, is looking for more depth and variety. He's not interested "in watching the angry man on the corner yelling at me anymore," he said. 


"It's kind of their own fault that I'm not watching," he said. "I felt they spent all this time talking about the election. They made it so much of their focus that when the main event ends, why would people want to keep watching?"

## 5 Climate Technologies You’ll Hear About in 2025

So here I present a roundup of the climate technologies that you might not have read about in Heatmap this year, but that have investors, academics, and the climate world at large buzzing as we look toward 2025. </p><h3>1. Green methanol for sustainable shipping fuels</h3><p>This fall when I spoke with Amy Duffuor, a co-founder and partner at the venture capital firm Azolla Ventures, she told me that her firm, which is focused on “overlooked and neglected” climate solutions, has been fascinated by the shipping industry. Because while aviation and shipping each account for about 3% of global emissions, decarbonizing flight seems to get the bulk of the attention. “Sometimes it’s hard for people to imagine what they don’t see or what they’re not interacting with on a day to day basis,” Duffuor told me. </p><p>This fall, the firm co-led a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oxylus-energy-raises-4-5-million-seed-round-for-clean-fuel-technology-302237086.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$4.5 million seed round</u></a> of investment in clean fuels producer Oxylus Energy, which converts carbon dioxide into green methanol for use in shipping and other transportation fuels. The tech relies on renewable-powered electrolyzers similar to those used to make green hydrogen, but the company’s secret sauce is a special catalyst that can convert carbon dioxide into methanol at low temperature and pressure, making<em> </em>the whole process more efficient and more economical than ever before. </p><p>Duffuor told me that green methanol has a leg up on other clean fuels such as green hydrogen, which has a low energy density, or green ammonia, which is highly toxic and corrosive. While supply of all of these is still limited and costly, Duffuor said that retrofitting an engine to run on green methanol is much simpler than adapting to other alternative fuels, which is why it’s already being done on a small scale today. Indeed, <a href="https://www.maersk.com/news/articles/2022/10/05/maersk-continues-green-transformation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shipping giant Maersk</u></a> has a number of green methanol boats in its fleet, one of which completed the <a href="https://stateofgreen.com/en/news/the-worlds-first-green-methanol-container-vessel-has-reached-copenhagen/#:~:text=Transport-,The%20world's%20first%20green%20methanol%20container%20vessel%20has%20reached%20Copenhagen,the%20Baltic%20Sea%20in%20October.&text=At%20a%20ceremony%20at%20Copenhagen's,compared%20to%20a%202020%20baseline." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>world’s first green methanol-powered voyage</u></a> last fall. </p><h3>2. Solar geoengineering</h3><p>Long considered “<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/climate-tech-geoengineering-carbon-removal?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_w0jlvz4_eHo2RJavH6QpECnpgGTP6OhTPFj8eDHEWrwJ0KDvXWlNCdIy0jHV7ZnDZg8NrrMrgvWZ3YHvEEOp3k6kN-Q&_hsmi=311057301&utm_content=311057301&utm_source=hs_email" target="_self"><u>one of climate science’s biggest taboos</u></a>,” according to Heatmap’s own Robinson Meyer, geoengineering had a big 2024, and it looks poised to be taken increasingly seriously. In fact, one investor I spoke with this month, Lee Larson of Piva Capital, which focuses on decarbonizing heavy industry, told me he foresees a splashy but undeniably controversial funding announcement coming in the near future. “I don’t think it’s going to be Piva, but someone is going to take a bet on this, and there’s going to be a big funding round for a startup in this space,” he predicted. “Because there’s enough interested people with deep pockets that have been thinking about this space for someone to raise money off of it.”</p><p>But if nothing else, this year proved that the backlash would be swift. In June, the city council in the small town of Alameda, California, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/climate/alameda-cloud-brightening-geoengineering.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shut down testing</u></a> of a solar geoengineering device that could one day be used for “marine cloud brightening” — that is, spraying aerosols into the sky to enable clouds to reflect more sunlight away from Earth — and Harvard University <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/20/harvard-geoengineering-project-abandoned/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>abandoned another solar geoengineering project</u></a>, which aimed to study how aerosol plumes behave in the stratosphere. At the same time, though, the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/climate/edf-solar-geoengineering-research.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> that it would fund research into solar geoengineering to help inform policymakers should it one day become regulated, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/climate/united-kingdom-geoengineering-research.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the UK also committed</u></a> to supporting research into various solar geoengineering pathways, including conducting outdoor experiments. </p><p>“There’s a growing understanding that, on a per unit of warming avoidance basis, this is just way cheaper than carbon dioxide removal solutions,” Larson told me. From his perspective, the world needs to support this type of research lest a layperson, a billionaire, or a small nation choose to go rogue. “Just given how cheap it is, given how little we know about it, that’s a poor combination — because the chance of someone doing something with a lot of unintended consequences goes up and up.”</p><h3>3. Floating solar</h3><p>The idea is pretty straightforward — install solar panels that can float on the surface of reservoirs, canals, lakes, and the like — but this year it really began to pick up steam. There are myriad benefits to this solution: eliminating land use controversies, built-in temperature regulation (water keeps the panels cool, thus increasing their efficiency), and reducing evaporation from the water bodies. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00251-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A paper</u></a> published in <em><em>Nature</em></em> this June found that floating solar could meet, on average, 16% of countries’ total energy needs.</p><p>And countries big and small are taking note. While there aren’t a lot of specialized floating solar startups seeking VC funding<em><em>, </em></em>governments as well as traditional solar manufacturers and project developers are stepping up. The <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-19-million-investing-america-agenda-innovative" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>U.S. Department of the Interior announced</u></a> in April that it’s investing $19 million to install panels over irrigation canals in California, Oregon, and Utah. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/zimbabwe-power-users-raise-250-million-for-floating-solar-plant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Zimbabwe recently secured</u></a> $250 million from the African Export-Import Bank to install floating solar on the world’s largest man-made lake, while China turned on the <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/14/2024/largest-offshore-solar-farm-goes-online" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>largest offshore solar farm</u></a> in the world in November. <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/taiwan-debuts-world-s-largest-offshore-solar-plant-to-power-74000-homes-yearly/ar-AA1tFZSQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Taiwan</u></a> and <a href="https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-news/ntpc-ramagundam-is-indias-largest-floating-solar-plant-at-100-mw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>India</u></a> have also already deployed large installations, and have <a href="https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/floating-solar-farms-part-2#:~:text=A%20big%20project%20is%20ongoing%20in%20India%2C%20the%20Omkareshwar%20Floating%20Solar%20Power%20Park%20Omkareshwar%20Dam%20in%20Khandwa.%20It%20is%20a%20600MW%20floating%20solar%20power%20plant%20that%20is%20being%20built%20in%20two%20phases.%20The%20first%20phase%20involves%20installation%20of%20278%20MW%2C%20which%20has%20now%20been%20activated." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>plans</u></a> for <a href="https://www.theasset.com/article/51172/mufg-aster-sign-us2587-million-solar-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more</u></a>. </p><p>I spoke with the lead author of the <em><em>Nature</em></em> paper, Dr. Iestyn Woolway of the UK-based Bangor University, way back in June about floating solar’s decarbonization potential. Even he was “quite surprised with the number of countries that could meet a sizable fraction of the energy demands by [floating photovoltaics],” he told me.<em> </em>His modeling shows that Bolivia, for example, could meet about 80% of its energy demand with floating solar, while Ethiopia could meet 100% of its demand, with extra energy to spare. </p><p>The next step, he said, is gaining a deeper understanding of the ecological impacts of this technology. “Even if you do cover a water body by something small, like 10%, we don’t know what knock-on effect that would have,” he said. </p><h3>4. Soil carbon sequestration</h3><p>Soils are some of the world’s most effective carbon sinks, and sustainable farming techniques can enhance soil’s natural carbon sequestration potential. Thus, soil carbon sequestration plays at the intersection of the fuzzy and buzzy regenerative agriculture space and the increasingly scientifically rigorous carbon dioxide removal sector, with its carbon crediting schemes and verification requirements. One investor I spoke with, Amy Francetic of Buoyant Ventures, is eager to find and back a company that can merge these two worlds. “If you could figure out how to sink carbon in a farm and do that in a way that is easy to measure and validate, we don’t have a good solution for that today,” she told me.</p><p>As of now, Francetic said, startups are going about this problem by doing labor intensive and expensive soil sampling and “marrying that with geospatial data to try to measure what climate benefits there are of changing certain agricultural practices, doing different row crops, changing the crop rotation, the amount of inputs you put into the crops.” Many have pitched Buoyant on their methodologies for bridging satellite data with soil sampling data, but thus far she’s passed. “None of them have, I think, met the standard of reliability that the financial industry would back from a carbon credit standpoint,” she explained. “That might be one of these holy grail things. If somebody could really do that, it could be very impactful.”</p><h3>5. Parametric insurance products</h3><p>I’ll be honest, before this year I didn’t know what parametric insurance was. But since it came up time and again in conversations with investors about extreme weather and the necessity of climate resilience and adaptation measures, I decided to dig in. Here’s what parametric insurance is: an insurance product that automatically provides rapid payouts to customers in the case of natural disasters or weather events, assuming these events exceed a predefined limit. For example, a policyholder might be paid if the rainfall, wind speed, or temperature of a particular weather event is above or below a certain threshold, with the amount tied to how much the measurement deviates from the limit, not the damages incurred. </p><p>With extreme weather events getting more frequent and more intense due to climate change, this has given rise to a crop of startups that can leverage sensors, satellites, and artificial intelligence to quickly and accurately measure the extent of these events, thus enabling parametric insurance for a host of new customers. To name a few companies that have taken advantage: There’s Floodbase and FloodFlash (both focusing on flood insurance, naturally), which have each raised over $10 million in Series A financing; FloodFlash made a <a href="https://www.artemis.bm/news/floodflash-uk-floods-hit-parametric-triggers-for-some-policies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>series </u></a>of <a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/floodflashs-parametric-coverage-ensures-rapid-payouts-to-uk-clients-after-floods/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rapid </u></a><a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/storm-bert-triggers-rapid-parametric-payout-from-floodflash/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>payouts</u></a> this year following storms in the UK, getting policyholders their money in as little as 10 hours after the water level exceeded its threshold. There’s Arbol, which protects against a host of weather events from drought to heat waves and cold snaps, and raised a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arbol-raises-60-million-in-series-b-funding-to-scale-parametric-insurance-responding-to-increasing-climate-risk-302131746.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$40 million Series B</u></a> round this year. And there’s Pula, which helps provide parametric insurance to small-holder farmers in emerging markets, and raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/14/pula-raises-20m-series-b/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$20 million Series B</u></a> round this year.</p><p>“This is affecting everybody,” Clea Kolster of Lowercarbon Capital, which led Floodbase’s Series A round, told me when we met at this year’s San Francisco Climate Week. “So how do you actually make sure that people have coverage for it and can continue to have as close to livable lives as possible, even when they’re subject to more frequent extreme weather events?” Investors know the storms are going to keep coming, so this category of adaptation tech is only set to grow.</p>

## Trial moved for man accused in Trump assassination attempt in Florida

date: 2024-12-25, from: VOA News USA

ORLANDO, FLORIDA — A man accused of attempting to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump in South Florida won't be tried until September, a federal judge ruled this week.


Ryan Routh's trial will begin Sept. 8 instead of the previously scheduled Feb. 10, start date, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in an order released on Monday.


Routh, 58, a Hawaii resident, has pleaded not guilty.


Routh's attorneys had asked the judge to delay the trial until no earlier than next December, saying they needed more time to review the evidence against him and decide whether to mount an insanity defense.


Routh owned 17 cellphones and numerous other electronic devices, and there are hundreds of hours of police body camera and surveillance videos that have been provided to the defense, Routh's attorneys argued during a hearing two weeks ago in Fort Pierce, Florida.


In her order, Cannon said that she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn't amount to an "unreasonable delay," she said.


The judge said that any insanity defense or any request related to Routh's mental competency must be made by early February. Any visit to the scene of the assassination attempt must be made by the end of February.


Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.


He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate.


Routh's charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence if he is convicted. Other charges include assaulting a federal officer and three firearms counts. He is being held without bail at the federal jail in Miami.


Routh's arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said security worked as it should have to thwart the potential Florida attack.

## NORAD's Santa tracker was Cold War morale boost. Now it attracts millions of kids

date: 2024-12-25, from: VOA News USA

The Christmas tradition has become nearly global in scope: Children from around the world track Santa Claus as he sweeps across the earth, delivering presents and defying time.


Each year, at least 100,000 kids call into the North American Aerospace Defense Command to inquire about Santa’s location. Millions more follow online in nine languages, from English to Japanese.


On any other night, NORAD is scanning the heavens for potential threats, such as last year’s Chinese spy balloon. But on Christmas Eve, volunteers in Colorado Springs are fielding questions like, “When is Santa coming to my house?” and, “Am I on the naughty or nice list?”


“There are screams and giggles and laughter,” said Bob Sommers, 63, a civilian contractor and NORAD volunteer.




Sommers often says on the call that everyone must be asleep before Santa arrives, prompting parents to say, “Do you hear what he said? We got to go to bed early.”


NORAD’s annual tracking of Santa has endured since the Cold War, predating ugly sweater parties and Mariah Carey classics. The tradition continues regardless of government shutdowns, such as the one in 2018, and this year.


Here’s how it began and why the phones keep ringing.


Origin story is Hollywood-esque



It started with a child’s accidental phone call in 1955. The Colorado Springs newspaper printed a Sears advertisement that encouraged children to call Santa, listing a phone number.


A boy called. But he reached the Continental Air Defense Command, now NORAD, a joint U.S. and Canadian effort to spot potential enemy attacks. Tensions were growing with the Soviet Union, along with anxieties about nuclear war.


Air Force Col. Harry W. Shoup picked up an emergency-only “red phone” and was greeted by a tiny voice that began to recite a Christmas wish list.


“He went on a little bit, and he takes a breath, then says, ‘Hey, you’re not Santa,’” Shoup told The Associated Press in 1999.


Realizing an explanation would be lost on the youngster, Shoup summoned a deep, jolly voice and replied, “Ho, ho, ho! Yes, I am Santa Claus. Have you been a good boy?”


Shoup said he learned from the boy’s mother that Sears mistakenly printed the top-secret number. He hung up, but the phone soon rang again with a young girl reciting her Christmas list. Fifty calls a day followed, he said.


In the pre-digital age, the agency used an 18-by-24-meter plexiglass map of North America to track unidentified objects. A staff member jokingly drew Santa and his sleigh over the North Pole.


The tradition was born.


“Note to the kiddies,” began an AP story from Colorado Springs on Dec. 23, 1955. “Santa Claus Friday was assured safe passage into the United States by the Continental Air Defense Command.”


In a likely reference to the Soviets, the article noted that Santa was guarded against possible attack from “those who do not believe in Christmas.”




Is the origin story humbug?


Some grinchy journalists have nitpicked Shoup’s story, questioning whether a misprint or a misdial prompted the boy’s call.


In 2014, tech news site Gizmodo cited an International News Service story from December 1, 1955, about a child’s call to Shoup. Published in the Pasadena Independent, the article said the child reversed two digits in the Sears number.


“When a childish voice asked COC commander Col. Harry Shoup, if there was a Santa Claus at the North Pole, he answered much more roughly than he should — considering the season:


‘There may be a guy called Santa Claus at the North Pole, but he’s not the one I worry about coming from that direction,’” Shoup said in the brief piece.


In 2015, The Atlantic magazine doubted the flood of calls to the secret line, while noting that Shoup had a flair for public relations.


Phone calls aside, Shoup was indeed media savvy. In 1986, he told the Scripps Howard News Service that he recognized an opportunity when a staff member drew Santa on the glass map in 1955.


A lieutenant colonel promised to have it erased. But Shoup said, “You leave it right there,” and summoned public affairs. Shoup wanted to boost morale for the troops and public alike.


“Why, it made the military look good — like we’re not all a bunch of snobs who don’t care about Santa Claus,” he said.


Shoup died in 2009. His children told the StoryCorps podcast in 2014 that it was a misprinted Sears ad that prompted the phone calls.


“And later in life he got letters from all over the world,” said Terri Van Keuren, a daughter. “People saying, ‘Thank you, Colonel, for having, you know, this sense of humor.’”




Rare addition to Santa’s story


NORAD’s tradition is one of the few modern additions to the centuries-old Santa story that have endured, according to Gerry Bowler, a Canadian historian who spoke to the AP in 2010.


Ad campaigns or movies try to “kidnap” Santa for commercial purposes, said Bowler, who wrote “Santa Claus: A Biography.” NORAD, by contrast, takes an essential element of Santa’s story and views it through a technological lens.


In a recent interview with the AP, Air Force Lt. Gen. Case Cunningham explained that NORAD radars in Alaska and Canada — known as the northern warning system — are the first to detect Santa.


He leaves the North Pole and typically heads for the international dateline in the Pacific Ocean. From there he moves west, following the night.


“That’s when the satellite systems we use to track and identify targets of interest every single day start to kick in,” Cunningham said. “A probably little-known fact is that Rudolph’s nose that glows red emanates a lot of heat. And so those satellites track [Santa] through that heat source.”


NORAD has an app and website, www.noradsanta.org, that will track Santa on Christmas Eve from 4 a.m. to midnight, mountain standard time. People can call 1-877-HI-NORAD to ask live operators about Santa’s location from 6 a.m. to midnight, mountain time.

## Biden signs bill officially making bald eagle the national bird of US

date: 2024-12-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The bald eagle, a symbol of the power and strength of the United States for more than 240 years, earned an overdue honor Tuesday: It officially became the country's national bird. 


President Joe Biden signed into law legislation sent to him by Congress that amends the United States Code to correct what had long gone unnoticed and designate the bald eagle — familiar to many because of its white head, yellow beak and brown body — as the national bird. 


The bald eagle has appeared on the Great Seal of the United States, which is used in official documents, since 1782, when the design was finalized. The seal is made up of the eagle, an olive branch, arrows, a flag-like shield, the motto “E Pluribus Unum” and a constellation of stars. 


Congress, that same year, designated the bald eagle as the the national emblem, and its image appears in a host of places, ranging from documents and the presidential flag to military insignia and U.S. currency, according to USA.gov. 


But it had never been officially designated to be what many had just assumed it was — the national bird. 


The bald eagle is indigenous to North America.

## American imprisoned in Russia sentenced to new 15-year jail term for espionage

date: 2024-12-25, from: VOA News USA

Moscow — A Russian-born U.S. citizen already imprisoned in Russia on a bribery conviction has been handed a second 15-year jail term for espionage, Russian news agencies reported Tuesday.


A Moscow court brought espionage charges against Gene Spector in August 2023. Details surrounding the case were not made public.


The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of the sentencing of a U.S. citizen in Russia and was monitoring the situation.


Spector, formerly an executive at a medical equipment company in Russia, was previously sentenced to more than three years in prison in September 2022 for enabling bribes to an aide of former deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich. The aide, Anastasia Alekseyeva, was sentenced to 12 years in April for taking bribes of two expensive overseas vacation trips.


Dvorkovich was a deputy prime minister under Dmitry Medvedev from 2012 to 2018. He is currently head of the international chess federation FIDE.

## NASA probe makes closest-ever pass by the sun

date: 2024-12-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — NASA's pioneering Parker Solar Probe made history Tuesday, flying closer to the sun than any other spacecraft, with its heat shield exposed to scorching temperatures topping 930 degrees Celsius (1,700 degrees Fahrenheit). 


Launched in August 2018, the spaceship is on a seven-year mission to deepen scientific understanding of our star and help forecast space-weather events that can affect life on Earth. 


Tuesday's historic flyby should have occurred at precisely 11:53 Greenwich Mean Time, although mission scientists will have to wait until Friday for confirmation as they lose contact with the craft for several days due to its proximity to the sun. 


"Right now, Parker Solar Probe is flying closer to a star than anything has ever been before," at 6.1 million kilometers (3.8 million miles) away, NASA official Nicky Fox said in a video on social media Tuesday morning.  


"It is just a total 'yay, we did it,' moment." 


If the distance between Earth and the sun is the equivalent to the length of an American football field, 109.7 meters, the spacecraft should have been about four meters from the end zone at the moment of closest approach — known as perihelion. 


"This is one example of NASA's bold missions, doing something that no one else has ever done before to answer long-standing questions about our universe," Parker Solar Probe program scientist Arik Posner said in a statement on Monday. 


"We can't wait to receive that first status update from the spacecraft and start receiving the science data in the coming weeks." 


So effective is the heat shield that the probe's internal instruments remain near room temperature — around 29 C (85 F) — as it explores the sun's outer atmosphere, called the corona. 


Parker will also be moving at a blistering pace of around 690,000 kilometers per hour (430,000 miles per hourph), fast enough to fly from the U.S. capital, Washington, to Japan's Tokyo in under a minute. 


"Parker will truly be returning data from uncharted territory," said Nick Pinkine, mission operations manager at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.  


"We're excited to hear back from the spacecraft when it swings back around the sun." 


By venturing into these extreme conditions, Parker has been helping scientists tackle some of the sun's biggest mysteries: how solar wind originates, why the corona is hotter than the surface below, and how coronal mass ejections — massive clouds of plasma that hurl through space are formed. 


The Christmas Eve flyby is the first of three record-setting close passes, with the next two — on March 22 and June 19, 2025 — both expected to bring the probe back to a similarly close distance from the Sun.

## Big banks, business groups sue US Federal Reserve over annual 'stress tests'

date: 2024-12-24, from: VOA News USA

Major banks and business groups sued the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, alleging the U.S. central bank's annual "stress tests" of Wall Street firms violate the law.


The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio, claims the Fed's practice of determining how big banks perform against hypothetical economic turmoil, and assigning capital requirements accordingly, do not follow proper administrative procedure. Plaintiffs included the Bank Policy Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Bank Association.


The lawsuit marks the latest example of the banking industry growing bolder and challenging in court their regulators' powers, particularly in the wake of recent Supreme Court rulings placing fresh restrictions on administrative authority.


In June, the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to such power by overturning a 1984 precedent that granted deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer. The so-called "Chevron doctrine" had called for judges to defer to reasonable federal agency interpretations of U.S. laws deemed to be ambiguous.  


While the 2010 Dodd-Frank law passed following the global financial crisis broadly requires the Fed to test banks' balance sheets, the capital adequacy analysis the Fed performs as part of tests, or the resulting capital it directs lenders to set aside, are not mandated by law.


Specifically, the groups are calling for the Fed to make public and subject to feedback the now-confidential models the regulators use to gauge bank performance, as well as details of the annual scenarios they create to test for weaknesses. The groups said they did not want to kill the stress testing program, which provides an annual bill of health to the nation's biggest firms, but argue the process needs to be more transparent and responsive to public feedback.


On Monday, the Fed announced plans to pursue similar changes ahead of the 2025 exams, citing recent legal developments, but the industry opted to proceed with its lawsuit. A Fed spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit on Tuesday.


"The opaque nature of these tests undermines their value for providing meaningful insights into bank resilience," Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement.  


"We remain hopeful the Fed will address long-standing issues with the stress tests, but this litigation preserves our ability to seek legal remedies if the Fed falls short.”


These tests, which banks have complained for years are opaque and subjective, are a central piece of the U.S. regulatory bank-capital structure. The Fed has long resisted calls to completely open up the testing process, due to concerns that it could make it easier for banks to clear the exams.


How banks perform on the test informs how much capital they must set aside to meet their obligations and dictate the scope of dividend payouts and stock buybacks.

## Chad’s online journalists decry ban ahead of December 29 elections

date: 2024-12-24, from: VOA News USA

Yaounde — Online media journalists in Chad are voicing dissatisfaction and frustration over officials’ refusal to lift a ban on the broadcasting of audiovisual content. The High Media and Audiovisual Authority, or HAMA, accuses journalists of reposting videos without the content producers’ permission but journalists say they are being silenced from reporting on critical election issues.


Journalists reporting for online media platforms say they are surprised that Chad's High Media and Audiovisual Authority, or HAMA, has refused to respect a December 20 Supreme Court decision ordering an immediate end to a ban on broadcasting online media content.


Bello Bakary Mana, the president of the Association of Online Media of Chad, Mana took part in a protest Tuesday in N'djamena against what he calls a deliberate attempt by HAMA to silence Chad's online media.


Mana said several hundred online reporters assisted by local radio, print and TV journalists are in N'djamena to let the world know that the media is being silenced in Chad. "They will continue protesting until HAMA stops threatening journalists and lifts what he calls its illegal December 4 ban on the broadcast of online audiovisual content," he said.


Bello, who spoke to VOA from N'djamena via a messaging app, also said only police can compel HAMA to respect the lifting of a ban on the broadcasting of online audiovisual content, but that police are controlled by the government, which ordered the ban.


HAMA says it prohibited online newspapers from broadcasting audiovisual content because many of the newspapers refused to obey an order earlier this year to stop reposting videos from foreign sources, including international media outlets, without the author or media outlets’ permission, as required by law.


Journalists say the decision, taken before elections on December 29 to mark an end to Chad's three-year transitional period, is an indication the government, through HAMA, wants to silence online media that the government has described as highly critical.


HAMA has always complained that online media regularly publish unverifiable information about President Mahamat Idriss Deby.




Deby became Chad's transitional president in April 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels following 30 years in power.


Deby was declared the winner of Chad's contested May 6 presidential polls amid opposition and civil society allegations the victory was stolen.


Government officials in Chad complained after the presidential elections that online media were reporting on and posting videos of opposition and civil society members saying that Deby wants to continue his late father's rule, according to local media.


Journalists in Chad say by banning online audiovisual content, HAMA wants to silence online media that have been reporting that Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement, or MPS, wants to use the polls to consolidate its grip on power at all costs.




Abderrahmane Barka, the president of HAMA, created by Chad's government to regulate the media in the central African state, says Chad's High Media and Audiovisual Authority that he leads noticed that before elections, rich politicians hire media organizations to broadcast campaign messages, and that poses a disadvantage to politicians who don’t have a lot of money. He says HAMA is reinforcing the law, which requires the media to give equal access without pay to all political parties taking part in elections.


Barka spoke on state TV on Tuesday. He said Chadian laws do not permit online newspapers to broadcast audiovisual content but did not comment on whether a Supreme Court decision to lift the ban will be respected.


Chad's online journalists say the ban has affected about 60% of their audience who no longer have access to online media. They say they are surprised that HAMA also ordered them to stop broadcasting audiovisual content that they produce locally.


Before the ban and ahead of the December 29 elections, HAMA suspended all interactive online, radio and TV programs, arguing that the media do not have sufficient human resources to produce such programs during election periods — a claim the media deny.


Last week, Reporters Without Borders asked Chad to reverse its decision and lift the ban. The media rights group says the job of HAMA is regulating and not prohibiting the media from informing, educating and entertaining their audience.



RSF acknowledges that broadcasting content without the consent of the producers is wrong and has asked Chad to allow online reporters to broadcast local content they create.

## Heavy travel day starts with brief grounding of all American Airlines flights

date: 2024-12-24, from: VOA News USA

Washington — American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide Tuesday because of a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive. 


Government regulators cleared American flights to get airborne about an hour after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered a national ground stop for the airline. The order, which prevented planes from taking off, was issued at the airline's request after it experienced trouble with its flight operating system, or FOS. The airline blamed technology from one of its vendors. 


As a result, flights were delayed across American’s major hubs, with only 37% of the airline's 3,901 domestic and international flights leaving on time, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. Nineteen flights were canceled. 


Dennis Tajer, a spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, a union representing American Airlines pilots, said the airline told pilots at 7 a.m. Eastern that there was an outage affecting the FOS. It handles different types of airline operations, including dispatch, flight planning and passenger boarding, as well as an airplane's weight and balance data, he said. 


Hours after the ground stop was lifted, Tajer said the union had not heard about any “chaos out there beyond just the normal heavy travel day.”  


On social media, however, customers expressed frustration with delays that caused them or their family members to miss connecting flights. One person asked if American planned to hold flights for passengers to make connections, while others complained about the lack of assistance they said they received from the airline or gate agents. 




Bobby Tighe, a real estate agent from Florida, said he will miss a family Christmas Eve party in New York because his American flight was repeatedly delayed. The delays made him miss a connecting flight, leaving him the choice of going to his destination — Westchester, New York — on Christmas Day or taking another flight to Newark, New Jersey, that was scheduled to land Tuesday evening. He chose the latter. 


“I’m just going to take an Uber or Lyft to the airport I was originally supposed to go to, pick up my rental car and kind of restart everything tomorrow,” Tighe said. He said his girlfriend was “going through the same exact situation” on her way from Dallas to New York. 


Cirium noted that the vast majority of flights were departing within two hours of their scheduled departure time. A similar percentage — 36% — were arriving at their destinations as scheduled. 


Dallas-Fort Worth, New York’s Kennedy Airport and Charlotte, North Carolina, saw the greatest number of delays, Cirium said.  


Meanwhile, the flight-tracking site FlightAware reported that 4,058 flights entering or leaving the U.S., or serving domestic destinations, were delayed, with 76 flights canceled. The site showed on Tuesday afternoon that 961 American flights were delayed. 


Amid the travel problems, significant rain and snow were expected in the Pacific Northwest at least into Christmas Day. Showers and thunderstorms were developing in the South. Freezing rain was reported in the Mid-Atlantic region near Baltimore and Washington, and snow fell in New York. 


Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups — a winter storm or a computer outage — can snowball into massive disruptions. 


That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update. 


Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have “interline agreements” that let them put stranded customers on another carrier’s flights. 


About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA. 


“Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,” AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.

## Japanese PM Ishiba: Important to strengthen US-Japan alliance

date: 2024-12-24, from: VOA News USA

TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Tuesday he wanted to strengthen his country's alliance with the United States, as he pushed for as early as possible a meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. 


Japan is neighbors with an increasingly assertive China and a nuclear-armed North Korea that has been deepening military ties with Russia. 


"I think it's important to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance even further... and share a common understanding of the situation in north-east Asia," he said at a press conference, adding that no dates for a potential meeting were set yet. 


Ishiba, in office since October, has sought a meeting with Trump, but told reporters last month that the president-elect's camp had said meetings with world leaders were restricted under the Logan Act before Trump's January inauguration. 


Trump has met with Akie Abe, the widow of the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 


Ishiba also said his cabinet plans to approve on Dec. 27 a draft state budget for the next fiscal year from April. 


He also pledged to work on measures to raise minimum wages and to eliminate public concerns for the future to boost private consumption.

	Here is an excerpt from the conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Allison Clements:</strong> FERC, the agency, which, I was one of five commissioners, has jurisdiction over what resources sign up for and retire from participating on the grid. And over the last decade, two decades, what has happened is, as this 1.5 terawatts of generation have gotten in line, it’s just overwhelmed the interconnection system. The interconnection processes weren’t designed for anything other than central station, dispatchable, most recently gas plants, combined cycle gas plants, peaking plants, closer to load, you don’t need as much network upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
	There’s lots of room on the grid because there was an investment in the grid many decades ago. But now we’ve got this situation where there’s all these resources who want to sign up, and they can’t get on. In fact, this has been going on for a long time. And most of the supply resources waiting to get on today do have site control, do have the financial and commercial readiness. There’s some that we’re still clearing out from the days of the Wild West, where people would just sign up six interconnection applications and see what happened, which would cause a lot of problems for everybody else when they would drop out of those lines.<br/>
<br/>
	So, what do we do about it? FERC has passed a couple of different rules to clean up regional transmission planning. A comment about planning during this morning’s session that utilities plan so much — well, if we had been planning for an increasingly electrified economy 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, we would have a lot more transmission, a lot more space on the grid to give access to these resources.<br/>
<br/>
	We have taken action as an agency to try and fix that through one rule. We’ve also taken action as an agency to try and fix the interconnection lines themselves through some nuts and bolts requirements to make it harder to get through, so you don’t come until you’re ready to go. But those rules and policy changes that are very positive aren’t going to have impact for, let’s say, five years, seven years. I mean, the reality is we’re not going to be picking new transmission lines from these processes we’ve developed until at least 2029.<br/>
<br/>
	2024 — what do we do for the next five years, right? Even these really exciting new deals with SMR, advanced geothermal, we’re looking in the 2030 timeline. Well, the existing grid is really inefficient, and if we can use AI to improve it, that would be really, really important in validating and making this a positive cycle of affirmation.<br/>
<br/>
	The last thing I’ll say is, what are those inefficiencies? The lines between regions, the lines between PJM, which is the region we’re sitting in today, a grid operator, and the New York State grid operator, and the New England grid operator at the interties, the transfers, are very inefficient and they’re often counter to good economics. We have no hardware and software solutions, grid-enhancing technologies, advanced transmission technologies that can automatically double existing capacity, or existing room, extra room on the grid. We have surplus interconnection. We have the opportunity to put more resources behind existing points of interconnection and use that system more efficiently. So, the reality is to solve the power for AI, we need the AI to come back and help us do it. </blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule">

## Report: Panel unable to reach consensus on Nippon's US Steel bid

date: 2024-12-24, from: VOA News USA

tokyo — The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has told the White House it is unable to reach a consensus on national security risks involved in Nippon Steel's bid for U.S. Steel, The Washington Post reported Monday. 


The decision now lies with President Joe Biden, who has 15 days to act. Both Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have said they oppose the $15 billion deal, which Nippon Steel announced last December. 


Nippon Steel said Tuesday that it did not receive any updates from CFIUS. U.S. Steel did not immediately reply to request for a comment. Both companies had previously planned to close the deal before the year's end. 


CFIUS, a government interagency committee that reviews security implications of foreign investment in the United States, said Monday that allowing Nippon Steel to take over U.S. Steel could result in lower domestic steel production, representing "a national security risk," according to the Post. 


Nippon Steel said it could eliminate that risk by appointing U.S. citizens to top management and board of director positions at U.S. Steel, but the committee was divided in its view of whether those remedies would be sufficient, the newspaper said. 


The U.S. Treasury Department, which leads CFIUS; the Commerce Department; and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 


Nippon Steel faces a $565 million penalty to U.S. Steel if the deal collapses, which would also be a major blow to the Japanese steelmaker's overseas expansion. It said earlier that it could pursue legal action against the U.S. government if the deal fell apart. 


With U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel aimed to raise its global steel production capacity to 85 million metric tons per year from 65 million tons now, and the asset is core to its goal of lifting production capacity to more than 100 million tons in the long term. 


With Japan being the largest foreign investor in the U.S., Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last month sent a letter to Biden asking him to approve Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel.

## Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupts, spewing columns of lava

date: 2024-12-24, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — One of the world's most active volcanoes sprang into life again Monday, spewing columns of lava 80 meters above Hawaii, U.S. vulcanologists said.


Images showed enormous fissures in the caldera of Kilauea, on Hawaii's Big Island, spraying jets of molten rock into the air.


The U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said the eruption began just after 2 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) in the southwestern section of the caldera.


“At 4:30 a.m., lava fountains were observed with heights up to 80 meters [262 feet],” the agency said.


"Molten material, including lava bombs, is being ejected from the winds on the caldera floor up onto the west caldera rim."


The eruption was also sending matter much higher into the atmosphere.


"The plume of volcanic gas and fine volcanic particles is reaching elevations of 6,000-8,000 feet above sea level ... and winds are transporting it to the southwest," the observatory said.


The observatory said sulfur dioxide emanating from the fissure would react with other gases in the atmosphere.


So-called vog — volcanic smog — can affect people and animals, as well as crops.


Kilauea has been very active since 1983 and erupts relatively regularly, including most recently in September.


It is one of six active volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands, which include Mauna Loa, the largest volcano in the world, though Kilauea is far more active.

## VOA Mandarin: Trump's new AI policy seeks to loosen regulations, support innovation, defeat China

date: 2024-12-23, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal President Joe Biden's executive order on artificial intelligence security, setting the stage for deregulation for AI companies by nominating pro-business, pro-startups Silicon Valley leaders.


The nomination of Jacob Helberg, an outspoken China critic, for a key State Department post indicates Trump’s intention to lead over China in AI, according to analysts.


“We're likely to see quite a great focus on countering China when it comes to AI – beating China, when it comes to having the most advanced AI capabilities,” says Ruby Scanlon, a researcher on technology and national security at Center for a New America Security.

## Bill Clinton out of the hospital after being treated for the flu

date: 2024-12-23, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Former President Bill Clinton was discharged from a Washington hospital Tuesday and will be home for Christmas after he was admitted the day before with a fever.


Clinton is being treated for the flu, Angel Urena, Clinton's deputy chief of staff, said in a statement about his release.


“He and his family are deeply grateful for the exceptional care provided by the team at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and are touched by the kind messages and well wishes he received,” Urena said.


“He sends his warmest wishes for a happy and healthy holiday season to all,” Urena said.


The 78-year-old Democrat was hospitalized Monday afternoon for testing and observation.


Clinton served two terms as president from January 1993 until January 2001. He addressed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last summer, and campaigned in the fall for Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost the presidential election to Republican Donald Trump in November.


Clinton recently published his newest book, Citizen, a memoir about his life after the White House and the role of philanthropy in it.

## FAA probes holiday drone show accident that injured boy in Florida

date: 2024-12-23, from: VOA News USA

ORLANDO — The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it has launched an investigation into why several drones collided and fell from the sky during a holiday show over the weekend in downtown Orlando, Florida, injuring a 7-year-old boy who required surgery. 


The drones fell into a crowd of thousands of people watching the show Saturday night at the city's Lake Eola Park. The show was permitted through the FAA. 


"Our thoughts are with the family and all those impacted by the outcome of this event," the city of Orlando said in a statement. "The city remains in contact with the vendor and FAA who will conduct a thorough investigation." 


Adriana Edgerton told Orlando television station WESH that her son, Alexander, required surgery after being hit in the chest with a drone. 


"The blade cut his mouth, but there's an actual imprint of the drone on his chest," she said. 


Sky Elements Drone Shows, the Fort Worth, Texas, vendor that put on the show, didn't immediately respond to an emailed inquiry on Monday. On the company's website, it said, "Every step of the way, we put accuracy, execution, and compliance first." 


Drone shows typically require a waiver to operate more than one drone at a time, and the FAA reviews each drone show application to make sure "the flying public and people on the ground will be safe," the agency said.

## US ship departs Cambodia after first port visit in nearly a decade

date: 2024-12-23, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI, TAIWAN — The USS Savannah departed from Cambodia last Friday, after the first port visit by the U.S. Navy to the Southeast Asian nation in eight years. Despite being a close partner of China, analysts say the stop in Cambodia’s port city of Sihanoukville shows that the country is looking to improve its relations with the United States. 


The Savannah arrived in Sihanoukville last Monday and docked there about 30 kilometers from the Chinese-funded Ream Naval Base, which has drawn concern from U.S. analysts as a potential permanent base for Chinese forces. 


Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defense says the U.S. warship’s five-day visit was aimed at “strengthening and expanding friendship” and “promoting bilateral cooperation.” 


In June 2024, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Minister of National Defense Tea Seiha, with the two sides agreeing to strengthen their bilateral defense relationship. 




Recent anti-democratic reforms, human rights violations and an increasing Chinese presence within Cambodia have strained relations. The Ream Naval Base is a particular sore spot for the two nations, with the U.S. imposing sanctions in 2021 on two senior Cambodian military officials accused of profiting from the Chinese-built base. 


However, last week’s port call and official promises suggest that Cambodia wishes to push back against its reputation as a client state of Beijing, analysts say. 


“I think that Cambodians are trying to show that — look, we’re not taking the side of the Chinese or the Americans,” said Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a researcher at the Lowy Institute in Australia. 


Yaacob said that Cambodia is using the return of a U.S. defense presence to its shores to demonstrate its adherence to self-proclaimed principles of nonalignment to the broader Asian region. 


Sam Seun, a policy analyst at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told VOA that the international community too often focuses on Cambodia’s relationship with China, and that this port call proves Cambodia can have good relationships with the United States and other countries too. 


He said China’s presence in Cambodia’s defense infrastructure is normal for a small country looking to “strengthen its military capabilities.” 


One port call, though, might not be enough to quell U.S. fears about Chinese military influence in Cambodia and mend the U.S.-Cambodian relationship. 


Although he viewed it as a “good start,” the warship docking in Cambodia “will not lead to a full restoration of relations between Cambodia and the United States. The United States will still accuse Cambodia of allowing China to establish a military base in its territory,” Seun said. 




China's two Type 056A frigates, the Aba and the Tianmen, had been stationed at Ream Naval Base for nearly 12 months by the time the Savannah arrived in Cambodia.  


Cambodian officials earlier stated that the ships were there for training engagements with the Cambodian navy. 


The base’s location holds strategic significance to China, given its proximity to potential conflict arenas and vital shipping routes in the South China Sea, said Sun Kim, assistant dean and lecturer at the Faculty of Social Sciences and International Relations at the Pannasastra University of Cambodia. 


Sun said the base is important to Chinese oil and gas transportation, as it allows for a greater ease of transport of fuel from Africa and the Middle East. 


Additionally, in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait, Ream Base could prove even more important, analysts say. 


"If China needs to deploy its navy, Ream Naval Base may be used as one of the bases for deployment by China,” said Sun. 


However, according to Cambodian law, foreign forces are prohibited from being permanently stationed in the country and from conducting military operations out of Cambodian bases. Cambodia has denied that the Ream Naval Base is controlled by China. 


On Friday, Cambodia’s former Prime Minister Hun Sen said Japan would be granted visitation rights to Ream Naval Base, according to a post on his Facebook page. The announcement came during a visit to Cambodia by Japan national security adviser Akiba Takeo.

## Experts urge US to use Taiwan logistics pact to counter China's military coercion

date: 2024-12-23, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A recently released U.S. government report details China's ongoing efforts to "erode long-standing norms in and around Taiwan" through various pressure tactics, including increased military flights crossing the Taiwan Strait median line. 


While U.S. officials have expressed serious concerns, some military experts argue that Washington's response has been ineffective in curbing Chinese aggression. 


To deter further coercion, some former U.S. military officials propose leveraging the U.S.-Taiwan Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) to allow American military jets to refuel there as a clear demonstration of resolve. 


The ACSA, a rarely discussed logistics agreement between the U.S. and Taiwan, allows the U.S. Department of Defense to exchange supplies, services, and logistical support with its partners and allies. 


In its 2024 report, Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China, released last week as mandated by Congress, the Pentagon highlights China's ongoing military buildup to secure national interests and assert territorial claims along its periphery. The report notes that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is increasingly focused on "military contingencies in the Taiwan Strait while simultaneously delaying or denying third-party intervention." 


The report also details the PLA's extensive joint land, air and sea exercises around Taiwan throughout 2023 to enhance combat readiness and operational coordination. It notes that more than 1,500 PLA aircraft entered Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone in both 2022 and 2023. 


Officials in Washington say U.S. defense engagement with Taiwan has evolved in response to China's growing capacity and willingness to use military coercion against Taiwan. 


But in Beijing, officials are warning against what they call "foreign military intervention," asserting that Taiwan is part of China's "internal affairs." 


"China urges the U.S. to immediately stop arming Taiwan," a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated on Monday, following President Joe Biden's recent authorization of up to $571 million in Defense Department materials, services, and military training for the self-ruled island. 


The spokesperson condemned the U.S. announcement of military aid, warning that Washington is "playing with fire” and will get “burned." 


Founded in 1949, the Communist Party-led People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan but claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democracy. It has never excluded the possibility of using force to bring the island under its control. 


The U.S. maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity, taking neither an official stance on Taiwan's sovereignty nor supporting its independence. 


A State Department spokesperson recently said that the U.S. remains concerned about "elevated" PLA activity near Taiwan, describing it as consistent with levels observed during previous "Joint Sword" military exercises. The statement followed PLA naval drills near Taiwan and along the First Island Chain earlier in December. 




Trey Meeks, a senior defense fellow at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, told VOA that low-cost strategies that would boost Taiwan's morale and demonstrate U.S. resolve could help counter China's "new normal" of constant and escalated military coercion. 


Meeks is among the military experts who said President-elect Donald Trump’s team is likely to be much more aggressive only if Taiwan agrees to significantly increase its defense budget. 


When Chinese military jets cross the median line, he suggested, a pair of U.S. fighter jets could later respond by leveraging the U.S.-Taiwan logistics agreement, the ACSA, by making a refueling stop in Taiwan. 


Another U.S. option, Meeks said, would be a visit by a U.S. Coast Guard vessel already operating in the region. This would signify a strategic response and signal that larger ships, potentially including U.S. naval vessels, might follow at U.S.-Taiwanese discretion. 


It wouldn’t be the first time. In June 2021, a U.S. military aircraft traveled to Taiwan to deliver COVID-19 vaccines, while in February 2023, South Korea's "Black Eagles" aerobatic team made a refueling stop at Taiwan's southern Kaohsiung airport while en route to an air show in Australia. 




For Taiwan, other options include intercepting Chinese aircraft incursions using radar missile locks. 


“The ride stops being fun for the Chinese fighter pilot when you lock him up with a surface-to-air missile," said Meeks, who's also a former U.S. military official. 


Forty-five years ago, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which became law on April 10, 1979. 


TRA policies would provide Taiwan with defensive weapons. U.S. special operations forces have been operating in Taiwan since 2012, and several hundred U.S. troops are currently known to be serving as a training team on the ground in Taiwan.

## US House panel finds Matt Gaetz paid for sex and drugs, obstructed Congress

date: 2024-12-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for drugs and sex that were violations of a series of House rules and included obstruction of Congress, the U.S. House of Representatives' Ethics Committee said in a report released on Monday.


Among the committee findings were that Gaetz paid $90,000 to 12 women, a substantial portion of which the panel found was likely for either sexual activity or drug use.


Gaetz, who has denied wrongdoing, resigned from the House of Representatives last month after he was selected by President-elect Donald Trump to be attorney general. He withdrew from consideration in the face of an uphill confirmation battle in the Senate.


The release of the report came despite a last-minute legal challenge from Gaetz in federal court in Washington, DC, in which he arguedthat the Ethics panel no longer had jurisdiction after Gaetz resigned from Congress.


That did not stop the committee from its decision to make the 37-page report public.


"The committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress," the report stated in its conclusion.


While Gaetz was found to have been involved in transporting women across state lines for the purposes of commercial sex, the panel said it did not find evidence that any of the women were under 18 at the time of travel.


"Nor did the committee find sufficient evidence to conclude that the commercial sex acts were induced by force, fraud, or coercion," the report said.


However, someone identified as "Victim A" told the panel of twice having sex with Gaetz at a party in 2017 while she was underage, receiving a $400 cash payment that she understood to be for sex.


At the time, the victim had just completed her junior year of high school. She testified that she did not inform Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age. The committee did not receive any evidence indicating that Gaetz was aware that she was a minor when he had sex with her.


Gaetz denied in a written submission to the panel that he had sex with anyone under the age of 18, but did not address the specific allegations related to "Victim A," according to the report.


Reuters was not immediately able to reach Gaetz for comment.


The move to make the report public was not unanimous.


Chairman Michael Guest said in a dissenting statement that the committee's findings were not being challenged, but that the panel was deviating from "well-established standards" in releasing a report on a former member of the House.


"The Committee's position regarding its lack of authority over former members represents a clear, well-established policy rather than an isolated interpretation," Gaetz's lawyers wrote in a complaint seeking to block the release of the report.


Gaetz lawyers saidthe report would contain "untruthful and defamatory information" about Gaetz.


A federal judge had not yet ruled on Gaetz's request at the time the report was published.


Gaetz was the subject of a three-year FBI investigation into allegations of sex trafficking that produced no criminal charges.


Gaetz played a lead role in 2023 in forcing a first-ever successful vote by the House to oust its speaker, who at the time was Kevin McCarthy -- just nine months into the job.

## Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty to state murder and other charges in United Healthcare CEO's death

date: 2024-12-23, from: VOA News USA

New York — The man accused of fatally shooting the CEO of UnitedHealthcare pleaded not guilty on Monday to murder and terror charges in a state case that will run parallel to his federal prosecution. 


Luigi Mangione, 26, was shackled and seated in a Manhattan court when he leaned over to a microphone to enter his plea. The Manhattan district attorney formally charged him last week with multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism. 


His initial appearance in New York's state's trial court was preempted by federal prosecutors bringing their own charges over the shooting. The federal charges could carry the possibility of the death penalty, while the maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. 




Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. 


Authorities say Mangione gunned down Brian Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan on the morning of Dec 4. 


Mangione was arrested in a Pennsylvania McDonald's after a five-day search, carrying a gun that matched the one used in the shooting and a fake ID, police said. He also was carrying a notebook expressing hostility toward the health insurance industry and especially wealthy executives, according to federal prosecutors. 


At a news conference announcing the state charges last Tuesday, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg said the application of the terrorism law reflected the severity of a "frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation." 


"In its most basic terms, this was a killing that was intended to evoke terror," he added. "And we've seen that reaction." 


Karen Friedman Agnifilo, an attorney for Mangione, has accused federal and state prosecutors of advancing conflicting legal theories. In federal court last week, she called their approach "very confusing" and "highly unusual." 


Mangione is being held in a Brooklyn federal jail alongside several other high-profile defendants, including Sean "Diddy" Combs and Sam Bankman-Fried. 




Mangione was extradited from Pennsylvania on Thursday and quickly rushed to New York City, where he was seen wearing an orange jumpsuit as he was led away from a helicopter by heavily armed police officers and New York City Mayor Eric Adams. 


Adams said he was hoping to send a message to the suspect: "I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city — the city that the people of New York love," the mayor told a local TV station. "I wanted to be there to show the symbolism of that." 


An Ivy-league graduate from a prominent Maryland family, Mangione appeared to have cut himself off from family and friends in recent months. He posted frequently in online forums about his struggles with back pain. He was never a UnitedHealthcare client, according to the insurer. 


Thompson, a married father of two high-schoolers, had worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. 


The killing has prompted some to voice their resentment at U.S. health insurers, with Mangione serving as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills. It also has sent shockwaves through the corporate world, rattling executives who say they have received a spike in threats.

## Biden commutes sentences of 37 federal death row inmates, citing opposition to executions

date: 2024-12-23, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Monday commuted the sentences of all but three of the 40 people on federal death row, citing his long-standing opposition to capital punishment.  


By his action, Biden also denies the incoming Trump administration the chance to green-light the convicts' executions. The first Trump administration carried out 13 executions of death-row inmates, a record for a single presidential term.  


The 37 men, who will now spend the rest of their lives in prison without the possibility of parole, landed on death row because juries found them guilty of brutal crimes that ended the lives of others. Most of these men have been awaiting their sentence for more than a decade. 


“Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,” Biden said in a statement accompanying the announcement. “But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President, and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.” 


One man, Thomas Steven Sanders of Louisiana, was found guilty of kidnapping and killing a 12-year-old girl, after fatally shooting her mother. And a California kidnapping-and-serial-killing duo, Jurijus Kadamovas and Iouri Mikhel, were sentenced to death for the killings of five people, including the strangling of a pregnant woman. They had attempted to get ransom from the victims but ended up killing all of them anyway.  


Excluded from the list are three men convicted for crimes that Biden described as “terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.”  


That group is headlined by Dylann Roof, who in 2015 killed nine members of a historically Black South Carolina church in what prosecutors said was an attempt to spark a race war. In his sentencing, prosecutors quoted Roof’s prison diary, in which he wrote: “I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed.” He went on, in that entry, to espouse racist beliefs, and concluded: “I have shed a tear of self-pity for myself. I feel pity that I had to do what I did in the first place.”  


Also excluded were Robert Bowers, convicted over the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, the 2018 shooting of 11 members of Pittsburgh's Tree of life Synagogue, and 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He said during interrogation that he and his older brother – who was killed in a police shootout while they were on the run – were planning another attack in central New York City.  


Biden announced a moratorium on federal executions soon after taking office in 2021. On Monday, he also touted his announcement earlier in December on bestowing the largest-ever act of clemency in a single day by an American president, affecting about 1,500 people who had been placed in home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic.  


Also in December, Biden announced his highest-profile pardon of all: that of his son Hunter, on federal gun and tax charges. Biden’s announcement sparked outrage as he had maintained throughout his presidency that he would not pardon his son. In his statement, he said he believed his son had been “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.” 


Members of Biden’s party largely applauded Monday’s commutations. Capital punishment has been abolished in 23 of the 50 American states, and in Washington, D.C., the capital.  


“I have long advocated for reforms to make our justice system more fair and effective, and that includes ending the use of the death penalty which has not been shown to reduce crime,” said Virginia Democratic Representative Bobby Scott in a statement. “I applaud President Biden for commuting these sentences to life sentences without the possibility of parole. The Biden Administration placed a moratorium on federal executions and this will ensure the incoming Administration cannot easily resume the practice.” 


Some of Trump’s supporters openly disagreed. 


In a post on social media platform X, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas wrote, “When given the choice between law-abiding Americans or criminals, Joe Biden and Democrats choose criminals every time.” 


Hardline Republican Representative Chip Roy called the president's decision unconscionable. "The Presidents pardon power is being abused by @JoeBiden to carry out a miscarriage of justice," he wrote. 


The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union described Biden’s decision as “the most consequential step of any president in our history to address the immoral and unconstitutional harms of capital punishment.”  


“With a stroke of his pen, the President locks in his legacy as a leader who stands for racial justice, humanity, and morality,” said Anthony D. Romero, in a statement. “This will undoubtedly be one of the seminal achievements of the Biden presidency.” 


And criminal justice reform advocates pushed for more.  


“We do not need to kill people to show that killing is wrong in this country,” said Bryan Stevenson, director of the Equal Justice Initiative. “The death penalty is a torturous, flawed, expensive, and error-filled practice that must be abolished. I commend President Biden for this historic act and hope that governors and state executives follow the president’s lead at a time when many of our courts are abandoning their role to ensure fairness and reliability in criminal cases. Leadership by elected officials will be more critical than ever.” 


The United States is in the minority of countries that impose a federal death penalty. Recent U.S. polls show younger Americans have driven down the public’s appetite for this punishment, with less than half of Americans born after 1981 supporting the practice. 


Trump, in his first term, pushed through 13 federal executions – the last one, just days before he left office – earning him the dubious distinction of overseeing more executions than any other U.S. president in more than a century. Trump has frequently praised what he says is China’s practice of swift trials and immediate execution for drug dealers.  


China leads the world in imposing thousands of death sentences each year, according to the non-partisan Death Penalty Information Center, which says it “does not take a posi­tion on the death penal­ty itself but is crit­i­cal of prob­lems in its application.” 


It is not known how many people are actually executed by the state, as Beijing does not release that information.

## Climate Change Is Making the World Darker

date: 2024-12-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzg0NDkzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NzQ0MjkyMn0.8RHQ1klYvkIt1U2mk_GGNd40TNQHUNhgnvXZ3ZDV_As/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">It is the darkest week of the year. For the lucky folks in Miami, the day still lasts a little over 10 hours; in Anchorage, it lasts less than six. In Utqiagvik, Alaska — the economic center of the North Slope’s oil operations — there is no day at all; the sun last set on Nov. 16 and won’t rise again until mid-January.</p>
<p>When there is no snow, that night feels even more endless. As temperatures warm around the globe, <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/why-is-winter-warm-climate-change" target="_self"><u>snowfall is noticeably declining</u></a>, which actually makes winters in northern climates <em><em>darker</em></em> since snow reflects so much light. With some parts of the U.S. set to lose <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/ski-snowboard-season-snow-climate-change" target="_self"><u>10% to 20% of their snowpack</u></a> per decade due to climate change, darker and rainier winters are likely in store for millions of us.</p>
<p>If that news fills you with horror and despair (as it does me) then I’ve got the book for you: Kari Leibowitz’s <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780593653753" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>How to Winter</em></em></u></a>, a guide to “harnessing your mindset to thrive on cold, dark, or difficult days.” Leibowitz is a Stanford-trained health researcher and psychologist specializing in “the winter blues.” She and I first spoke in January when she <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/warm-winters-mental-health-depression" target="_self"><u>thoroughly debunked</u></a> the claim that warmer winters will make people happier. </p>
<p>Leibowitz certainly doesn’t think the loss of snow is good news. (In addition to her mindset research, she is on the Science Alliance team at Protect Our Winters, a nonprofit that mobilizes outdoor recreators to take action on environmental issues.) But if warmer winters <em><em>are </em></em>a part of our reality going forward, then she also believes we should learn to adapt to them rather than merely endure them. </p>
<p>Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. </p>
<p><strong>When we spoke in January, I was working on a piece about the common misconception that global warming and warmer winters will make people happier. Though few Americans actually look forward to darker and colder days, what </strong><em><strong><em>do</em></strong></em><strong> we lose when we lose winter?</strong></p>
<p>We lose a lot. If you live somewhere that gets below freezing or that gets snow in the winter, that opens up a huge world of winter recreation possibilities — skiing, snowshoeing, ice skating — and also a world of beauty and fascination. Even people who don’t love winter tend to think of a White Christmas and snowy cabins when they picture a winter that they <em><em>would</em></em> love. Ice and frost can be really beautiful. </p>
<p>In my personal experience, and in the experiences of many people I’ve spoken to throughout Scandinavia, a few degrees or more below freezing is much better than a few degrees above freezing because then you get that humidity, and that cold soaks into your bones. There are a lot of places in the U.S. that are really on the border, where a few degrees makes a really big difference between a colder, snowier winter and a warmer, rainier winter. Snow also reflects light; it makes it brighter during the darkest days of the year.</p>
<p><strong>I’m glad you brought that up! One of the things I learned last time we spoke was that climate change is making the world darker in the sense that snow is what reflects light in the wintertime, so warmer and drizzlier winters are potentially more difficult for us to tolerate than very cold ones. What would you recommend people who live in these transitional or rapidly changing climates do to combat the winter blues?</strong></p>
<p>Working with the darkness is key wherever you live, whether it’s somewhere snowier or less snowy. In Scandinavia, you will not see big, bright overhead lights on in people’s houses during the night or the evening in the winter. It’s almost counterintuitive because you think, “Oh, it’s dark outside, let me make it as bright as possible in here.” But that creates a really strong contrast that is tiring for our eyes and our bodies. </p>
<p>Lower lights — using candlelight — turn the darkness into an asset. You can only eat dinner by candlelight when the sun sets early; it makes the darkness part of the vibe and it also reduces the big contrast with the outdoors. That might make it easier to get outside and do things, too, because it doesn’t look as dark out compared to inside. On a gray, rainy morning, I will light candles for 15 minutes when I eat my breakfast. In the U.S., this sort of lighting is usually reserved for special occasions, but I think making it part of the everyday is really valuable. </p>
<p><strong>You also write in the book about rebranding Christmas lights as “winter lights” and leaving them up all season long.</strong></p>
<p>This is something they did in Edmonton, Canada, when they were working on their winter city strategy. It kind of kills me when the Christmas lights come down in the second week of January! We have so much winter darkness left to go and we need that light. Even at home, using twinkly lights in our living rooms makes such a difference in the vibe. </p>
<p>You can only enjoy Christmas lights or winter lights when it’s dark out, and acknowledging that darkness brings something special also helps reframe our feelings about winter.</p>
<p><strong>You wrote this book because many people struggle with the winter. But as I was reading it, I was thinking about how much I dread summer and the inescapable heat of August. Do you think the mindset strategies you suggest for winter could apply to “summering” as well?</strong></p>
<p>They are really different challenges. My theory about winter is that the cold is not as big a problem as the darkness. There is research that backs this up: Evidence shows that light makes us feel awake and that it makes us feel good, and darkness makes us feel tired and can have a mild depressant effect. But the larger message of the book, and the larger approach to the winter mindset, is to find the opportunity in the challenge that you’re facing. And that can help us with anything — including really hot summers.</p>
<p>So, what’s the opportunity? Maybe the opportunity is that you can do more things at night when the temperature is really nice; there is something really lovely about being outside at night when it’s warm! Or maybe you can spend time resting during the hottest parts of the day, like they do in places like Spain. I’ve been to other places in the Mediterranean where they have metal blackout shades that are great for sleeping and keeping it cool. We should think, “What are the opportunities here to work with the climate, to build houses differently that have better cross breezes or have atriums?” We need to work with this reality.We need to adapt.</p>
<p><strong>When did you start thinking about climate change in your winter mindset work?</strong></p>
<p>It really came from my experiences in the Arctic. I’d talk to people there and they would be like, “It’s raining in January. That’s very unusual.” When I was living in Norway [between 2014 and 2015], I went to Svalbard, and there was a bunch of stuff that I couldn’t do because it had been too warm. It had rained, and then the rain freezes on the mountain tops, and it snows on top of that, and then there’s avalanche risk. We were going to go to some ice caves and it wasn’t safe at that time. I was talking to people in Svalbard who were like, “Normally, this fjord freezes over, and we can snowmobile from place to place in the winter, but this year, we can’t.”</p>
<p>Being [in Tromsø, Norway], living there, talking to those people, and really caring about that community, and staying plugged in from afar — it’s really personal. A lot of the things that I was learning about in my research that people in Tromsø look forward to, and that make winter great, are not things that they can always count on. And I think that’s true everywhere you go.</p>

## In a calendar rarity, Hanukkah starts this year on Christmas Day

date: 2024-12-23, from: VOA News USA

Hanukkah, Judaism's eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900.


For some rabbis, the intersection of the two religious holidays provides an auspicious occasion for interfaith engagement.


"This can be a profound opportunity for learning and collaboration and togetherness," said Rabbi Josh Stanton, a vice president of the Jewish Federations of North America. He oversees interfaith initiatives involving the 146 local and regional Jewish federations that his organization represents.


"The goal is not proselytizing; it's learning deeply from each other," he said. "It's others seeing you as you see yourself."


One example of togetherness: a Chicanukah party hosted Thursday evening by several Jewish organizations in Houston, bringing together members of the city's Latino and Jewish communities for a "cross cultural holiday celebration." The venue: Houston's Holocaust museum.


The food on offer was a blend of the two cultures — for example a latke bar featuring guacamole, chili con queso and pico de gallo, as well as applesauce and sour cream. The doughnut-like pastries were sufganiyot — a Hanukkah specialty — and buñuelos, And the mariachi band took a crack at playing the Jewish folk song "Hava Nagila."


"What really brings us together is our shared values — our faith, our families, our heritage," said Erica Winsor, public affairs officer for the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston.


Rabbi Peter Tarlow, executive director of the Houston-based Center for Latino-Jewish Relations, said the first Chicanukah event 12 years ago drew 20 people, while this year the crowd numbered about 300, and could have been larger had not attendance been capped. He said the partygoers were a roughly even mix of Latinos — some of them Jews with Latin American origins — and "Anglo" Jews.




"There's too much hate, too much separation against both Jews and Latinos," Tarlow said. "This is a way we can come together and show we support each other."


While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it's taking place this year amid continuing conflicts involving Israeli forces in the Middle East, and apprehension over widespread incidents of antisemitism.


Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, acknowledged that many Jews may be feeling anxious heading into Hanukkah this year. But he voiced confidence that most would maintain the key tradition: the lighting of candles on menorah candelabras and displaying where they're visible through household windows and in public spaces.


"The posture of our community — without stridency, just with determination — is that the menorah should be in our windows, in a place where the public sees it," Hauer said.


"It is less for us, the Jewish community, than for the world," he added. "We have to share that light. Putting the menorah in the window is our expression of working to be a light among the nations."


Hauer concurred with Stanton that this year's overlap of Hanukkah and Christmas is "an exceptional opportunity to see and experience the diversity of America and the diversity of its communities of faith."


Rabbi Motti Seligson, public relations director for the Hasidic movement Chabad-Lubavitch, noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of a milestone in the public lightings of menorahs. It was on Dec. 8, 1974 — as part of an initiative launched by the Lubavitcher leader, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson — that a menorah was lit outside Philadelphia's Independence Hall, where the Liberty Bell was housed at the time.


"Hanukkah is a celebration of religious liberty, so that it's not taken for granted," Seligson said. "One of the ways of doing that is by celebrating it publicly."


He said Chabad was organizing about 15,000 public menorah lightings this year through its numerous branches around the world.




"There certainly is some apprehension," Seligson said, referring to concerns about antisemitism and political friction. "Some people question whether Jews will be celebrating as openly as in the past."


"What I'm hearing is there's no way that we can't," he added. "The only way through these difficult times is by standing stronger and prouder and shining brighter than ever."


Stanton concurred.


"Through our history, we've been through moments that are easy and moments that are hard," he said. "Safety for us does not come from hiding. It comes from reaching out."


Why is Hanukkah so late this year? The simple answer is that the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. Hanukkah always begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev, a date which occurs between late November and late December on the Gregorian calendar.


The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. But the term "Chrismukkah" — signifying the overlap of the two holidays — had become a popular term before then. The term gained extra currency in 2003, when the character Seth Cohen on the TV drama "The O.C." embraced the fusion holiday as a tribute to his Jewish father and Protestant mother.


This season, the Hallmark Channel introduced a new Christmas movie called "Leah's Perfect Gift," depicting a young Jewish woman who had admired Christmas from a distance and gets a chance to experience it up close when her boyfriend invites her to spend the holidays with his family. Spoiler alert: All does not go smoothly.


Despite such storylines suggesting a fascination with Christmas among some Jews, Stanton says research by the Jewish Federations reveals a surge in Jews seeking deeper connections to their own traditions and community, as well as a surge in Jews volunteering for charitable activities during the holidays.


"The opportunity is to share with others how we celebrate Hanukkah," he said. "It's a holiday of freedom, hope, showing proudly you are Jewish."

## Custom clocks designed for Pennsylvania's Capitol a century ago still ticking

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

Harrisburg, Pennsylvania — Capitol buildings are almost always an imposing presence. As the seat of government, they tend to be elegant and stately — and frequently capped by a dome.


Visitors to Pennsylvania 's Capitol are drawn to its priceless artwork, polished marble and intricate carvings, but hidden behind the doors of some of its most ornate offices and chambers are another treasure: hundreds of antique clocks that were part of its original design.


The 273 working clocks include many that are integrated into fireplace mantels and other building features.


They are not low maintenance, requiring regular oiling and occasional mechanical overhauls.


And every week, in a throwback to a time before wristwatches and cellphones, clock winders roam the halls — ensuring the century-plus-old timekeepers keep ticking.


On a recent morning, Bethany Gill demonstrated how it's done — going room to room with an array of ladders and custom tools. She opens the glass covers, rotates the mechanisms enough to keep them going for about a week and checks their accuracy before moving on to the next one.


Gill is a former art student who works for Johnson & Griffiths Studio, a Harrisburg firm that just received a five-year, $526,000 winding and maintenance contract renewal from the Capitol Preservation Committee.


She's also a lifelong clock lover who looks forward to the semiannual transitions between daylight saving time and Eastern Standard Time.


Why?


"My dad was a clock collector growing up," Gill said. "And every Sunday we would go around the house and wind the clocks. And that was always just a nice thing that I did with my dad."


Pennsylvania's Capitol was crafted by architect Joseph M. Huston, who won its design competition in 1901 with a vision for a temple of democracy — a palace of art that would be as fancy as what could then be found in Europe.


Among countless other fine touches, Huston designed at least 180 custom clock cases, including smaller so-called keystone clocks that are shaped to remind people of Pennsylvania's early and critical role in the formation of the United States, leaving it with the nickname of the Keystone State.


"The clocks are just part of why the building's so unique and so intricate," said Capitol Preservation Committee historian Jason Wilson. "The mantels surrounding the clocks are all custom designed."


Every so often the clocks, most of them built from mahogany or stained mahogany, are carefully removed from their spots around the Capitol and taken to a facility for cleaning, maintenance and repair. They seem to run better when kept wound.


Huston, the architect, achieved his goal. The Capitol is a showpiece that draws thousands of visitors every year to where 253 state lawmakers convene to debate and pass legislation.


While the buildings and the clocks are his lasting legacy, Huston was convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the state during the Capitol construction project and spent several months in another Pennsylvania landmark, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.

## China says US is 'playing with fire' after latest military aid for Taiwan

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

Beijing — The Chinese government protested Sunday the latest American announcements of military sales and assistance to Taiwan, warning the United States that it is "playing with fire."


U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Saturday the provision of up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and in military education and training for self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory and says must come under its control. Separately, the Defense Department said Friday that $295 million in military sales had been approved.


A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement urged the U.S. to stop arming Taiwan and stop what it called "dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait."


U.S. military sales and assistance aim to help Taiwan defend itself and deter China from launching an attack.


The $571 million in military assistance comes on top of Biden's authorization of $567 million for the same purposes in late September. The military sales include $265 million for about 300 tactical radio systems and $30 million for 16 gun mounts.


Taiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the approval of the two sales, saying in a post on X that it reaffirmed the U.S. government's "commitment to our defense."


In October, the U.S. approved $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including the first-time delivery of an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, also drawing China's criticism while Beijing has responded with war drills around Taiwan.


Taiwan earlier this month demanded that China end its ongoing military activity in nearby waters, which it said undermined peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade.


U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency.


Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense.

## Trump threatens to retake control of Panama Canal

West Palm Beach, Florida — President-elect Donald Trump threatened to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal on Sunday, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates to use the Central American passage and drawing a sharp rebuke from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino.


Speaking to a crowd of supporters in Arizona on Sunday, Trump also said he would not let the canal fall into the "wrong hands," warning of potential Chinese influence on the passage.


China does not control or administer the canal, but a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings has long managed two ports located on the Caribbean and Pacific entrances to the canal.


The president-elect's comments came hours after he leveled a similar threat against Panama in a post on Truth Social on Saturday night.


"Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal?" Trump said on Sunday at AmericaFest, an annual event organized by Turning Point, an allied conservative group. "Because we're being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we're being ripped off everywhere else."


Trump's comments were an exceedingly rare example of a U.S. leader saying he could push a sovereign country to hand over territory. It also underlines an expected shift in U.S. diplomacy under Trump, who has not historically shied away from threatening allies and using bellicose rhetoric when dealing with counterparts.


"The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, highly unfair," Trump said. "It was given to Panama and the people of Panama, but it has provisions. You get to treat us fairly, and they haven't treated us fairly. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, quickly and without question."


In a recorded message released by Panamanian President Mulino on Sunday afternoon, the nation's leader said that Panama's independence was non-negotiable and that China had no influence on the canal's administration. He also defended the passage rates Panama charged, saying they were not set "on a whim."


"Every square meter of the Panama Canal and the surrounding area belongs to Panama and will continue belonging [to Panama]," Mulino said in the statement, which was released on X.


Several other Panamanian politicians, including members of the opposition, also took to social media to criticize Trump's statements.


The United States largely built the canal and administered territory surrounding the passage for decades. But the United States and Panama signed a pair of accords in 1977 that paved the way for the canal's return to full Panamanian control. The United States handed over control of the passage in 1999 after a period of joint administration.


The waterway, which allows up to 14,000 ships to cross per year, accounts for 2.5% of global seaborne trade and is critical to U.S. imports of autos and commercial goods by container ships from Asia, and for U.S. exports of commodities, including liquefied natural gas.


It is not clear how Trump would seek to regain control over the canal, and he would have no recourse under international law if he decided to make a play for the passage.


This is not the first time Trump has openly considered territorial expansion.


During his 2017-2021 term, Trump expressed interest in buying Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He was publicly rebuffed by Danish authorities before any conversations could take place.


Trump's appearance at AmericaFest capped a four-day event that drew more than 20,000 activists.

## Native American tribe closer to acquiring more land in Arizona after decades of delay

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

Federal officials have joined with the state of Arizona to begin fulfilling a settlement agreement that was reached with the Hopi Tribe nearly three decades ago, marking what tribal officials described as a historic day.


Government attorneys filed condemnation documents on Friday to transfer dozens of square kilometers of state land into trust for the Hopi. The tribe will compensate the state nearly $4 million for more than 80 square kilometers of land near Winslow.


It could mark the first of more transfers of land into trust to help eliminate the checkerboard of ownership that characterizes much of the lands used by the tribe for ranching in northeastern Arizona.


A long time coming


Friday's filing was born out of the 1996 passage of the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act, which ratified an agreement between the Hopi and federal government that set conditions for taking land into trust for the tribe.


The wrangling over land in northeastern Arizona has been bitter, pitting the Hopi and the Navajo Nation against one another for generations. The federal government failed in its attempt to have the tribes share land and after years of escalating conflict, Congress in 1974 divided the area and ordered tribal members to leave each other's reservations.


The resulting borders meant the Navajo Nation — the country's largest reservation at close to 70,000 square kilometers — surrounded the nearly 6,500-square-kilometer Hopi reservation.


Since the 1996 settlement, the Hopi Tribe has purchased private land and sought to take neighboring state lands into trust in hopes of consolidating property for the tribe's benefit.


A historic day


There have been many roadblocks along the way, including in 2018 when the tribe sought the support of local governments in northern Arizona to back a proposed transfer for land south of the busy Interstate 40 corridor. Those efforts were stymied by the inclusion of national forest tracts in the Flagstaff area.


Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma said in a statement Friday that he was grateful for everyone who worked to make the condemnation filing a reality and that the timing for this historic moment was fitting.


"Within Hopi, it is our time of the soyal'ang ceremony — the start of the New Year and the revitalization of life," he said.


Gov. Katie Hobbs, who first visited the Hopi reservation in 2023, acknowledged that the tribe has been fighting for its rights for decades and that politicians of the past had refused to hear the voices of tribal communities.


"Every Arizonan should have an opportunity to thrive and a space to call home, and this agreement takes us one step closer to making those Arizona values a reality," she said Friday.


More transfers and economic opportunities


In November, the Navajo Nation signed a warranty deed to take into trust a parcel of land near Flagstaff as part of the federal government's outstanding obligations to support members of that tribe who were forcibly relocated as a result of the Navajo-Hopi dispute.


Navajo leaders are considering building a casino on the newly acquired land, saying such a project would provide significant economic benefits.


For the Hopi, bringing more land into trust also holds the promise of more economic opportunities. The state lands near Winslow that are part of the condemnation filing are interspersed with Hopi-owned lands and have long been leased to the tribe for ranching and agricultural purposes, according to the U.S. Justice Department.


Federal officials said Friday's filing is the first of an anticipated series of condemnation actions that ultimately would result in the transfer of more than 1440 square kilometers of state land into trust for the Hopi Tribe.

## Media report: More than 3,100 Native American children died in US boarding schools

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

Washington — At least 3,104 Native American children died in boarding schools in the United States, taken from their families to be forcibly assimilated, The Washington Post reported on Sunday, with its estimate three times higher than that of the American government.


In these establishments, some of which were religious and which existed from the beginning of the 19th century to the 1970s, many children suffered physical, psychological or sexual violence, according to a recent government report which estimated that at least 973 students died there.


In late October, U.S. President Joe Biden apologized to Native American peoples, calling the atrocities "a sin that stains our souls."


According to The Washington Post, which conducted a year-long investigation, 3,104 students lost their lives in these schools between 1828 and 1970, in what the newspaper describes as "a dark chapter in American history that has long been ignored and largely covered up."


And the toll would actually be much higher according to historians, adds the newspaper.


The Washington Post says it has "determined that more than 800 of these students were buried in or near cemeteries at the schools where they attended, underscoring that, as in many cases, the children's bodies were never returned to their families or tribes."


According to documents seen by the daily, "The causes of death included infectious diseases, malnutrition and accidents."


Dozens of Native American students have died under suspicious circumstances, the article continues, "and in some cases, documents show indications of abuse or mistreatment that likely led to the children's deaths."


The boarding schools "were not schools" but "prison camps, work camps," Judi gaiashkibos, director of the Nebraska Commission on Native Americans and whose relatives were sent there, told the newspaper.


The Joe Biden administration has implemented a series of measures to support Native American nations and improve relations with the federal state.


In the United States, reservations now administered by Native Americans are predominantly poor, with high suicide and overdose rates.


In neighboring Canada, where the same practice of residential schools for young indigenous people existed, the country has also opened its eyes in recent years to this dark page of history.

## 'Sonic 3' bests 'Mufasa' at box office

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

New York — In the holiday season battle of big-budget family movies, Paramount Pictures' "Sonic the Hedgehog 3" sped past the Walt Disney Co.'s "Mufasa: The Lion King" to take the top spot at the box office ahead of the lucrative Christmas corridor in theaters.


"Sonic the Hedgehog 3" debuted with $62 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates. With strong reviews (86% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and a high score from audiences (an "A" on CinemaScore), "Sonic 3" is well positioned to be the top choice in cinemas during the busiest moviegoing period of the year.


It was telling of some wider trends that "Sonic 3" — made for $122 million — bested one of Disney's top properties. Videogame adaptations, once among the most derided movie genres, have emerged as one of the most dependable box office forces in recent years. The two previous "Sonic" movies together grossed more $700 million worldwide and the third installment appears likely to do better than both of them. A fourth "Sonic" movie is already in development.


"Mufasa," however, was humbled in its opening weekend, with its $35 million in domestic ticket sales coming in notably shy of expectations. The photorealistic "Lion King" prequel even opened wider than "Sonic 3," launching on 4,100 theaters and gobbling up most IMAX screens, compared with 3,761 locations for "Sonic 3."


Though "Mufasa's" reviews were poor (56% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences gave it an "A-" CinemaScore.


"Sonic 3" nearly doubled the haul for "Mufasa," which cost more than $200 million to make. Disney could look to $87.2 million in international sales to help make up the difference. The third "Sonic" will roll out in most overseas markets in the coming weeks.


In director Jeff Fowler's "Sonic 3," Ben Schwartz returns as the voice of the hedgehog, alongside Tails the Fox (Colleen O'Shaughnessey), Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba) and Jim Carrey in scene-stealing dual roles as Dr. Robotnik and his grandfather.


"Moonlight" filmmaker Barry Jenkins directs "Mufasa's" voice cast, including Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Donald Glover, Beyonce Knowles-Carter, Mads Mikkelsen and Blue Ivy Carter. It follows Jon Favreau's 2019 photorealistic "The Lion King" remake, which made $1.66 billion globally despite mixed reviews. "Mufasa" didn't come close to that film's huge $191 million opening weekend.


"We felt strongly that the marketplace could support both movies and we're certainly holding up our side of the bargain," said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount.


No major franchise movie is coming this Christmas. The most anticipated Dec. 25 release might be "A Complete Unknown," with Timothee Chalamet as Bob Dylan. That means "Sonic 3" could be looking at several weeks in a row at No. 1.


"The family audience was 59% on 'Sonic 2.' This time it's 46%. That 13% drop reflects the time of year we're dealing with," said Aronson. "I think once the marketplace really cooks, 'Sonic' is going to be the dominant force."


Many of Disney's live-action adaptations – including "Aladdin," "Beauty and the Beast" and "Jungle Book" – have been big hits. Others, such as "Dumbo," "Mulan" and "The Little Mermaid," have been less well received. More are on the way, including a new "Snow White" in March, "Lilo & Stitch" in May, and plans for "Moana" and "Tangled" to get the same live-action treatment.


Despite "Mufasa's" muted opening, Disney is still celebrating its strongest annual performance in years. The studio has accounted for more than $5 billion in ticket sales worldwide, including the year's top two hits: "Inside Out 2" and "Deadpool and Wolverine." The animated "Moana 2" could give Disney the top three movies of the year. In four weeks of release, it has collected $790.2 million globally, including $13.1 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters over this weekend.


Though Christmas often sees some of the biggest releases of the year, movies released around Thanksgiving really drove the box office this season. That includes "Moana 2" and Universal Pictures' "Wicked," which managed third place in its fifth weekend.


"Wicked," the hit musical adaption starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, added $13.5 million in North American theaters to push its domestic total to $383.9 million.


Those films, among others, have led a Hollywood rebound in 2024. After a significant deficit earlier in the year, overall sales are drawing close to those of 2023. According to Comscore, the gap has narrowed to 4.4% behind last year's results. While that's still significantly less than pre-pandemic years, it's enough to flip the script on what once looked like a rough year for the movies.


Family films like "Inside Out 2," "Moana 2" and "Sonic 3" have played a major role. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, noted animated movies have accounted for 26.5% of this year's box office.


"The box office year was saved by the family audience being drawn to the multiplex," said Dergarabedian.


"Homestead," the latest release from Christian-themed Angel Studios, the distributor of "Sound of Freedom," opened with $6.1 million. It follows a group of Doomsday preparers who take shelter in a self-sufficient compound after a nuclear attack in California.


Brady Corbet's "The Brutalist," one of the year's top Oscar contenders, launched on four screens in New York and Los Angeles. Its $66,698 per-screen average was one of the highest of 2024. The post-World War II epic runs three-and-a-half hours, posing obvious theatrical challenges. A24 is trying to turn the film starring Adrien Brody and Guy Pearce into an arthouse event. It was nominated for seven Golden Globes.


Final domestic box office figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:


1. "Sonic the Hedgehog 3," $62 million.


2. "Mufasa: The Lion King," $35 million.


3. "Wicked," $13.5 million.


4. "Moana 2," $13.1 million.


5. "Homestead," $6.1 million.


6. "Gladiator II," $4.5 million.


7. "Kraven the Hunter," $3.1 million.


8. "Red One," $1.4 million.


9. "Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim," $1.3 million.


10. "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever," $825,000.

## Trump taps ex-Treasury official Miran as chair of Council of Economic Advisers

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday that Stephen Miran, a Treasury Department adviser in his first administration, would be the chair of his Council of Economic Advisers.


The council advises the president on economic policy and is composed of three members, including the chair. The council assists in the preparation of an annual report that gives an overview of the country's economy, reviews federal policies and programs and makes economic policy recommendations.


Earlier this year, Miran and economist Nouriel Roubini authored a hedge fund study that said the U.S. Treasury last year effectively provided economic stimulus by moderating long-dated bond sales.


The study echoed suggestions by Republican lawmakers that the Treasury deliberately increased issuance of short-term Treasury bills to give the economy a "sugar high" ahead of the November elections. The Treasury denied any such strategy.


Miran, a senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital, has also argued that fears over trade tariffs that Trump has threatened to impose after he takes office next month are overblown.




Trade and economic experts have said such duties would raise prices and would effectively be a new tax on consumers.


Last month, Trump tapped Kevin Hassett, who was a key economic adviser in his first term, to chair his National Economic Council, which helps set domestic and international economic policy.


Hudson Bay Capital took a position in Trump's social media firm Trump Media & Technology in the first quarter of this year.

## It's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in US

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it: it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S.


The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel at least 80 kilometers from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.


Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.


What will be the busiest travel days?


Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year — by a wide margin — was Thanksgiving Day.


The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through Jan. 2.


About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.


"Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday," AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.


Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was about $.99 a liter, down from $1 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.


Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation's highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.


Weather and other wildcards


Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups — a winter storm or a computer outage — can snowball into massive disruptions.


That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.


Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have "interline agreements" that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.


This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.


Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.


"When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference," said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.


People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.


"They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you," and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said.


Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays — Delta, United and JetBlue, for example — are now using the government standard.


Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page.


Planning ahead for 2025


Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.


"Because travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May," Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. "If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January."

## Survey: Most US teens are abstaining from drinking, smoking and marijuana

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Teen drug use hasn't rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the results from a large annual national survey released Tuesday.


About two-thirds of 12th graders this year said they hadn't used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days. That's the largest proportion abstaining since the annual survey started measuring abstinence in 2017.


Among 10th graders, 80% said they hadn't used any of those substances recently, another record. Among eighth graders, 90% didn't use any of them, the same as was reported in the previous survey.


The only significant increase occurred in nicotine pouches. About 6% of 12th graders saying they'd used them in the previous year, up from about 3% in 2023.


Whether that has the makings of a new public health problem is unclear. The University of Michigan's Richard Miech, who leads the survey, said: "It's hard to know if we're seeing the start of something, or not."


The federally funded Monitoring the Future survey has been operating since 1975. This year's findings are based on responses from about 24,000 students in grades eight, 10 and 12 in schools across the country. The survey is "one of the best, if not the best" source of national data for substance use by teens, said Noah Kreski, a Columbia University researcher who has studied teen drug use.


Early in the pandemic, students across the country were told not to go to schools and to avoid parties or other gatherings. They were at home, under parents' supervision. Alcohol and drug use of all kinds dropped because experimentation tends to occur with friends, spurred by peer pressure, experts say.


As lockdowns ended, "I think everyone expected at least a partial rebound," Miech said.


Even before the pandemic, there were longstanding declines in teen cigarette smoking, drinking and use of several types of drugs. Experts theorized that kids were staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out in groups, where they sometimes tried illicit substances.


But marijuana use wasn't falling before the pandemic. And vaping was on the upswing. It was only during the pandemic that those two saw enduring declines, too.


Some experts wonder if the pandemic lockdowns had a deeper influence.


Miech noted that a lot of teens who experiment with e-cigarettes or drugs start in the 9th grade, sometimes because older adolescents are doing it. But the kids who were 9th graders during the lockdowns never picked up the habit, and never had the opportunity to turn into negative influencers of their younger classmates, he said.


"The pandemic stopped the cycle of new kids coming in and being recruited to drug use," Miech said.


Mental health may also be a factor. There were increased reports of depression and anxiety in kids after the pandemic began. Depression is often associated with substance use, but some people with depression and anxiety are very wary of messing with drugs, said Dr. Duncan Clark, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who researches substance use in kids.


"Some teens with anxiety are worried about the effects of substances. They may also be socially inhibited and have less opportunity to use drugs," Clark said. "It's a complicated relationship."

## Nuclear bunker sales increase, despite expert warnings

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn't hold back. A grotto swimming pool with a waterfall for hot summer days. A home theater for cozy winter nights. A fruit orchard to harvest in fall. And a vast underground bunker in case disaster strikes.


"The world's not becoming a safer place," he said. "We wanted to be prepared."


Under a nondescript metal hatch near the private basketball court, there's a hidden staircase that leads down into rooms with beds for about 25 people, bathrooms and two kitchens, all backed by a self-sufficient energy source.


With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California's Inland Empire.


"If there was a nuclear strike, would you rather go into the living room or go into a bunker? If you had one, you'd go there too," said Jones, who said he reluctantly sold the home two years ago.


Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally, from small metal boxes to crawl inside to extravagant underground mansions.


Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren't focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.


Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren't necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA.


But increasingly, buyers say bunkers offer a sense of security. The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include "the rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest."


Building bunkers


"People are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it's better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it," said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard, amid showers of sparks and the loud buzz of welding at his bunker factory, which he says is the world's largest, in Sulphur Springs, Texas.


Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales.


On Nov. 21, in the hours after Russia's first-ever use of an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile to attack Ukraine, Hubbard said his phone rang nonstop.


Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building.


Hubbard said his bunkers are built for all disasters.


"They're good for anything from a tornado to a hurricane to nuclear fallout, to a pandemic to even a volcano erupting," he said, sweeping his arms toward a massive warehouse where more than 50 different bunkers were under construction.


A loaded shotgun at arm's length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices — $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 — and installations — they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker.


Under Hubbard's doomsday scenario, global tensions could lead to World War III, a situation he is prepared to live through.


"The good news about nuclear warfare," he said, "if there ever was any, that it's very survivable if you're not killed in the initial blast."


He's not wrong, say U.S. government disaster preparedness experts.




'You want to go to your most robust building'


"Look, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation," said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. Buddemeier and his colleagues are tasked with evaluating what could happen after an attack and how best to survive. "There's going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe."


Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans — who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills — educated about how to respond.


After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.


"It's going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you're going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building," he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating.


The government's efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic.


The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: "BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL."


For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what "seek immediate shelter" actually meant.


Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next.


"Gently brush your pet's coat to remove any fallout particles" it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows "enough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure."


Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said "the scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing."


If a small number of weapons detonate rather than all-out war, he said, sheltering inside a large building to avoid the fallout could save lives.


'Underground bunkers aren't going to protect people'


Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable.


"Bunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war," said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.


Sanders-Zakre called radiation the "uniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons," and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn't prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. "Ultimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons."


Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago.


"The political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war," he said. "That's something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable."


Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term.


"Even if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well," he said. "The fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound."


That's been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years.


"If we ever get to a point where there's all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren't going to protect people," he said. "Instead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially."


Next, he said, "we should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons."


Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he's disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal.


"The stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world."


McGovern pushed back against FEMA's efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter.


"What a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that's chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way," he said.


Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker.


This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons.


The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren't particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven't spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there.


"We have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible," the husband said. "It does provide a sense of security."

## Trump threatens to take back control of Panama Canal

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday slammed what he called unfair fees for U.S. ships passing through the Panama Canal and threatened to demand control of the waterway be returned to Washington.


He also hinted at China's growing influence around the canal, a worrying trend for American interests as U.S. businesses depend on the channel to move goods between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.


"Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous," he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.


"This complete 'rip-off' of our Country will immediately stop."


The Panama Canal, which was completed by the United States in 1914, was returned to the Central American country under a 1977 deal signed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter.


Panama took full control in 1999.


"It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else," Trump said. "We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!"


He continued that if Panama could not ensure "the secure, efficient and reliable operation" of the channel, "then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question."


Authorities in Panama did not immediately react to Trump's post.


Although he does not officially take office until next month, Trump has nevertheless been flexing his political influence in the waning days of President Joe Biden's administration.


The real estate mogul boasted on the campaign trail that as an entrepreneur, he was uniquely positioned to fight for U.S. business interests.


An estimated 5% of global maritime traffic passes through the Panama Canal, which allows ships traveling between Asia and the U.S. East Coast to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America.


The main users of the passage are the United States, China, Japan and South Korea.


The Panama Canal Authority reported in October that the waterway had earned record revenues of nearly $5 billion in the last fiscal year.

## Trump taps 'Apprentice' producer as special envoy to United Kingdom

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with The Apprentice, is being tapped by the president-elect as special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration.


"With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role," Trump announced Saturday.


Burnett, who was born in London, helped produce hits like Survivor and The Voice, but is perhaps best known for teaming up with Trump for The Apprentice, which first aired on NBC in 2004.


Trump had been well-known in real estate and pop culture circles for decades. But the show helped again make him a household name. Trump severed ties with NBC in 2015, the same year he launched his first White House run.


The selection of Burnett continues Trump's trend of filling out his incoming administration with people who have high-profile backgrounds in television or politics, or both, including his choice to be defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a former co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend, and ex-television doctor and unsuccessful Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz.


Trump's first campaign in 2016 was rocked by allegations about his conduct on The Apprentice and other appearances during his association with NBC, notably in footage in which he said he could sexually assault women and get away with it because he was a "star."


Almost a decade after he left his reality TV role, Trump's television career remains central to his biography and political rise. The show presented Trump Tower to tens of millions of people as a symbol of power and success before Trump launched his first campaign from the building's lobby.


"Mark is known for creating and producing some of the biggest shows in Television History," Trump wrote in his statement on Burnett, listing many of his biggest hits including, "most notably, The Apprentice" and noting that Burnett "has won 13 Emmy Awards!"


Special envoys are usually picked by presidents for the world's traditional hotspots, including the Middle East, where Trump has said he'd like Steven Witkoff to fill the role. The United Kingdom, which has long enjoyed a "special relationship" with the U.S. that makes it one of Washington's strongest global allies, is not typically a candidate for such posts.


But Trump has announced a series of special envoy positions to several top loyalists ahead of his inauguration on Jan. 20, including his former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell who he chose as envoy for special missions. That announcement joined previous ones including Adam Boehler as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.


The president-elect said Burnett "will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges."

## Stolen base king Rickey Henderson dies at 65

date: 2024-12-22, from: VOA News USA

OAKLAND, Calif. — Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, who shattered stolen base records and redefined baseball's leadoff position, has died. He was 65.


Henderson died on Friday. The Athletics said Saturday they were "shocked and heartbroken by his passing," but did not specify a cause of death.


Known as baseball's "Man of Steal," Henderson had a lengthy list of accolades and accomplishments over his 25-year career — an MVP, 10 All-Star selections, two World Series titles and a Gold Glove award.


But it was stealing bases where Henderson made his name and dominated the sport like no other.


He broke through with 100 steals in his first full season in the majors in 1980, topping Ty Cobb's AL single-season record with the Oakland Athletics. He barely slowed, playing for nine franchises over the next two decades. He broke Lou Brock's single-season record of 118 by stealing 130 bases in 1982 and led the league in steals for seven straight seasons and 12 overall.


He broke Brock's career record when he stole his 939th base on May 1, 1991, for Oakland. He famously pulled third base out of the ground and showed it off to the adoring crowd before giving a speech that he capped by saying: "Lou Brock was a great base stealer, but today I am the greatest of all time."


Henderson finished his career with 1,406 steals, a 468-steal edge over Brock.




Henderson said in September he would have had many more steals in his career and in the record-breaking 1982 season if rules introduced in 2023 to limit pickoff throws and increase the size of bases had overlapped with his career.


"If I was playing today, I would get 162, right now, without a doubt," he said.


Henderson’s accomplishment that record-breaking day in 1991 was slightly overshadowed that night when Nolan Ryan threw his record seventh career no-hitter. Henderson had been Ryan’s 5,000th career strikeout victim, which led him to say, "If you haven’t been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you’re nobody."


That was clearly not the case for Henderson. He is also the career leader in runs scored with 2,295 and in leadoff home runs with 81, ranks second to Barry Bonds with 2,190 walks and is fourth in games played (3,081) and plate appearances (13,346). He finished his career with 3,055 hits over 25 seasons spent with Oakland, the New York Yankees, Toronto, San Diego, Anaheim, the New York Mets, Seattle, Boston and the Los Angeles Dodgers.


He fittingly finished his career with the Dodgers at age 44 in 2003 by scoring a run in his final play on a major league field.


Henderson is the third prominent baseball Hall of Famer with ties to the Bay Area who died this year, following the deaths in June of former Giants stars Willie Mays and Orlando Cepeda.


Henderson was the rare position player who batted from the right side and threw with his left arm — but then again, everything about Henderson was unique.


He batted out of an extreme crouch, making for a tighter strike zone that contributed to his high walk total. He struck fear in opponents with his aggressive leads off first, his fingers twitching between his legs as he eyed the pitcher and the next base.


Born on Christmas Day in 1958 in Chicago in the back of his parents' Chevy, Henderson grew up in Oakland and developed into a star athlete. He played baseball, basketball and football at Oakland Tech High School and was a highly sought-after football recruit who could have played tailback at Southern California, where he could have played eventually with football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen.


But Henderson said his mother loved baseball and thought it would be the safer career in a decision that proved to be prescient.


"She didn’t want her baby to get hurt," Henderson told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2019. "I was mad, but she was smart. Overall, with the career longevity and the success I had, she made the right decision. Some of the players in football now have short careers and they can barely move around when they’re done."
