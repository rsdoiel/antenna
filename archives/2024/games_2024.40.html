<p>date: 2024-10-06, updated: 2024-10-04, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>October is spooky season, and the urge to settle in with some
pumpkin-scented candles with a seasonally fitting game is at an all-time
high. But while there are plenty of horror games out there for the brave
and the bold, what are the scaredy-cats to do this Halloween season? 
Never fear — we’ve collected a […]</p>

<p>Canadian filmmaker Pascal Plante was already dwelling on the eldritch
terrors that lurked below the surface of the dark web before the
COVID-19 pandemic sent him into lockdown. But by 2021, his
self-inflicted misery, combined with sitting at home for long stretches
of time, resulted in the screenplay for Red Rooms.  A brilliant

<p>Season 1 of The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power promised a
