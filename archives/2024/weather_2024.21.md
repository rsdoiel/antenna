Mesoscale Discussion 0859
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0825 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Areas affected...parts of southwestern Nebraska and adjacent
northern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 210125Z - 210300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...An intensifying supercell and perhaps small upscale
growing convective cluster appears likely to continue developing
eastward along a frontal zone into portions of southwestern Nebraska
and adjacent northern Kansas through 10 PM-Midnight CDT.  This will
be accompanied by increasing potential for large hail, severe wind
gusts and a few tornadoes.  A new watch likely will be issued within
the next hour or so.

DISCUSSION...More substantive intensification of convection across
northeastern Colorado is now underway, including one supercell now
propagating eastward across the Akron CO vicinity.  As activity
continues eastward, strengthening easterly low-level updraft inflow
will become increasingly unstable with deeper progression into the
plains.  This likely will support further upscale growth, including,
at least initially, an enlarging supercell, then perhaps a gradually
upscale growing cluster focused along the baroclinic zone (roughly
centered around 700 mb) extending eastward near/north of the
Kansas/Nebraska border vicinity.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0759 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Valid 210100Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE CENTRAL
HIGH PLAINS ACROSS SOUTHERN NE...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected through tonight from the
central High Plains to parts of the Upper Midwest. The greatest
concentration of tornadoes, large hail, and severe wind is expected
over northeast Colorado into southern Nebraska, and far northwest
Kansas. This will include potential for a strong tornado, very large
hail, and significant severe gusts.

...01Z Update...
Primary concern is with ongoing convection developing across
northeast CO into the southwest NE Panhandle. With a current of east
to southeast 0-1 km winds expected to increase during the next few
hours, afternoon CAM guidance along with recent WoFS runs are
insistent on long-lived supercell development along the southern
flank of the thunderstorm plume. This appears likely to emanate out
of the Akron, CO vicinity and move east towards the CO/KS/NE border
area. With low 60s surface dew points across northwest KS marking
the northwest extent of MLCAPE in excess of 1500 J/kg, a supercell
or two impinging on the increasingly buoyant airmass downstream, may
become intense. In addition to the risk for very large hail,
enlarging low-level hodographs will support potential for cyclic
tornadogenesis, especially in the 02-05Z time frame. Transition from
tornadic supercell to a bow will likely occur during the late
evening to early morning, with probable movement along the
pronounced MLCAPE gradient into at least south-central NE.
Increasingly large MLCIN is anticipated overnight across KS,
suggesting that the severe wind swath will remain latitudinally
confined. Downstream convection, ongoing across southeast NE,
suggests the upstream severe wind threat may wane somewhat near dawn
as the MCS approaches the Mid-MO Valley. But the potential for a
well-organized MCS to persist across much of southern NE is apparent
and warrants expansion of the level 3-ENH risk.

Elsewhere, scattered large hail and sporadic severe wind gusts
should occur this evening into the early overnight from southeast NE
to southeast MN. A lower-end QLCS across Lower MI into northwest IN
may produce locally damaging winds with strong gusts through the
rest of this evening. But this convection will likely diminish
overnight.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0449 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Valid 221200Z - 281200Z

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...

...Days 3-4/Wednesday-Thursday...
A broad large-scale trough will persist across the West, with the
strongest midlevel flow confined to the northwestern CONUS. Along
the southern periphery of the trough, moderate west-southwesterly
flow will overspread a dry/deeply mixed air mass from the Southwest
into the southern High Plains. As a result, elevated to locally
critical conditions are expected each afternoon, given increasingly
dry/receptive fuels across the region. 40-percent Critical
probabilities remain in place for these days, though confidence in
any more than locally critical conditions is too low to introduce
higher probabilities at this time. 

...Days 5-6/Friday-Saturday...
On Day 5/Friday, west-southwesterly midlevel flow will strengthen
across the Southwest, where a warm/dry antecedent air mass will be
in place. Given the strengthening midlevel flow and a modest surface
pressure gradient, critical conditions are expected on Day 5/Friday
over northeast AZ and northwest NM. Thereafter, a robust midlevel
jet streak embedded in the west-southwesterlies will overspread the
Southwest and southern High Plains on Day 6/Saturday. This will
promote another day of dry/windy conditions across the region, with
the best overlap of strong surface winds and low RH atop receptive
fuels expected over southern NM, where critical conditions are
expected. 

Elevated to locally critical conditions will likely continue on Day
7/Sunday, though midlevel flow will be slightly weaker than days
prior -- precluding 70-percent probabilities at this time.

1237 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Areas affected...the Michigan Thumb vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201737Z - 201930Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe storms capable of isolated damaging wind
and hail are possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has recently intensified near the
Thumb region of Michigan. While low-level moisture is relatively
limited, strong heating is occurring downstream of this cluster,
supporting MUCAPE of near or above 1000 J/kg. Deep-layer shear is
rather modest, but unidirectional southwesterly flow may support
some organization with this cluster as it moves northeastward
through the afternoon. Steepening low-level lapse rates will support
a threat for strong/damaging outflow gusts, while stronger embedded
cells may be capable of producing some hail. In addition, isolated
strong storm development cannot be ruled out later this afternoon to
the southwest of the ongoing cluster, along a trailing surface
boundary.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1258 PM CDT Mon May 20 2024

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHERN
IOWA...NORTHWEST ILLINOIS AND FAR NORTHEAST MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected Tuesday across the Midwest, especially
including portions of Iowa and Missouri into Wisconsin and
western/northern Illinois. Tornadoes (a few strong), damaging wind
gusts, and large hail are expected.

...Lower/Middle Missouri Valley to the Upper Great Lakes...
A notably strong belt of cyclonically curved westerlies (70+ kt 500
mb) will extend from the south-central Great Plains to the Upper
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes on Tuesday, with a lead/convectively
augmented shortwave trough likely to spread from the central High
Plains toward the Lake Superior vicinity late Tuesday night. An
elongated surface low over eastern Nebraska Tuesday morning will
deepen and lift northeast to northern Wisconsin/Upper Michigan by
evening, with a surface warm front lifting northward ahead of the
surface low, although its effective position will likely be
influenced by the early day precipitation. Meanwhile, a trailing
cold front will surge east across Iowa/eastern Kansas/northern
Missouri from mid-afternoon into the evening.

Remnant clusters of storms will likely be ongoing Tuesday morning
across central/eastern Nebraska, with the possibility of additional
storms farther east across southern Iowa/northern Missouri in
association with a warm-advection regime. Some key uncertainties
persist about the influences of this early day convection, but
trends will be for quick air mass recovery given a
progressive/highly dynamic pattern.

Very steep mid-level lapse rates will overspread the increasingly
moist warm sector, supporting aggressive diurnal destabilization
especially on the southern fringe of lingering convection/cloud
cover. Significantly strengthening mid-level winds and a diurnally
persistent strong low-level jet will support initial supercells
capable of large hail and a few tornadoes, including strong (EF2+)
tornado potential. But a mixed/transitional mode is expected
overall, as upscale growth occurs given the degree of forcing for
ascent, with likely evolution into a well-organized/fast-moving QLCS
capable of increasingly widespread/intense damaging winds and a
continued QLCS-related tornado risk. This scenario currently appears
to be most probable across southern/eastern Iowa into northwest
Illinois and nearby far northern Missouri. The severe risk will
persist into the Upper Great Lakes region and middle Mississippi
Valley overnight.

...Southern Plains...
Convective coverage will likely decrease with southward extent as
large-scale ascent focuses northward toward the Great Lakes.
Nevertheless isolated storms are possible into northeast
Oklahoma/northwest Arkansas by late afternoon/evening, and more
conditionally with southwest extent near a dryline from central
Oklahoma into central Texas. Large hail and severe gusts will be
possible with this activity.

...Northeast States...
A weak upper shortwave trough will move across southern Quebec and
northern New England. This will result in a band of enhanced
westerly deep-layer flow from northern New York into Maine. A
seasonally moist airmass will be in place with surface dewpoints
into the low 60s F, with strong heating and steepening low-level
lapse rates. MLCAPE to around 1000 J/kg and effective shear
magnitudes around 35 kt will support organized cells. Elongated
hodographs and favorable vertical shear suggest marginally severe
hail will be possible along with locally damaging wind gusts.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN/WESTERN NM
AND EASTERN AZ...

The forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments/expansions
were made to the Critical highlights in AZ, based on the latest
observational data and high-resolution guidance. See the previous
discussion below for details.

..Weinman.. 05/20/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Mon May 20 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level jet streak will overspread the Southwest this afternoon
as a mid-level trough amplifies across the western CONUS. A deeply
mixed boundary layer is expected across Arizona and New Mexico with
temperatures in the 90s. Some of this stronger flow will mix to the
surface amid the deep boundary layer. In addition, lee cyclogenesis
will tighten the pressure gradient in the region and aid in stronger
surface winds. Sustained surface winds of 25 to 30 mph are expected
across New Mexico with some sustained winds over 30 mph in northern
Arizona. Single-digit relative humidity is also expected across most
of the region. Fuels have started to dry to critical levels across
portions of eastern and northern Arizona. Therefore, a Critical
delineation is warranted.

Valid 201630Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NORTHERN ILLINOIS AND SOUTHERN WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
The primary threat for severe thunderstorms today will be over parts
of the central Plains, with large hail, damaging wind gusts, and a
few tornadoes possible.

...Central High Plains...
A large upper trough will slowly deepen across the western United
States today, with strengthening southwesterly mid/upper level flow
spreading across the Plains states.  A band of mid-level moisture
and instability will result in scattered high-based thunderstorms
across northern CO/southern WY by mid-afternoon, capable of locally
damaging wind gusts.  Other discrete supercell storms may form in
vicinity of the DCVZ as southeasterly low-level winds and elevated
terrain aid in initiation.  These storms will track
east-northeastward into a progressively more moist/unstable air
mass, with the risk of very large hail and a few tornadoes through
the evening.  By mid-evening, coverage of storms will increase over
southwest NE as a southerly low-level jet strengthens, with storms
progressing across the central Plains overnight with a continued
risk of large hail and damaging winds.

...IL/WI...
A well-defined remnant MCV from overnight convection over KS is
currently over northeast IA.  A surface boundary extends eastward
from the low across northern IL.  Broken clouds and partial
afternoon heating will aid in the development of thunderstorms near
the MCV later today as it tracks across southern WI/northern IL. 
Any storm that can interact with the boundary would have the
potential to become a supercell and pose a risk of a tornado or two.
 Otherwise, hail and gusty winds could occur with the strongest
cells.

...Southeast FL...
Widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms are possible across
southeast FL.  Ample low-level moisture, strong heating, cyclonic
midlevel flow, and relatively steep lapse rates could result in a
strong storm or two capable of gusty winds and hail.
