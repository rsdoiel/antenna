frozen-in-time Roman city</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I love exploring the world of ancient Rome, with its grand architecture, fascinating culture, and stories of larger-than-life leaders. But since many of the 2,000-year-old empire&amp;#8217;s landmarks are reduced to ruins, it can be hard to make sense of the stones and rubble left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2024-11-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Native Hawaiian oral traditions record a rich history of the changing volcanic landscape in Hawai&amp;#8216;i. Interweaving cultural knowledge with scientific disciplines can provide a more complete understanding of past events, including the largest known lava flow eruption of Kilauea. &lt;/p&gt;
