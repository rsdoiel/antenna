## Concluding thoughts

date: 2024-11-24, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

## Woody down

date: 2024-11-24, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

USC&#8217;s leading running back – and the team&#8217;s X-factor – Woody Marks looks to be on the ground.
Redshirt senior defensive back K.J. Wallace manages a perfectly timed blitz that brings Marks down, and should he stay down, it&#8217;ll be a big loss for the Trojans.
