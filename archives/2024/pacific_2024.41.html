<p>date: 2024-10-13, updated: 2024-10-13, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH is we are seeing MORE Taxes, fewer flights with arrivals
continuing to decline WE must ask, if WE ask “are WE better off now than
before Covid, the answer will be a resounding NO, as NOTHING has changed
FOR the better FOR the People nor FOR the CNMI. The impotence in our
economy FOR the People is obvious with no real improvements and nothing
even planned to improve our economy other than crying to the Feds &amp;
taxes. This is WHY I’ve been screaming &amp; yelling for YEARS to get a
real economist on the Hill working with our Executive &amp; Legislature
but instead WE continue to suffer under what I see as picnic table
discussions &amp; decisions on our economy. Just because one may be
smart, it by-no-means qualifies them as an economist — so WHO is really
our Economist!!!</p>
