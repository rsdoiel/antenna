## Willie On My Mind

date: 2024-01-28, from: Dan Rather's Steady

I was reminiscing recently about songs that are close to my heart. So many country songs from my younger years pop into my head at the oddest times these days, but I heard one recently from my friend Willie Nelson that reminded me of another time in Texas, a gentler time, and it&#8217;s certainly a reason to smile. Back in 1982, Willie recorded &#8220;Always On My Mind.&#8221;
