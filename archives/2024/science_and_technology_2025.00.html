<h2 id="chimera-linux-enters-beta">Chimera Linux enters beta</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve talked about Chimera Linux before – it’s a unique Linux
distribution that combines a BSD userland with the LLVM/Clang toolchain,
and musl. Its init system is dinit, and it uses apk-tools from Alpine as
its package manager. None of this has anything to do with being
anti-anything; the choice of BSD’s tools and userland is mostly
technical in nature. Chimera Linux is available for x86-64, AArch64,
RISC-V, and POWER (both little and big endian). I am unreasonably
excited for Chimera Linux, for a variety of reasons – first, I love the
above set of choices they made, and second, Chimera Linux’ founder and
lead developer, q66, is a well-known and respected name in this space.
She not only founded Chimera Linux, but also used to maintain the
POWER/PowerPC ports of Void Linux, which is the port of Void Linux I
used on my POWER9 hardware. She apparently also contributed quite a bit
to Enlightenment, and is currently employed by Igalia, through which she
can work on Chimera. With the description out of the way, here’s the
news: Chimera Linux has officially entered beta. Today we have
updated apk-tools to an rc tag. With this, the project is now entering
beta phase, after around a year and a half. In general, this does not
actually mean much, as the project is rolling release and updates will
simply keep coming. It is more of an acknowledgement of current status,
though new images will be released in the coming days. ↫ Chimera Linux’s
website Despite my excitement, I haven’t yet tried Chimera Linux myself,
as I figured its pre-beta stage wasn’t meant for an idiot like me who
can’t contribute anything meaningful, and I’d rather not clutter the
airwaves. Now that it’s entered beta, I feel like the time is getting
riper and riper for me to dive in, and perhaps write about it here.
Since the goal of Chimera Linux is to be a general-purpose distribution,
I think I’m right in the proper demographic of users. It helps that I’m
about to set up my dual-processor POWER9 machine again, and I think I’ll
be going with Chimera Linux. As a final note, you may have noticed I
consistently refer to it as “Chimera Linux”. This is very much on
purpose, as there’s also something called ChimeraOS, a more standard
Linux distribution aimed at gaming. To avoid confusion, I figured I’d
keep the naming clear and consistent.</p>

10.1 on a 1998 Toshiba laptop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Here are my notes on running NetBSD 10.1 on my first personal laptop
that I still keep, a 1998 i586 Toshiba Satellite Pro with 81Mb of RAM
and a 1Gb IBM 2.5″ IDE HD. In summary, the latest NetBSD runs well on
this old hardware using an IDE to CF adapter and several changes to the
i386 GENERIC kernel. ↫ Joel P. I don’t think the BSD world – and NetBSD
in particular – gets enough recognition for supporting both weird
architectures and old hardware as well as it does. This here is a 26
year old laptop running the latest version of NetBSD, working X11 server
and all, while other operating systems drop support for devices only a
few years old. So many devices could be saved from toxic landfills if
only more people looked beyond Windows and macOS.</p>
