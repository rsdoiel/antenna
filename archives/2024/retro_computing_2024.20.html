<p>Sometimes success smacks you right in the face. More often, it sneaks
up on you from behind. In September of 1993, the brothers Rand and Robyn
Miller and the few other employees of Cyan, Inc., were prototypical
starving artists, living on “rice and beans and government cheese.” That
month they saw Brøderbund publish their esoteric […]</p>

Edlin is an awesome line-oriented editor. That means you edit one line
at a time, not full-screen. Gregory Pietsch has released Edlin version
2.24 that moves the copyright and program info to the ‘?’ help screen.
It also changes the “Abort edit?” prompt when you exit to “Really quit?”
I love these changes; I use Edlin to write quick batch files, like to
capture some commands I just ran as a BAT file, and moving the copyright
info to the ‘?’ page means the commands don’t scroll off the screen.
Thanks Gregory! You can find the new version at
<a class="" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freedos-edlin/">FreeDOS
Edlin at SF</a> or mirrored at the FreeDOS Files Archive at Ibiblio
under
<a class="" href="https://ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/dos/edlin/2.24/" rel="nofollow">/files/dos/edlin</a>.
We’ve also mirrored an EXE you can run.

<p>The RISC OS Developments programmer behind Pinboard2, the Wi-Fi
drivers, and more Since its inception, with the original aim of
producing a web browser, there have been a lot of good news coming out
of RISC OS Developments Ltd (ROD) – from the browser itself, Iris
(albeit still in testing and not yet ready for public release), taking
on ownership of the operating system and releasing it under a truly open
licence, and much more, including development of additional software.
Some of that other software – such as Pinboard2, a…</p>

Pro Quake</h2>

<p>If you’re a fan of video games in general, and first person shooters
in particular, another title in that genre has been given a little
attention by R-Comp – this time it’s Quake. The update builds on the
2018 release of the game, which brought boosted performance to the game
when run on more modern CPUs, adding support for floating point
abilities of the processors, and profiles to take advantage of the
higher resolution screens, and so on. The new version builds on that,
with updated profiles for higher resolutions…</p>

<p>Kevin Wells is adding multi-language support to his StreetFix
application, which can be used to report and check up on local issues,
such as potholes, broken bollards, street lights not working, and so on.
To that end, he’s running a poll on whether the choice for the language
name should be in English, or specified in the language in question –
for example, should Swedish be identified as that, making it obvious for
English speakers, or should it be Svenska, to make it clearer to Swedish
speakers? The poll was…</p>
