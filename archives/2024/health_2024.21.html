factors of SARS-CoV-2 in infection, pathogenesis, and long-term
effects</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is the causative virus of the devastating COVID-19
pandemic that results in an unparalleled global health and economic
crisis. Despite unprecedented scientific efforts and therapeutic
interventions, the fight against COVID-19 continues as the rapid
emergence of different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and the increasing
challenge of long COVID-19, raising a vast demand to understand the
pathomechanisms of COVID-19 and its long-term sequelae and develop
therapeutic strategies beyond the virus per se. Notably, in addition to
the virus itself, the replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and clinical
severity of COVID-19 is also governed by host factors. In this review,
we therefore comprehensively overview the replication cycle and
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of host factors and
host-virus interactions. We sequentially outline the pathological
implications of molecular interactions between host factors and
SARS-CoV-2 in multi-organ and multi-system long COVID-19, and summarize
current therapeutic strategies and agents targeting host factors for
treating these diseases. This knowledge would be key for the
identification of new pathophysiological aspects and mechanisms, and the
development of actionable therapeutic targets and strategies for
tackling COVID-19 and its sequelae.</p>

omega-3 postbiotic trans-10-cis-15-octadecadienoic acid attenuates
contact hypersensitivity in mice through downregulation of vascular
endothelial growth factor A</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Intestinal bacteria metabolize dietary substances to produce
bioactive postbiotics, among which some are recognized for their role in
promoting host health. We here explored the postbiotic potential of two
omega-3 α-linolenic acid–derived metabolites:
trans-10-cis-15-octadecadienoic acid (t10,c15-18:2) and
cis-9-cis-15-octadecadienoic acid (c9,c15-18:2). Dietary intake of
lipids rich in omega-3 α-linolenic acid elevated levels of t10,c15-18:2
and c9,c15-18:2 in the serum and feces of mice, an effect dependent on
the presence of intestinal bacteria. Notably, t10,c15-18:2 mitigated
skin inflammation in mice that became hypersensitive after exposure to
2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, an experimental model for allergic contact
dermatitis. In particular, t10,c15-18:2—but not c9,c15-18:2—attenuated
ear swelling and edema, characteristic symptoms of contact
hypersensitivity. The anti-inflammatory effects of t10,c15-18:2 were due
to its ability to suppress the release of vascular endothelial growth
factor A from keratinocytes, thereby mitigating the enhanced vascular
permeability induced by hapten stimulation. Our study identified
retinoid X receptor as a functional receptor that mediates the
downregulation of skin inflammation upon treatment with t10,c15-18:2.
Our results suggest that t10,c15-18:2 holds promise as an omega-3 fatty
acid–derived postbiotic with potential therapeutic implications for
alleviating the skin edema seen in allergic contact dermatitis–induced
inflammation.</p>

of genetic distance threshold for inferring the CRF01_AE molecular
network based on next-generation sequencing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHIV molecular network based on genetic distance (GD) has
been extensively utilized. However, the GD threshold for the non-B
subtype differs from that of subtype B. This study aimed to optimize the
GD threshold for inferring the CRF01_AE molecular
network.MethodsNext-generation sequencing data of partial CRF01_AE pol
sequences were obtained for 59 samples from 12 transmission pairs
enrolled from a high-risk cohort during 2009 and 2014. The paired GD was
calculated using the Tamura-Nei 93 model to infer a GD threshold range
for HIV molecular networks.Results2,019 CRF01_AE pol sequences and
information on recent HIV infection (RHI) from newly diagnosed
individuals in Shenyang from 2016 to 2019 were collected to construct
molecular networks to assess the ability of the inferred GD thresholds
to predict recent transmission events. When HIV transmission occurs
within a span of 1-4 years, the mean paired GD between the sequences of
the donor and recipient within the same transmission pair were as
follow: 0.008, 0.011, 0.013, and 0.023 substitutions/site. Using these
four GD thresholds, it was found that 98.9%, 96.0%, 88.2%, and 40.4% of
all randomly paired GD values from 12 transmission pairs were correctly
identified as originating from the same transmission pairs. In the real
world, as the GD threshold increased from 0.001 to 0.02
substitutions/site, the proportion of RHI within the molecular network
gradually increased from 16.6% to 92.3%. Meanwhile, the proportion of
links with RHI gradually decreased from 87.0% to 48.2%. The two curves
intersected at a GD of 0.008 substitutions/site.DiscussionA suitable
range of GD thresholds, 0.008-0.013 substitutions/site, was identified
to infer the CRF01_AE molecular transmission network and identify HIV
transmission events that occurred within the past three years. This
finding provides valuable data for selecting an appropriate GD
thresholds in constructing molecular networks for non-B subtypes.</p>

neoformans trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (tps1) promotes organ-specific
virulence and fungal protection against multiple lines of host
defenses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS1) was identified as a virulence
factor for Cryptococcus neoformans and a promising therapeutic target.
This study reveals previously unknown roles of TPS1 in evasion of host
defenses during pulmonary and disseminated phases of infection. In the
pulmonary infection model, TPS1-deleted (tps1Δ) Cryptococci are rapidly
cleared by mouse lungs whereas TPS1-sufficent WT (H99) and revertant
(tps1Δ:TPS1) strains expand in the lungs and disseminate, causing 100%
mortality. Rapid pulmonary clearance of tps1Δ mutant is T-cell
independent and relies on its susceptibility to lung resident factors
and innate immune factors, exemplified by tps1Δ but not H99 inhibition
in a coculture with dispersed lung cells and its rapid clearance
coinciding with innate leukocyte infiltration. In the disseminated model
of infection, which bypasses initial lung–fungus interactions, tps1Δ
strain remains highly attenuated. Specifically, tps1Δ mutant is unable
to colonize the lungs from the bloodstream or expand in spleens but is
capable of crossing into the brain, where it remains controlled even in
the absence of T cells. In contrast, strains H99 and tps1Δ:TPS1 rapidly
expand in all studied organs, leading to rapid death of the infected
mice. Since the rapid pulmonary clearance of tps1Δ mutant resembles a
response to acapsular strains, the effect of tps1 deletion on capsule
formation in vitro and in vivo was examined. Tps1Δ cryptococci form
capsules but with a substantially reduced size. In conclusion, TPS1 is
an important virulence factor, allowing C. neoformans evasion of
resident pulmonary and innate defense mechanisms, most likely via its
role in cryptococcal capsule formation.</p>

liability of gut microbiota for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lung
function: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe microbiota-gut-lung axis has elucidated a potential
association between gut microbiota and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF). However, there is a paucity of population-level studies with
providing robust evidence for establishing causality. This two-sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis aimed to investigate the causal
relationship between the gut microbiota and IPF as well as lung
function.Materials and methodsAdhering to Mendel’s principle of
inheritance, this MR analysis utilized summary-level data from
respective genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving 211 gut
microbial taxa, IPF, and lung function indicators such as FEV1, FVC, and
FEV1/FVC. A bidirectional two-sample MR design was employed, utilizing
multiple MR analysis methods, including inverse variance-weighted (IVW),
weighted median, MR-Egger, and weighted mode. Multivariable MR (MVMR)
was used to uncover mediating factors connecting the exposure and
outcome. Additionally, comprehensive sensitivity analyses were conducted
to ensure the robustness of the results.ResultsThe MR results confirmed
four taxa were found causally associated with the risk of IPF. Order
Bifidobacteriales (OR=0.773, 95% CI: 0.610–0.979, p=0.033), Family
Bifidobacteriaceae (OR=0.773, 95% CI: 0.610–0.979, p=0.033), and Genus
RuminococcaceaeUCG009 (OR=0.793, 95% CI: 0.652–0.965, p=0.020) exerted
protective effects on IPF, while Genus Coprococcus2 (OR=1.349, 95% CI:
1.021–1.783, p=0.035) promote the development of IPF. Several taxa were
causally associated with lung function, with those in Class
Deltaproteobacteria, Order Desulfovibrionales, Family
Desulfovibrionaceae, Class Verrucomicrobiae, Order Verrucomicrobiales
and Family Verrucomicrobiaceae being the most prominent beneficial
microbiota, while those in Family Lachnospiraceae, Genus Oscillospira,
and Genus Parasutterella were associated with impaired lung function. As
for the reverse analysis, MR results confirmed the effects of FEV1 and
FVC on the increased abundance of six taxa (Phylum Actinobacteria, Class
Actinobacteria, Order Bifidobacteriales, Family Bifidobacteriaceae,
Genus Bifidobacterium, and Genus Ruminiclostridium9) with a boosted
level of evidence. MVMR suggested monounsaturated fatty acids, total
fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to
total fatty acids as potential mediating factors in the genetic
association between gut microbiota and IPF.ConclusionThe current study
suggested the casual effects of the specific gut microbes on the risk of
IPF and lung function. In turn, lung function also exerted a positive
role in some gut microbes. A reasonable dietary intake of lipid
substances has a certain protective effect against the occurrence and
progression of IPF. This study provides novel insights into the
potential role of gut microbiota in IPF and indicates a possible gut
microbiota-mediated mechanism for the prevention of IPF.</p>

burnetii-containing vacuoles interact with host recycling endosomal
proteins Rab11a and Rab35 for vacuolar expansion and bacterial
growth</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCoxiella burnetii is a gram-negative obligate
intracellular bacterium and a zoonotic pathogen that causes human Q
fever. The lack of effective antibiotics and a licensed vaccine for
Coxiella in the U.S. warrants further research into Coxiella
pathogenesis. Within the host cells, Coxiella replicates in an acidic
phagolysosome-like vacuole termed Coxiella-containing vacuole (CCV).
Previously, we have shown that the CCV pH is critical for Coxiella
survival and that the Coxiella Type 4B secretion system regulates CCV pH
by inhibiting the host endosomal maturation pathway. However, the
trafficking pattern of the ‘immature’ endosomes in Coxiella- infected
cells remained unclear.MethodsWe transfected HeLa cells with GFP-tagged
Rab proteins and subsequently infected them with mCherry-Coxiella to
visualize Rab protein localization. Infected cells were immunostained
with anti-Rab antibodies to confirm the Rab localization to the CCV, to
quantitate Rab11a and Rab35- positive CCVs, and to quantitate total
recycling endosome content of infected cells. A dual-hit siRNA mediated
knockdown combined with either immunofluorescent assay or an
agarose-based colony-forming unit assay were used to measure the effects
of Rab11a and Rab35 knockdown on CCV area and Coxiella intracellular
growth.ResultsThe CCV localization screen with host Rab proteins
revealed that recycling endosome-associated proteins Rab11a and Rab35
localize to the CCV during infection, suggesting that CCV interacts with
host recycling endosomes during maturation. Interestingly, only a subset
of CCVs were Rab11a or Rab35-positive at any given time point.
Quantitation of Rab11a/Rab35-positive CCVs revealed that while Rab11a
interacts with the CCV more at 3 dpi, Rab35 is significantly more
prevalent at CCVs at 6 dpi, suggesting that the CCV preferentially
interacts with Rab11a and Rab35 depending on the stage of infection.
Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in Rab11a and Rab35
fluorescent intensity in Coxiella-infected cells compared to mock,
suggesting that Coxiella increases the recycling endosome content in
infected cells. Finally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rab11a and Rab35
resulted in significantly smaller CCVs and reduced Coxiella
intracellular growth, suggesting that recycling endosomal Rab proteins
are essential for CCV expansion and bacterial
multiplication.DiscussionOur data, for the first time, show that the CCV
dynamically interacts with host recycling endosomes for Coxiella
intracellular survival and potentially uncovers novel host cell factors
essential for Coxiella pathogenesis.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPseudomonas aeruginosa is notorious for its multidrug
resistance and its involvement in hospital-acquired infections. In this
study, 20 bacterial strains isolated from soil samples near the Hindan
River in Ghaziabad, India, were investigated for their biochemical and
morphological characteristics, with a focus on identifying strains with
exceptional drug resistance and pyocyanin production.MethodsThe isolated
bacterial strains were subjected to biochemical and morphological
analyses to characterize their properties, with a particular emphasis on
exopolysaccharide production. Strain GZB16/CEES1, exhibiting remarkable
drug resistance and pyocyanin production. Biochemical and molecular
analyses, including sequencing of its 16S rRNA gene (accession number
LN735036.1), plasmid-curing assays, and estimation of plasmid size, were
conducted to elucidate its drug resistance mechanisms and further
pyocynin based target the Candida albicans Strain GZB16/CEES1
demonstrated 100% resistance to various antibiotics used in the
investigation, with plasmid-curing assays, suggesting plasmid-based
resistance gene transmission. The plasmid in GZB16/CEES1 was estimated
to be approximately 24 kb in size. The study focused on P. aeruginosa’s
pyocyanin production, revealing its association with anticandidal
activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the bacterial
extract against Candida albicans was 50 μg/ml, with a slightly lower
pyocyanin-based MIC of 38.5 μg/ml. Scanning electron microscopy
illustrated direct interactions between P. aeruginosa strains and
Candida albicans cells, leading to the destruction of the
latter.DiscussionThese findings underscore the potential of P.
aeruginosa in understanding microbial interactions and developing
strategies to combat fungal infections. The study highlights the
importance of investigating bacterial-fungal interactions and the role
of pyocyanin in antimicrobial activity. Further research in this area
could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for
combating multidrug-resistant infections.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aimed to determine whether combined of pathogen
detection strategies, including specimen acquisition, culture
conditions, and molecular diagnostics, can improve treatment outcomes in
patients with periprosthetic joint infections (PJI).MethodsThis
retrospective study included suspected PJI cases from three sequential
stages at our institution: Stage A (July 2012 to June 2015), Stage B
(July 2015 to June 2018), and Stage C (July 2018 to June 2021). Cases
were categorized into PJI and aseptic failure (AF) groups based on
European Bone and Joint Infection Society (EBJIS) criteria. Utilization
of pathogen diagnostic strategies, pathogen detection rates, targeted
antibiotic prescription rates, and treatment outcomes were analyzed and
compared across the three stages.ResultsA total of 165 PJI cases and 38
AF cases were included in this study. With the progressive
implementation of the three optimization approaches across stages A, B
and C, pathogen detection rates exhibited a gradual increase
(χ2 = 8.282, P=0.016). Similarly, utilization of targeted antibiotic
therapy increased stepwise from 57.1% in Stage A, to 82.3% in Stage B,
and to 84% in Stage C (χ2 = 9.515, P=0.009). The 2-year infection
control rate exceeded 90% in both stages B and C, surpassing stage A
(71.4%) (χ2 = 8.317, P=0.011). Combined application of all three
optimized protocols yielded the highest sensitivity of 91.21% for
pathogen detection, while retaining higher specificity of
92.11%.ConclusionThe utilization of combined pathogen diagnostic
strategies in PJI can increase pathogen detection rates, improve
targeted antibiotic prescription, reduce the occurrence of antibiotic
complications, and achieve better treatment outcomes.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>With the increasing research on the exploitation of rumen microbial
resources, rumen probiotics have attracted much attention for their
positive contributions in promoting nutrient digestion, inhibiting
pathogenic bacteria, and improving production performance. In the past
two decades, macrogenomics has provided a rich source of new-generation
probiotic candidates, but most of these “dark substances” have not been
successfully cultured due to the restrictive growth conditions. However,
fueled by high-throughput culture and sorting technologies, it is
expected that the potential probiotics in the rumen can be exploited on
a large scale, and their potential applications in medicine and
agriculture can be explored. In this paper, we review and summarize the
classical techniques for isolation and identification of rumen
probiotics, introduce the development of droplet-based high-throughput
cell culture and single-cell sequencing for microbial culture and
identification, and finally introduce promising cultureomics techniques.
The aim is to provide technical references for the development of
related technologies and microbiological research to promote the further
development of the field of rumen microbiology research.</p>

of extracellular vesicles in orchestration of immune responses in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the causative agent of
Tuberculosis, is an intracellular bacterium well known for its ability
to subvert host energy and metabolic pathways to maintain its
intracellular survival. For this purpose, the bacteria utilize various
mechanisms of which extracellular vehicles (EVs) related mechanisms
attracted more attention. EVs are nanosized particles that are released
by almost all cell types containing active biomolecules from the cell of
origin and can target bioactive pathways in the recipient cells upon
uptake. It is hypothesized that M.tb dictates the processes of host EV
biogenesis pathways, selectively incorporating its molecules into the
host EV to direct immune responses in its favor. During infection with
Mtb, both mycobacteria and host cells release EVs. The composition of
these EVs varies over time, influenced by the physiological and
nutritional state of the host environment. Additionally, different EV
populations contribute differently to the pathogenesis of disease at
various stages of illness participating in a complex interplay between
host cells and pathogens. These interactions ultimately influence immune
responses and disease outcomes. However, the precise mechanisms and
roles of EVs in pathogenicity and disease outcomes remain to be fully
elucidated. In this review, we explored the properties and function of
EVs in the context of M.tb infection within the host microenvironment
and discussed their capacity as a novel therapeutic strategy to combat
tuberculosis.</p>

human alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a host target for the
rabies virus glycoprotein</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The rabies virus enters the nervous system by interacting with
several molecular targets on host cells to modify behavior and trigger
receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virion by poorly understood
mechanisms. The rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) interacts with the
muscle acetylcholine receptor and the neuronal α4β2 subtype of the
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) family by the putative
neurotoxin-like motif. Given that the neurotoxin-like motif is highly
homologous to the α7 nAChR subtype selective snake toxin α-bungarotoxin
(αBTX), other nAChR subtypes are likely involved. The purpose of this
study is to determine the activity of the RVG neurotoxin-like motif on
nAChR subtypes that are expressed in brain regions involved in rabid
animal behavior. nAChRs were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and
two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology was used to collect
concentration-response data to measure the functional effects. The RVG
peptide preferentially and completely inhibits α7 nAChR ACh-induced
currents by a competitive antagonist mechanism. Tested heteromeric
nAChRs are also inhibited, but to a lesser extent than the α7 subtype.
Residues of the RVG peptide with high sequence homology to αBTX and
other neurotoxins were substituted with alanine. Altered RVG
neurotoxin-like peptides showed that residues phenylalanine 192,
arginine 196, and arginine 199 are important determinants of RVG peptide
apparent potency on α7 nAChRs, while serine 195 is not. The evaluation
of the rabies ectodomain reaffirmed the observations made with the RVG
peptide, illustrating a significant inhibitory impact on α7 nAChR with
potency in the nanomolar range. In a mammalian cell culture model of
neurons, we confirm that the RVG peptide binds preferentially to cells
expressing the α7 nAChR. Defining the activity of the RVG peptide on
nAChRs expands our understanding of basic mechanisms in host-pathogen
interactions that result in neurological disorders.</p>

id="effect-of-three-oral-pathogens-on-the-tma-tmao-metabolic-pathway">Effect
of three oral pathogens on the TMA-TMAO metabolic pathway</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundTrimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is produced by hepatic
flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) from trimethylamine (TMA). High
TMAO level is a biomarker of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic
disorders, and it also affects periodontitis through interactions with
the gastrointestinal microbiome. While recent findings indicate that
periodontitis may alter systemic TMAO levels, the specific mechanisms
linking these changes and particular oral pathogens require further
clarification.MethodsIn this study, we established a C57BL/6J male mouse
model by orally administering Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis,
Pg), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum, Fn), Streptococcus mutans
(S. mutans, Sm) and PBS was used as a control. We conducted LC-MS/MS
analysis to quantify the concentrations of TMAO and its precursors in
the plasma and cecal contents of mice. The diversity and composition of
the gut microbiome were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. TMAO-related
lipid metabolism and enzymes in the intestines and liver were assessed
by qPCR and ELISA methods. We further explored the effect of Pg on FMO3
expression and lipid molecules in HepG2 cells by stimulating the cells
with Pg-LPS in vitro.ResultsThe three oral pathogenic bacteria were
orally administered to the mice for 5 weeks. The Pg group showed a
marked increase in plasma TMAO, betaine, and creatinine levels, whereas
no significant differences were observed in the gut TMAO level among the
four groups. Further analysis showed similar diversity and composition
in the gut microbiomes of both the Pg and Fn groups, which were
different from the Sm and control groups. The profiles of TMA-TMAO
pathway-related genera and gut enzymes were not significantly different
among all groups. The Pg group showed significantly higher liver FMO3
levels and elevated lipid factors (IL-6, TG, TC, and NEFA) in contrast
to the other groups. In vitro experiments confirmed that stimulation of
HepG2 cells with Pg-LPS upregulated the expression of FMO3 and increased
the lipid factors TC, TG, and IL-6.ConclusionThis study conclusively
demonstrates that Pg, compared to Fn and Sm, plays a critical role in
elevating plasma TMAO levels and significantly influences the TMA-TMAO
pathway, primarily by modulating the expression of hepatic FMO3 and
directly impacting hepatic lipid metabolism.</p>

of omadacycline in the treatment of Legionella pneumonia: a case
report</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Legionella, one of the main pathogens that causes community-acquired
pneumonia, can lead to Legionella pneumonia, a condition characterized
predominantly by severe pneumonia. This disease, caused by the bacterium
Legionella pneumophila, can quickly progress to critical pneumonia and
is often associated with damage to multiple organs. As a result, it
requires close attention in terms of clinical diagnosis and treatment.
Omadacycline, a new type of tetracycline derivative belonging to the
aminomethylcycline class of antibiotics, is a semi-synthetic compound
derived from minocycline. Its key structural feature, the aminomethyl
modification, allows omadacycline to overcome bacterial resistance and
broadens its range of effectiveness against bacteria. Clinical studies
have demonstrated that omadacycline is not metabolized in the body, and
patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction do not need to adjust their
dosage. This paper reports a case of successful treatment of Legionella
pneumonia with omadacycline in a patient who initially did not respond
to empirical treatment with moxifloxacin. The patient also experienced
electrolyte disturbance, as well as dysfunction in the liver and
kidneys, delirium, and other related psychiatric symptoms.</p>

stratification and survival time of patients with gram-negative
bacillary pneumonia in the intensive care unit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPneumonia is a common infection in the intensive care
unit (ICU), and gram-negative bacilli are the most common bacterial
cause. The purpose of the study was to investigate the risk factors for
30-day mortality in patients with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia in
the ICU, construct a predictive model, and stratify patients based on
risk to assess their short-term survival.MethodsPatients admitted to the
ICU with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia at Fujian Medical University
Affiliated First Hospital between January 2018 and September 2020 were
selected. Patients were divided into deceased and survivor groups based
on whether death occurred within 30 days. Multifactorial logistic
regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for
30-day mortality in these patients, and a predictive nomogram model was
constructed based on these factors. Patients were categorized into low-,
medium-, and high-risk groups according to the model’s predicted
probability, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to assess
short-term survival.ResultsThe study included 305 patients. Lactic acid
(odds ratio [OR], 1.524, 95% CI: 1.057-2.197), tracheal intubation (OR:
4.202, 95% CI: 1.092-16.169), and acute kidney injury (OR:4.776, 95% CI:
1.632-13.978) were identified as independent risk factors for 30-day
mortality. A nomogram prediction model was established based on these
three factors. Internal validation of the model showed a Hosmer-Lemeshow
test result of X2=5.770, P=0.834, and an area under the ROC curve of
0.791 (95% CI: 0.688-0.893). Bootstrap resampling of the original data
1000 times yielded a C-index of 0.791, and a decision curve analysis
indicated a high net benefit when the threshold probability was between
15%-90%. The survival time for low-, medium-, and high-risk patients was
30 (30, 30), 30 (16.5, 30), and 17 (11, 27) days, respectively, which
were significantly different.ConclusionLactic acid, tracheal intubation,
and acute kidney injury were independent risk factors for 30-day
mortality in patients in the ICU with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia.
The predictive model constructed based on these factors showed good
predictive performance and helped assess short-term survival,
facilitating early intervention and treatment.</p>
