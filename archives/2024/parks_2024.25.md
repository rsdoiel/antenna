<p>“This plan is a collaborative effort of communities, Tribes, local governments, and other partners,” said <strong>BLM California Acting State Director Gordon Toevs</strong>. “Together, we have developed a plan that reflects stakeholder values, allowing for informed decisions and conservation reflective of the BLM’s multiple-use mission.”</p>

<p>The management plans for the Redding and Arcata field offices have not been updated since the mid-1990s. The proposed plan addresses changing use patterns, provides for a broad array of recreation uses, plans for wilderness management, and protects and conserves <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/wild-and-scenic-rivers">Wild and Scenic Rivers</a> and <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/planning-and-nepa/planning-101/special-planning-designations/acec-s">Areas of Critical Environmental Concern</a>.</p>

Please visit the BLM&nbsp;<a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/planning-and-nepa/public-participation/filing-a-plan-protest" target="_blank">Filing a Plan Protest</a>&nbsp;page for instructions.</p>
