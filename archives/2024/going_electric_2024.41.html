Who said
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/electric-vehicles/">electric
vehicles</a> are too expensive? With several EVs on sale for lease under
$200 a month this October, the prices prove otherwise. Here are some of
the best EV lease deals this month.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of October 2024. We’re still enjoying the tail end of
some great summer pricing as e-bike companies push to move their
inventory! Just like
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/">
ultra-competitive e-bike selling year</a> last year, 2024 has been a
year of impressive e-bike sales. So check out the awesome e-bikes below,
any one of which could become your next electric bike.
