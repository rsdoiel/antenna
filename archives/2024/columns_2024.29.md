## 2024-07-15 One Page Dungeon Contest

date: 2024-07-15, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-15-one-page-dungeon-contest">2024-07-15 One Page Dungeon Contest</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to invite you to the 2024 One Page Dungeon Contest. We are accepting submissions starting now and to the end of July. The contest challenge is to create an intriguing and fun dungeon to play&hellip; on only one page. We would love to see you get involved.&rdquo; – <a href="https://spielknights.gumroad.com/p/invitation-to-the-2024-one-page-dungeon-contest">Invitation to the 2024 One Page Dungeon Contest</a> and the <a href="https://www.dungeoncontest.com/">Dungeon Contest</a> homepage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I submitted an entry for the One Page Dungeon Contest.
Since I would like the dungeons to be close to the prep I do for my own games so that I feel like I belong to a community of referees that spends a similar amount of time for their adventures I took some of my (German) prep notes, cleaned them up and added some text boxes using Inskape and decided against spending time on polishing it up.</p>

<p>At the time, my players had a hard time getting past the gate.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-08-22_Hammond_verfolgt_den_Orkzug">2023-08-22 Hammond verfolgt den Orkzug</a> is when a player tracked a group of orcs as they reinforced the existing orc lair</li>
<li><a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-09-20_Das_Endes_des_Balrogs">2023-09-20 Das Endes des Balrogs</a> was the first attempt at taking the lair in which they faced the fire demon and hell hounds</li>
<li><a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-09-26_Der_Kampf_auf_den_Galerien_von_Grosshammer">2023-09-26 Der Kampf auf den Galerien von Grosshammer</a>, this is where they found a back entrance</li>
</ul>

<p>Result:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/pdfs/Orc_Halls_by_Alex_Schroeder_1.pdf">Orc Halls by Alex Schroeder</a></li>
</ul>

<p>At the time I had a second 10-headed hydra, too…</p>

<p>The boss orcs had 3, 5 and 7 hit dice.</p>

<p>And later, when the players had killed all the orcs, a bunch of goblins led by one Eye Poker resettled the halls.</p>

<p>These are the stats I would use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>orcs</strong> HD 1 AC 6 1d6 F1 MV 12 ML 8 XP 100

<ul>
<li><strong>Grishg</strong> HD 3 AC 6 1d6 F3 MV 12 ML 8 XP 300; with <em>gauntlets of max strength</em> granting +3; under the influence of the demon</li>
<li><strong>Shagdog</strong> HD 5 AC 6 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 8 XP 500; lightning bolt 1×/day for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; very loyal to Maufimbul</li>
<li><strong>Ashuak</strong> HD 5 AC 3 1d6 F5 MV 6 ML 9 XP 500; willing to buy freedom and leave</li>
<li><strong>Maufimbul</strong> HD 7 AC 3 1d6 F7 MV 6 ML 9 XP 700; wielding <em>Fur Hunter</em> +1/+3 vs. mammals; traditionalist spear dancer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>boars</strong> HD 3+1 AC 6 1d8 F1 MV 15 ML 9 XP 300</li>
<li><strong>hell hounds</strong> HD 5 AC 4 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; fire 2/6 for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; see invisible (that pack of hell hounds is also the random encounter)</li>
<li><strong>small pyrohydra</strong> HD 5 (40hp, 8hp per head) AC 5 1d10 per head F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; regrowing heads (unless cauterized with fire or ice, up to 7 more heads may grow, one per round, each with 8 hp); fire breath 3×/day: deal as much damage as it has hit-points left, save vs. breath for half; poisonous blood: when cutting off a head in melee, save vs. poison or die; immune to fire and poison</li>
<li><strong>fire demon</strong> HD 9+1 AC 4 1d6/2d6 F20 MV 12 ML 11; flying; aura of fire 1d6 (everybody within 10 ft); when the first attack with the flaming whip hits, the second attack with the flaming sword is at +4; only harmed by magic and magical weapons; immune to fire (the flaming whip and the flaming sword are two magic items that can be taken from the demon)</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly, the pyrohydra is the worst if you fight it without multiple lightning bolts or the like.</p>

<p>As for intelligent monsters, I figured that it would be possible to somehow sneak in and overhear orcs talk about the four bosses. If somebody wanted to, the power dynamic could be exploited. As it turned out, though, my players tried to force the front gate with sleep spells, alerted the guards, which brought on the fire demon and all the hell hounds. The enemies were destroyed but the party had to retreat. Next time, the party found the outlook, sent up a ranger with dark vision and a magic item that could charm humanoids. He killed the four orc guards, climbed down the netting into the cavern, found the way to the shooting gallery, started killing all the orcs and that was the signal the others needed to begin the race down the the long stairs. At the bottom, the orcs had cajoled a ten-headed pyrohydra into the Merchant Hall but it died in the first round after being hit by lightning bolts and other spells.</p>

<p>The treasure map to the Cistern of Sulphur does not contain any new monsters or traps; it&rsquo;s not a new lair or dungeon. It&rsquo;s part of the treasure gained here so all it takes is a one day trip up the mountains to that sulphur cavern. The only risk involved is random encounters.</p>

BTW, Al Sharpton should write the defining op-ed in the NYT, not George Clooney, who is very pretty, and a great choice to cast in movies like Up In The Air or Michael Clayton, but we don't know <i>anything</i> about his political judgement. He hasn't done anything to tell us who he is in that dimension. To the extent that we do know anything about him: 1. He's a jokester. 2. He has a brilliant and beautiful wife. 3. He has a huge villa in Italy which he keeps very private. That's about it. He's rich. We have nothing in common. He should run for office and get in the mix. The fact that the NYT chose him, that says something about them, other than they don't care what people think, or they think we're really shallow and will fall for bullshit like George Clooney who says he loves Biden. We didn't even know he knew Joe Biden! Why should Clooney have more of a say in this than I do? Tell me what Nancy Pelosi thinks, or Al Sharpton (I know I said that before). Or give Michael Moore a shot. He has a lot more skin in the game than Clooney. I'd love to read an op-ed by David Frum. Liz Cheney! I would be interested in her opinion on this.

Government should roll out new initiatives with the same skill as Apple rolls out new products. Not the same as Steve Jobs, that's asking too much. But with focus and showmanship, and a livestream, and fanbois and Al Sharpton in place of John Gruber. Focus our attention on each product (ie climate change, social security, Ukraine, etc), so the ideas don't get missed, and we can network in support of the initiative. This is all part of the idea of having a <i>democratic.party</i> website that we call call home for our political organizing. None of this pissing in the wind we do on twitter-like systems. Form buddy groups of people we organize with, based on locality or common interests. Organize the people as well as the billionaires are organized. This is what political parties should be in 2024 for crying out loud. We're missing the point of the mess in our politics. It's all a mess because it needs to be organized and it's not. Maybe I should take everything else off my blog now so I can use what little attention I have been able to gather here to focus on this idea. <i>We. Need. To. Organize.</i>

## Stay sane even though the news is trying to make us crazy

date: 2024-07-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>We should hire an intern at some J-school to keep track of all of my tweets, write them down, then translate each into a rule for what a news organization should do instead of not do. Flip the sense of the rule in other words.</p>
<p>Then we feed those rules to an AI.</p>
<p>Then we flow in the news stories of the day from various sites through the same AI for translation. Yes I know they'd complain <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/vociferous">vociferously</a>, but which ones you use don't matter because the AI algorithm will translate whatever they are to Dave Winer tense.</p>
<p>Then of course publish them to another site called The News That Helps Us All Stay Sane. </p>

## 2024-07-02 The importance of moderation

date: 2024-07-15, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-02-the-importance-of-moderation">2024-07-02 The importance of moderation</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a> recently wrote <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/usenet">Usenet had to die</a>, arguing that Usenet was wasteful, everybody carrying a copy of everybody else, including spam and binaries.
I agree with all the points made. The idea that there is one global network of groups, with everybody carrying all the groups and everybody being allowed to post led to the downfall of Usenet.</p>

<p>Having recently hooked my laptop and server server to a handful of other servers using UUCP, NNCP and NNTP for file copies, mail and news, I just want to emphasize that the same technology can be used to build a different net.</p>

<ul>
<li>UUCP doesn&rsquo;t have to be anonymous. Calling systems can be required to have a username and password.</li>
<li>NNTP doesn&rsquo;t have to be anonymous. Systems can be known peers based on IP numbers and users can be required to authenticate themselves.</li>
<li>Servers don&rsquo;t have to mirror all the groups. Systems can be selective in what they accept and in what they pass on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The spam problem arises when two systems &ldquo;trust&rdquo; each other and peer messages but one of the systems doesn&rsquo;t act on abuse and moderation reports.
Perhaps Usenet generated too much of a workload for system administrators so they stopped following up on those reports.
Perhaps some servers had become too big to ban.</p>

<p>I think we have the exact same problems with fedi.
Some instances seem too big to defederate from.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn&rsquo;t work.
If my posts end up on an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me, the post shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the other users that I don&rsquo;t like can comment and those comments are sent back to me.
I can block them all individually or block the large instance including my small number of friends.
That instance has become too big to ban.</p>

<p>To come back to net news:
From my point of view, the protocols are not to blame for the downfall of Usenet.
It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet.
It was the ease of setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made Usenet irrelevant.
In the end, to all these people federation was not as important as moderation.</p>

<p>Administrators were unwilling to drop the groups that were overrun with people that needed moderation.
This is a problem on all platforms with groups, e.g. Reddit.</p>

<p>Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn&rsquo;t moderate their users.
This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.</p>

<p>Administrators were unwilling to create new groups for people in their niches.
At least nobody seems to be making that mistake again.
IRC, Reddit, Discord – they all demonstrated that ad-hoc group formation and self-moderation was viable.</p>

<p>This is why I think moderation, group forming and selectivity of federation are the most important quality of a platform.</p>

<p>We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange, like in the old days.
The problem is unmoderated growth.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Social_Media">#Social Media</a></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>2024-07-04</strong>. I got a long reply by <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a>, reproduced in its entirety below.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">⁂</div>

<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s not a super new post, it&rsquo;s from September 2023. I dug it
out again since we were talking about Illuminant, which seems awesome.
It uses hashtags only as post keywords and instead, if I understand
things correctly, relies on FEP-1b12 to provide group support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think we have the exact same problems with fedi. Some instances

</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not quite the same thing.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a bad thing that I&rsquo;ve being hesitant to defederate from
m.soc even though I get more spam from it over Fedi than I&rsquo;ve been
getting from email fro the past several years.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m still only getting individual posts from m.soc or any other
server. (Which is also why hashtags don&rsquo;t work the way people think.)</p>

<p>On Usenet, the typical behavior would be to carry the whole thing.
Currently, I get dozens of spam messages from m.soc. If I were to
mirror the whole thing (which is possible with AP relays, and is what
would be necessary for hashtags to work like channels, me mirroring
the entirety of all the non-banned servers), I&rsquo;d have to deal with
thousands of messages. My server would croak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn’t work. If my posts end up
on an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me,
the post shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the
other users that I don’t like can comment and those comments are
sent back to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A problem. But again something that was way worse with usenet because
on there, not only would I mirror or moderate abusive replies to me. I
had to mirror abusive replies to <em>everybody</em>.</p>

<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m, for the most part, glad that the servers-that-can-comment
aren&rsquo;t allowlisted, that it works like email, that I can get comments
from anyone. The downside of that is having to ban ban ban like crazy,
but if it didn&rsquo;t work like that I&rsquo;m not sure it even would be
federated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can block them all individually or block the large instance
including my small number of friends. That instance has become too
big to ban.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A problem. But on Usenet, <em>every</em> instance was too big to ban since
every instance was expected to carry everything.</p>

<p>Individual blocks is one way around it. That&rsquo;s why I, a small instance
op, while I&rsquo;ve banned many small mainly-abuse instances, my need to
ban the big sloppily moderated silos like m.soc or threads is a li&rsquo;l
lower since I don&rsquo;t have hundreds of users to protect, which a midsize
instance would have. I can absolutely see why midsize &ldquo;safe space&rdquo;
instances would ban m.soc for example.</p>

<p>Also I &ldquo;silence&rdquo; every instance since I don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;whole known
network&rdquo; tab.</p>

<p>Killfiles was a user-level way to mute users on newsgroups. So there
was <em>some</em> mitigation, but Fedi additionally has several other
moderation tools like instance bans or silencing.</p>

<p>More fundamentally: ActivityPub is about sending individual posts.
Usenet was about mirroring entire servers. Those two are not the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are
not to blame for the downfall of Usenet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The context that I wrote that Usenet post last September was to rant
about hashtags. (A topic that I&rsquo;m gonna return to every now and then
until the group/tag situation gets a li&rsquo;l better, which might require
new UX affordances or perhaps only education.)</p>

<p>That problem, summarized:</p>

<ul>
<li>Servers can only show you the posts that it has already stumbled
over, through following or commenting</li>
<li>So when you browse a hashtag, you only see a very small subset of
those posts</li>
<li>Which is fine for organizing a handful of persons posts, like &ldquo;I
wanna see all of Marie&rsquo;s <code>#tidying</code> posts&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wanna go back and
take a look at all of my already-followed-friends <code>#mosstodon</code>
posts&rdquo; or even for filtering out stuff. I.e. it&rsquo;s OK as a tool for
<em>subsets</em> and <em>intersection</em></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a disaster for <em>union</em>, for discovery, for &ldquo;emulating channels&rdquo;
which people are used to from Tumblr and Twitter, which worked there
since those are centralized</li>
<li>For hashtags to work the way people expect them to, servers would
have to mirror all posts. Like on Usenet.</li>
<li>There was an effort in that direction early on, with the &ldquo;relay&rdquo;
system.</li>
<li>But small servers would croak. <strong>That&rsquo;s</strong> the problem. It&rsquo;d be an
environmental waste heap.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that&rsquo;s absolutely a protocol level problem!</p>

<p>A protocol level problem that Usenet had even without hashtags. (Well,
there was one hashtag: Kibo.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said a couple of times that servers mirror each other and for the
sticklers in the audience I&rsquo;ve got to add that not literally <em>every</em>
server carried <em>every</em> group. For example, some didn&rsquo;t carry
Anarchists Lunatics Terrorists a.k.a. the <code>alt</code> hierarchy. But that&rsquo;s
the fundamental intended flow. Group mirroring.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Usenet_servers_and_clients.svg" alt="Usenet
architecture" /></p>

<p>So in that way, Usenet is unlike mailing lists, where individual
messages are sent to individual users. FEP-1b12 group servers on Fedi
(like PieFed and MBin) are awesome because they get the best of both
worlds of the &ldquo;only send the relevant posts&rdquo; nature of mailing lists,
and the &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hosting this post anyway so we only need to store it
once in the SQL&rdquo; nature of Usenet. As long as one user on a Lemmy
server is subscribed to <code>@garderning@foo.bar</code>, like an email user
might be subscribed to a mailing list, it might-as-well display a copy
of that group since it&rsquo;s getting those messages anyway. It&rsquo;s not
perfect and we&rsquo;re still paying a hefty &ldquo;decentralization tax&rdquo;, but
it&rsquo;s more robust than mail and news.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet. It was the ease of
setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made
Usenet irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naw, Usenet kept puttering along after that, for a while, until the
cost (and legal danger) of mirroring huge binaries archives which was
the nail of nails. And that was a protocol level issue.</p>

<p>Fedi absolutely has a moderation problem. That is being addressed although it seems to me that there are still unsolved problems.<br>
Usenet had a much bigger moderation problem and much of the reason for
that was on the protocol level. We have instances and instance bans to
help moderate clusters of users where each instance op helps moderate
the users on their instance. Moderation is happening on a user level
which makes much more sense than on a group level. (Someone can be a
saint on <code>alt.suicide.holiday</code> but a jerk on
<code>alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</code> for example.)</p>

<p>But Usenet also has a scalability problem. Resource use. Better
moderation wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly enough to fix that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t
moderate their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms,
e.g. Mail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Email can&rsquo;t moderate their users since email isn&rsquo;t supposed to be
world-readable. (With exceptions like mailing lists; we can ban
someone who sends abusive messages to those.) But even so, instance
banning is very common on email.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news
exchange, like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last time I talked about this I got the world&rsquo;s most stubborn reply
guy on my neck who (since he was on a huge instance) could use
hashtags to find at least some amount of interesting posts and was
resistant to change. Since I mentioned scalability issues and how my
server would croak if it were to try to mirror even <em>one</em> of the big
instances, he started going on and on about &ldquo;scalability is only for
capitalists&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Yet another case of Smolnet Wishful Thinking Syndrome. The kind of
thinking that hates Eternal September more than anything but keeps
designing protocols that lead to more Eternal Septembers since they&rsquo;re
about everyone-seeing-everyone and then they resort to technical
gatekeeping or even bullying to keep people out. Not into it.</p>

<p>My criticism of Usenet&rsquo;s protocol here has nothing to do with
capitalist scaling, which is about &ldquo;throwing computers at it&rdquo;. Sure,
that&rsquo;d be one solution to the protocol problems inherent to Usenet and
relay-laden-ActivityPub.</p>

<p>Real Smolnet scaling is about designing protocols that are about
connecting people to people (and to topic groups or other
communities), and in a non-wasteful, mottainai way create small
overlapping villages instead of one big shout-loud-and-go-viral
channel.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of protocols. Those where everyone must see
everything (like Antenna and CAPCOM, and Twitter), and those where
that&rsquo;s not the case (like ActivityPub and email).</p>

<p>Here are three network layouts:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://ellen.idiomdrottning.org/baran_networks.png" alt="Baran networks" /></p>

<p>First we have a centralized network. One hub server and then every
client is a spoke connected to that center core. The most efficient
way to organize an &ldquo;everyone-must-see-everything&rdquo; protocol, but
vulnerable to disasters like meteor strikes, nuclear explosions,
billionaire takeovers, or earthquakes.</p>

<p>Then we have a decentralized network. Several hubs connected to each
other, mirroring each other. Usenet worked like that. The hubs need to
be just as beefy as the ones in a centralized network. This has some
advantages like redundancy and robustnesss, and it&rsquo;s more politically
appealing to the anarchists that built the internet. (Not sure why
since there&rsquo;s still two tiers and a mod group that rules everything
for everyone.) It can be wasteful. It can handle
everyone-must-see-everything protocols. It can also really shine when
everyone <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> need to see everything, like IRC which is super
efficient. IRC is a brilliant protocol design that, like a mailing
list, only sends the messages to a server that that server needs.</p>

<p>Finally we have a distributed network. No hubs. It looks more like a
mesh where every machine is connected to only a handful of &ldquo;nearby&rdquo;
machines. This type of network is an absolute disaster for the
everyone-must-see-everything scenario! Redundant to the point of
wastefulness. That&rsquo;s a future we must fight tooth and nail! And that&rsquo;s
exactly where the relay-centered version of ActivityPub was headed,
and that&rsquo;s what would be &ldquo;needed&rdquo; for hashtags-as-groups-and-discovery
to &ldquo;work&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where we the grassroots federalized ancom degrowth community
need to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves because even though
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/energy-is-undercosted" title="Energy is undercosted">energy and e-waste is underpriced</a>, a capitalist for-profit silo
company would never in a million years set up a system like this
because it&rsquo;s too wasteful ever for them, while we&rsquo;re liable to do so
since each instance op only sees their <em>own</em> costs, not the cost for
the network as a whole. The megacorps are OK with centralization
because for them, the power consolidation in the first two network
types is a positive, while for us it&rsquo;s a huge negative so we&rsquo;re drawn
to the third type, so we need to be really careful and really
responsible here.</p>

<p>But as bad as this layout is for everyone-must-see-everything, it&rsquo;s
really awesome for protocols where everyone <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> need to see
everything. It&rsquo;s economical, robust, cozy. ActivityPub (without the
relentless mirroring) is a good fit here. I can follow a handful of
users and be connected to their instances and only their posts are
sent to my instance, I don&rsquo;t mirror the entire server. It&rsquo;s actually
pretty awesome! It&rsquo;s good for moderation too because I only need to
moderate my &ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo;. Yeah, a &ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo; is the perfect
analogy for this; neighborhoods that can and overlap but are still
small and managed. A system set up like that can remain smol and cozy
even as it invites everyone on Earth. It&rsquo;s great. ActivityPub is
awesome.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>2024-07-08</strong>. I got a reply from <a href="https://koldfront.dk/">Adam Sjøgren</a> regarding Sandra&rsquo;s comment on hashtag use in <a href="https://illuminant.asjo.org/">Illuminant</a>.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">⁂</div>

<p>ActivityPub hashtags are translated to Keywords: and vice versa in
Illuminant. So far I haven&rsquo;t had the need to use hashtags/keywords for
more than showing/writing them in Keywords: - I did have a plan to
have groups like fediverse.keyword.music, fediverse.keyword.askfedi
etc. etc. but I haven&rsquo;t implemented it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say that I do not know what FEP-1b12 is, so I don&rsquo;t think
Illuminant implements any of the group support defined in that.</p>

<p>Since Illuminant is very much driven by what I personally want and
feel like implementing/have the energy to implement, it has a kind of
skewed subset of what I guess is expected from a fediverse server/user
interface by most&hellip;</p>

<p>While it is fun for me to hear somebody call Illuminant awesome, I
must say that I&rsquo;m pretty sure there is only one person in the universe
who actually runs it. Being proven wrong would be awesome, though.</p>

## How are you coping?

date: 2024-07-15, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, I want to ask you, candidly: How are you doing? The last two weeks &#8212; beginning with the Biden-Trump debate when Biden looked and sounded even older than his years and Trump lied even more than usual, followed by the Democrats&#8217; public agonizing over whether Biden should drop out, and then Saturday&#8217;s attempted assassination of Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania &#8212; have been harrowing.

## July 14, 2024 

date: 2024-07-15, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Shortly after 6:00 yesterday evening at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a shooter on the roof of a building about 400 feet from the stage appears to have shot eight bullets at the former president and into the crowd. Trump appeared to flinch and reach for his right ear as Secret Service agents crouched over the former president. When the agents got word the shooter was &#8220;down,&#8221; they lifted Trump to move him out. He asked to get his shoes and then to put them on.

## Self-care that’s not driven by shame

date: 2024-07-15, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

I&#8217;ve always had a hard time keeping up with flossing, which is embarrassing 😓 even though I know I&#8217;m not alone in this struggle. Getting habits to stick takes me a lot of work. But after a couple decades of the &#8220;brute force&#8221; / &#8220;guilt trip&#8221; approach, shaming myself clearly wasn&#8217;t making me any better [&#8230;]

## 2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux

date: 2024-07-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-14-yvonand-tour-du-vallon-des-vaux">2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux</h1>

<p>On the last day, we decided to go for a walk nearby instead of getting on the train immediately.
We took the train to Yvonand and turned towards the hills, spending most of our time in the forest.
This is <a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/route-129">route 129</a>.</p>

<p>When leaving the fields around Yvonand and entering the woods, the autobahn arches high above.
If only it were a fantastic train and not a triumph for car culture.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This small rivulet must have cut the canyon.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This bridge marks the beginning of the way up, if I remember.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you leave the forest, you&rsquo;re on the plateau above.
We ate lunch at the Hotel de Ville in Chavannes-le-Chêne.</p>

<p>Gewöhnliche Wegwarte<br>
Cichorium intybus</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s a weird one from the night before: Apparently the square in front of the castle is bathed in blue light at night, as if a train station bathroom trying to keep drug addicts away.</p>

<p>Somewhat creepy.</p>

## Morning coffee notes

date: 2024-07-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>BTW, I'm intermittently locked out of my <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa">Threads</a> account. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png">They say</a> it has to do with automated stuff they don't explain. I don't have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network, it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don't see me over there, this is why.</p>
<p>How I found out about Trump's assassination. By accident, I was watching CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to season 6 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty">Line of Duty</a>, which isn't very great. I couldn't focus on the show. I got my iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting that <i>he</i> hadn't been killed, and somehow I knew that "he" was Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his fist, looking right into the camera. He's 100 percent television actor. Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn't cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed killing him. He's thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies about being a victim, really is a victim, and we'll never hear the end of it. And it didn't take long before a random Republican asshole was saying this was Biden's fault for saying Trump would end democracy, which he has said he will, promised to do, and <i>we saw him try to do it</i> on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides. It didn't take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate. This was Biden's fault they all agree. Occam's Razor says this is over. We aren't going to vote in November. The deal is done because the journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I've yet to hear another explanation from them.</p>
<p>If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph, they'd nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That's how our journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the dictator. This is what it's like after that happened. People inside big companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize. Now their malaise becomes ours. </p>
<p>BTW, if Biden steps aside don't expect the Repubs won't sue saying it's illegal, so guess what -- not only don't you get Biden, you don't even get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the arguments already written.</p>

## Today’s violence

date: 2024-07-14, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, My first thought on hearing about the attempted shooting of Donald Trump at a rally today in Pennsylvania was &#8220;I hope to god he&#8217;s okay.&#8221; I thought this for the usual reasons we human beings hope that other humans are safe from harm. But I had another reason in the case of Donald Trump.
