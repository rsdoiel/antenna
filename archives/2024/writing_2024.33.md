## Paul Di Filippo Reviews Lake of Darkness by Adam Roberts

date: 2024-08-11, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Lake of Darkness</strong>, Adam Roberts (Gollancz 978-1399617673, hardcover, 320pp, £22.00) July 2024</p>

He weaves every  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/08/paul-di-filippo-reviews-lake-of-darkness-by-adam-roberts/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

A virtual who’s who of our field, it has included authors such  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/08/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-the-collapsing-frontier-by-jonathan-lethem/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
