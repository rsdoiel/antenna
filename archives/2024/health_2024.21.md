## Improved cure rate of periprosthetic joint infection through targeted antibiotic therapy based on integrated pathogen diagnosis strategy

date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesThis study aimed to determine whether combined of pathogen detection strategies, including specimen acquisition, culture conditions, and molecular diagnostics, can improve treatment outcomes in patients with periprosthetic joint infections (PJI).MethodsThis retrospective study included suspected PJI cases from three sequential stages at our institution: Stage A (July 2012 to June 2015), Stage B (July 2015 to June 2018), and Stage C (July 2018 to June 2021). Cases were categorized into PJI and aseptic failure (AF) groups based on European Bone and Joint Infection Society (EBJIS) criteria. Utilization of pathogen diagnostic strategies, pathogen detection rates, targeted antibiotic prescription rates, and treatment outcomes were analyzed and compared across the three stages.ResultsA total of 165 PJI cases and 38 AF cases were included in this study. With the progressive implementation of the three optimization approaches across stages A, B and C, pathogen detection rates exhibited a gradual increase (χ2 = 8.282, P=0.016). Similarly, utilization of targeted antibiotic therapy increased stepwise from 57.1% in Stage A, to 82.3% in Stage B, and to 84% in Stage C (χ2 = 9.515, P=0.009). The 2-year infection control rate exceeded 90% in both stages B and C, surpassing stage A (71.4%) (χ2 = 8.317, P=0.011). Combined application of all three optimized protocols yielded the highest sensitivity of 91.21% for pathogen detection, while retaining higher specificity of 92.11%.ConclusionThe utilization of combined pathogen diagnostic strategies in PJI can increase pathogen detection rates, improve targeted antibiotic prescription, reduce the occurrence of antibiotic complications, and achieve better treatment outcomes.

## Research progress in isolation and identification of rumen probiotics

date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

With the increasing research on the exploitation of rumen microbial resources, rumen probiotics have attracted much attention for their positive contributions in promoting nutrient digestion, inhibiting pathogenic bacteria, and improving production performance. In the past two decades, macrogenomics has provided a rich source of new-generation probiotic candidates, but most of these “dark substances” have not been successfully cultured due to the restrictive growth conditions. However, fueled by high-throughput culture and sorting technologies, it is expected that the potential probiotics in the rumen can be exploited on a large scale, and their potential applications in medicine and agriculture can be explored. In this paper, we review and summarize the classical techniques for isolation and identification of rumen probiotics, introduce the development of droplet-based high-throughput cell culture and single-cell sequencing for microbial culture and identification, and finally introduce promising cultureomics techniques. The aim is to provide technical references for the development of related technologies and microbiological research to promote the further development of the field of rumen microbiology research.

## Significance of extracellular vesicles in orchestration of immune responses in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection

date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the causative agent of Tuberculosis, is an intracellular bacterium well known for its ability to subvert host energy and metabolic pathways to maintain its intracellular survival. For this purpose, the bacteria utilize various mechanisms of which extracellular vehicles (EVs) related mechanisms attracted more attention. EVs are nanosized particles that are released by almost all cell types containing active biomolecules from the cell of origin and can target bioactive pathways in the recipient cells upon uptake. It is hypothesized that M.tb dictates the processes of host EV biogenesis pathways, selectively incorporating its molecules into the host EV to direct immune responses in its favor. During infection with Mtb, both mycobacteria and host cells release EVs. The composition of these EVs varies over time, influenced by the physiological and nutritional state of the host environment. Additionally, different EV populations contribute differently to the pathogenesis of disease at various stages of illness participating in a complex interplay between host cells and pathogens. These interactions ultimately influence immune responses and disease outcomes. However, the precise mechanisms and roles of EVs in pathogenicity and disease outcomes remain to be fully elucidated. In this review, we explored the properties and function of EVs in the context of M.tb infection within the host microenvironment and discussed their capacity as a novel therapeutic strategy to combat tuberculosis.

## The human alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a host target for the rabies virus glycoprotein

date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The rabies virus enters the nervous system by interacting with several molecular targets on host cells to modify behavior and trigger receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virion by poorly understood mechanisms. The rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) interacts with the muscle acetylcholine receptor and the neuronal α4β2 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) family by the putative neurotoxin-like motif. Given that the neurotoxin-like motif is highly homologous to the α7 nAChR subtype selective snake toxin α-bungarotoxin (αBTX), other nAChR subtypes are likely involved. The purpose of this study is to determine the activity of the RVG neurotoxin-like motif on nAChR subtypes that are expressed in brain regions involved in rabid animal behavior. nAChRs were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology was used to collect concentration-response data to measure the functional effects. The RVG peptide preferentially and completely inhibits α7 nAChR ACh-induced currents by a competitive antagonist mechanism. Tested heteromeric nAChRs are also inhibited, but to a lesser extent than the α7 subtype. Residues of the RVG peptide with high sequence homology to αBTX and other neurotoxins were substituted with alanine. Altered RVG neurotoxin-like peptides showed that residues phenylalanine 192, arginine 196, and arginine 199 are important determinants of RVG peptide apparent potency on α7 nAChRs, while serine 195 is not. The evaluation of the rabies ectodomain reaffirmed the observations made with the RVG peptide, illustrating a significant inhibitory impact on α7 nAChR with potency in the nanomolar range. In a mammalian cell culture model of neurons, we confirm that the RVG peptide binds preferentially to cells expressing the α7 nAChR. Defining the activity of the RVG peptide on nAChRs expands our understanding of basic mechanisms in host-pathogen interactions that result in neurological disorders.

## Effect of three oral pathogens on the TMA-TMAO metabolic pathway

date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTrimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is produced by hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) from trimethylamine (TMA). High TMAO level is a biomarker of cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders, and it also affects periodontitis through interactions with the gastrointestinal microbiome. While recent findings indicate that periodontitis may alter systemic TMAO levels, the specific mechanisms linking these changes and particular oral pathogens require further clarification.MethodsIn this study, we established a C57BL/6J male mouse model by orally administering Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis, Pg), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum, Fn), Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans, Sm) and PBS was used as a control. We conducted LC-MS/MS analysis to quantify the concentrations of TMAO and its precursors in the plasma and cecal contents of mice. The diversity and composition of the gut microbiome were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. TMAO-related lipid metabolism and enzymes in the intestines and liver were assessed by qPCR and ELISA methods. We further explored the effect of Pg on FMO3 expression and lipid molecules in HepG2 cells by stimulating the cells with Pg-LPS in vitro.ResultsThe three oral pathogenic bacteria were orally administered to the mice for 5 weeks. The Pg group showed a marked increase in plasma TMAO, betaine, and creatinine levels, whereas no significant differences were observed in the gut TMAO level among the four groups. Further analysis showed similar diversity and composition in the gut microbiomes of both the Pg and Fn groups, which were different from the Sm and control groups. The profiles of TMA-TMAO pathway-related genera and gut enzymes were not significantly different among all groups. The Pg group showed significantly higher liver FMO3 levels and elevated lipid factors (IL-6, TG, TC, and NEFA) in contrast to the other groups. In vitro experiments confirmed that stimulation of HepG2 cells with Pg-LPS upregulated the expression of FMO3 and increased the lipid factors TC, TG, and IL-6.ConclusionThis study conclusively demonstrates that Pg, compared to Fn and Sm, plays a critical role in elevating plasma TMAO levels and significantly influences the TMA-TMAO pathway, primarily by modulating the expression of hepatic FMO3 and directly impacting hepatic lipid metabolism.

## Efficacy of omadacycline in the treatment of Legionella pneumonia: a case report

date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Legionella, one of the main pathogens that causes community-acquired pneumonia, can lead to Legionella pneumonia, a condition characterized predominantly by severe pneumonia. This disease, caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila, can quickly progress to critical pneumonia and is often associated with damage to multiple organs. As a result, it requires close attention in terms of clinical diagnosis and treatment. Omadacycline, a new type of tetracycline derivative belonging to the aminomethylcycline class of antibiotics, is a semi-synthetic compound derived from minocycline. Its key structural feature, the aminomethyl modification, allows omadacycline to overcome bacterial resistance and broadens its range of effectiveness against bacteria. Clinical studies have demonstrated that omadacycline is not metabolized in the body, and patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction do not need to adjust their dosage. This paper reports a case of successful treatment of Legionella pneumonia with omadacycline in a patient who initially did not respond to empirical treatment with moxifloxacin. The patient also experienced electrolyte disturbance, as well as dysfunction in the liver and kidneys, delirium, and other related psychiatric symptoms.

## Risk stratification and survival time of patients with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia in the intensive care unit

date: 2024-05-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionPneumonia is a common infection in the intensive care unit (ICU), and gram-negative bacilli are the most common bacterial cause. The purpose of the study was to investigate the risk factors for 30-day mortality in patients with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia in the ICU, construct a predictive model, and stratify patients based on risk to assess their short-term survival.MethodsPatients admitted to the ICU with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia at Fujian Medical University Affiliated First Hospital between January 2018 and September 2020 were selected. Patients were divided into deceased and survivor groups based on whether death occurred within 30 days. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in these patients, and a predictive nomogram model was constructed based on these factors. Patients were categorized into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups according to the model's predicted probability, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to assess short-term survival.ResultsThe study included 305 patients. Lactic acid (odds ratio [OR], 1.524, 95% CI: 1.057-2.197), tracheal intubation (OR: 4.202, 95% CI: 1.092-16.169), and acute kidney injury (OR:4.776, 95% CI: 1.632-13.978) were identified as independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. A nomogram prediction model was established based on these three factors. Internal validation of the model showed a Hosmer-Lemeshow test result of X2=5.770, P=0.834, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.791 (95% CI: 0.688-0.893). Bootstrap resampling of the original data 1000 times yielded a C-index of 0.791, and a decision curve analysis indicated a high net benefit when the threshold probability was between 15%-90%. The survival time for low-, medium-, and high-risk patients was 30 (30, 30), 30 (16.5, 30), and 17 (11, 27) days, respectively, which were significantly different.ConclusionLactic acid, tracheal intubation, and acute kidney injury were independent risk factors for 30-day mortality in patients in the ICU with gram-negative bacillary pneumonia. The predictive model constructed based on these factors showed good predictive performance and helped assess short-term survival, facilitating early intervention and treatment.
