## Tropical Cyclone Chido’s Horrifying Destruction

date: 2024-12-16, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> A rare tornado caused damage in Northern California over the weekend • Severe flooding continues in southern Thailand • It is chilly and cloudy in Washington, D.C., where lawmakers have <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/permitting-all-but-out-of-year-end-spending-package/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> decided not to include permitting reform in the year-end spending package after a weekend of tense talks.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
	1. Tropical Cyclone Chido brings destruction to French islands of Mayotte
</h3><p>
	Thousands of people could be dead in the small island region of Mayotte after Tropical Cyclone Chido swept through on Saturday. The islands, home to some 300,000, are French territory but located in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and the east coast of Africa. Sources have reported apocalyptic scenes of destruction, with entire neighborhoods gone and essential infrastructure wiped out. “There is nothing left,” a local hotel owner <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/12/16/africa/mayotte-cyclone-chido-intl-hnk/index.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> CNN. “It’s as if an atomic bomb fell.” The cyclone struck as a Category 4 storm, with 136-mph winds, making it the strongest storm to hit the islands in nearly 100 years. So far 14 people are confirmed to have perished, but that death toll is expected to rise. According to CNN, the worst damage is in slum regions where thousands of undocumented migrants reside.
</p><h3>
	2. Climate decisions to watch from the last days of the Biden administration
</h3><p>
	With the end of President Biden’s term rapidly approaching, his administration is racing to finalize some key environmental decisions and finance deals. For example, the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office has a handful of “conditional” commitments for clean tech (like a $6.6 billion loan to Rivian, and a $7.5 billion loan for a battery plant built by the Stellantis and Samsung joint venture) that are in limbo and could be nixed by the Trump administration. Officials are “working hard to make the loan guarantees and loan agreements as airtight as possible,” a former policy adviser for the LPO <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-13/with-trump-looming-energy-department-moves-to-close-billions-in-deals?srnd=phx-green&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>. Here are a few other decisions to look out for in the coming weeks:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>California’s gas-powered car ban:</strong> A decision is expected <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/12/13/epa-california-climate-cars-evs/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as soon as this week</a> from the Environmental Protection Agency on whether California can ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Reports suggest the agency will grant its approval, which would also apply to about a dozen other states. Trump is expected to reverse the rule, likely setting up a long legal battle.</li>
<li><strong>Final rules on green hydrogen tax credits and “tech-neutral” clean power tax credits:</strong> Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener" target="_self">told Heatmap back in October</a> that the long-awaited rules governing the new clean hydrogen tax credit would be finalized before the end of the year. The Department will also publish the final guidance for the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/clean-electricity-tax-credit?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener" target="_self">technology-neutral clean power</a> tax credits by that time.</li>
<li><strong>LNG impact report: </strong>The Department of Energy’s long-awaited <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-study-may-conclude-lng-worse-for-climate-than-coal-lobbyists-say/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report on the environmental impacts</a> of liquefied natural gas exports is expected this week (although it was also expected last week, and the week before that…). Trump is likely to end the DOE’s pause on LNG export approvals. </li>
</ul><h3>
	3. Trump transition team recommends pulling the plug on Biden’s EV push <br/>
</h3><p>Relatedly, President-elect Trump’s transition team is recommending he “cut off support for electric vehicles and charging stations and to strengthen measures blocking cars, components, and battery materials from China,” <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-transition-team-plans-sweeping-rollback-biden-ev-emissions-policies-2024-12-16/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, citing a transition document seen by the outlet. Funds for the EV transition would be redirected toward national defense. Such recommendations wouldn’t be entirely surprising, though the team is also suggesting Trump bring in tariffs on <em><em>all</em></em> imported battery materials. The $7,500 EV tax credit is also on the chopping block, as are the Biden administration’s tailpipe emissions standards.</p><h3>4. COP16 on desertification ends without a deal</h3><p>The UN COP16 summit on addressing desertification and land degradation concluded over the weekend <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6aca26ff-c39f-48bd-8c23-0a8595c402ca?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">without producing an agreement</a> on how nations should respond to drought. Representatives from nearly 200 countries attended the two-week-long gathering in Saudi Arabia. Poorer countries had hoped the summit would result in a legally-binding agreement that would require wealthier nations to fund drought resilience in developing countries. “I fear the UNCCD COP16 has suffered the same fate as the biodiversity and climate COPs this year,” Jes Weigelt of European climate think-tank TMG Research <a href="https://apnews.com/article/un-drought-desertification-climate-riyadh-saudi-arabia-a353d12a2fe8c19e932f96198fa3421d?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em><em>The Associated Press</em></em>. “It failed to deliver.” The next round of these talks will be held in Mongolia in 2026.</p><h3>5. Study: Dozens of Miami beachfront condos are sinking</h3><p>Many condos along Miami’s beachfront are sinking at “unexpected” rates, according to a new <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024EA003852?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em>Earth and Space Science</em>. Between 2016 and 2023, some 35 buildings – including Trump Tower III and Trump International Beach Resorts – subsided by up to three inches. “Almost all the buildings at the coast itself, they’re subsiding,” Falk Amelung, a geophysicist at the University of Miami and an author on the study, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/climate-change/article296831519.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>Miami Herald</em>. There are several factors contributing to the sinking, but experts told the <em>Herald</em> that one could be rising sea levels, which are speeding up the region’s coastal erosion. “The study underscores the need for ongoing monitoring and a deeper understanding of the long-term implications for these structures,” said Farzaneh Aziz Zanjani, the study’s lead author.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p><em><em>“The man who once had the key insight that the way to fight climate change was to make EVs cool now thinks nothing is cooler than getting retweets and likes from the right-wing trolls who consider him their king.”</em></em> –Paul Waldman writing for Heatmap about how <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/elon-musk-climate-enemy?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9zowHHUhb75dZNBNZ_ORBFHqM_BYiQ2oRTlRm07LhuDeGJ6zKDU3wHIVdBakKCZTz1V4aJ" target="_self">Elon Musk broke bad on climate</a></p>

## Elon Musk Broke Bad on Climate

date: 2024-12-16, from: Heatmap News

On Friday, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-transition-recommends-scrapping-car-crash-reporting-requirement-opposed-by-2024-12-13/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a> that the Trump transition team is looking to scrap a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash-reporting requirement, “a move that could cripple the government’s ability to investigate and regulate the safety of vehicles with automated-driving systems.” Tesla finds this requirement irksome, and lo, it may soon disappear. </p><p>In the scope of Musk’s emerging sway over the Trump administration and the course of federal policy in the coming years, it’s a relatively minor story of potentially corrupt influence and the subversion of the public interest. But an even more disturbing picture of Musk’s full priority set is coming into focus. </p><p>Musk, the richest human being in history (his net worth <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/11/business/elon-musk-400-billion-net-worth/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now tops</u></a> $400 billion), may soon exercise a control over government policy unprecedented for a private citizen, which as recently as a year or so ago might have seemed like a net positive for the fight against climate change. Until the relatively immediate present, Musk was rightly counted as a hero of that battle. Whether or not you accept <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h4ZoGASM8bI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his claim</u></a> that “I’ve done more for the environment than any single human on Earth,” Musk has certainly done more than anyone to promote the adoption of electric vehicles. And no public figure could — if he wanted — have more ability to convince conservatives in general, and Donald Trump in particular, to accept the reality of climate change and commit to doing something about it than he does. </p><p>But that is not what Elon Musk wants. It is becoming clear that in pursuit of his own objectives — money, power, domination over others, personal aggrandizement, and the realization of <a href="https://www.spacex.com/media/making_life_multiplanetary_transcript_2017.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his dream</u></a> of making humanity a “multi-planet species” — Musk is content not just to set aside the fight against climate change, but to actively undermine it. </p><p>While Musk has not made any grand announcement declaring that he no longer cares about climate, there is considerable evidence to suggest he does not. In <a href="https://www.rev.com/transcripts/elon-musk-and-donald-trump-interview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a rambling interview</u></a> with Trump this August, Musk said that his views on the fossil fuel industry are “probably different from what most people would assume.” He explained that “I don’t think we should vilify the oil and gas industry,” and although over time we should move toward sustainable energy, “we still have quite a bit of time … we don’t need to rush and we don’t need to stop farmers from farming or prevent people from having steaks.” </p><p>Which is almost exactly what any <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20climate%20crisis" target="_self"><u>fossil fuel CEO</u></a> would say. </p><p>It certainly marks a rhetorical shift for someone who once <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/Elon-Musk-thinks-we-need-a-popular-uprising-against-the-fossil-fuel-industry/articleshow/55233184.cms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advocated</u></a> a “popular uprising” against fossil fuel companies. One might object that whatever he says in interviews, he’s still the CEO of America’s largest EV manufacturer. And Tesla no doubt remains a company filled with people committed to combating climate change who see their work as a key part of that effort. <a href="https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/Tesla-Master-Plan-Part-3.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The third iteration</u></a> of the company’s “Master Plan,” released last year, describes what it believes is necessary to “fully electrify the economy and eliminate fossil fuel use.” </p><p>But that doesn’t seem to reflect the CEO’s own thinking. The <em><em>Washington Post</em></em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/12/10/elon-musk-climate-change-worldview-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a> that earlier this year, Musk killed plans to create an affordable Tesla that could have greatly expanded the reach of EVs in the U.S., opting instead to make further investments in luxury cars and artificial intelligence. (To add insult to injury, Reuters first reported in April that the car had been canceled, but Musk said that the outlet was “<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-model-2#:~:text=Tesla%20has%20denied%20the%20reporting.%20In%20a%20post%20on%20the%20social%20network%20X%2C%20Elon%20Musk%20said%3A%20%E2%80%9CReuters%20is%20lying%20(again).%E2%80%9D%20He%20later%20added%3A%20%E2%80%9CReuters%20is%20dying.%E2%80%9D" target="_self"><u>lying</u></a>.”) “The internal deliberations over the so-called Tesla Model 2,” said the <em><em>Post</em></em>, “reflect what sources close to Musk describe as a significant shift in the billionaire’s attitude toward climate change.” </p><p>That’s apparent in what may be the single most important decision Trump and congressional Republicans will have to make with regard to EVs: whether to kill the $7,500 EV subsidy revived and expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act. If Musk wanted to, he could almost certainly convince Trump that the subsidies ought to remain in place. But he doesn’t; this summer he said on an earnings call that while eliminating the subsidies might cost Tesla some sales, “long term, it probably actually helps” because it would be “devastating for our competitors.” Or as he said in <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813112958157005259" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a tweet</u></a>, “Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla.” </p><p>In other words, Musk favors a policy change that will reduce overall adoption of EVs, because it will hurt his competition, perhaps driving some of his competitors out of the EV market entirely. Bad for the climate, but good for Elon Musk. </p><p>Then we have the rest of the Trump administration’s agenda to roll back climate progress. To date there is zero evidence that Musk has suggested that Trump dial back his “drill, baby, drill” agenda or appoint administration figures who are anything less than fossil fuel enthusiasts. Quite the opposite: When Trump <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-expedited-permitting" target="_blank">posted on Truth Social</a> that “Any person or company investing ONE BILLION DOLLARS, OR MORE, in the United States of America, will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all Environmental approvals,” Musk responded by <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1866571568266219998" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tweeting</u></a>, “This is awesome.” </p><p>That it isn’t in Trump’s power to single-handedly waive “all Environmental approvals” isn’t the point, so much as the fact that Musk thrills to the idea of the government no longer bothering to enforce environmental laws. While the “Department of Government Efficiency” Trump has tasked Musk with creating is neither a department, nor part of the government, nor devoted to efficiency, it nonetheless stands as a symbol of Musk’s close relationship with Trump and his ability to influence Trump’s decisions, particularly given how little Trump actually cares about policy areas other than immigration and foreign trade. It has become hard to envision Musk acting as anything other than an accelerant on Trump’s worst environmental instincts. </p><p>Musk’s shift to the right will continue to have serious national consequences in both government policy and public debate. He bought Twitter in 2022 with the stated intention of removing much of its content moderation in the name of “free speech,” with the predictable result that the renamed X quickly became a sewer of far-right extremism and misinformation of all kinds. As multiple <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10122024/todays-climate-climate-misinformation-social-media/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>analyses</u></a> have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-technology-science-social-media-a7e2e3214abb4470dcb6e2837aa39c2e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shown</u></a>, climate denialism and deceit have proliferated on X, making it one of the premier vectors of influence for those who would thwart efforts to address the climate crisis. </p><p>There is no reason to believe that this concerns Musk in any way. The man who once had the key insight that the way to fight climate change was to make EVs cool now thinks nothing is cooler than getting retweets and likes from the right-wing trolls who consider him their king.</p><p>At this point, one might even question whether Musk <em><em>ever</em></em> cared about climate change, or if concern about warming was just an engine that he realized could make him rich and feed his grandiose dreams of world domination. The answer to that question is: It doesn’t matter. Whatever he might once have thought, Musk has been transformed. He is no longer a force for good in the climate fight; instead, he’ll be one more obstacle to ensuring the future of the planet. If only he didn’t have the ability to do so much damage.</p>

## Biden, Harris thank donors, urge them to stay engaged after tough loss to Trump

date: 2024-12-16, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday thanked deep-pocketed Democratic donors who raised record sums in last month's election loss to President-elect Donald Trump and urged them not to lose hope and to remain politically engaged.


Biden and Harris, along with their spouses, in remarks at the Democratic National Committee holiday reception sought to buck up key donors who the Democratic Party needs to stay committed as it tries to pick up the pieces. Republicans scored a decisive victory taking the White House and Senate while maintaining control of the House in an election where donors of all political stripes spent about $4.7 billion.


"We all get knocked down. My dad would say when you get knocked down, you just got to get up," Biden said. "The measure of a person or a party is how fast they get back up."


Harris, who stepped in as the party's presidential nominee after Biden ended his campaign in July following his disastrous debate performance, praised donors for putting their time — and checkbooks — into backing her and Democrats that they believed in.


Democrats, their allied super PACs and other groups raised about $2.9 billion, compared to about $1.8 billion for the Republicans. Harris noted that Democrats raised a whopping $700 million over just 700 events organized by the Democratic finance committee.


"You rallied, you opened your homes, you reached out to your friends and your family," said Harris, who will soon begin weighing in earnest her own future and whether to make another White House run. "You put your personal capital — and by that I mean your relationships — at stake to talk with people because you care so deeply, and you connected with people and took the time to remind them of what is at stake and what was at stake."


While Biden acknowledged the sting that Democrats continue to feel about last month's loss, he said they should take pride in what they accomplished.


The administration's signature achievements include a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., and a surge in federal environmental spending through the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022 after it cleared Congress solely with Democratic votes.


"We could never have gotten as much done as we did without you," Biden said. "You not only contributed to the campaign, but you did something, I think, even more important. You were willing to lend your names, your reputation, your character to the effort."


Biden said that he intended to remain engaged with party politics once he leaves office on Jan. 20. He also predicted that he expected Harris would remain a central character in the party's future.


"You're not going anywhere kid. We aren't letting you," Biden said to Harris.

## Storms across US bring heavy snow, dangerous ice, tornado in California

date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA

Omaha, Nebraska — A tornado near a mall in central California swept up cars, uprooted trees and sent several people to the hospital. In San Francisco, authorities issued the first-ever tornado warning.


Elsewhere, inclement weather plagued areas of the U.S., with dangerous conditions including heavy snow in upstate New York, a major ice storm in Midwest states and severe weather warnings around Lake Tahoe. 


The ice storm beginning Friday evening created treacherous driving conditions across Iowa and eastern Nebraska Friday and into Saturday and prompted temporary closures of Interstate 80 after numerous cars and trucks slid off the road. In upstate New York, more than 33 inches (84 centimeters) was reported near Orchard Park, which is often a landing point for lake-effect snow.


On Saturday, a tornado touched down near a shopping mall in Scotts Valley, California, about 110 kilometers south of San Francisco, around 1:40 p.m. The tornado overturned cars and toppled trees and utility poles, the National Weather Service said. The Scotts Valley Police Department said several people were injured and taken to hospitals.


In San Francisco, some trees toppled onto cars and streets and damaged roofs. The  

damage was due to 129-kph straight-line winds, not a tornado, weather  

service meteorologist Dalton Behringer said Sunday.


Roger Gass, a meteorologist in the weather service’s office in Monterey, California, said the warning of a possible tornado in San Francisco was a first for the city, noting an advanced alert did not go out before the last tornado struck nearly 20 years ago.


“I would guess there wasn’t a clear signature on radar for a warning in 2005,” said Gass, who was not there at the time.


The fast-moving storm prompted warnings for residents to take shelter, but few people have basements in the area.


More than 30 centimeters of snow fell at some Lake Tahoe ski resorts, and 181-kph gust of wind was recorded at the Mammoth Mountain resort south of Yosemite National Park, according to the weather service’s office in Reno, Nevada. Up to 90 centimeters of snow was forecast for the Sierra Nevada mountaintops.


The weekend Tahoe Live music festival at Palisades Tahoe ski resort in California went ahead as planned in spite of a snowstorm Saturday. Lil Wayne and Diplo were scheduled to perform Sunday, the festival’s website said. An avalanche warning was in effect at least until Monday morning in the area.


Interstate 80 was closed along a 130-kilometer stretch from Applegate, California, to the Nevada line just west of Reno on Saturday. The California Highway Patrol reopened the road in the afternoon for passenger vehicles with chains or four-wheel drive and snow tires.


The severe weather in the Midwest resulted in at least one death. The Washington County Sheriff’s office in Nebraska said a 57-year-old woman died after she lost control of her pickup on Highway 30 near Arlington and hit an oncoming truck. The other driver sustained minor injuries.


Businesses announced plans to open late Saturday as temperatures rose high enough in the afternoon to melt the ice in most places.


“Luckily some warmer air is moving in behind this to make it temporary,” said Dave Cousins, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s office in Davenport, Iowa.


Tens of thousands of people in western Washington state lost electricity Saturday as the system delivered rain and gusty winds, local news outlets reported.

## 'North Pole' flight takes kids to Santa in transformed Denver airport hangar

date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA

Denver, Colorado — Dozens of kids cheered on a festively decked-out plane in Denver on Saturday when the pilot announced their destination for the day: the North Pole.


More than 100 children, some of whom have serious health issues, were then taken on a roughly 45-minute flight near the city before landing back at Denver International Airport and being towed to a hangar transformed by United Airlines employees and volunteers into the North Pole.


Streamers, paper snowflakes and tufts of cotton resembling feathery snow dotted the plane and seats. Flight personnel paraded a bubble machine up and down the aisle to shouts of "bubbles, bubbles, bubbles" from the excited children. Holiday songs played in the background and there were apple snacks and juice for all.


Before landing, the children were asked to close their window shades. When they opened, the kids were met by the sight of a waiting Santa and Mrs. Claus and a host of elves. An ice cream truck was on hand and the children received gifts.




Bryce Bosley, 6, was tickled to see Santa and all the North Pole had to offer.


"The North Pole is fun because there's games, food, and all the activities are really fun," he said.


United Capt. Bob Zimmermann, the holiday flight's pilot, was struck by the joy and wonder of the youngsters.


"Throughout the year I'll think of the fantasy flight," he said. "When life seems to get tough or I want to complain about something, I remember these kids and the joy and the love and what this feels like, and it just keeps my life in perspective."


United partnered with Make-A-Wish Colorado, Girls Inc., Children's Hospital Colorado and Rocky Mountain Down Syndrome Association to invite Denver-area kids ages 3 to 10 years on the flight.




For more than 30 years, United has staged its annual "fantasy flights" to fictional North Poles at airports around the world to bring holiday cheer to children and their families.


This year they took place in 13 cities, starting Dec. 5 in Honolulu and then in Washington, Houston, Los Angeles, London, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Cleveland and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and on the island of Guam. Newark, New Jersey, also had a flight Saturday.


Jonna McGrath, United's vice president for operations at its Denver hub, has participated in 29 flights and said it is one of her favorite days of the year.


"It gives them a day where they are away from some of the challenges they face in their day-to-day life," said McGrath, who was dressed as an elf. "Bringing a little magic and some gifts to their holiday season is something they'll never forget."

## 'Tis the season for roasting chestnuts. But in US, native ones are almost gone

date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA

It's been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut on city sidewalks. It's no longer the variety whose smell some people associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it's virtually extinct. 


But memories of the American chestnut's legacy keep resurfacing for the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags of nuts cooked on charcoal. 


"You can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in virtually every aspect of the lives of people," said Sara Fern Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once did. 


Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If and when they do find the right variety, they'll need to figure out how to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from climate change, globalization and development. 




Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties, like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter snacking. 


Still, American chestnut trees are better-suited for timber, they're culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans alike. "It was really a pretty significant species to lose," said Amy Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree's genetics. "The more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest ecosystem is." 


The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said breeders have learned just how difficult that is — blight resistance involves several different genes, and it has proven hard to separate them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts. 


To speed the process, some scientists have been working on genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through the regulatory process as soon as this year. 


"It kind of stinks that it happened because now it's taking a little bit longer than we had hoped," said Linda McGuigan, a research support specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are continuing to pursue many avenues. 


"I don't think you will get there, to all you desire, without both," Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance. 


Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a warming planet is changing habitat around the world? 




A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived. 


"I don't think it's hyperbolic to say it's revolutionary" for teams at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across the country. 


Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it "robust and well supported" and "critically important to the success of the chestnut." 


Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with real-world experiments. "I think with advancements in genetics, they can probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all of that takes time and effort, right?" 


For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their lifetimes. It's a lesson that became clear for the community when pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their research for years as lab manager at SUNY's college of environmental science and forestry. 


"The project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory," McGuigan said. "I want to do something good for the future, for my children."

## 'Kraven the Hunter' flops while 'Moana 2' tops the box office again

date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA

The Spider-Man spinoff "Kraven the Hunter" got off to a disastrous start in North American theaters this weekend. 


The movie starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson earned only $11 million, according to studio estimates Sunday, making it one of the worst openings for a Marvel-adjacent property. Its box office take was even less than the film "Madame Web." 


The weekend's other major studio release was Warner Bros.' animated "The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim," which made $4.6 million. Made for about $30 million, the movie is set 183 years before the events of "The Lord of the Rings" films and was fast-tracked to ensure New Line did not lose the rights to Tolkien's novels. Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens have been working on future live-action films for the franchise. 


Meanwhile, the top of the charts again belonged to "Moana 2" and "Wicked." 


"Moana" added $26.6 million to its domestic total in its third weekend and $57.2 million internationally, bringing its global tally to $717 million. It's now the fourth highest grossing film of the year, surpassing "Dune: Part Two." 


"Wicked," which is in its fourth weekend, brought in another $22.5 million to take second place. The Universal musical has made over $359 million domestically and over $500 million worldwide. 


"Gladiator II" also made $7.8 million, bringing its domestic total to $145.9 million in four weeks. 


"Kraven the Hunter" is the latest misfire from Sony in its attempt to mine the Spider-Man universe for spin-off franchises without the lucrative web slinger himself. "Kraven" joins "Madame Web" and "Morbius" in franchise additions that fell flat with both audiences and critics. The one exception on this rollercoaster journey has been the "Venom" trilogy, which has made over $1.8 billion worldwide. 


The R-rated "Kraven the Hunter" was directed by J.C. Chandor and faced a number of delays, partly due to the Hollywood strikes. It was shot nearly three years ago and originally slated to hit theaters in January 2023. The film cost a reported $110 million to produce and was co-financed by TSG. Internationally, it made $15 million, but its potential for longevity appears limited: It currently carries a 15% "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes and got a C grade on CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences. 


"It's not always a guarantee that you'll be able to connect with audiences when you have a spinoff character," said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. "General audiences seem to want to know exactly what they're getting." 


Several awards contenders opened in limited release over the weekend, including Paramount's "September 5" about ABC's coverage of the Munich Olympics hostage crisis. Amazon MGM and Orion's "Nickel Boys," based on Colson Whitehead's Pulitzer-winner about an abusive reform school in Florida, opened in two theaters in New York. It averaged $30,422 per screen and will be expanding to Los Angeles before going nationwide in the coming weeks. 


Some big hitters are on the way in the home stretch of the 2024 box office. "Mufasa" and "Sonic the Hedgehog 3" will hit in the coming weeks along with a bevy of arthouse and adult releases like "Babygirl," "Nosferatu" and "A Complete Unknown." 


The box office has seen a dramatic recovery since June, when it was down nearly 28% from the previous year. The deficit now stands at 4.8%. 


Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 


1. "Moana 2," $26.6 million. 


2. "Wicked," $22.5 million. 


3. "Kraven the Hunter," $11 million. 


4. "Gladiator II," $7.8 million. 


5. "Red One," $4.6 million. 


6. "Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim," $4.5 million. 


7. "Interstellar" (rerelease), $3.3 million. 


8. "Pushpa: The Rule — Part 2," $1.6 million. 


9. "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever," $1.4 million. 


10. "Queer," $790,954.

## Incoming national security adviser calls for explanation of US drone sightings

date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser says it’s time to figure out where dozens of unexplained drones flying over eastern U.S. states are coming from and whether any ill intent is involved.


Republican Representative Michael Waltz, from Florida and set to join Trump’s White House team when the president-elect takes office January 20, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “We need to get to the bottom of it.”


For weeks now, residents in the state of New Jersey, which borders New York City, and other states to the north and south along the Atlantic Ocean coastline have reported seeing more than 5,000 supposed drones, a figure U.S. officials have concluded is wildly inflated.


All manner of conspiracy theories has been offered for the unexplained sightings, including U.S. government spying and the deployment of Iran-launched drones from a mothership off U.S. eastern coastal waters.


Waltz called them “long-loitering, could-be dangerous” drones. He credited the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden for trying to allay fears and resolve any mystery about the drones but offered no explanation himself.


“We need more transparency,” Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, told the CBS show. “This can’t be the future.”


On Saturday, officials from the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stressed that most of the recent purported drone sightings in New Jersey — the state with the most reports — and elsewhere have been manned aircraft and posed no national security threat.


An FBI official told reporters that the agency was working with 50 local, state and federal partners and had determined that fewer than 100 of the more than 5,000 reported sightings had turned out to merit further investigation.


"The combination of efforts so far ... to include technical equipment, tip line information and noted consults has ... not found any evidence to support large-scale [unmanned aerial system] activities," the official said, adding that many of the sightings occurred along regular flight paths.




The official said more investigations are under way to look at the remaining cases, including analysis of radar and intelligence.


"We can't ignore the sightings that have been there," the official said. "We're doing our best to find the origin of those drone activities, but I think there has been a slight over-reaction" in the number of claimed drone sightings.


U.S. officials say they have confirmed drone sightings over military bases in New Jersey, including Picatinny Arsenal, but found no evidence that a foreign government had launched the drones. National security officials, however, have not been able to figure out who has been operating the unexplained drones.


State and local officials in eastern seaboard states have expressed concern. Larry Hogan, a former Maryland governor, posted on social media Friday that he had seen “what appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky” above his residence in the state. “The public is growing increasingly concerned and frustrated with the complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude of the federal government.”


President-elect Trump suggested Saturday that the Biden administration was withholding information about the drone sightings and that the devices should be shot down. Republican Representative Christopher Smith of New Jersey said Friday in a statement that the White House’s attitude toward the sightings had been “dismissive.”


U.S. officials said Saturday the administration had sent New Jersey officials radar technology with an “electro-optical infrared camera system” to track the devices.


Last week, White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said an investigation of the drone sightings had not turned up any illegal activity.


“To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,” Kirby said.

## Mystery drone sightings keep happening in New Jersey - What we know... and don't know

date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA

A large number of mysterious drones have been reported flying over parts of New Jersey and the East Coast in recent weeks, sparking speculation and concern over who sent them and why.


New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.


Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to be a threat to public safety, but many state and municipal lawmakers have nonetheless called for stricter rules about who can fly the unmanned aircraft.


The FBI is among several agencies investigating and has asked residents to share videos, photos and other information they may have about the drones.


What's the deal with the drones in New Jersey?


Dozens of witnesses have reported seeing them in the state starting in November.


At first they were spotted flying along the scenic Raritan River, which feeds the Round Valley Reservoir, the state's largest aquifer, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of New York City.


But soon sightings were reported statewide, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster.




The aircraft have also recently been spotted in coastal areas.


Republican U.S. Rep. Chris Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer told him a dozen drones closely followed a Guard lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County over the weekend.


Federal officials offer assurances that drones don't pose a threat

The growing anxiety among some residents is not lost on the Biden administration, which has faced criticism from Trump for not dealing with the matter more aggressively.


In a call with reporters Saturday that was organized by the White House, senior officials from the FBI, Pentagon, FAA and other agencies sought to assure people that the drones are not a national security or public safety threat or the handywork of a malicious foreign actor.


An FBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said the public concern is understandable but added, “I think there has been a slight overreaction.”


Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday that the military’s initial assessment after consulting with the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Council — that the drones are not of foreign origin — remained unchanged.


New Jersey congressman wants the military to take action


A New Jersey congressman has urged the Pentagon to authorize the use of force to bring down one or more drones to try to figure out who deployed them.




The objects could be downed over the ocean or in an unpopulated area on land, Smith said Saturday at a news conference.


“Why can't we bag at least one of these drones and get to the bottom of it?” Smith said.


Rep. Jeff Van Drew, another Republican Jersey Shore-area congressman, has also called for the military to shoot down the drones.


Monmouth County Sheriff Shaun Golden said people should not take it into their own hands to shoot down drones, which would break state and federal laws.


Drones have been spotted over New York City



Drone sightings have now been reported in New York, where a permit is required, and Mayor Eric Adams said the city was investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials.


The runways at Stewart International Airport — about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of the city — were shut down for about one hour Friday night because of drone activity in the airspace, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.


“This has gone too far,” she said in a statement.


The governor called on Congress to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones and give more investigative authority to state and local law enforcement.


“Extending these powers to New York State and our peers is essential,” she said. “Until those powers are granted to state and local officials, the Biden administration must step in by directing additional federal law enforcement to New York and the surrounding region to ensure the safety of our critical infrastructure and our people.”


Are these drones dangerous?


The White House has said that a review of the reported sightings shows that many of them are actually manned aircraft being flown lawfully, echoing the opinion of officials and drone experts.


The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”


Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security, said the reported drones have been up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter and sometimes travel with their lights switched off. This is much larger than those typically flown by drone hobbyists, and she said they appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio.


Who sent the drones?


Authorities say they do not know.


The FBI, Homeland Security and state police are investigating the sightings. Authorities say they don’t know if it is one drone that has been spotted many times or if there are multiple aircraft being flown in a coordinated effort.


Speculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns that the drone or drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents.


Officials stress that ongoing state and federal investigations have found no evidence to support those concerns, but Rep. Smith on Saturday echoed such speculation.


“The elusive maneuvering of these drones suggests a major military power sophistication that begs the question whether they have been deployed to test our defense capabilities — or worse — by violent dictatorships, perhaps maybe Russia, or China, or Iran, or North Korea,” he said.


Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Wednesday that the aircraft are not U.S. military drones.


What have officials said about the sightings?


Trump has said he believes the government knows more than it’s saying. “Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!” he posted on his social media site.


Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday that the drones should be “shot down, if necessary.”


“We should be doing some very urgent intelligence analysis and take them out of the skies, especially if they’re flying over airports or military bases,” Blumenthal said.


Experts, however, warn not to shoot at anything in the sky.


Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings and said she doesn't believe the assertion that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety.


“How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”


Are drones allowed in New Jersey?


The flying of drones for recreational and commercial use is legal in the state, but it is subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions.


In New York City, a permit is required to take off or land an unmanned aircraft.


Operators must be FAA-certified.


Have drones been spotted anywhere else?


Sightings also have been reported in Virginia and elsewhere.


Two people said they spotted an aircraft Thursday night near Virginia Beach that was unlike any other they’ve seen.


The object was over the ocean, and they watched as it slowly moved over an Army National Guard facility, John Knight told The Virginian-Pilot.


“It was definitely different,” said Knight, who took videos of what he thinks was a drone the size of a small truck.


“It flew like a helicopter but made no noise,” he added.


The Virginia National Guard did not have any aircraft operating in the area Thursday night, according to spokesperson A.A. “Cotton” Puryear. Its leadership is aware of the incident and it’s under investigation.


Another military installation in the area is Naval Air Station Oceana Dam Neck Annex. NAS Oceana, the East Coast master jet base in Virginia Beach, is aware of recent reports of sightings in the area and is coordinating with federal and state agencies to ensure the safety of its personnel and operations, Katie Hewett, public affairs officer, said Friday by email.


Knight submitted the videos Thursday night to the FBI tip line.


In Massachusetts, 10 to 15 drones were reported hovering over a home Thursday night in Harwich on Cape Cod. A resident told police they were bright and she observed them for more than an hour.


Earlier that evening, an off-duty police officer in the same town noticed similar activity near a public safety complex, police said. The information was forwarded to the FBI and Massachusetts State Police.


Drones were also spotted last month in the U.K. The U.S. Air Force said several small unmanned aircraft were detected near four military bases in England that are used by American forces.

## Hackers demand ransom from Rhode Islanders after data breach

date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA

Hundreds of thousands of Rhode Island residents' personal and bank information, including Social Security numbers, were likely hacked by an international cybercriminal group asking for a ransom, state officials said on Saturday. 


In what Rhode Island officials described as extortion, the hackers threatened to release the stolen information unless they were paid an undisclosed amount of money. 


The breached data affects people who use the state's government assistance programs and includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and healthcare purchased through the state's HealthSource RI, Governor Dan McKee announced on Friday. 


Hackers gained access to RIBridges, the state's online portal for obtaining social services earlier this month, the governor's office said in a statement, but the breach was not confirmed by its vendor, Deloitte, until Friday. 


"Deloitte confirmed that there is a high probability that a cybercriminal has obtained files with personally identifiable information from RIBridges," the governor's office said in a statement on Saturday. 


A representative from McKee's office was not immediately available to Reuters for comment. 


Anyone who has applied for or received benefits through those programs since 2016 could be affected. 


The state directed Deloitte to shut down RIBridges to remediate the threat, and for the time being, anyone applying for new benefits will have to do so on paper applications until the system is back up. 


Households believed to have been affected will receive a letter from the state notifying them of the problem and explaining steps to be taken to help protect their data and bank accounts.

## Storms encase Iowa, eastern Nebraska in ice; trigger tornado warning in California

date: 2024-12-15, from: VOA News USA

OMAHA, NEBRASKA — A major ice storm created treacherous driving conditions across Iowa and eastern Nebraska this weekend and prompted temporary closures of Interstate 80 after numerous cars and trucks slid off the road. 


Many events were canceled across the region when the storm hit Friday evening, and businesses announced plans to open late Saturday as officials urged people to stay home if possible. Temperatures rose high enough in the afternoon to melt the ice in most places, however. 


"Luckily some warmer air is moving in behind this to make it temporary," said Dave Cousins, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's office in Davenport, Iowa. 


At least one person died in a crash caused by the icy roads in eastern Nebraska. The Washington County Sheriff's office said a 57-year-old woman died after she lost control of her pickup on Highway 30 near Arlington and hit an oncoming truck. The other driver sustained minor injuries. 


Trees topple


Elsewhere a storm and wind gusts of up to 96 kilometers per hour prompted the first tornado warning in San Francisco, California, and caused some damage. Parts of neighboring San Mateo County were also included in the warning, which went out at 5:51 a.m. to about 1 million people in the area. It was lifted by 6:15 a.m. 


The storm toppled trees onto cars and streets and damaged some roofs in San Francisco, which has not seen a tornado since 2005, according to the Weather Service. The damage was being assessed to determine if there was indeed a tornado. 




"This was the first-ever warning for a possible tornado in San Francisco. I would guess there wasn't a clear signature on radar for a warning in 2005," said Roger Gass, a meteorologist in the Weather Service's Monterey, California. He said he was not there in 2005. 


The fast-moving storm prompted warnings for residents to take shelter, but few people have basements in the area. 


"The biggest thing that we tell people in the city is to put as many walls between you and the outside as possible," meteorologist Dalton Behringer said. 


Snow falls at ski resorts


In upstate New York, people were digging out after heavy snow fell. More than 84 centimeters was reported near Orchard Park, where residents are used to dealing with lake-effect snow this time of year. 


And in Nevada, up to 91 centimeters of snow was forecast for Sierra Nevada mountaintops, with a winter storm warning in effect through 10 p.m. More than one-third of a meter fell at some Lake Tahoe ski resorts, according to the National Weather Service's Reno office. 


Interstate 80 was closed for about an 130-kilometer stretch from Applegate, California, to the Nevada state line just west of Reno, where rain was falling and a winter weather advisory remained in effect through the afternoon. 


In western Washington, tens of thousands of people lost electricity Saturday, local news outlets reported, amid a system that brought rain and gusty winds.
