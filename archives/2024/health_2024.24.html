bacterial pathogen detection and clinical characteristics of orthopedic
infection in hospitalized patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAccurate identification of the etiology of orthopedic
infection is very important for correct and timely clinical management,
but it has been poorly studied. In the current study we explored the
association of multiple bacterial pathogens with orthopedic
infection.MethodsHospitalized orthopedic patients were enrolled in a
rural hospital in Qingdao, China. Wound or exudate swab samples were
collected and tested for twelve bacterial pathogens with both culture
and multiplex real time PCR.Results and discussionA total of 349
hospitalized orthopedic patients were enrolled including 193 cases
presenting infection manifestations upon admission and 156 with no sign
of infection. Orthopedic infection patients were mainly male (72.5%)
with more lengthy hospital stay (median 15 days). At least one pathogen
was detected in 42.5% (82/193) of patients with infection while 7.1%
(11/156) in the patients without infection (P &lt; 0.001). S. aureus was
the most prevalent causative pathogen (15.5%). Quantity dependent
pathogen association with infection was observed, particularly for P.
aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, possibly indicating subclinical infection.
Most of the patients with detected pathogens had a previous history of
orthopedic surgery (odds ratio 2.8, P = 0.038). Pathogen specific
clinical manifestations were characterized. Multiplex qPCR, because of
its high sensitivity, superior specificity, and powerful quantification
could be utilized in combination with culture to guide antimicrobial
therapy and track the progression of orthopedic infection during
treatment.</p>

signalling: the key to controlling EV71 replication and inflammatory
response</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease
caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) that frequently affects children,
leading to severe infections in some cases. In general, when infection
occurs, the body upregulates inflammatory responses to eliminate
pathogenic microorganisms to protect the host from infection. However,
EV71 may inhibit host’s innate immunity to promote virus infection. At
present, it is not fully understood how EV71 hijack the host cells for
its own replication. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a natural immune
receptor, historically associated with bacterial endotoxin-induced
inflammatory responses. However, it is still unclear whether and how
TLR4 is altered during EV71 infection. In this study, we observed a
reduction in both TLR4 protein and gene transcript levels in RD, GES-1,
and Vero cells following EV71 infection, as detected by RT-qPCR,
immunofluorescence staining and western blot. Furthermore, we observed
that the TLR4 downstream molecules of MYD88, p-NF-κB p65, p-TBK1 and
related inflammatory cytokines were also reduced, suggesting that
antiviral innate immune and inflammatory response were suppressed. To
determine the impact of TLR4 changes on EV71 infection, we interfered
EV71-infected RD cells with TLR4 agonist or inhibitor and the results
showed that activation of TLR4 inhibited EV71 replication, while
inhibition of TLR4 promote EV71 replication. Besides, EV71 replication
was also promoted in TLR4 siRNA-transfected and EV71-infected RD cells.
This suggests that down-regulation the expression of TLR4 by EV71 can
inhibit host immune defense to promote EV71 self-replication. This novel
mechanism may be a strategy for EV71 to evade host immunity.</p>

detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis based on cyp141 via real-time
fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(cyp141-RealAmp)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is
essential for controlling tuberculosis.<br>Methods We designed a
portable thermocycler-based real-time fluorescence loop-mediated
isothermal amplification assay (cyp141-RealAmp) using six
oligonucleotide primers derived from cyp141 to detect MTB. A combined
number of 213 sputum samples (169 obtained from clinically diagnosed
cases of pulmonary TB and 44 from a control group without tuberculosis)
underwent Acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear, culture, Xpert MTB/RIF assays,
and cyp141-RealAmp assay.<br>ResultsBy targeting MTB cyp141, this
technique could detect as low as 10 copies/reaction within 30 min, and
it was successfully rejected by other mycobacteria and other bacterial
species tested. Of the 169 patients, there was no statistical difference
between the detection rate of cyp141-RealAmp (92.90%, 95% CI:
89.03–96.07) and that of Xpert MTB/RIF (94.67%, 95% CI: 91.28–98.06) (P
&gt; 0.05), but both were statistically higher than that of culture
(65.68%, 95% CI: 58.52–72.84) (P&lt; 0.05) and AFB (57.40%, 95% CI:
49.94–64.86) (P&lt; 0.05). Both cyp141-RealAmp and Xpert MTB/RIF had a
specificity of 100%. Furthermore, a high concordance between
cyp141-RealAmp and Xpert MTB/RIF was found (Kappa = 0.89).ConclusionThe
cyp141-RealAmp assay was shown to be effective, responsive, and accurate
in this study. This method offers a prospective strategy for the speedy
and precise detection of MTB.</p>

endodontalis HmuY differentially participates in heme acquisition
compared to the Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia
hemophore-like proteins</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPorphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas endodontalis
belong to the Bacteroidota phylum. Both species inhabit the oral cavity
and can be associated with periodontal diseases. To survive, they must
uptake heme from the host as an iron and protoporphyrin IX source. Among
the best-characterized heme acquisition systems identified in members of
the Bacteroidota phylum is the P. gingivalis Hmu system, with a leading
role played by the hemophore-like HmuY (HmuYPg)
protein.MethodsTheoretical analysis of selected HmuY proteins and
spectrophotometric methods were employed to determine the heme-binding
mode of the P. endodontalis HmuY homolog (HmuYPe) and its ability to
sequester heme. Growth phenotype and gene expression analysis of P.
endodontalis were employed to reveal the importance of the HmuYPe and
Hmu system for this bacterium.ResultsUnlike in P. gingivalis, where
HmuYPg uses two histidines for heme-iron coordination, other known HmuY
homologs use two methionines in this process. P. endodontalis HmuYPe is
the first characterized representative of the HmuY family that binds
heme using a histidine-methionine pair. It allows HmuYPe to sequester
heme directly from serum albumin and Tannerella forsythia HmuYTf, the
HmuY homolog which uses two methionines for heme-iron coordination. In
contrast to HmuYPg, which sequesters heme directly from methemoglobin,
HmuYPe may bind heme only after the proteolytic digestion of
hemoglobin.ConclusionsWe hypothesize that differences in components of
the Hmu system and structure-based properties of HmuY proteins may
evolved allowing different adaptations of Porphyromonas species to the
changing host environment. This may add to the superior virulence
potential of P. gingivalis over other members of the Bacteroidota
phylum.</p>

effects of different hyaluronic acids on periodontal biofilm-immune cell
interaction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionRecent studies have demonstrated a positive role of
hyaluronic acid (HA) on periodontal clinical outcomes. This in-vitro
study aimed to investigate the impact of four different HAs on
interactions between periodontal biofilm and immune cells.MethodsThe
four HAs included: high-molecular-weight HA (HHA, non-cross-linked),
low-molecular-weight HA (LHA), oligomers HA (OHA), and cross-linked
high-molecular-weight HA (CHA). Serial experiments were conducted to
verify the influence of HAs on: (i) 12-species periodontal biofilm
(formation and pre-existing); (ii) expression of inflammatory cytokines
and HA receptors in monocytic (MONO-MAC-6) cells and periodontal
ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) with or without exposure to periodontal
biofilms; (iii) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
MONO-MAC-6 cells and PDLF with presence of biofilm and HA.ResultsThe
results indicated that HHA and CHA reduced the bacterial counts in a
newly formed (4-h) biofilm and in a pre-existing five-day-old biofilm.
Without biofilm challenge, OHA triggered inflammatory reaction by
increasing IL-1β and IL-10 levels in MONO-MAC cells and IL-8 in PDLF in
a time-dependent manner, whereas CHA suppressed this response by
inhibiting the expression of IL-10 in MONO-MAC cells and IL-8 in PDLF.
Under biofilm challenge, HA decreased the expression of IL-1β (most
decreasing HHA) and increased IL-10 levels in MONO-MAC-6 cells in a
molecular weight dependent manner (most increasing CHA). The interaction
between HA and both cells may occur via ICAM-1 receptor. Biofilm
stimulus increased ROS levels in MONO-MAC-6 cells and PDLF, but only HHA
slightly suppressed the high generation of ROS induced by biofilm
stimulation in both cells.ConclusionOverall, these results indicate that
OHA induces inflammation, while HHA and CHA exhibit anti-biofilm,
primarily anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties in the
periodontal environment.</p>

and dynamic changes of Huanglongbing pathogen in its insect vector
Diaphorina citri</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri Kuwayama is the
leading vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the
causative agent of citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) disease. The distribution
and dynamics of CLas within ACP are critical to understanding how the
transmission, spread and infection of CLas occurs within its host vector
in nature. In this study, the distribution and titer changes of CLas in
various tissues of ACP 5th instar nymphs and adults were examined by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time quantitative PCR
(qPCR) techniques. Results demonstrated that 100% of ACP 5th instar
nymphs and adults were infected with CLas following feeding on infected
plants, and that CLas had widespread distribution in most of the tissues
of ACP. The titers of CLas within the midgut, salivary glands and
hemolymph tissues were the highest in both 5th instar nymphs and adults.
When compared with adults, the titers of CLas in these three tissues of
5th instar nymphs were significantly higher, while in the mycetome,
ovary and testes they were significantly lower than those of adults.
FISH visualization further confirmed these findings. Dynamic analysis of
CLas demonstrated that it was present across all the developmental ages
of ACP adults. There was a discernible upward trend in the presence of
CLas with advancing age in most tissues of ACP adults, including the
midgut, hemolymph, salivary glands, foot, head, cuticula and muscle. Our
findings have significant implications for the comprehensive
understanding of the transmission, dissemination and infestation of
CLas, which is of much importance for developing novel strategies to
halt the spread of CLas, and therefore contribute to the efficient
prevention and control of HLB.</p>

cholestasis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionIn infants with cholestasis, variations in the
enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and the gut microbiota (GM)
characteristics differ between those with biliary atresia (BA) and
non-BA, prompting a differential analysis of their respective GM
profiles.MethodsUsing 16S rDNA gene sequencing to analyse the variance
in GM composition among three groups: infants with BA (BA group, n=26),
non-BA cholestasis (IC group, n=37), and healthy infants (control group,
n=50). Additionally, correlation analysis was conducted between GM and
liver function-related indicators.ResultsPrincipal component analysis
using Bray–Curtis distance measurement revealed a significant
distinction between microbial samples in the IC group compared to the
two other groups. IC-accumulated co-abundance groups exhibited positive
correlations with aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase,
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and total bile acid serum levels.
These correlations were notably reinforced upon the exclusion of
microbial samples from children with BA.ConclusionThe varying
“enterohepatic circulation” status of bile acids in children with BA and
non-BA cholestasis contributes to distinct GM structures and functions.
This divergence underscores the potential for targeted GM interventions
tailored to the specific aetiologies of cholestasis.</p>

of the gut microbiota and its metabolite short-chain fatty acids on
endometriosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In recent years, a growing body of research has confirmed that the
gut microbiota plays a major role in the maintenance of human health and
disease. A gut microbiota imbalance can lead to the development of many
diseases, such as pregnancy complications, adverse pregnancy outcomes,
polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, and cancer. Short-chain fatty
acids are metabolites of specific intestinal bacteria and are crucial
for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and regulating metabolism and
immunity. Endometriosis is the result of cell proliferation, escape from
immune surveillance, and invasive metastasis. There is a strong
correlation between the anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects
of short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbes and the development
of endometriosis. Given that the mechanism of action of gut microbiota
and Short-chain fatty acids in endometriosis remain unclear, this paper
aims to provide a comprehensive review of the complex interactions
between intestinal flora, short-chain fatty acids and endometriosis. In
addition, we explored potential microbial-based treatment strategies for
endometriosis, providing new insights into the future development of
diagnostic tests and prevention and treatment methods for
endometriosis.</p>

multifaceted role of c-di-AMP signaling in the regulation of
Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide structure and function</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThis study unveils the intricate functional association
between cyclic di-3’,5’-adenylic acid (c-di-AMP) signaling, cellular
bioenergetics, and the regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profile in
Porphyromonas gingivalis, a Gram-negative obligate anaerobe considered
as a keystone pathogen involved in the pathogenesis of chronic
periodontitis. Previous research has identified variations in P.
gingivalis LPS profile as a major virulence factor, yet the underlying
mechanism of its modulation has remained elusive.MethodsWe employed a
comprehensive methodological approach, combining two mutants exhibiting
varying levels of c-di-AMP compared to the wild type, alongside an
optimized analytical methodology that combines conventional mass
spectrometry techniques with a novel approach known as FLATn.ResultsWe
demonstrate that c-di-AMP acts as a metabolic nexus, connecting
bioenergetic status to nuanced shifts in fatty acid and glycosyl
profiles within P. gingivalis LPS. Notably, the predicted regulator gene
cdaR, serving as a potent regulator of c-di-AMP synthesis, was found
essential for producing N-acetylgalactosamine and an unidentified
glycolipid class associated with the LPS profile.ConclusionThe
multifaceted roles of c-di-AMP in bacterial physiology are underscored,
emphasizing its significance in orchestrating adaptive responses to
stimuli. Furthermore, our findings illuminate the significance of LPS
variations and c-di-AMP signaling in determining the biological
activities and immunostimulatory potential of P. gingivalis LPS,
promoting a pathoadaptive strategy. The study expands the understanding
of c-di-AMP pathways in Gram-negative species, laying a foundation for
future investigations into the mechanisms governing variations in LPS
structure at the molecular level and their implications for
host-pathogen interactions.</p>

inhibitors targeting furin protease for the management of COVID-19</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is a highly
contagious respiratory disease with widespread societal impact. The
symptoms range from cough, fever, and pneumonia to complications
affecting various organs, including the heart, kidneys, and nervous
system. Despite various ongoing efforts, no effective drug has been
developed to stop the spread of the virus. Although various types of
medications used to treat bacterial and viral diseases have previously
been employed to treat COVID-19 patients, their side effects have also
been observed. The way SARS-CoV-2 infects the human body is very
specific, as its spike protein plays an important role. The S subunit of
virus spike protein cleaved by human proteases, such as furin protein,
is an initial and important step for its internalization into a human
host. Keeping this context, we attempted to inhibit the furin using
phytochemicals that could produce minimal side effects. For this, we
screened 408 natural phytochemicals from various plants having antiviral
properties, against furin protein, and molecular docking and dynamics
simulations were performed. Based on the binding score, the top three
compounds (robustaflavone, withanolide, and amentoflavone) were selected
for further validation. MM/GBSA energy calculations revealed that
withanolide has the lowest binding energy of −57.2 kcal/mol followed by
robustaflavone and amentoflavone with a binding energy of −45.2 kcal/mol
and −39.68 kcal/mol, respectively. Additionally, ADME analysis showed
drug-like properties for these three lead compounds. Hence, these
natural compounds robustaflavone, withanolide, and amentoflavone, may
have therapeutic potential for the management of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting
furin.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection

<p>Taenia crassiceps has been used for decades as an experimental model
for the study of human and porcine cysticercosis. Even though, its life
cycle, tissue organization, ultrastructure and immune response elicited
in the host, have been extensively described, there are many other
biological questions remaining to be addressed. In the present study we
revisited the muscle and neural architecture of cysticerci in two of the
most frequently used strains (WFU and ORF), using conventional staining
and confocal microscopy imaging, aiming to assemble an updated anatomy.
Differences between both strains, including polarization processes
during development of the young budding larvae, are emphasized. We also
performed a search for genes that have been related to peptidergic
neural processes in other related flatworms. These findings can help to
understand the anatomical and molecular consequences of the scolex
presence or absence in both strains.</p>

features of pediatric mucormycosis: role of metagenomic next generation
sequencing in diagnosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMucormycosis is an uncommon invasive fungal infection that
has a high mortality rate in patients with severe underlying diseases,
which leads to immunosuppression. Due to its rarity, determining the
incidence and optimal treatment methods for mucormycosis in children is
challenging. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a rapid,
precise and sensitive method for pathogen detection, which helps in the
early diagnosis and intervention of mucormycosis in children. In order
to increase pediatricians’ understanding of this disease, we conducted a
study on the clinical features of mucormycosis in children and assessed
the role of mNGS in its diagnosis.MethodsWe retrospectively summarized
the clinical data of 14 children with mucormycosis treated at the First
Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2020 to
September 2023.ResultsOf the 14 cases, 11 case of mucormycosis were
classified as probable, and 3 cases were proven as mucormycosis. Most
children (85.71%) had high-risk factors for mucormycosis. All 14
children had lung involvement, with 5 cases of extrapulmonary
dissemination. Among the 14 cases, 4 cases underwent histopathological
examination of mediastinum, lung tissue or kidney tissue, in which
fungal pathogens were identified in 3 patients. Fungal hyphae was
identified in 3 cases of mucormycosis, but only 1 case yielded a
positive culture result. All patients underwent mNGS testing with
samples from blood (8/14), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (6/14), and
tissue (1/14). mNGS detected fungi in all cases: 7 cases had Rhizomucor
pusillus, 4 cases had Rhizopus oryzae, 3 cases had Rhizopus microsporus,
1 case had Lichtheimia ramosa, and 1 case had Rhizomucor miehei.
Coinfections were found with Aspergillus in 3 cases, bacteria in 3
cases, and viruses in 5 cases.ConclusionChildren with mucormycosis
commonly exhibit non-specific symptoms like fever and cough during the
initial stages. Early diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and imaging
is crucial in children suspected of having mucormycosis. mNGS, as a
supplementary diagnostic method, offers greater sensitivity and shorter
detection time compared to traditional mucormycosis culture or
histopathological testing. Additionally, mNGS enables simultaneous
detection of bacteria and viruses, facilitating timely and appropriate
administration of antibiotics and thereby enhancing patient
outcomes.</p>

aureus persistence in osteocytes: weathering the storm of antibiotics
and autophagy/xenophagy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Staphylococcus aureus is a major causative pathogen of osteomyelitis.
Intracellular infections of resident bone cells including osteocytes can
persist despite gold-standard clinical intervention. The mechanisms by
which intracellular S. aureus evades antibiotic therapy are unknown. In
this study, we utilised an in vitro S. aureus infection model of human
osteocytes to investigate whether antibiotic-mediated dysregulation of
autophagy contributes to this phenomenon. Infected or non-infected
osteocyte-like cells were exposed to combinations of rifampicin,
vancomycin, and modulators of autophagy. Intracellular bacterial growth
characteristics were assessed using colony-forming unit (CFU) analysis,
viable bacterial DNA abundance, and the rate of escape into
antibiotic-free medium, together with measures of autophagic flux.
Rifampicin, alone or in combination with vancomycin, caused a rapid
decrease in the culturability of intracellular bacteria, concomitant
with stable or increased absolute bacterial DNA levels. Both antibiotics
significantly inhibited autophagic flux. However, modulation of
autophagic flux did not affect viable bacterial DNA levels. In summary,
autophagy was shown to be a factor in the host–pathogen relationship in
this model, as its modulation affected the growth state of intracellular
S. aureus with respect to both their culturability and propensity to
escape the intracellular niche. While rifampicin and vancomycin
treatments moderately suppressed autophagic flux acutely, this did not
explain the paradoxical response of antibiotic treatment in decreasing
S. aureus culturability whilst failing to clear bacterial DNA and hence
intracellular bacterial load. Thus, off-target effects of rifampicin and
vancomycin on autophagic flux in osteocyte-like cells could not explain
the persistent S. aureus infection in these cells.</p>

synergistic antiviral efficacy between a novel elite controller-derived
dipeptide and antiretrovirals against drug-resistant HIV-1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe naturally occurring dipeptide Tryptophylglycine (WG)
is enhanced in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infected Elite
Controllers (EC). We have shown that this dipeptide has an anti-HIV-1
effect and evaluated now its synergistic antiretroviral activity, in
combination with current antiretrovirals against multi-drug resistant
HIV-1 isolates.MethodsDrug selectivity assay with WG-am and ARVs agains
HIV-1 resistant isolates were carried out. Subsequently, two methods,
Chou-Talalay’s Combination Index (CI) and ZIP synergy score (SS), were
used to quantify the synergism.ResultsWG-am had a moderate/strong
synergism with the four tested antiretrovirals: raltegravir, tenofovir,
efavirenz, darunavir. WG-am:TDF had strong synergism at ED50, ED75, ED90
(CI: &lt;0.2) in isolates resistant to protease inhibitors or integrase
strand inhibitors (INSTI), and a slightly less synergism in isolates
resistant to non-nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase
inhibitors. WG-am combined with each of the four drugs inhibited all
drug-resistant isolates with over 95% reduction at maximum concentration
tested. The highest selectivity indexes (CC50/ED50) were in
INSTI-resistant isolates.ConclusionOur data suggest that WG, identified
as occurring and enhanced in Elite Controllers has a potential to become
a future treatment option in patients with HIV-1 strains resistant to
any of the four major categories of anti-HIV-1 compounds.</p>

features of fowl adenovirus serotype-4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4) is highly pathogenic to broilers
aged 3 to 5 weeks and has caused considerable economic loss in the
poultry industry worldwide. FAdV-4 is the causative agent of
hydropericardium-hepatitis syndrome (HHS) or hydropericardium syndrome
(HPS). The virus targets mainly the liver, and HPS symptoms are observed
in infected chickens. This disease was first reported in Pakistan but
has now spread worldwide, and over time, various deletions in the FAdV
genome and mutations in its major structural proteins have been
detected. This review provides detailed information about FAdV-4 genome
organization, physiological features, epidemiology, coinfection with
other viruses, and host immune suppression. Moreover, we investigated
the role and functions of important structural proteins in FAdV-4
pathogenesis. Finally, the potential regulatory effects of FAdV-4
infection on ncRNAs are also discussed.</p>

and C-reactive protein-to-prealbumin ratios as prognostic indicators in
severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe primary aim of this study is to investigate the
correlation between serum levels of fibrinogen-to-prealbumin ratio (FPR)
and C-reactive protein-to-prealbumin ratio (CPR) and prognostic outcomes
among patients with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS).
SFTS, characterized by elevated mortality rates, represents a
substantial public health challenge as an emerging infectious
disease.MethodsThe study included 159 patients with SFTS. Clinical and
laboratory data were compared between the survival and death groups.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were utilized
to identify independent risk factors for mortality. The predictive
efficacy of FPR and CPR was evaluated using receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve. Survival analysis was conducted using the
Kaplan–Meier curve and the log-rank test was employed for
comparison.ResultsThe death group exhibited significantly elevated
levels of FPR and CPR compared to the survival group (P &lt; 0.05).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that both FPR and
CPR independently correlated with a poorer prognosis among patients with
SFTS. The ROC curve analysis indicated that FPR and CPR had superior
predictive capabilities compared to C-reactive protein and fibrinogen.
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with SFTS who
have FPR &gt; 0.045 (log-rank test; χ2 = 17.370, P &lt; 0.001) or CPR
&gt; 0.05 (log-rank test; χ2 = 19.442, P &lt; 0.001) experienced
significantly lower survival rates within a 30-day follow-up
period.ConclusionElevated levels of FPR and CPR serve as distinct risk
factors for mortality among patients with SFTS, indicating their
potential to predict an unfavorable prognosis in these patients.</p>

microbiome-derived hydrolases—an underrated target of natural product
metabolism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying gut
microbiome-derived hydrolases in relation to oral drug metabolism,
particularly focusing on natural product drugs. Despite the significance
of natural product drugs in the field of oral medications, there is a
lack of research on the regulatory interplay between gut
microbiome-derived hydrolases and these drugs. This review delves into
the interaction between intestinal microbiome-derived hydrolases and
natural product drugs metabolism from three key perspectives. Firstly,
it examines the impact of glycoside hydrolases, amide hydrolases,
carboxylesterase, bile salt hydrolases, and epoxide hydrolase on the
structure of natural products. Secondly, it explores how natural product
drugs influence microbiome-derived hydrolases. Lastly, it analyzes the
impact of interactions between hydrolases and natural products on
disease development and the challenges in developing microbial-derived
enzymes. The overarching goal of this review is to lay a solid
theoretical foundation for the advancement of research and development
in new natural product drugs and personalized treatment.</p>
