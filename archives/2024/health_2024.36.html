nucleatum induces invasive growth and angiogenic responses in malignant
oral keratinocytes that are cell line- and bacterial
strain-specific</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic commensal of the oral cavity
recently reported to be associated with cancers of the gastrointestinal
tract and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we
investigate the impact on oral keratinocytes of infection with a
genetically diverse set of strains of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum
recovered from patients with oral dysplasia (n=6). We employed H357 oral
keratinocytes derived from a stage 1 OSCC and H376 cells derived from a
stage 3 OSCC. Adhesion phenotypes were strain specific, with 3/6
clinical isolates examined exhibiting higher adherence to the stage 3
H376 cell line. Conversely, intracellular invasion was greatest in the
H357 cells and was associated with specific transcriptional responses
including autophagy and keratinization. Infection of both H357 and H376
cell lines induced transcriptional and cytokine responses linked to
cancer cell migration and angiogenesis. F. nucleatum infection induced
greater levels of MMP9 secretion in the H376 cell line which was
associated with enhanced motility and invasion phenotypes. Additionally,
the degree of F. nucleatum induced invasive growth by H376 cells varied
between different clinical isolates of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum.
Blockage of CCL5 signalling using the inhibitor metCCL5 resulted in
reduced keratinocyte invasion. F. nucleatum infection also induced
expression of the pro-angiogenic chemokine MCP-1 and the angiogenic
growth factor VEGF-A resulting in increased capillary-like tube
formation in HUVEC cells, most significantly in H376 cells. Treatment of
HUVEC cells with resveratrol, a VEGF-A signalling inhibitor,
significantly attenuated F. nucleatum induced tube formation. Our data
indicate that the outcomes of F. nucleatum-oral cell interactions can
vary greatly depending on the bacterial genotype and the malignant
phenotype of the host cell.</p>

Microbiology</p>
<p>A case of Eimonosis orientalis was reported in a 52-year-old male
farmer who presented with cough, phlegm, fever, headache, and nausea for
more than 4 days. Haemophilic cells and fungal spores were identified in
the bone marrow smear and confirmed as Aemon orientalis by culture. The
same bacteria were also isolated from blood cultures</p>

in the epidemiological patterns of respiratory syncytial virus and human
metapneumovirus infection among pediatric patients and their correlation
with severe cases: a long-term retrospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesWe aim to investigate the prevalence of respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) among pediatric
patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) in southern China
both pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic, as well as identify associated
risk factors for severe infections.MethodsThe study conducted a
real-time PCR analysis on hospitalized children with ARTI from 2012 to
2023, specifically targeting RSV, hMPV, and other respiratory pathogens.
Additionally, demographic data was collected during this
analysis.ResultsThe prevalence of RSV occurs triennially, and likewise,
the temporal pattern of hMPV outbreaks mirrors that of RSV. The peak
infection rates of RSV and hMPV occurred during and following the
implementation of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control measures. The
incidence of RSV infection exhibited bimodal peaks in 2022, while hMPV
demonstrated seasonal peaks during the spring, fall, and winter periods
post-COVID-19 pandemic. After the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an
upward trend in the proportion of female patients and patients aged one
year and older presenting with ARTI, RSV infections, and hMPV
infections. Infant (OR = 4.767, 95%CI: [3.888–5.846], p &lt; 0.0001),
presence of co-infection (OR = 0.540, 95%CI: [0.404–0.722], p &lt;
0.0001), and existence of comorbidities (OR = 1.582, 95%CI:
[1.285–1.949], p &lt; 0.0001) was the risk ratio for the severity of RSV
infection. Children infected with hMPV under the age of 1 year (OR =
0.322, 95%CI: [0.180 – 0.575], p &lt; 0.0001), as well as those with
comorbidities (OR = 8.809, 95%CI: [4.493 – 17.272], p &lt; 0.0001), have
a higher risk of developing severe illness.ConclusionThe changing
epidemiological patterns have the potential to lead to widespread severe
outbreaks among children, particularly those with underlying medical
conditions who may experience more severe symptoms. Conducting
surveillance for pneumoviridae viruses in children is an imperative
measure to establish a robust foundation for future epidemic prevention
and treatment strategies.</p>

the power of short-chain fatty acids in ameliorating intestinal mucosal
immunity: a new porcine nutritional approach</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), a subset of organic fatty acids with
carbon chains ranging from one to six atoms in length, encompass
acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These compounds are the endproducts
of dietary fiber fermentation, primarily catalyzed by the glycolysis and
pentose phosphate pathways within the gut microbiota. SCFAs act as
pivotal energy substrates and signaling molecules in the realm of animal
nutrition, exerting a profound influence on the intestinal, immune
system, and intestinal barrier functions. Specifically, they contibute
to 60-70% of the total energy requirements in ruminants and 10-25% in
monogastric animals. SCFAs have demonstrated the capability to
effectively modulate intestinal pH, optimize the absorption of mineral
elements, and impede pathogen invasion. Moreover, they enhance the
expression of proteins associated with intestinal tight junctions and
stimulate mucus production, thereby refining intestinal tissue
morphology and preserving the integrity of the intestinal structure.
Notably, SCFAs also exert anti-inflammatory properties, mitigating
inflammation within the intestinal epithelium and strengthening the
intestinal barrier’s defensive capabilities. The present review
endeavors to synthesize recent findings regarding the role of SCFAs as
crucial signaling intermediaries between the metabolic activities of gut
microbiota and the status of porcine cells. It also provides a
comprehensive overview of the current literature on SCFAs’ impact on
immune responses within the porcine intestinal mucosa.</p>
