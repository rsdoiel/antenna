Kidney Disease: The Potassium Dilemma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: The Kidney Dietitian</p>
<p>
Can people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) eat potatoes? What about
bananas or tomatoes?  All of these foods are notorious for being high in
potassium.  Kidney patients are often told to stay away from them.  I
have good news! Patients with kidney disease CAN (and should!) enjoy
these high potassium foods.  Keep reading to learn […]

breast milk isolated lactic acid bacteria: antimicrobial and
immunomodulatory activity on the Galleria mellonella burn wound
model</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionManaging burn injuries is a challenge in healthcare. Due
to the alarming increase in antibiotic resistance, new prophylactic and
therapeutic strategies are being sought. This study aimed to evaluate
the potential of live Lactic Acid Bacteria for managing burn infections,
using Galleria mellonella larvae as an alternative preclinical animal
model and comparing the outcomes with a common antibiotic.MethodsThe
antimicrobial activity of LAB isolated from human breast milk was
assessed in vitro against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853.
Additionally, the immunomodulatory effects of LAB were evaluated in vivo
using the G. mellonella burn wound infection model.Results and
discussionIn vitro results demonstrated the antimicrobial activity of
Lactic Acid Bacteria against P. aeruginosa. In vivo results show that
their prophylactic treatment improves, statistically significant, larval
survival and modulates the expression of immunity-related genes,
Gallerimycin and Relish/NF-κB, strain-dependently. These findings lay
the foundation and suggest a promising alternative for burn wound
prevention and management, reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance,
enhancing immune modulation, and validating the potential G. mellonella
as a skin burn wound model.</p>

the misty lands of Chlamydia trachomatis infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Chlamydia are Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterial
pathogens that infect eukaryotic cells and reside within a host-derived
vacuole known as the inclusion. To facilitate intracellular replication,
these bacteria must engage in host-pathogen interactions to obtain
nutrients and membranes required for the growth of the inclusion,
thereby sustaining prolonged bacterial colonization. Autophagy is a
highly conserved process that delivers cytoplasmic substrates to the
lysosome for degradation. Pathogens have developed strategies to
manipulate and/or exploit autophagy to promote their replication and
persistence. This review delineates recent advances in elucidating the
interplay between Chlamydia trachomatis infection and autophagy in
recent years, emphasizing the intricate strategies employed by both the
Chlamydia pathogens and host cells. Gaining a deeper understanding of
these interactions could unveil novel strategies for the prevention and
treatment of Chlamydia infection.</p>

id="complement-c3-deposition-restricts-the-proliferation-of-internalized-staphylococcus-aureus-by-promoting-autophagy">Complement
C3 deposition restricts the proliferation of internalized Staphylococcus
aureus by promoting autophagy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Complement C3 (C3) is usually deposited spontaneously on the surfaces
of invading bacteria prior to internalization, but the impact of C3
coating on cellular responses is largely unknown. Staphylococcus aureus
(S. aureus) is a facultative intracellular pathogen that subverts
autophagy and replicates in both phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells. In
the present study, we deposited C3 components on the surface of S.
aureus by complement opsonization before cell infection and confirmed
that C3-coatings remained on the surface of the bacteria after they have
invaded the cells, suggesting S. aureus cannot escape or degrade C3
labeling. We found that the C3 deposition on S. aureus notably enhanced
cellular autophagic responses, and distinguished these responses as
xenophagy, in contrast to LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP).
Furthermore, this upregulation was due to the recruitment of and direct
interaction with autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1), thereby
resulting in autophagy-dependent resistance to bacterial growth within
cells. Interestingly, this autophagic effect occurred only after C3
activation by enzymatic cleavage because full-length C3 without cleavage
of the complement cascade reaction, although capable of binding to
ATG16L1, failed to promote autophagy. These findings demonstrate the
biological function of intracellular C3 upon bacterial infection in
enhancing autophagy against internalized S. aureus.</p>

network pharmacology, machine learning, molecular docking and molecular
dynamic to explore the mechanism of Chufeng Qingpi decoction in treating
schistosomiasis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAlthough the Chufeng Qingpi Decoction (CQD) has
demonstrated clinical effectiveness in the treatment of schistosomiasis,
the precise active components and the underlying mechanisms of its
therapeutic action remain elusive. To achieve a profound comprehension,
we incorporate network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis, molecular
docking, and molecular dynamics simulations as investigative
methodologies within our research framework.MethodUtilizing TCMSP and
UniProt, we identified formula components and targets. Cytoscape 3.10.0
was used to construct an herb–target interaction network. Genecards,
DisGeNET, and OMIM databases were examined for disease-related
objectives. A Venn diagram identified the intersection of compound and
disease targets. Using Draw Venn, overlapping targets populated STRING
for PPI network. CytoNCA identified schistosomiasis treatment targets.
GO &amp; KEGG enrichment analysis followed High-scoring genes in PPI
were analyzed by LASSO, RF, SVM-RFE. Molecular docking &amp; simulations
investigated target-compound interactions.ResultThe component’s target
network encompassed 379 nodes, 1629 edges, highlighting compounds such
as wogonin, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin. Amongst the proteins
within the PPI network, PTGS2, TNF, TGFB1, BCL2, TP53, IL10, JUN, MMP2,
IL1B, and MYC stood out as the most prevalent entities. GO and KEGG
revealed that mainly involved the responses to UV, positive regulation
of cell migration and motility. The signal pathways encompassed Pathways
in cancer, Lipid and atherosclerosis, Fluid shear stress and
atherosclerosis, as well as the AGE-RAGE. Bioinformatics analysis
indicated TP53 was the core gene. Ultimately, the molecular docking
revealed that wogonin, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin each
exhibited significant affinity in their respective interactions with
TP53. Notably, kaempferol exhibited the lowest binding energy,
indicating a highly stable interaction with TP53. Lastly, we validated
the stability of the binding interaction between the four small
molecules and the TP53 through molecular dynamics simulations. The
molecular dynamics simulation further validated the strongest binding
between TP53 and kaempferol. In essence, our research groundbreaking in
its nature elucidates for the first time the underlying molecular
mechanism of CQD in the therapeutic management of schistosomiasis,
thereby providing valuable insights and guidance for the treatment of
this disease.ConclusionThis study uncovered the efficacious components
and underlying molecular mechanisms of the Chufeng Qingpi Decoction in
the management of schistosomiasis, thereby offering valuable insights
for future fundamental research endeavors.</p>

performance of metagenomic sequencing in patients with suspected
infection: a large-scale retrospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has been
widely reported to identify pathogens in infectious diseases (IDs). In
this work, we intended to investigate the diagnostic value and clinical
acceptance of paired-samples mNGS as compared to the culture
method.MethodsA total of 361 patients with suspected infection were
retrospectively included. With reference to the clinical diagnosis, we
compared the diagnostic performance and clinical acceptance in pathogen
detection between mNGS and culture tests. Moreover, the pathogen
concordance of paired blood and respiratory tract (RT) samples in mNGS
assay was investigated.ResultsAmong 511 samples, 62.04% were shown to be
pathogen positive by mNGS, and that for clinical diagnosis was 51.86%
(265/511). When compared to culture assay (n = 428), mNGS had a
significantly higher positivity rate (51.87% vs. 33.18%). With reference
to the clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity of mNGS outperformed that of
culture (89.08% vs. 56.72%). Importantly, mNGS exhibited a clinically
accepted rate significantly superior to that of culture. In addition,
the mNGS result from 53 paired blood and RT samples showed that most
pairs were pathogen positive by both blood and RT, with pathogens
largely being partially matched.ConclusionThrough this large-scale
study, we further illustrated that mNGS had a clinically accepted rate
and sensitivity superior to those of the traditional culture method in
diagnosing infections. Moreover, blood and paired RT samples mostly
shared partial-matched positive pathogens, especially for pathogens with
abundant read numbers in RT, indicating that both blood and RT mNGS can
aid the identification of pathogens for respiratory system
infection.</p>

lon protease to inhibit persister cell formation in Salmonella
Typhimurium: a drug repositioning approach</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivePersister cells are a specific subset of bacteria capable of
surviving exposure to lethal doses of antibiotics, leading to antibiotic
therapy failures and infection relapses. This research explores the
utilization of drug repositioning to target the Lon protease in
Salmonella Typhimurium.MethodIn this study, FDA-approved drugs sourced
from the Drug Bank database were screened to identify existing
pharmaceuticals with the potential to combat the Lon protease. The
formation of persister cells in the presence of antibiotics, as well as
the combination of antibiotics with potential Lon protease inhibitors,
was examined. Furthermore, the expression of type II toxin-antitoxin
system genes was analyzed to enhance our comprehension of the
inhibitors’ effects.ResultMolecular docking analysis revealed that
Diosmin and Nafcillin exhibited strong binding affinity to the Lon
protease. Molecular dynamics simulation trajectories analysis
demonstrated that the interaction of these ligands with the enzyme did
not induce instability; rather, the enzyme’s structure remained stable.
Combinations of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with either Nafcillin or
Diosmin led to significant reductions in bacterial cell counts.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of these combinations, when compared to
antibiotics alone, highlighted the substantial impact of Nafcillin and
Diosmin in reducing type II TA system gene expression.ConclusionThese
findings suggest promising prospects for developing novel therapeutic
approaches targeting persister cells to mitigate treatment failures in
Salmonella infections.</p>

of severe SARS-COV-2 infection and paraquat poisoning in human lung
tissue samples: comparison of microbial infected and toxic pulmonary
fibrosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPulmonary fibrosis (PF) encompasses a spectrum of lung
conditions characterized by the abnormal accumulation of scar tissue in
the lungs, leading to impaired respiratory function. Various conditions
can result in severe PF, among which viral infections have emerged as
significant triggers. In addition to viral infections, exposure to toxic
substances such as paraquat represents another significant risk factor
for PF. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the dissimilarities and
similarities between PF triggered by viral infections and chemical
toxicants, using the mechanism of PF in IPF as a
reference.MethodsData-independent acquisition proteomics technology was
employed to identify COVID-19 and paraquat-induced PF from the autopsy
of lung tissue samples obtained from individuals who died due to PF.
Bioinformatics was employed for differential protein analysis, and
selected indicators were validated on pathological sections.ResultsOur
results showed that the differential proteins associated with the two
causes of PF were enriched in similar lung fibrosis-related signaling
pathways, such as the Wnt signaling pathway. However, differences were
observed in proteins such as CACYBP, we verified the consistency of the
results with proteomics using the IHC approachConclusionThis study
illuminates distinct protein-level differences by investigating
pulmonary fibrosis pathways in severe COVID-19 and paraquat poisoning.
Although both conditions activate lung-protective and repair pathways,
COVID-19 shows limited phosphorylation-independent ubiquitination of
β-catenin compared to paraquat toxicity. These findings shed light on
potential therapeutic targets for PF induced via diverse factors.</p>

in gut microbiota increases intestinal γ-aminobutyric acid and
alleviates anxiety behavior: a possible mechanism via the action on
intestinal epithelial cells</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The role of the gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis has attracted
attention in recent years. Some gut microbiota produces γ-aminobutyric
acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammals, in vitro,
but the correlation between gut microbiota composition and intestinal
GABA concentration, as well as the action of intestinal GABA in vivo,
are poorly understood. Herein, we found that the intestinal GABA
concentration was increased in mice by the intervention of the gut
microbiota with neomycin or Bifidobacterium bifidum TMC3115 (TMC3115).
Administration of TMC3115 reduced anxiety without affecting serum levels
of serotonin, corticosterone, or GABA. We further found that intestinal
epithelial cells expressed GABA receptor subunits and mediated
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling upon GABA stimulation. In
addition, administration of TMC3115 induced mitogen-activated protein
kinase signaling in colonic epithelial cells but not in small intestinal
epithelial cells in mice. These results indicate that GABA produced by
the gut microbiota, mainly in the colon, may affect host behavioral
characteristics via GABA receptors expressed in intestinal epithelial
cells without being transferred to the blood. This study suggests a
novel mechanism by which intestinal GABA exerts physiological effects,
even in the presence of the blood-brain barrier.</p>

<p>BackgroundThere is a crosstalk between gut microbiota and
radiotherapy. The aim of this study is to use bibliometric analysis to
explore the research status and development trends of research on gut
microbiota and radiotherapy.MethodsA literature search regarding
publications on gut microbiota and radiotherapy from 2004 to 2023 was

institutions, preferred journals, top authors and co-cited authors, top
co-cited references, keywords and citation were analyzed in this
study.ResultsA total of 2821 papers were extracted. The number of papers

agalactiae isolated from clinical mastitis cases on large dairy farms in
north China: phenotype, genotype of antimicrobial resistance and
virulence genes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Streptococcus agalactiae (Strep. agalactiae) is bovine mastitis
pathogen and has thus became a matter of concern to dairy farms
worldwide in terms of economic loss. The aims of this study were to (a)
determine virulence genes, and (b) characterize the antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) profiles and AMR genes and (c) figure out the
relationship between AMR phenotypes and genotypes of Strep. agalactiae
isolated from dairy cows in north China. A total of 20 virulence genes
and 23 AMR genes of 140 isolates collected from 12 farms in six
provinces were studied. The antimicrobial susceptibility of 10
veterinary commonly used antimicrobials were tested using the broth
microdilution method. Results showed that all the isolates harbored the
virulence genes lacIV, gapC, and dltA. The isolates that harbored the
genes lacIII, fbsA, hylB, and cfb exhibited the high prevalence
(99.29%), followed by isolates that harbored lacI (98.57%), bibA
(97.86%), cylE (97.14%), lacII (92.14%), cspA (52.14%), pavA (25%), bca
(2.14%), and scpB (0.71%). The fbsB, lmb, spbI, bac, and rib genes were
not detected. The virulence patterns of B (fbsA_cfb_cylE_
hylB_bibA_cspA_ gapC_dltA_lacIII/IV) and C (fbsA_cfb_ bibA _ gapC_
dltA_lacIV) were dominant, accounting for 97.86% of the isolates. The
following AMR genes were prevalent: pbp1A (97.14%), tet(M) (95.00%), lnu
(A) (80.71%), erm (B) (75.00%), tet(O) (72.14%), blaZ (49.29%), tet(S)
(29.29%), blaTEM (25.71%), erm (A) (17.14%), erm (C) (13.57%), tet (L)
(10.71%), linB (2.86%), and erm (TR) (2.86%). The pbp2b, mecA1, mecC,
lnu (D), erm (F/G/Q), and mef (A) genes were not detected. Eighty
percent of the isolates harbored AMR genes and were highly resistant to
tetracycline, followed by macrolides (10.71%), lincosamides (9.29%) and
β-lactams (4.29%). In conclusion, isolates only exhibited well
correlation between tetracyclines resistance phenotype and genotype, and
almost all isolates harbored intact combination of virulence genes.</p>

study of chicken lung transcriptome to understand the host immune
response during Newcastle disease virus challenge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNewcastle disease is one of the significant issues in the
poultry industry, having catastrophic effects worldwide. The lung is one
of the essential organs which harbours Bronchus-associated lymphoid
tissue and plays a vital role in the immune response. Leghorn and
Fayoumi breeds are known to have differences in resistance to Newcastle
disease. Along with genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also
known to regulate various biological pathways through gene
regulation.MethodsThis study analysed the lung transcriptome data and
identified the role of genes and long non-coding RNAs in differential
immune resistance. The computational pipeline, FHSpipe, as used in our
previous studies on analysis of harderian gland and trachea
transcriptome was used to identify genes and lncRNAs. This was followed
by differential expression analysis, functional annotation of genes and
lncRNAs, identification of transcription factors, microRNAs and finally
validation using qRT-PCR.Results and discussionA total of 8219 novel
lncRNAs were identified. Of them, 1263 lncRNAs and 281 genes were
differentially expressed. About 66 genes were annotated with either an
immune-related GO term or pathway, and 12 were annotated with both. In
challenge and breed-based analysis, most of these genes were upregulated
in Fayoumi compared to Leghorn, and in timepoint-based analysis, Leghorn
challenge chicken showed downregulation between time points. A similar
trend was observed in the expression of lncRNAs. Co-expression analysis
has revealed several lncRNAs co-expressing with immune genes with a
positive correlation. Several genes annotated with non-immune pathways,
including metabolism, signal transduction, transport of small molecules,
extracellular matrix organization, developmental biology and cellular
processes, were also impacted. With this, we can understand that Fayoumi
chicken showed upregulated immune genes and positive cis-lncRNAs during
both the non-challenged and NDV-challenge conditions, even without viral
transcripts in the tissue. This finding shows that these
immune-annotated genes and coexpressing cis-lncRNAs play a significant
role in Fayoumi being comparatively resistant to NDV compared to
Leghorn. Our study affirms and expands upon the outcomes of previous
studies and highlights the crucial role of lncRNAs during the immune
response to NDV.ConclusionThis analysis clearly shows the differences in
the gene expression patterns and lncRNA co-expression with the genes
between Leghorn and Fayoumi, indicating that the lncRNAs and
co-expressing genes might potentially have a role in differentiating
these breeds. We hypothesise that these genes and lncRNAs play a vital
role in the higher resistance of Fayoumi to NDV than Leghorn. This study
can pave the way for future studies to unravel the biological mechanism
behind the regulation of immune-related genes.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Given the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance, scientists
are urgently seeking adjunct antimicrobial strategies, such as phage
therapy (PT). However, despite promising results for the treatment of
musculoskeletal infections in our center, crucial knowledge gaps remain.
Therefore, a prospective observational study (PHAGEFORCE) and a
multidisciplinary approach was set up to achieve and optimize
standardized treatment guidelines. At our center, PT is strictly
controlled and monitored by a multidisciplinary taskforce. Each phage
treatment follows the same pathway to ensure standardization and data
quality. Within the PHAGEFORCE framework, we established a testing
platform to gain insight in the safety and efficacy of PT,
biodistribution, phage kinetics and the molecular interaction between
phages and bacteria. The draining fluid is collected to determine the
phage titer and bacterial load. In addition, all bacterial isolates are
fully characterized by genome sequencing to monitor the emergence of
phage resistance. We hereby present a standardized bench-to-bedside
protocol to gain more insight in the kinetics and dynamics of PT for
musculoskeletal infections.</p>

and prognostic utility of neutrophil in severe patients with K.
pneumoniae infection are crucial for clinical management and prognostic
assessment.MethodsK. pneumoniae patients with different infection sites
were enrolled from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV and

counts within 30 days of clinical onset were examined using locally

performed to assess the relationship between neutrophil counts and
hospital mortality.ResultsA total of 1,705 patients caused by K.
pneumonia were included in the study. The non-survivor group exhibited a
comparatively older age and a higher proportion of K. pneumoniae
infections originating from respiratory and bloodstream sources compared
to the survivor group (38.4% vs 21.1%, p&lt;0.0001, and 15.1% vs 10.3%,
p=0.021). Patients combined with multiple drug resistance strains,
respiratory infection, liver disease, and above 60 years exhibited a
specific dynamic process of neutrophil levels. Neutrophils counts peaked
at admission and 1-2 weeks later. There was a ‘U’-shaped relationship
between neutrophil counts and hospital mortality.ConclusionsNeutrophils
in K. pneumoniae infected patients have distinctive features and dynamic
clinical trajectories. Close monitoring of severe patients infected with
K. pneumoniae upon admission and during the first 1-2 weeks after
admission is of utmost importance, particularly for patients with a
neutrophil count exceeding 8.0×109/L.</p>

influence of Helicobacter pylori infection on acute coronary syndrome
and lipid metabolism in the Chinese ethnicity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients frequently present a
relatively high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.
H. pylori was previously hypothesized to induce ACS through the
regulation of lipid levels. However, the risk of H. pylori-induced ACS
varies significantly among different ethnic groups, and the associations
between H. pylori and lipid parameters remain unclear. This study aimed
to systematically assess the risk of ACS in Chinese populations with H.
pylori infection while also evaluating the effects of H. pylori on lipid
parameters.Materials and methodsA hospital-based case−control study
involving 280 participants was conducted. Immunoblotting was used for
the detection and genotyping of H. pylori. The associations between H.
pylori and ACS, as well as lipid parameters, were analyzed via the
chi-square test and a multiple logistic regression model.ResultsH.
pylori infection significantly increased the risk of ACS among all
participants (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 4.04, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 1.76−9.25, P &lt; 0.05), with no associations with virulence
factors (cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) or vacuole toxin geneA
(VacA)). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant increase in the risk
of ACS among the elderly population aged 56−64 years with H. pylori
infection. Additionally, a substantial association was observed between
H. pylori and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). No significant
differences were found in lipid parameters, including low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol
(TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and the LDL/HDL
ratio, between individuals positive and negative for H. pylori
infection. Similar results were observed between the ACS group and the
control group.ConclusionsOur study has demonstrated for the first time
that H. pylori does not significantly impact lipid metabolism but
increases the risk of ACS fourfold in the Chinese population (OR = 4.04,
95% CI: 1.76−9.25). Furthermore, the virulence factors of H. pylori
(CagA and VacA) may not be involved in the mechanisms by which they
promote the development of ACS. This finding provides additional
evidence for the association between H. pylori and ACS among different
ethnic groups and refutes the biological mechanism by which H. pylori
affects ACS through lipid metabolism regulation. Regular screening for
H. pylori and eradication treatment in elderly individuals and those at
high risk for ACS may be effective measures for reducing the incidence
of ACS. Future research should include multicenter randomized controlled
trials and explore host genetics and the effects of H. pylori on the gut
microbiota as potential biological pathways linking H. pylori and
ACS.</p>

nucleatum induces invasive growth and angiogenic responses in malignant
oral keratinocytes that are cell line- and bacterial
strain-specific</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic commensal of the oral cavity
recently reported to be associated with cancers of the gastrointestinal
tract and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we
investigate the impact on oral keratinocytes of infection with a
genetically diverse set of strains of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum
recovered from patients with oral dysplasia (n=6). We employed H357 oral
keratinocytes derived from a stage 1 OSCC and H376 cells derived from a
stage 3 OSCC. Adhesion phenotypes were strain specific, with 3/6
clinical isolates examined exhibiting higher adherence to the stage 3
H376 cell line. Conversely, intracellular invasion was greatest in the
H357 cells and was associated with specific transcriptional responses
including autophagy and keratinization. Infection of both H357 and H376
cell lines induced transcriptional and cytokine responses linked to
cancer cell migration and angiogenesis. F. nucleatum infection induced
greater levels of MMP9 secretion in the H376 cell line which was
associated with enhanced motility and invasion phenotypes. Additionally,
the degree of F. nucleatum induced invasive growth by H376 cells varied
between different clinical isolates of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum.
Blockage of CCL5 signalling using the inhibitor metCCL5 resulted in
reduced keratinocyte invasion. F. nucleatum infection also induced
expression of the pro-angiogenic chemokine MCP-1 and the angiogenic
growth factor VEGF-A resulting in increased capillary-like tube
formation in HUVEC cells, most significantly in H376 cells. Treatment of
HUVEC cells with resveratrol, a VEGF-A signalling inhibitor,
significantly attenuated F. nucleatum induced tube formation. Our data
indicate that the outcomes of F. nucleatum-oral cell interactions can
vary greatly depending on the bacterial genotype and the malignant
phenotype of the host cell.</p>

in the epidemiological patterns of respiratory syncytial virus and human
metapneumovirus infection among pediatric patients and their correlation

<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesWe aim to investigate the prevalence of respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) among pediatric
patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) in southern China
both pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic, as well as identify associated
risk factors for severe infections.MethodsThe study conducted a
real-time PCR analysis on hospitalized children with ARTI from 2012 to
2023, specifically targeting RSV, hMPV, and other respiratory pathogens.
Additionally, demographic data was collected during this
analysis.ResultsThe prevalence of RSV occurs triennially, and likewise,
the temporal pattern of hMPV outbreaks mirrors that of RSV. The peak
infection rates of RSV and hMPV occurred during and following the
implementation of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control measures. The
incidence of RSV infection exhibited bimodal peaks in 2022, while hMPV
demonstrated seasonal peaks during the spring, fall, and winter periods
post-COVID-19 pandemic. After the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an
upward trend in the proportion of female patients and patients aged one
year and older presenting with ARTI, RSV infections, and hMPV
infections. Infant (OR = 4.767, 95%CI: [3.888–5.846], p &lt; 0.0001),
presence of co-infection (OR = 0.540, 95%CI: [0.404–0.722], p &lt;
0.0001), and existence of comorbidities (OR = 1.582, 95%CI:
[1.285–1.949], p &lt; 0.0001) was the risk ratio for the severity of RSV
infection. Children infected with hMPV under the age of 1 year (OR =
0.322, 95%CI: [0.180 – 0.575], p &lt; 0.0001), as well as those with
comorbidities (OR = 8.809, 95%CI: [4.493 – 17.272], p &lt; 0.0001), have
a higher risk of developing severe illness.ConclusionThe changing
epidemiological patterns have the potential to lead to widespread severe
outbreaks among children, particularly those with underlying medical
conditions who may experience more severe symptoms. Conducting
surveillance for pneumoviridae viruses in children is an imperative
measure to establish a robust foundation for future epidemic prevention
and treatment strategies.</p>

the power of short-chain fatty acids in ameliorating intestinal mucosal
immunity: a new porcine nutritional approach</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), a subset of organic fatty acids with
carbon chains ranging from one to six atoms in length, encompass
acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These compounds are the endproducts
of dietary fiber fermentation, primarily catalyzed by the glycolysis and
pentose phosphate pathways within the gut microbiota. SCFAs act as
pivotal energy substrates and signaling molecules in the realm of animal
nutrition, exerting a profound influence on the intestinal, immune
system, and intestinal barrier functions. Specifically, they contibute
to 60-70% of the total energy requirements in ruminants and 10-25% in
monogastric animals. SCFAs have demonstrated the capability to
effectively modulate intestinal pH, optimize the absorption of mineral
elements, and impede pathogen invasion. Moreover, they enhance the
expression of proteins associated with intestinal tight junctions and
stimulate mucus production, thereby refining intestinal tissue
morphology and preserving the integrity of the intestinal structure.
Notably, SCFAs also exert anti-inflammatory properties, mitigating
inflammation within the intestinal epithelium and strengthening the
intestinal barrier’s defensive capabilities. The present review
endeavors to synthesize recent findings regarding the role of SCFAs as
crucial signaling intermediaries between the metabolic activities of gut
microbiota and the status of porcine cells. It also provides a
comprehensive overview of the current literature on SCFAs’ impact on
immune responses within the porcine intestinal mucosa.</p>
