## Where is Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite Dev Kit?

date: 2024-07-19, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Where is Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite Dev Kit?</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I signed up to buy a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Dev Kit the second I found out about it. It's <em>supposed to be</em> the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/3-reasons-snapdragon-dev-kit-mac-mini-killer/">Mac mini killer for Windows</a>.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/snapdragon-dev-kit-transparent.jpg" alt="Snapdragon X Elite Dev Kit Transparent"></p>

<p>They even promoted it with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24158603/qualcomm-windows-snapdragon-dev-kit-x-elite">this amazing-looking transparent shell</a>, and I and hundreds of other devs were ready to pony up the $899 Qualcomm was asking.</p>

<p>Their pre-order form said it would be out June 18. Almost exactly one month later, I got an email saying it was available. Great!</p>

<p>So I went to <a href="https://www.arrow.com/en/products/c8380-12c-mp-32g/thundercomm">the purchase page on Arrow</a>... and it showed as out of stock. That was about 15 minutes after receiving the email.</p>

<p>There were three possibilities:</p></div>

Now that <a href="https://slate.com/business/2024/07/elon-musk-donald-trump-donation-republican-twitter-troll-meme-posts.html">Elon Musk</a> is giving so generously, dollars and flow, to the fascists, he's encouraging more of us to use Zuckerberg's twitter-like system, aka Threads. But Zuck isn't making it go down easy. There's a piece in Bloomberg (paywall) that says Trump is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/jul/19/trump-biden-rnc-democrats-election-updates">badass</a> but isn't supporting either candidate. What could possibly go wrong?

## victimology

I’ve been meaning for some time to write a brief post about Freddie deBoer’s case for forcing mentally ill people into treatment — or rather, about one element of the story. And then today I see a new post by Freddie on this review of this book by Jonathan Rosen, and that got the wheels [&#8230;]

Something for writers? Perhaps something that moves WordPress into a space adjacent to twitter-like systems? They just added support for Threads to WordPress, so now you can <a href="https://jetpack.com/social/">crosspost</a> from a blog to a thread. Haven't tried it yet. They also have a new <a href="https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/">identity system</a> built around Gravatar, announced in early June. It'll be interesting to see what they come out with. I wonder if there is a developer ecosystem building on this, and if they have an evangelism program. I have my own vision of how these things should work.

## P&B: Luke Harris

date: 2024-07-19, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 47th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Luke Harris and his blog, <a href="https://www.lkhrs.com">www.lkhrs.com</a></p>
<p><a href="https://kevquirk.com/">Kev Quirk</a> suggested Luke as a potential guest way back in September, when this series was in its infancy. I'm quite sure I stumbled on Luke's site before that, though.  </p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>I’m Luke, I’m 29, and I live in Chicago with my partner and five cats. I grew up in Austin, Texas. I was homeschooled—which was horrific—and haven’t gone to college yet.</p>
<p>I’m in-between jobs at the moment; I’ve been looking for IT and web development work. For the last eleven years I’ve been doing web design on the side in addition to full-time jobs in electrical, HVAC, apartment maintenance, logistics brokering, and healthcare IT. Web design and working in tech was The Dream™ for a long time; with each new non-tech job I kept telling myself it was just a brief interlude before I was “discovered” and hired for a wonderful position doing what I love. But experience and rejection slowly eroded the naivety away. I still love this stuff but with how turbulent things have been in the industry these last few years, I’ve been looking at what else I can do for a career besides drawing rectangles and making logos bigger.</p>
<p>My hobbies include blogging (whoa), playing video games, reading books, listening to music, and coding. Lately I’ve been playing Helldivers 2, Diablo IV, and Rimworld. Learning Go has been an obsession for the last year and I’ve been having fun building a form handler. The code is a complete mess right now but a couple weeks ago I got it to take a form submission and send me an email—which made me so excited that I haven’t touched the project since.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>My first blog was on Blogger in 2010. I frequented a number of forums at the time and I saw other people had their blogs linked in their signature, and I thought it was cool to have a spot all my own for topics that didn’t fit the theme of those forums. Early posts centered around the computer forum I started during that time.</p>
<p>In March 2011 I moved to WordPress and decided the previous posts weren’t worth moving, and their teenage angst is lost to time. Frustrated with WordPress, I moved over to Tumblr for a couple months before pulling a 180 and moving right back to WordPress in June 2011. My posts continued to revolve around running my forums—now multiple—and random computer activities I was up to that day.</p>
<p>In 2013 I switched to Anchor CMS (RIP Charlotte). This is when the first rendition of the cactus logo I use on my site showed up. I <em>loved</em> the Markdown approach to blogging after fighting the WordPress editor, but I wasn’t able to delete comments and I missed the WordPress media gallery. Later that same year I moved to WordPress for the third time. For the next couple of years I wrote about my solutions to problems I encountered and my adventures in Elite: Dangerous.</p>
<p>2016 saw a decline in posts and the beginning of a 4-year hiatus from blogging altogether. I met my partner that same year. Embarrassed by my teenage self and uncertain how to market my web design services, I took down the blog and switched my site to a resume-like Gatsby template. </p>
<p>I started things back up again in 2020 with the fourth return to WordPress, this time embracing the Gutenberg editor and boasting about how not-Jamstack my site was—out of exasperation with Gatsby’s build times. But as usual at this point, my time on WordPress wouldn’t last long and in 2021 I moved to Eleventy, followed by Hugo a few months later.</p>
<p>For the first year after my return to blogging, I mainly wrote about web development and tech. In 2022 I grew tired of this; I love those things but they can be incredibly dry and I wanted to express myself more. I started writing more about life and posted about <a href="https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2022/08/wiper-adventure/">my trip to purchase wiper blades</a>, which became a reader favorite. I went back and forth on whether to separate the tech posts or keep posting through it, and ultimately decided it doesn’t matter. I write about what interests me and let the people following my blog decide for themselves.</p>
<p>My blog also functioned as my portfolio, and I went back and forth on this for years until I removed the portfolio and business parts for good a couple years ago. I felt like trying to attract business on my personal site limited what I could write about, and it was so freeing to finally rip that stuff out. </p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>I consume an unhealthy amount of articles every day and a lot of my inspiration comes from the excellent people who live in my RSS reader. I’ll get an idea in my head and start writing to uncover more meaning behind it—like sculpting but less cool. Sometimes I start with a good title and then the rest flows out as I think through it in real time. Other times I might be journaling my thoughts and a sentence will grow into three paragraphs, a title will appear, and eventually the whole mess finds its way into my blog. I try to publish posts the same day I start them; my drafts folder is where posts go to die.</p>
<p>I research almost every post, which is a problem because I can get way too into the research portion and kill my writing flow. Even the personal posts will have me going through maps and photos to make sure I’ve got the story and names straight. I keep reminding myself that I don’t need to provide proof for absolutely everything.</p>
<p>On days or topics where I feel less confident I ask my partner to proofread. I re-read what I write about 15-20 times and when the frustration reaches a breaking point I switch to Sublime Merge, close my eyes, hit the keys to stage/commit/push, and whisper a prayer to the gods of blogging.</p>
<p>Once a post is published I have a habit of re-reading what I wrote 5–10 <em>more</em> times because the context switch from my editor to the wild web tends to inspire additional changes. I consider this part an unhealthy obsession and I’m working on not doing that and posting carefree to the wind.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>My ideal creative environment is on an airplane mid-flight after they’ve passed out the complimentary snacks and drinks that you can’t taste because you’ve temporarily surfaced above nature’s tender embrace, and in your newfound godhood your thoughts drift to thinking about how we never should have left the trees all those years ago. Many posts have started in the shower, where I’ll strike upon a turn of phrase that I like and then do my darnedest to remember it when I’m dry enough to type it out.</p>
<p>I can’t be airborne or in the shower perpetually, so I gladly settle for my desk in the corner with a nice cup of coffee and one of five cats in my lap. The physical space I’m in absolutely influences my creativity; I struggle to think in loud environments with sounds I can’t tune out.</p>
<p>Noise-cancelling headphones help a lot. I find being unable to hear my keystrokes to be incredibly helpful for staying in the trance-like state of the zone while writing. I put on music that I’ve either heard a bazillion times or with few lyrics. Lately my go-to has been Chicago house inspired.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>My blog is generated with Hugo and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. The domain is registered through Namecheap. My CMS is my operating system and text editor, which can be a frustrating combination at times but it works. I use Hugo’s archetypes feature to start a new post with the front matter populated, and then Hugo opens it in iA Writer. Final edits happen in Sublime Text.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>There’s a lot I’d do with hindsight. For example, I had to switch my domain from a .work to a .com TLD a few years ago because the .work TLD made it onto a few widely-used corporate firewall blocklists years after I registered mine, to the point where I couldn’t access my own website in a coffee shop one day. While preventing potential employers and coworkers from accessing my site could be a useful feature, I’d go with a boring TLD from the start.</p>
<p>I would have separated my consulting from my personal site earlier. And I would have kept my site as my main online presence, instead of dumping words into various social media platforms for five minutes of fame. A lot of those words and images are lost now.</p>
<p>I’d still switch up my tech stack with the season though. Part of me enjoys creating problems for my future self.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Domains renewal: $28 USD/year</li>
<li>Cloudflare Pages: $0</li>
</ul>
<p>Way back near the start I had banner ads, but they produced pennies a year and looked terrible. I <a href="https://ko-fi.com/lkhrs">recently set up a Ko-fi page</a> and added the link to the bottom of my blog posts, and a couple wonderful readers have funded domain renewals for the next couple of years. And I’ve been hired by people who found me via my blog—that counts, right?</p>
<p>I absolutely support monetizing personal blogs. Those recurring costs add up and it’s another avenue for people to send you warm and fuzzy feelings. But it should be tasteful. Am I running around town wearing clothing plastered with ads for the latest VC-funded grift? (No, but please reach out if that’s an option. People don’t need to know it’s me). On the blog it’s different; my literal name and persona is wrapped up in it. When I added banner ads it felt filthy, like I sold my soul to the company with the largest fraction of a penny on AdSense. It would take a large—not small—dump truck load of pennies to make me consider doing that again. The sponsored article people have tried hard, but every time I ask for the load of zinc measured in cubic yards, negotiations fall through.</p>
<p>I encourage a cautious, almost hesitant approach. Monetization should be an afterthought, not the primary goal. </p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>I recommend checking out each of these blogs and interviewing their wonderful owners. A few of them have been interviewed already.</p>

<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>While writing this I came across the album <a href="https://song.link/https://music.apple.com/us/album/ease-the-work/1725718657"><em>Ease the Work</em></a> by the instrumental group Hour. It feels like a nice stroll at sunset with a cool breeze behind you and an endless expanse of tired and dusty landscape in front. It beckons you to explore its gentle swells and sweeping strings while the beat steadily plods along, kicking up little swirls of vague nostalgia. Thoughts you’ve thought before but hadn’t properly put to rest will surface and demand to be explored, to be wholly perceived; thoughts that may have first surfaced decades prior. They nibble at your attention, threatening the tranquil state of your mind, but it is effortless to cast them away. You lose yourself in the fiery sun, yearning to someday follow its passage behind the hazy horizon. Not today though. Today is a great day to write a blog post.</p>

## Hubble Studies a Potential Galactic Merger

date: 2024-07-19, from: NASA breaking news

This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image features the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 5238, located 14.5 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici. Its unexciting, blob-like appearance seems to resemble an oversized star cluster more than a classic image of a galaxy. Its lackluster appearance belies its complicated structure, which is the subject of […]

## CrowdStrike issue is causing massive computer outages worldwide

date: 2024-07-19, from: OS News

Well, this sure is something to wake up to: a massive worldwide outage of computer systems due to a problem with CrowdStrike software. Payment systems, airlines, hospitals, governments, TV stations &#8211; pretty much anything or anyone using computers could be dealing with bluescreens, bootloops, and similar issues today. Open-heart surgeries had to be stopped mid-surgery, planes can&#8217;t take off, people can&#8217;t board trains, shoppers can&#8217;t pay for their groceries, and much, much more, all over the world. The problem is caused by CrowdStrike, a sort-of enterprise AV/monitoring software that uses a Windows NT kernel driver to monitor everything people do on corporate machines and logs it for&#8230; Security purposes, I guess? I&#8217;ve never worked in a corporate setting so I have no experience with software like this. From what I hear, software like this is deeply loathed by workers the world over, as it gets in the way and slows systems down. And, as can happen with a kernel driver, a bug can cause massive worldwide outages which is costing people billions in damages and may even have killed people. There is a workaround, posted by CrowdStrike: This is a solution for individually fixing affected machines, but I&#8217;ve seen responses like &#8220;great, how do I apply this to 70k endpoints?&#8221;, indicating that this may not be a practical solution for many affected customers. Then there&#8217;s the issue that this may require a BitLocker password, which not everyone has on hand either. To add insult to injury, CrowdStrike&#8217;s advisory about the issue is locked behind a login wall. A shitshow all around. Do note that while the focus is on Windows, Linux machines can run CrowdStrike software too, and I&#8217;ve heard from Linux kernel engineers who happen to also administer large numbers of Linux servers that they&#8217;re seeing a huge spike in Linux kernel panics&#8230; Caused by CrowdStrike, which is installed on a lot more Linux servers than you might think. So while Windows is currently the focus of the story, the problems are far more widespread than just Windows. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re going to see some major consequences here, and my &#8211; misplaced, I&#8217;m sure &#8211; hope is that this will make people think twice about one, using these invasive anti-worker monitoring tools, and two, employing kernel drivers for this nonsense.

## 2024-07-19 Trusting a self-signed certificate

date: 2024-07-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-19-trusting-a-self-signed-certificate">2024-07-19 Trusting a self-signed certificate</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@sarahjamielewis" title="@sarahjamielewis@mastodon.social">@sarahjamielewis</a> recently announced an IRC server with a self-signed certificate. What if you have an IRC client that keeps complaining about this?</p>

<p>On a system like Debian, you can download the certificate and install it such that all applications trust it.</p>

<pre><code># Get certificate from the correct port
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect resistant.tech:6697 \
  &lt; /dev/null \
  2&gt; /dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -outform PEM \
  &gt; resistant-tech.pem

# Compare fingerprint with
# 63:B1:2E:A7:8A:BD:8A:33:B5:62:21:7C:42:71:75:66:43:BA:D2:78:21:09:8E:80:17:7E:28:D2:58:65:E6:48
openssl x509 -in resistant-tech.pem -noout -sha256 -fingerprint

# Install on Debian (the new extension is important)
sudo mv --interactive resistant-tech.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/resistant-tech.crt
sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates

# The output above should say &quot;1 added, 0 removed; done&quot; somewhere

# Test it
gnutls-cli resistant.tech:6697
</code></pre>

<p>If the output says &ldquo;PKI verification of server certificate failed&hellip;&rdquo; then the installation didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>If the output says &ldquo;Handshake was completed&rdquo; and seems to hang, that&rsquo;s because you can now type raw IRC commands.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p>(I saw comments by myself on related Stack Exchange questions from 2014. 😑)</p>

## Summer rental

date: 2024-07-18, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>4:05am<br />
The windows are open, hoping to capture the faint winds and convert them into a mythical cooling cross-breeze. A gust passes through vacuuming all the doors shut, cancelling hope for a miracle.<br />
I’m awake. It’s cool but I’m on top of the covers and not cool enough.<br />
The plastic thump-thump-thump of the oscillating fan reaching the end of its arc is rhythmic yet not. After three-to-six attempts, it yields to the resistance and heads the other way. It will be back soon.<br />
Another fan in the room sounds like a far off propeller plane looping around the property. I await its arrival at each approach.<br />
The alleyway ebbs and flows throughout the night with the smell of marijuana smoke, teens cussing, and the clinking of bottles as passers-by rummage through recycling bins.<br />
There’s a sick child in the other room. My child. Been sick for days, poor thing. On antibiotics now. Spit the first dose on the floor because she didn’t like the taste.<br />
I can hear her labored breath as different subconscious systems battle for what they deem as comfortable. Warm, yet shivering. Cold, yet burning up. Asleep, yet aware.<br />
My wife is there next to her. Also sick with a persistent unspecified cough.<br />
Since arriving at the rental three days ago, I have only left the house to buy medicine and wine.</p>
<p>7:23am<br />
Scuttling in the alleyway. Two voices. A truck starts. A woman pleads, “I’m sorry, I fucked up.” The truck drives off.<br />
I put on a pot of coffee.</p>
<p>9:15am<br />
Left the rental to walk and pick up breakfast. Peeked at the ocean to remind myself of the magnitude. I’m a block away but hadn’t seen it in days.<br />
I got a breakfast burrito. The potatoes were a little al dente, but it had black beans and wasn’t a soupy mess so I call that a win.<br />
PCR tests came back and it’s not Covid and it’s not strep, but we don’t have any answer for what sickness(es?) our family is dealing with.<br />
I’m on vacation but it’s not quite vacation anymore.<br />
I’m working a bit. Dysfunctional but I appreciate a place to channel anxiety.<br />
Caretaking is much harder than computer work.</p>
<p>4:46pm<br />
We made it to the beach. Wife and son thought it was too windy for my solar shade —and it was— but I persevered. After naysaying me they had the audacity to want to join me in my solar fortress. Haha. Nice try.<br />
My congested little one made me pretend food with wet sand. She’s allowed to join me in my fortress.<br />
We left as the tide came in and ordered pizza. The pizza was just okay.</p>
<p>9:44pm<br />
A good day. A long day.<br />
Another member of the family is reporting a sore throat, so that’s less than ideal.<br />
“When this vacation is over I’m going to need another vacation,” the protagonist says looking directly through the fourth wall. The canned laughter erupts.<br />
Do wells of rage fill up faster than waters of peace? Am I broken or is the underlying system broken?</p>
<p>5:32am<br />
Awakened by two crows squawking at each other.<br />
I went to bed after midnight. A new day begins.</p>

## NVIDIA transitions fully towards open-source GPU Linux kernel modules

date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News

It&#8217;s a bit of a Linux news day today &#8211; it happens &#8211; but this one is good news we can all be happy about. After earning a bad reputation for mishandling its Linux graphics drivers for years, almost decades, NVIDIA has been turning the ship around these past two years, and today they made a major announcement: from here on out, the open source NVIDIA kernel modules will be the default for all recent NVIDIA cards. We’re now at a point where transitioning fully to the open-source GPU kernel modules is the right move, and we’re making that change in the upcoming R560 driver release. ↫ Rob Armstrong, Kevin Mittman and Fred Oh There are some caveats regarding which generations, exactly, should be using the open source modules for optimal performance. For NVIDIA&#8217;s most cutting edge generations, Grace Hopper and Blackwell, you actually must use the open source modules, since the proprietary ones are not even supported. For GPUs from the Turing, Ampere, Ada Lovelace, or Hopper architectures, NVIDIA recommends the open source modules, but the proprietary ones are compatible as well. Anything older than that is restricted to the proprietary modules, as they&#8217;re not supported by the open source modules. This is a huge milestone, and NVIDIA becoming a better team player in the Linux world is a big deal for those of us with NVIDIA GPUs &#8211; it&#8217;s already paying dividend in vastly improved Wayland support, which up until very recently was a huge problem. Do note, though, that this only covers the kernel module; the userspace parts of the NVIDIA driver are still closed-source, and there&#8217;s no indication that&#8217;s going to change.

## Linux patch to disable Snapdragon X Elite GPU by default

date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News

Not too long ago it seemed like Linux support for the new ARM laptops running the Snapdragon X Pro and Elite processors was going to be pretty good &#8211; Qualcomm seemed to really be stepping up its game, and detailed in a blog post exactly what they were doing to make Linux a first-tier operating system on their new, fancy laptop chips. Now that the devices are in people&#8217;s hand, though, it seems all is not so rosy in this new Qualcomm garden. A recent Linux kernel DeviceTree patch outright disables the GPU on the Snapdragon X Elite, and the issue is, as usual, vendor nonsense, as it needs something called a ZAP shader to be useful. The ZAP shader is needed as by default the GPU will power on in a specialized &#8220;secure&#8221; mode and needs to be zapped out of it. With OEM key signing of the GPU ZAP shader it sounds like the Snapdragon X laptop GPU support will be even messier than typically encountered for laptop graphics. ↫ Michael Larabel This is exactly the kind of nonsense you don&#8217;t want to be dealing with, whether you&#8217;re a user, developer, or OEM, so I hope this gets sorted out sooner rather than later. Qualcomm&#8217;s commitments and blog posts about ensuring Linux is a first-tier platform are meaningless if the company can&#8217;t even get the GPU to work properly. These enablement problems should&#8217;ve been handled well before the devices entered circulation, so this is very disheartening to see. So, for now, hold off on X Elite laptops if you&#8217;re a Linux user.

## Ly: a TUI display manager

date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News

Ly is a lightweight TUI (ncurses-like) display manager for Linux and BSD. ↫ Ly GitHub page That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the description. I&#8217;ve been wanting to take a stab at running a full CLI/TUI environment for a while, see just how far I can get in my computing life (excluding games) running nothing but a few tiled terminal emulators running various TUI apps for email, Mastodon, browsing, and so on. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d be particularly happy with it &#8211; I&#8217;m a GUI user through and through &#8211; but lately I&#8217;ve seen quite a few really capable and just pleasantly usable TUI applications come by, and they&#8217;ve made me wonder. It&#8217;d make a great article too.

## Unified kernel image

date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News

UKIs can run on UEFI systems and simplify the distribution of small kernel images. For example, they simplify network booting with iPXE. UKIs make rootfs and kernels composable, making it possible to derive a rootfs for multiple kernel versions with one file for each pair. A Unified Kernel Image (UKI) is a combination of a UEFI boot stub program, a Linux kernel image, an initramfs, and further resources in a single UEFI PE file (device tree, cpu µcode, splash screen, secure boot sig/key, &#8230;). This file can either be directly invoked by the UEFI firmware or through a boot loader. ↫ Hugues If you&#8217;re still a bit unfamiliar with unified kernel images, this post contains a ton of detailed practical information. Unified kernel images might become a staple for forward-looking Linux distributions, and I know for a fact that my distribution of choice, Fedora, has been working on it for a while now. The goal is to eventually simplify the boot process as a whole, and make better, more optimal use of the advanced capabilities UEFI gives us over the old, limited, 1980s BIOS model. Like I said a few posts ago, I really don&#8217;t want to be using traditional bootloaders anymore. UEFI is explicitly designed to just boot operating systems on its own, and modern PCs just don&#8217;t need bootloaders anymore. They&#8217;re points of failure users shouldn&#8217;t be dealing with anymore in 2024, and I&#8217;m glad to see the Linux world is seriously moving towards negating the need for their existence.

## Should you give up social media?

date: 2024-07-18, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>In a <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/could-you-give-up-social-media">recent post</a>, Kev used the magic words to summon me and make me write something on this site: he talked about social media, mentioned me, and posed a question. Rather than focusing on the could/should/would why don’t we focus on the actual product and figure out what is that we’re getting out of social media? And I’m saying “we” even though I’m not really on any traditional social media platform. But more on that later.</p>
<p>The quality and usefulness of a social platform are a by-product of three factors: my inputs, other people’s inputs, and the platform creator’s intentions. The first two are quite obvious since social media is the product of what people decide to put into it. The third is what really shapes a platform. Not all platforms are created equal and as a result of that the mixture of inputs and outputs can differ widely from one digital place to another. Fame and money are terrible incentives when it comes to digital spaces because people are willing to do pretty much everything to get a following if that can help them earn money. So every time a platform gets big enough you just know things are doomed to turn to shit. That’s an inescapable reality of social platforms. So if you’re looking for a decent social media space you probably want to stay on one that’s designed to either stay small in size or one that’s designed to stay small in scope.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to think that a Mastodon server is a good example of the first type but you’d be wrong. The decentralised social media experiments—Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky—are not designed to stay small. Quite the contrary. They can stay small but you have to fight against the main concept behind those platforms. In the past, I argued that <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/small-communities-are-the-best-communities">small communities are the best type of communities</a> and so one potential solution to this social media conundrum is to find—or create!—a closed-door, small community that wants to stay small on purpose in order to keep it sane.</p>
<p>Another potential solution is to not join a kitchen-sink social platform where (almost) everything goes and instead join one that is specifically designed to cater for a specific audience. <a href="https://literal.club">Literal</a> is a good example. It’s a social platform but the focus is books so everything that’s happening there is related to books and book reading. You won’t find people sharing memes or random links or anything like that but if you care about books you’ll find plenty of those.</p>
<p>Another good example is <a href="https://read.cv/">read.cv</a> and its sibling, <a href="https://posts.cv/">posts.cv</a>. The first one gives out very early Dribbble vibes but with a different overall aesthetic and the second, since it’s tied to the first one, is a Twitter clone where everyone’s a designer posting stuff about design or photography. I have a profile on both so technically I am on social media but my activity on there is non-existent. I update the <a href="https://read.cv/manuelmoreale">read.cv profile</a> periodically since it’s my online CV and I never posted anything on post.cv even though every three or four weeks I scroll through it for 5 minutes to see what people are creating. And it’s an incredibly positive experience. No flame wars, no memes, and nobody is trying to crypto scam anyone. Just a chill place that’s mainly focused on design (and cats).</p>
<p>The main issue with social media is that we want them to be everything. We want them to be a place for casual interactions, for discovery, for news, for serious discourse. And that’s a mistake. Because the moment you put a stupid amount of people in one room and you let them do whatever they want the only reasonable outcome you can expect is chaos. Sure, you might get some positive results out of it but you’ll also likely get someone shitting in a corner and someone trying to fuck the power outlet. Because that’s the world we live in. Now sprinkle some nonsense AI on top of it all and Bob’s your uncle.</p>
<p>So, to circle back to the original question you asked Kev, I don’t think it’s a matter of wanting to give up social media entirely. You should be asking if you’re willing to give up this specific flavour of social media, you should be asking what parts of this type of social media you’re treasuring and then figure out if there are saner ways to get those same things elsewhere.</p>                <hr>

## XCTest in Xcode 16

date: 2024-07-17, from: Michael Tsai

Jesse Squires: The first is waitForNonExistence(withTimeout:), which provides the inverse of the existing waitForExistence(timeout:) API. Finally! This is such a welcome change. Often in UI testing it is more semantic to wait for an element to disappear rather than appear &#8212; for example, waiting for a loading indicator or waiting for a UIContentUnavailableView to disappear.

The Repubs can win by throwing the election into the House. They can probably get it by the courts in enough places, just a couple of swing states, and they win even if they lose by normal vote-counting methods. The whole bit about Biden's age is meant to distract us from the fact it probably doesn't matter how old the Democratic candidate is.

## Lunch break

date: 2024-07-17, from: Rachel Kwon blog

I never had a regular &ldquo;lunch break&rdquo; until recently. Early in my career it was not by choice — in surgery training there&rsquo;s really no such thing as a break, only a stolen minute or two here and there to pee or wolf down whatever food you can scrounge or nap in a chair if it&rsquo;s the middle of the night and you&rsquo;re on call. We did get a $5 meal coupon for the hospital cafeteria which could get you a cup of terrible coffee and a bagel drier than a bag of silica gel in the Sahara desert.

## 2024-07-16 What's the minimal NNCP setup to get started?

date: 2024-07-17, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-16-what-s-the-minimal-nncp-setup-to-get-started">2024-07-16 What&rsquo;s the minimal NNCP setup to get started?</h1>

<p>This page is for you if you are curious about NNCP and you don&rsquo;t know how to get started.
It contains instructions on how to set up your laptop such that it can exchange files with my laptop (melanobombus) via my server (sibirocobombus).</p>

<p>Before testing it, you need to send me an email with some info but we&rsquo;ll get to that.</p>

<p>First, switch to the root user. Everything will be easier that way.</p>

<pre><code>sudo su
</code></pre>

<p>The instructions are going to assume a Debian system.</p>

<p>Begin by installing the <code>nncp</code> package.</p>

<pre><code>apt install nncp
</code></pre>

<p>Generate a new <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file and secure it:</p>

<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>

<p>You need to add my server to your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file, in the <code>neigh</code> section.</p>

<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       CCAIPFSAZWYICBQ5BIURX4UMEJIXVSZFIING7HRUFTDOFV5XISVQ
      exchpub:  NGEIDPDVZ2I6CTRKCBT734VV4W2YFVTV6YFBU5UGB6IHBA3QDJUQ
      signpub:  VXBMWXS74IGAYQCLJY4UPAXXQXPT3K53QI5XCFHOAKL4I2FQNLKQ
      noisepub: MGGBAOHRHEWEC6CGT47GA2DOQXQFZUAKJ66PD734Y5WNWP364UXQ
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;@daily&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p>What does it mean?</p>

<ol>
<li>you know how to contact my server via the <code>.addrs.internet</code> key – you need this, but you can specify <code>campaignwiki.org</code> instead, if your prefer</li>
<li>you connect to my server every now and then via the <code>calls[0].cron</code> entry – this is not necessary if you don&rsquo;t mind using <code>nncp-call</code> every now and then</li>
</ol>

<p>My laptop can only be reached via my server. You need to add it as well.</p>

<p>As far as the <code>melanobombus.incoming</code> key goes, pick a suitable directory that your regular account has access to.</p>

<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       R23WEIHB52TMA4EKGJPKUDBFSYP2HG4HHW2HGJ3RJATCCRLYDUZQ
      exchpub:  EGP2MMLQJQUKWTHI22JTIRMR2UV3BA2ATE3AYLVOFODMTNRGAMEA
      signpub:  YO6SZXVEIU77OQQRKMAUFUT4V3NJER4U7LQE5JI7JORJXKXY5FBA
      noisepub: 6ECO4WXJNDED6WHJ6SM2HGRQMUO75X65ALT2YRKZ3YGGBDXRNV4A
      via:      [&quot;sibirocobombus&quot;]
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/melanobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        rsmtp:  [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;, &quot;-bS&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>What does it mean?</p>

<ol>
<li>you know how to contact my laptop via my server using the <code>.via[0]</code> key – you need this and the name needs to match the name you used for my server</li>
<li>you allow my laptop to save incoming files in a directory via the <code>.incoming</code> key – you only need this if you want to receive files (the directory must exist and the <code>nncp</code> group must be allowed to write to it)</li>
<li>you allow my laptop to send mail to local users via the <code>.exec.rsmtp</code> key – this is not necessary if you don&rsquo;t want to receive mail</li>
</ol>

<p>You would create the incoming directory as follows, as your regular user:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir --parents ~/incoming/melanobombus
sudo chgrp nncp ~/incoming/melanobombus
sudo chmod g+w ~/incoming/melanobombus
</code></pre>

<p>You need to send me your system&rsquo;s public keys from the <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file so that I can set up similar entries on my laptop and my server.</p>

<p>Once I&rsquo;ve added your public keys to my server, we can test it.</p>

<p>My server will not call you, since it doesn&rsquo;t know your Internet address.
It waits for you to call it both when you want to send or when you want to receive something.
You would do this as follows:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the <code>@daily</code> entry in the <code>sibirocobombus.cron[0]</code> entry of your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file will call my server once a day, at midnight.</p>

<p>To send me a README file, you&rsquo;d run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-file README melanobombus:
2024-07-12T18:12:15Z Tx README 486 B/486 B 100% (73 KiB/sec)
2024-07-12T18:12:15Z File README (282 B) is sent to melanobombus:README
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, the file is in the queue.</p>

<p>You need to to call my server using <code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus</code> to actually send the files or you&rsquo;ll have to wait for the cron job. My server will receive the packets encrypted and addressed to my laptop and enqueue them again. The next time my laptop calls my server, it&rsquo;ll get them.</p>

<p>You probably want to let me know about the file via <a href="Contact">another channel</a>. But soon enough we can set up mail via NNCP. 😁</p>

## Safari already contains ad tracking technology, and they’re now adding it to Safari’s Private Browsing mode, too

date: 2024-07-16, from: OS News

We&#8217;ve been talking a lot about sleazy ways in which the online advertising industry is conspiring with browser makers &#8211; who also happen to be in the online advertising industry &#8211; to weaken privacy features so they can still track you and the ads they serve you, but with &#8220;privacy&#8221;. They&#8217;re trying really hard to make it seem as if they&#8217;re doing us a huge favour by making tracking slightly more private, and browser makers are falling over themselves to convince us that allowing some user and ad tracking is the only way to stop the kind of total everything, everywhere, all at once tracking we have now. We&#8217;ve got Google and Chrome pushing something called &#8220;Privacy Sandbox&#8220;, and we&#8217;ve got Mozilla and Facebook pushing something called &#8220;Privacy-Preserving Attribution&#8220;, both of which are designed to give the advertising industry slightly more private tracking in the desperate hope they won&#8217;t still be doing a lot more tracking on the side. Safari users, meanwhile, have been feeling pretty good about all of this in the knowledge Apple cares about privacy, so surely Safari won&#8217;t be doing any of this. You know where this is going, right? Today, the WebKit project published a lengthy blog post detailing all the various additional measures it&#8217;s taking to make its Private Browsing mode more, well, private, and a lot of them are great moves, very welcome, and ensure that private browsing on Safari is a little bit more private than it is on Chrome, as the blog post gleefully points out. However, not long into the blog post, the shoe drops. We also expanded Web AdAttributionKit (formerly Private Click Measurement) as a replacement for tracking parameters in URL to help developers understand the performance of their marketing campaigns even under Private Browsing. ↫ John Wilander, Charlie Wolfe, Matthew Finkel, Wenson Hsieh, and Keith Holleman A little further down, they go into more detail: Web AdAttributionKit (formerly Private Click Measurement) is a way for advertisers, websites, and apps to implement ad attribution and click measurement in a privacy-preserving way. You can read more about it here. Alongside the new suite of enhanced privacy protections in Private Browsing, Safari also brings a version of Web AdAttributionKit to Private Browsing. This allows click measurement and attribution to continue working in a privacy-preserving manner. ↫ John Wilander, Charlie Wolfe, Matthew Finkel, Wenson Hsieh, and Keith Holleman So not only does Safari already include the kind of tracking technology everyone is &#8211; rightfully &#8211; attacking Mozilla over for adding it to Firefox, Apple and the Safari team are actually taking it a step further and making this ad tracking technology available in private browsing mode. The technology is limited a bit more in Private Browsing mode, but its intent is preserved: to track you and the ads you see online. I would hazard a guess that when you enable a browser&#8217;s private browsing or incognito mode, you assume that means zero tracking. We already know that Chrome&#8217;s Incognito mode leaks data like a sieve with bullet holes in it, and now it seems Safari&#8217;s Private Browsing mode, too, is going to allow advertisers to track you and the ads you see &#8211; blog post full of fancy privacy features be damned. Do you know those &#8220;Around the web&#8221; chumboxes? Even if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the term, you&#8217;ve most definitely seen these things all over the web, and really hate them. A major player in the chumbox business is a company called Taboola, a name that&#8217;s quite despised and reviled online. Popular Apple blogger John Gruber called Taboola a &#8220;slumlord&#8221; and the &#8220;lowest common denominator clickbait property&#8220;. Do you want to know which major technology company just signed a massive deal with Taboola? Ad tech giant Taboola has struck a deal with Apple to power native advertising within the Apple News and Apple Stocks apps, Taboola founder and CEO Adam Singolda told Axios. ↫ Sara Fischer at Axios Apple needs to find new markets to keep growing, and clearly, pestering its users with upsells and subscriptions to its services isn&#8217;t enough. The online advertising industry is massive &#8211; just look at Google&#8217;s and Facebook&#8217;s financial disclosures &#8211; and Apple seems to be interested in taking a bigger slice of that fat pie. And as Google and now Mozilla are finding out, a browser that blocks ads and ad tracking kind of gets in the way of that. Anyone who can make and sell plug-and-play Pi-Hole devices even normal people can use is going to make a killing.

Highly recommend this <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81614129">Netflix series</a> -- esp the last three episodes. I found it enlightening, even though I lived through most of this history, I never saw it all put together in a series of events over decades. I came out of it with a much clearer perspective of where we are in the Cold War. It never was over. "The end of history" was too good to be true. Also glad I read so much about slavery a few years ago. If you put both these together, you get the USA, and the deep and lasting wounds we keep re-opening.

## 2024-07-16 The Dark Net

date: 2024-07-16, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-16-the-dark-net">2024-07-16 The Dark Net</h1>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t read The Dark Forest but I read a few blog posts about it.
What really got me interested, however, was <a href="https://www.ystrickler.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet/">The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet</a> by Yancey Strickler in 2019:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the internet, and away from the mainstream. – Yancey Strickler</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I often think of where the world is headed, politically. I&rsquo;m a doomer at heart.</p>

<p>As part of that, I think about the Internet in a few decades. In the worst case, the public Internet is gone. An alternative that is slightly less bad is that governments will have discovered that blocking at the level of the national Domain Name System (DNS) won&rsquo;t work because it&rsquo;s easy to circumvent using alternative name servers. And so, slowly at first but then ever faster, from the top down, people will think that perhaps the Great Firewall is cool: for the children, against porn, against spam, against vandalism, to fight tax evasion, to fight terrorism, you know the deal. And yes, even to fight fascism. So many people are telling me that we should ban Telegram, for example.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m honestly not sure what to recommend. Is the free press our problem? I don&rsquo;t think so. It&rsquo;s the incentives and the power imbalances that are a problem. Rich people pay other people to create companies, to buy companies, to sponsor some programs and to cancel others, and slowly the landscape changes. Big corporations buy small ones. Rich people buy failing ones. The prime example here in Switzerland is how the Weltwoche was bought by billionaires and handed to somebody who supports a flat tax, who supports the ban on minarets, who supports supports tax evasion abroad, who supports anti-refugee policies… all of it legal, of course, but these laws are nauseating. The same pattern can be seen in how the state tries to support media diversity and still the big publishers manage to profit the most. The same pattern can be seen in how the right wing parties fight against state radio and state TV.</p>

<p>So what I recommend is to not go dark. Have friends. Have social media. But be aware that our time might be short. We might have to build the infrastructure while we can. Those of us who can should build for the rest of us who have other things on their mind. We should build this to be as easy to use as possible. We should build this so that we can detach from the public Internet and it will still work.</p>

<p>The sneaker-net will be back. They will call it the dark net but to me, it will forever be friends meeting in a place, with mass storage in our backpacks (at the time) or in our pockets, exchanging stuff. And even if this future is not great at all, we need that alternative. How else will our future selves and our children organize? And even if it turns out to be unnecessary because we keep riding that wild horse of freedom, forever teetering at the brink of fascism, alternative needs to be there to keep the next level of services in line. I still believe that the availability and ubiquity of bit-torrent is what keeps the prices of streaming services down. It&rsquo;s the threat of piracy that keeps the official channels honest. Because we can always go back. The infrastructure is still around. The software is still around.</p>

<p>This is why I&rsquo;m interested in <a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@jgoerzen" title="@jgoerzen@floss.social">@jgoerzen</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://changelog.complete.org/archives/10231-recovering-our-lost-free-will-online-tools-and-techniques-that-are-available-now">Recovering Our Lost Free Will Online: Tools and Techniques That Are Available Now</a>. In my case, the thing I&rsquo;m most interested in is NNCP.</p>

<p>NNCP allows us to connect all services that can be made to work with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_and_forward">store and forward</a> architecture. The simplest and oldest protocols in this respect are mail and file copying, and services built on top of that, such as net news. These services grew big with UUCP, the precursor to NNCP. Store-and-forward precludes the kind of interactive applications many of us are used to. Instead, it&rsquo;s a bit like a library or a book store: you order a book and at some point you get the book. There is a delay. The postal system works the same way: write a letter and send it off, wait for some days, maybe get a reply back. Basically, anything that can be imagined as requesting something and getting back a reply after some time can be implemented using store-and-forward architecture.</p>

<p>If you think of the web as serving static documents, it can be made to work. Imagine reading Wikipedia via email: you send the URL via email to a service, and some time later you get back an email with the response. Soon we would be thinking of extensions to this. What if the response returned an archive of the page requested, all the images it includes, and the same for all the Wikipedia content pages it links to? Fewer visits to the library, so to say! It would be much harder to do the same thing using traditional social media because the web sites are more like web apps. There are a gazillion ways to view things: in a time line (or multiple time lines!), on a profile (so many profiles!), in threads, in search results, and so on. If every click on a button requires a trip that can take many days, it&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t work. Instead, such social media sites must be restructured to work a bit like net news: new posts satisfying some filters are sent in regular updates and your local client rearranges the, filters them, searches them.</p>

<p>All of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking">delay-tolerant networking</a> is possible with Unix to Unix Copy (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP">UUCP</a>). What Node to Node Copy (<a href="http://www.nncpgo.org/">NNCP</a>) adds is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">end-to-end encryption</a> (in a multi-hop setup the packets remain encrypted so the carrier cannot read them) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing">onion routing</a> (in a multi-hop setup the carrier doesn&rsquo;t know where the packet is originally from or where the packet is going to end up). And with that, the sneaker-net is back. You can imagine a low-tech future where most of the last miles are burned, the copper stolen and repurposed, the optical fibre no longer functional, and a service springs up where the post or some other courier is used to send USB sticks and SD cards from community to community in order to exchange letters, reports, movies, pictures, music, and so on. Or if the government is monitoring the airwaves and declaring mesh networks illegal or taking over the mesh networks (like Cuba&rsquo;s Street Network, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Cuba#SNET">SNET</a>), we&rsquo;ll have to rely on USB sticks and SD cards, too.</p>

<p>This is where we&rsquo;re getting back to the Dark Forest. I don&rsquo;t have an answer to that. It&rsquo;s a bit like members-only bit-torrent sites. Do you trust them? Do they trust you? How are you going to learn about the trustworthy ones?</p>

<p>In order to learn more, to be prepared, to think things through, I want to experiment with the technology. I want to see what can be done, run into the issues, pick the low hanging fruits. Play with the technology before we really need it.</p>

<p>I remember audio cassettes being sent back and forth as a kid when we were living in South-West Africa (back before they finally got their freedom and renamed the country to Namibia) and my grandparents were living in Austria. Phone calls were very expensive. So the family sat around a tape recorder, each of us speaking in turn, saying something, and weeks later, all of us gathering again, listening to the replies.</p>

<p>Using images like these virtual, delay-tolerant family gatherings worked long before I knew anything at all about computers.</p>

He's as empty as Trump, and much younger, so we can't hope to outwait him. Now we have a real problem, because Trump has a successor. I imagine Trump's sons probably aren't happy about this. Had he picked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio">Little Marco</a>, no one would mistake him as an heir, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum">Doug Burgum</a> who is a bit too old to be an heir (same age as I am). We <i>do</i> have a problem with Biden, he hasn't prepared for this moment. Old or not, they had 3.5 years to get ready, and they didn't. As I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/15.html#a124845">yesterday</a>, the biggest most important thing is that we <b>organize ourselves.</b> That's the best defense all around. Every attempt to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_(enclosure)">corral</a> the insurrection has been either non-existent or overwhelmingly inadequate. Trump should be out of the picture, and for a while it seemed as if he was getting there, but now he's back, and probably a bigger threat than ever. I don't think replacing Biden is anywhere near enough. We need leadership. Not wait to be led. We've waited too long. People who appear ready to step up -- AOC, Bernie Sanders. Who else? I wouldn't put Obama on that list, he tried to welcome Trump, even let him have his Supreme Court pick, just to be a nice guy. We are not going to prevail by being nice, unfortunately. We're also not going to prevail by each of us taking care of Number One. We have to work together. Organize and work together. Those ought to be our mantras until we achieve them.

<p>Today, on the <strong>tenth anniversary</strong> of <a href="https://marco.org/2014/07/16/overcast">Overcast 1.0</a>, I&#8217;m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Like podcasts better than blog posts? <a href="https://atp.fm/596">Listen to ATP #596</a> for more!</strong></p>

<h3>What&#8217;s new</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Much faster,</strong> more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Modern design,</strong> optimized for easily-reached controls on today&#8217;s phone sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Improvements</strong> throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What&#8217;s not</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Most features.</strong> Overcast is still Overcast!</li>
<li><strong>The audio engine.</strong> It&#8217;s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!)</li>
<li><strong>The business.</strong> I&#8217;m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving <em>only</em> my customers.</li>
<li><strong>My principles.</strong> I always want to make the best podcast app, and I&#8217;ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What&#8217;s gone</h3>

<p><strong>Streaming.</strong> Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.<sup id="fnref:pMYQjMdU5streambugs"><a href="#fn:pMYQjMdU5streambugs" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is <em>much</em> more reliable.</p>

<p>Tapping a non-downloading episode will now open the playback screen, download it, <em>then</em> start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered.</p>

<p>On today&#8217;s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds.</p>

<p>And in the near future, I&#8217;ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don&#8217;t automatically download every episode.</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s next</h3>

<ul>
<li>The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon.</li>
<li>More options for downloading and deleting episodes.</li>
<li>Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.)</li>
</ul>

<p>And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade.</p>

<p>Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list!</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Most of Overcast&#8217;s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why there haven&#8217;t been many new features or changes in years.</p>

<p>You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn&#8217;t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted.</p>

<p>For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I&#8217;ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/Blackbird">Blackbird</a>, and modern Swift concurrency.</p>

<p>Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I&#8217;m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app <em>much</em> better.</p>

<p>Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s to the next one.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>

<li id="fn:pMYQjMdU5streambugs">
<p>Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.&#160;<a href="#fnref:pMYQjMdU5streambugs" rev="footnote">&#8617;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

## 2024-07-15 One Page Dungeon Contest

date: 2024-07-16, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-15-one-page-dungeon-contest">2024-07-15 One Page Dungeon Contest</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to invite you to the 2024 One Page Dungeon Contest. We are accepting submissions starting now and to the end of July. The contest challenge is to create an intriguing and fun dungeon to play&hellip; on only one page. We would love to see you get involved.&rdquo; – <a href="https://spielknights.gumroad.com/p/invitation-to-the-2024-one-page-dungeon-contest">Invitation to the 2024 One Page Dungeon Contest</a> and the <a href="https://www.dungeoncontest.com/">Dungeon Contest</a> homepage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I submitted an entry for the One Page Dungeon Contest.
Since I would like the dungeons to be close to the prep I do for my own games so that I feel like I belong to a community of referees that spends a similar amount of time for their adventures I took some of my (German) prep notes, cleaned them up and added some text boxes using Inskape and decided against spending time on polishing it up.</p>

<p>At the time, my players had a hard time getting past the gate.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-08-22_Hammond_verfolgt_den_Orkzug">2023-08-22 Hammond verfolgt den Orkzug</a> is when a player tracked a group of orcs as they reinforced the existing orc lair</li>
<li><a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-09-20_Das_Endes_des_Balrogs">2023-09-20 Das Endes des Balrogs</a> was the first attempt at taking the lair in which they faced the fire demon and hell hounds</li>
<li><a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-09-26_Der_Kampf_auf_den_Galerien_von_Grosshammer">2023-09-26 Der Kampf auf den Galerien von Grosshammer</a>, this is where they found a back entrance</li>
</ul>

<p>Result:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/pdfs/Orc_Halls_by_Alex_Schroeder_2.pdf">Orc Halls by Alex Schroeder</a></li>
</ul>

<p>At the time I had a second 10-headed hydra, too…</p>

<p>The boss orcs had 3, 5 and 7 hit dice.</p>

<p>And later, when the players had killed all the orcs, a bunch of goblins led by one Eye Poker resettled the halls.</p>

<p>These are the stats I would use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>orcs</strong> HD 1 AC 6 1d6 F1 MV 12 ML 8 XP 100

<ul>
<li><strong>Grishg</strong> HD 3 AC 6 1d6 F3 MV 12 ML 8 XP 300; with <em>gauntlets of max strength</em> granting +3; under the influence of the demon</li>
<li><strong>Shagdog</strong> HD 5 AC 6 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 8 XP 500; lightning bolt 1×/day for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; very loyal to Maufimbul</li>
<li><strong>Ashuak</strong> HD 5 AC 3 1d6 F5 MV 6 ML 9 XP 500; willing to buy freedom and leave</li>
<li><strong>Maufimbul</strong> HD 7 AC 3 1d6 F7 MV 6 ML 9 XP 700; wielding <em>Fur Hunter</em> +1/+3 vs. mammals; traditionalist spear dancer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>boars</strong> HD 3+1 AC 6 1d8 F1 MV 15 ML 9 XP 300</li>
<li><strong>hell hounds</strong> HD 5 AC 4 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; fire 2/6 for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; see invisible (that pack of hell hounds is also the random encounter)</li>
<li><strong>small pyrohydra</strong> HD 5 (40hp, 8hp per head) AC 5 1d10 per head F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; regrowing heads (unless cauterized with fire or ice, up to 7 more heads may grow, one per round, each with 8 hp); fire breath 3×/day: deal as much damage as it has hit-points left, save vs. breath for half; poisonous blood: when cutting off a head in melee, save vs. poison or die; immune to fire and poison</li>
<li><strong>fire demon</strong> HD 9+1 AC 4 1d6/2d6 F20 MV 12 ML 11; flying; aura of fire 1d6 (everybody within 10 ft); when the first attack with the flaming whip hits, the second attack with the flaming sword is at +4; only harmed by magic and magical weapons; immune to fire (the flaming whip and the flaming sword are two magic items that can be taken from the demon)</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly, the pyrohydra is the worst if you fight it without multiple lightning bolts or the like.</p>

<p>As for intelligent monsters, I figured that it would be possible to somehow sneak in and overhear orcs talk about the four bosses. If somebody wanted to, the power dynamic could be exploited. As it turned out, though, my players tried to force the front gate with sleep spells, alerted the guards, which brought on the fire demon and all the hell hounds. The enemies were destroyed but the party had to retreat. Next time, the party found the outlook, sent up a ranger with dark vision and a magic item that could charm humanoids. He killed the four orc guards, climbed down the netting into the cavern, found the way to the shooting gallery, started killing all the orcs and that was the signal the others needed to begin the race down the the long stairs. At the bottom, the orcs had cajoled a ten-headed pyrohydra into the Merchant Hall but it died in the first round after being hit by lightning bolts and other spells.</p>

<p>The treasure map to the Cistern of Sulphur does not contain any new monsters or traps; it&rsquo;s not a new lair or dungeon. It&rsquo;s part of the treasure gained here so all it takes is a one day trip up the mountains to that sulphur cavern. The only risk involved is random encounters.</p>

## I told you so: Mozilla working with Facebook to weaken Firefox’ privacy and anti-tracking features

date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve long been warning about the dangers of relying on just one browser as the bullwark against the onslaught of Chrome, Chrome skins, and Safari. With Firefox&#8217; user numbers rapidly declining, now stuck at a mere 2% or so &#8211; and even less on mobile &#8211; and regulatory pressure possibly ending the Google-Mozilla deal with makes up roughly 80% of Mozilla&#8217;s income, I&#8217;ve been warning that Mozilla will most likely have to start making Firefox worse to gain more temporary revenue. As the situation possibly grows even more dire, Firefox for Linux would be the first on the chopping block. I&#8217;ve received quite a bit of backlash over expressing these worries, but over the course of the last year or so we&#8217;ve been seeing my fears slowly become reality before our very eyes, culminating in Mozilla recently acquiring an online advertising analytics company. Over the last few days, things have become even worse: with the release of Firefox 128, the enshitification of Firefox has now well and truly begun. Less than a month after acquiring the AdTech company Anonym, Mozilla has added special software co-authored by Meta and built for the advertising industry directly to the latest release of Firefox, in an experimental trial you have to opt out of manually. This &#8220;Privacy-Preserving Attribution&#8221; (PPA) API adds another tool to the arsenal of tracking features that advertisers can use, which is thwarted by traditional content blocking extensions. ↫ Jonah Aragon If you have already upgraded to Firefox 128, you have automatically been opted into using this new API, and for now, you can still opt-out by going to Settings > Privacy &#38; Security > Website Advertising Preferences, and remove the checkmark &#8220;Allow websites to perform privacy-preserving ad measurement&#8221;. You were opted in without your consent, without any widespread announcement, and if it wasn&#8217;t for so many Firefox users being on edge about Mozilla&#8217;s recent behaviour, it might not have been snuffed out this quickly. Over on GitHub, there&#8217;s a more in-depth description of this new API, and the first few words are something you never want to hear from an organisation that claims to fight tracking and protect your privacy: &#8220;Mozilla is working with Meta&#8221;. I&#8217;m not surprised by this at all &#8211; like I, perhaps gleefully, pointed out, I&#8217;ve been warning about this eventuality for a long time &#8211; but I&#8217;ve noted that on the wider internet, a lot of people were very much unpleasently surprised, feeling almost betrayed by this, the latest in a series of dubious moves by Mozilla. It&#8217;s not even just the fact they&#8217;re &#8220;working with Meta&#8221;, which is entirely disqualifying in and of itself, but also the fact there&#8217;s zero transparency or accountability about this new API towards Firefox&#8217; users. Sure, we&#8217;re all technologically inclined and follow technology news closely, but the vast majority of people don&#8217;t, and there&#8217;s bound to be countless people who perhaps only recently moved to Firefox from Chrome for privacy reasons, only to be stabbed in the back by Mozilla partnering up with Facebook, of all companies, if they even find out about this at all. It&#8217;s right out of Facebook&#8217;s playbook to secretly experiment on users. This is what I wrote a year ago: I’m genuinely worried about the state of browsers on Linux, and the future of Firefox on Linux in particular. I think it’s highly irresponsible of the various prominent players in the desktop Linux community, from GNOME to KDE, from Ubuntu to Fedora, to seemingly have absolutely zero contingency plans for when Firefox enshittifies or dies, despite everything we know about the current state of the browser market, the state of Mozilla’s finances, and the future prospects of both. Desktop Linux has a Firefox problem, but nobody seems willing to acknowledge it. ↫ Thom Holwerda It seems my warnings are turning into reality one by one, and if, at this point, you&#8217;re still not worried about where you&#8217;re going to go after Firefox starts integrating even more Facebook technologies or Firefox for Linux gets ever more resources pulled away from it until it eventually gets cancelled, you&#8217;re blind.

## The AMD Zen 5 microarchitecture: powering Ryzen AI 300 series for mobile and Ryzen 9000 for desktop

date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News

Built around the new Zen 5 CPU microarchitecture with some fundamental improvements to both graphics and AI performance, the Ryzen AI 300 series, code-named Strix Point, is set to deliver improvements in several areas. The Ryzen AI 300 series looks set to add another footnote in the march towards the AI PC with its mobile SoC featuring a new XDNA 2 NPU, from which AMD promises 50 TOPS of performance. AMD has also upgraded the integrated graphics with the RDNA 3.5, which is designed to replace the last generation of RDNA 3 mobile graphics, for better performance in games than we&#8217;ve seen before. Further to this, during AMD&#8217;s recent Tech Day last week, AMD disclosed some of the technical details regarding Zen 5, which also covers a number of key elements under the hood on both the Ryzen AI 300 and the Ryzen 9000 series. On paper, the Zen 5 architecture looks quite a big step up compared to Zen 4, with the key component driving Zen 5 forward through higher instructions per cycle than its predecessor, which is something AMD has managed to do consistently from Zen to Zen 2, Zen 3, Zen 4, and now Zen 5. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech Not the review and deep analysis quite yet, but a first thorough look at what Zen 5 is going to bring us, straight from AnandTech.

## Fusion OS: writing an OS in Nim

date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News

I decided to document my journey of writing an OS in Nim. Why Nim? It&#8217;s one of the few languages that allow low-level systems programming with deterministic memory management (garbage collector is optional) with destructors and move semantics. It&#8217;s also statically typed, which provides greater type safety. It also supports inline assembly, which is a must for OS development. Other options include C, C++, Rust, and Zig. They&#8217;re great languages, but I chose Nim for its simplicity, elegance, and performance. ↫ Fusion OS documentation website I love it when a hobby operating system project not only uses a less common programming language, but the author also details the entire development process in great detail. It&#8217;s not a UNIX-like, and the goals are a single 64 bit address space, capability-based security model, and a lot more. It&#8217;s targeting UEFI machines, and the code is, of course, open source and available on GitHub.

## 2024-07-02 The importance of moderation

date: 2024-07-15, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-02-the-importance-of-moderation">2024-07-02 The importance of moderation</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a> recently wrote <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/usenet">Usenet had to die</a>, arguing that Usenet was wasteful, everybody carrying a copy of everybody else, including spam and binaries.
I agree with all the points made. The idea that there is one global network of groups, with everybody carrying all the groups and everybody being allowed to post led to the downfall of Usenet.</p>

<p>Having recently hooked my laptop and server server to a handful of other servers using UUCP, NNCP and NNTP for file copies, mail and news, I just want to emphasize that the same technology can be used to build a different net.</p>

<ul>
<li>UUCP doesn&rsquo;t have to be anonymous. Calling systems can be required to have a username and password.</li>
<li>NNTP doesn&rsquo;t have to be anonymous. Systems can be known peers based on IP numbers and users can be required to authenticate themselves.</li>
<li>Servers don&rsquo;t have to mirror all the groups. Systems can be selective in what they accept and in what they pass on.</li>
</ul>

<p>The spam problem arises when two systems &ldquo;trust&rdquo; each other and peer messages but one of the systems doesn&rsquo;t act on abuse and moderation reports.
Perhaps Usenet generated too much of a workload for system administrators so they stopped following up on those reports.
Perhaps some servers had become too big to ban.</p>

<p>I think we have the exact same problems with fedi.
Some instances seem too big to defederate from.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn&rsquo;t work.
If my posts end up on an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me, the post shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the other users that I don&rsquo;t like can comment and those comments are sent back to me.
I can block them all individually or block the large instance including my small number of friends.
That instance has become too big to ban.</p>

<p>To come back to net news:
From my point of view, the protocols are not to blame for the downfall of Usenet.
It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet.
It was the ease of setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made Usenet irrelevant.
In the end, to all these people federation was not as important as moderation.</p>

<p>Administrators were unwilling to drop the groups that were overrun with people that needed moderation.
This is a problem on all platforms with groups, e.g. Reddit.</p>

<p>Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn&rsquo;t moderate their users.
This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.</p>

<p>Administrators were unwilling to create new groups for people in their niches.
At least nobody seems to be making that mistake again.
IRC, Reddit, Discord – they all demonstrated that ad-hoc group formation and self-moderation was viable.</p>

<p>This is why I think moderation, group forming and selectivity of federation are the most important quality of a platform.</p>

<p>We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange, like in the old days.
The problem is unmoderated growth.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Social_Media">#Social Media</a></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>2024-07-04</strong>. I got a long reply by <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a>, reproduced in its entirety below.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">⁂</div>

<p>Ah, that&rsquo;s not a super new post, it&rsquo;s from September 2023. I dug it
out again since we were talking about Illuminant, which seems awesome.
It uses hashtags only as post keywords and instead, if I understand
things correctly, relies on FEP-1b12 to provide group support.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think we have the exact same problems with fedi. Some instances
seem too big to defederate from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not quite the same thing.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a bad thing that I&rsquo;ve being hesitant to defederate from
m.soc even though I get more spam from it over Fedi than I&rsquo;ve been
getting from email fro the past several years.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m still only getting individual posts from m.soc or any other
server. (Which is also why hashtags don&rsquo;t work the way people think.)</p>

<p>On Usenet, the typical behavior would be to carry the whole thing.
Currently, I get dozens of spam messages from m.soc. If I were to
mirror the whole thing (which is possible with AP relays, and is what
would be necessary for hashtags to work like channels, me mirroring
the entirety of all the non-banned servers), I&rsquo;d have to deal with
thousands of messages. My server would croak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn’t work. If my posts end up
on an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me,
the post shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the
other users that I don’t like can comment and those comments are
sent back to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A problem. But again something that was way worse with usenet because
on there, not only would I mirror or moderate abusive replies to me. I
had to mirror abusive replies to <em>everybody</em>.</p>

<p>BTW, I&rsquo;m, for the most part, glad that the servers-that-can-comment
aren&rsquo;t allowlisted, that it works like email, that I can get comments
from anyone. The downside of that is having to ban ban ban like crazy,
but if it didn&rsquo;t work like that I&rsquo;m not sure it even would be
federated.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can block them all individually or block the large instance
including my small number of friends. That instance has become too
big to ban.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A problem. But on Usenet, <em>every</em> instance was too big to ban since
every instance was expected to carry everything.</p>

<p>Individual blocks is one way around it. That&rsquo;s why I, a small instance
op, while I&rsquo;ve banned many small mainly-abuse instances, my need to
ban the big sloppily moderated silos like m.soc or threads is a li&rsquo;l
lower since I don&rsquo;t have hundreds of users to protect, which a midsize
instance would have. I can absolutely see why midsize &ldquo;safe space&rdquo;
instances would ban m.soc for example.</p>

<p>Also I &ldquo;silence&rdquo; every instance since I don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;whole known
network&rdquo; tab.</p>

<p>Killfiles was a user-level way to mute users on newsgroups. So there
was <em>some</em> mitigation, but Fedi additionally has several other
moderation tools like instance bans or silencing.</p>

<p>More fundamentally: ActivityPub is about sending individual posts.
Usenet was about mirroring entire servers. Those two are not the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are
not to blame for the downfall of Usenet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The context that I wrote that Usenet post last September was to rant
about hashtags. (A topic that I&rsquo;m gonna return to every now and then
until the group/tag situation gets a li&rsquo;l better, which might require
new UX affordances or perhaps only education.)</p>

<p>That problem, summarized:</p>

<ul>
<li>Servers can only show you the posts that it has already stumbled
over, through following or commenting</li>
<li>So when you browse a hashtag, you only see a very small subset of
those posts</li>
<li>Which is fine for organizing a handful of persons posts, like &ldquo;I
wanna see all of Marie&rsquo;s <code>#tidying</code> posts&rdquo; or &ldquo;I wanna go back and
take a look at all of my already-followed-friends <code>#mosstodon</code>
posts&rdquo; or even for filtering out stuff. I.e. it&rsquo;s OK as a tool for
<em>subsets</em> and <em>intersection</em></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a disaster for <em>union</em>, for discovery, for &ldquo;emulating channels&rdquo;
which people are used to from Tumblr and Twitter, which worked there
since those are centralized</li>
<li>For hashtags to work the way people expect them to, servers would
have to mirror all posts. Like on Usenet.</li>
<li>There was an effort in that direction early on, with the &ldquo;relay&rdquo;
system.</li>
<li>But small servers would croak. <strong>That&rsquo;s</strong> the problem. It&rsquo;d be an
environmental waste heap.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that&rsquo;s absolutely a protocol level problem!</p>

<p>A protocol level problem that Usenet had even without hashtags. (Well,
there was one hashtag: Kibo.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said a couple of times that servers mirror each other and for the
sticklers in the audience I&rsquo;ve got to add that not literally <em>every</em>
server carried <em>every</em> group. For example, some didn&rsquo;t carry
Anarchists Lunatics Terrorists a.k.a. the <code>alt</code> hierarchy. But that&rsquo;s
the fundamental intended flow. Group mirroring.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Usenet_servers_and_clients.svg" alt="Usenet
architecture" /></p>

<p>So in that way, Usenet is unlike mailing lists, where individual
messages are sent to individual users. FEP-1b12 group servers on Fedi
(like PieFed and MBin) are awesome because they get the best of both
worlds of the &ldquo;only send the relevant posts&rdquo; nature of mailing lists,
and the &ldquo;we&rsquo;re hosting this post anyway so we only need to store it
once in the SQL&rdquo; nature of Usenet. As long as one user on a Lemmy
server is subscribed to <code>@garderning@foo.bar</code>, like an email user
might be subscribed to a mailing list, it might-as-well display a copy
of that group since it&rsquo;s getting those messages anyway. It&rsquo;s not
perfect and we&rsquo;re still paying a hefty &ldquo;decentralization tax&rdquo;, but
it&rsquo;s more robust than mail and news.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet. It was the ease of
setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made
Usenet irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naw, Usenet kept puttering along after that, for a while, until the
cost (and legal danger) of mirroring huge binaries archives which was
the nail of nails. And that was a protocol level issue.</p>

<p>Fedi absolutely has a moderation problem. That is being addressed although it seems to me that there are still unsolved problems.<br>
Usenet had a much bigger moderation problem and much of the reason for
that was on the protocol level. We have instances and instance bans to
help moderate clusters of users where each instance op helps moderate
the users on their instance. Moderation is happening on a user level
which makes much more sense than on a group level. (Someone can be a
saint on <code>alt.suicide.holiday</code> but a jerk on
<code>alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</code> for example.)</p>

<p>But Usenet also has a scalability problem. Resource use. Better
moderation wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly enough to fix that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t
moderate their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms,
e.g. Mail.</p>

<p>Email can&rsquo;t moderate their users since email isn&rsquo;t supposed to be
world-readable. (With exceptions like mailing lists; we can ban
someone who sends abusive messages to those.) But even so, instance
banning is very common on email.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news
exchange, like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last time I talked about this I got the world&rsquo;s most stubborn reply
guy on my neck who (since he was on a huge instance) could use
hashtags to find at least some amount of interesting posts and was
resistant to change. Since I mentioned scalability issues and how my
server would croak if it were to try to mirror even <em>one</em> of the big
instances, he started going on and on about &ldquo;scalability is only for
capitalists&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Yet another case of Smolnet Wishful Thinking Syndrome. The kind of
thinking that hates Eternal September more than anything but keeps
designing protocols that lead to more Eternal Septembers since they&rsquo;re
about everyone-seeing-everyone and then they resort to technical
gatekeeping or even bullying to keep people out. Not into it.</p>

<p>My criticism of Usenet&rsquo;s protocol here has nothing to do with
capitalist scaling, which is about &ldquo;throwing computers at it&rdquo;. Sure,
that&rsquo;d be one solution to the protocol problems inherent to Usenet and
relay-laden-ActivityPub.</p>

<p>Real Smolnet scaling is about designing protocols that are about
connecting people to people (and to topic groups or other
communities), and in a non-wasteful, mottainai way create small
overlapping villages instead of one big shout-loud-and-go-viral
channel.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of protocols. Those where everyone must see
everything (like Antenna and CAPCOM, and Twitter), and those where
that&rsquo;s not the case (like ActivityPub and email).</p>

<p>Here are three network layouts:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://ellen.idiomdrottning.org/baran_networks.png" alt="Baran networks" /></p>

<p>First we have a centralized network. One hub server and then every
client is a spoke connected to that center core. The most efficient
way to organize an &ldquo;everyone-must-see-everything&rdquo; protocol, but
vulnerable to disasters like meteor strikes, nuclear explosions,
billionaire takeovers, or earthquakes.</p>

<p>Then we have a decentralized network. Several hubs connected to each
other, mirroring each other. Usenet worked like that. The hubs need to
be just as beefy as the ones in a centralized network. This has some
advantages like redundancy and robustnesss, and it&rsquo;s more politically
appealing to the anarchists that built the internet. (Not sure why
since there&rsquo;s still two tiers and a mod group that rules everything
for everyone.) It can be wasteful. It can handle
everyone-must-see-everything protocols. It can also really shine when
everyone <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> need to see everything, like IRC which is super
efficient. IRC is a brilliant protocol design that, like a mailing
list, only sends the messages to a server that that server needs.</p>

<p>Finally we have a distributed network. No hubs. It looks more like a
mesh where every machine is connected to only a handful of &ldquo;nearby&rdquo;
machines. This type of network is an absolute disaster for the
everyone-must-see-everything scenario! Redundant to the point of
wastefulness. That&rsquo;s a future we must fight tooth and nail! And that&rsquo;s
exactly where the relay-centered version of ActivityPub was headed,
and that&rsquo;s what would be &ldquo;needed&rdquo; for hashtags-as-groups-and-discovery
to &ldquo;work&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where we the grassroots federalized ancom degrowth community
need to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves because even though
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/energy-is-undercosted" title="Energy is undercosted">energy and e-waste is underpriced</a>, a capitalist for-profit silo
company would never in a million years set up a system like this
because it&rsquo;s too wasteful ever for them, while we&rsquo;re liable to do so
since each instance op only sees their <em>own</em> costs, not the cost for
the network as a whole. The megacorps are OK with centralization
because for them, the power consolidation in the first two network
types is a positive, while for us it&rsquo;s a huge negative so we&rsquo;re drawn
to the third type, so we need to be really careful and really
responsible here.</p>

<p>But as bad as this layout is for everyone-must-see-everything, it&rsquo;s
really awesome for protocols where everyone <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> need to see
everything. It&rsquo;s economical, robust, cozy. ActivityPub (without the
relentless mirroring) is a good fit here. I can follow a handful of
users and be connected to their instances and only their posts are
sent to my instance, I don&rsquo;t mirror the entire server. It&rsquo;s actually
pretty awesome! It&rsquo;s good for moderation too because I only need to
moderate my &ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo;. Yeah, a &ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo; is the perfect
analogy for this; neighborhoods that can and overlap but are still
small and managed. A system set up like that can remain smol and cozy
even as it invites everyone on Earth. It&rsquo;s great. ActivityPub is
awesome.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>2024-07-08</strong>. I got a reply from <a href="https://koldfront.dk/">Adam Sjøgren</a> regarding Sandra&rsquo;s comment on hashtag use in <a href="https://illuminant.asjo.org/">Illuminant</a>.</p>

<div style="text-align:center">⁂</div>

<p>ActivityPub hashtags are translated to Keywords: and vice versa in
Illuminant. So far I haven&rsquo;t had the need to use hashtags/keywords for
more than showing/writing them in Keywords: - I did have a plan to
have groups like fediverse.keyword.music, fediverse.keyword.askfedi
etc. etc. but I haven&rsquo;t implemented it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say that I do not know what FEP-1b12 is, so I don&rsquo;t think
Illuminant implements any of the group support defined in that.</p>

<p>Since Illuminant is very much driven by what I personally want and
feel like implementing/have the energy to implement, it has a kind of
skewed subset of what I guess is expected from a fediverse server/user
interface by most&hellip;</p>

<p>While it is fun for me to hear somebody call Illuminant awesome, I
must say that I&rsquo;m pretty sure there is only one person in the universe
who actually runs it. Being proven wrong would be awesome, though.</p>

## Google can totally explain why Chromium browsers quietly tell only its websites about your CPU, GPU usage

date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News

It&#8217;s time for Google being Google, this time by using an undocumented APIs to track resource usage when using Chrome. When visiting a *.google.com domain, the Google site can use the API to query the real-time CPU, GPU, and memory usage of your browser, as well as info about the processor you&#8217;re using, so that whatever service is being provided – such as video-conferencing with Google Meet – could, for instance, be optimized and tweaked so that it doesn&#8217;t overly tax your computer. The functionality is implemented as an API provided by an extension baked into Chromium – the browser brains primarily developed by Google and used in Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and others. ↫ Brandon Vigliarolo at The Register The original goal of the API was to give Google&#8217;s various video chat services &#8211; I&#8217;ve lost count &#8211; the ability to optimise themselves based on the available system resources. Crucially, though, this API is only available to Google&#8217;s domains, and other, competing services cannot make use of it. This is in clear violation of the European Union&#8217;s Digital Markets Act, and with Chrome being by far the most popular browser in the world, and thus a clear gatekeeper, the European Commission really should have something to say about this. For its part, Google told The Register it claims to comply with the DMA, so we might see a change to this API soon. Aside from optimising video chat performance, the API, which is baked into a non-removable extension, also tracks performance issues and crashes and reports these back to Google. This second use, too, is at its core not a bad thing &#8211; especially if users are given the option to opt out of such crash analytics. Still, it seems odd to use an undocumented API for something like this, but I&#8217;m not a developer so what do I know. Mind you, other Chromium-based browsers also report this data back to Google, which is wild when you think about it. Normally I would suggest people switch to Firefox, but I&#8217;ve got some choice words for Firefox and Mozilla, too, later today.

## Pretty pictures, bootable floppy disks, and the first Canon Cat demo?

date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News

About a month ago, Cameron Kaiser first introduced us to the Canon Cat, a computer designed by Jeff Raskin, but abandoned within six months by Canon, who had no idea what to do with it. In his second article on the Cat, Kaiser dives much deeper into the software and operating system of the Cat, even going so far as to become the first person to write software for it. One of the most surprising aspects of the Cat is that it&#8217;s collaborative; other users can call into your Cat using a landline and edit the same document you&#8217;re working on remotely. Selecting text has other functions too. When I say everything goes in the workspace, I do mean everything. The Cat is designed to be collabourative: you can hook up your Cat to a phone line, or at least you could when landlines were more ubiquitous, and someone could call in and literally type into your document remotely. If you dialed up a service, you would type into the document and mark and send text to the remote system, and the remote system&#8217;s response would also become part of your document. (That goes for the RS-232 port as well, by the way. In fact, we&#8217;ll deliberately exploit this capability for the projects in this article.) ↫ Cameron Kaiser You can also do calculations right into the text, going so far as allowing the user to define variables and reuse those variables throughout the text to perform various equations and other mathematic operations. If you go back and change the value of a variable, all other equations using those variables are updated as well. That&#8217;s quite nifty, especially considering the age of the Cat, and since the Cat is fixed width, you can effectively create spreadsheets this way, too. There&#8217;s really far too much to cover here, and I strongly suggest you head on over and read the entire thing.

## Microsoft quietly updates official lightweight Windows 11 Validation OS ISOs for 24H2

date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News

Microsoft has again quietly updated its Validation OS ISOs. In case you are not familiar with it, Validation OS is an official lightweight variant of Windows and it is designed for hardware vendors to test, validate and repair hardware defects. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin I had no idea this variant of Windows existed, but it kind of makes sense when you think about it. OEMs or other companies making devices that run or work with Windows may need to test, reboot, test, reboot, and so on, endlessly, and having a lightweight and fast version of Windows that doesn&#8217;t load any junk you don&#8217;t need &#8211; or just loads straight into your company&#8217;s hardware testing application &#8211; is incredibly valuable. According to Microsoft, the Windows Validation OS boots to a command line that allows you to run Win32 applications. This has made me wonder if I can use it for the one thing I am forced to use Windows for: playing League of Legends (I cobbled together a spare parts machine solely for this purpose). My guess is that either the Validation OS will lack certain components or frameworks League of Legends requires, or is so different from regular Windows that it will trip Riot Games&#8217; rootkit, or both. Still, I&#8217;m curious. I might load this up on a spare hard drive and what&#8217;s possible.

## GitHub is starting to feel like legacy software

date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News

The corporate branding, the new “AI-powered developer platform” slogan, makes it clear that what I think of as “GitHub”—the traditional website, what are to me the core features—simply isn’t Microsoft’s priority at this point in time. I know many talented people at GitHub who care, but the company’s priorities just don’t seem to value what I value about the service. This isn’t an anti-AI statement so much as a recognition that the tool I still need to use every day is past its prime. Copilot isn’t navigating the website for me, replacing my need to the website as it exists today. I’ve had tools hit this phase of decline and turn it around, but I’m not optimistic. It’s still plenty usable now, and probably will be for some years to come, but I’ll want to know what other options I have now rather than when things get worse than this. ↫ Misty De Meo Apparently, GitHub is in the middle of a long, drawn-out process where it&#8217;s rewriting its frontend using React. De Meo was trying to use a particular feature of GitHub &#8211; the blame view, which also works through the command line but is apparently much harder to parse there &#8211; and realised the browser search feature just couldn&#8217;t find the line of code they absolutely knew for sure was there. After scrolling for a while, the browser search feature suddenly found the line of code. I’d heard rumblings that GitHub’s in the middle of shipping a frontend rewrite in React, and I realized this must be it. The problem wasn’t that the line I wanted wasn’t on the page—it’s that the whole document wasn’t being rendered at once, so my browser’s builtin search bar just couldn’t find it. On a hunch, I tried disabling JavaScript entirely in the browser, and suddenly it started working again. GitHub is able to send a fully server-side rendered version of the page, which actually works like it should, but doesn’t do so unless JavaScript is completely unavailable. ↫ Misty De Meo Seem like a classic case of people being told to develop something in too little time, with the wrong tools, while management is breathing down their necks and pulling engineers away to work on buzzwords like &#8220;AI&#8221;.

## One hundred

date: 2024-07-14, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>It’s the number of people who have taken a few minutes out of their busy lives to write something on my <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook">guestbook</a>. One hundred doesn’t seem a lot in the grand scheme of things, especially on the web. If you have one hundred followers you might as well have zero. One hundred views on a YouTube video? That’s nothing. You need at least one hundred thousand to be part of the conversation. And yet, I find one hundred signatures in a guestbook to be a lot. Can you imagine having one hundred people in front of you, all saying something to you, one after the other? It would feel overwhelming. The internet has messed up many things, including the sense of scale. But this more humane scale is why I love the personal web. You can still recognise the names of the people who interact with you, you can still remember details about them. I’m grateful for every single one of those one hundred signatures. If yours is one of them, thank you.</p>                <hr>

## 2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux

date: 2024-07-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-14-yvonand-tour-du-vallon-des-vaux">2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux</h1>

<p>On the last day, we decided to go for a walk nearby instead of getting on the train immediately.
We took the train to Yvonand and turned towards the hills, spending most of our time in the forest.
This is <a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/route-129">route 129</a>.</p>

<p>When leaving the fields around Yvonand and entering the woods, the autobahn arches high above.
If only it were a fantastic train and not a triumph for car culture.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This small rivulet must have cut the canyon.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This bridge marks the beginning of the way up, if I remember.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you leave the forest, you&rsquo;re on the plateau above.
We ate lunch at the Hotel de Ville in Chavannes-le-Chêne.</p>

<p>Gewöhnliche Wegwarte<br>
Cichorium intybus</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s a weird one from the night before: Apparently the square in front of the castle is bathed in blue light at night, as if a train station bathroom trying to keep drug addicts away.</p>

<p>Somewhat creepy.</p>

## Morning coffee notes

date: 2024-07-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>BTW, I'm intermittently locked out of my <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa">Threads</a> account. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png">They say</a> it has to do with automated stuff they don't explain. I don't have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network, it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don't see me over there, this is why.</p>
<p>How I found out about Trump's assassination. By accident, I was watching CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to season 6 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty">Line of Duty</a>, which isn't very great. I couldn't focus on the show. I got my iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting that <i>he</i> hadn't been killed, and somehow I knew that "he" was Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his fist, looking right into the camera. He's 100 percent television actor. Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn't cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed killing him. He's thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies about being a victim, really is a victim, and we'll never hear the end of it. And it didn't take long before a random Republican asshole was saying this was Biden's fault for saying Trump would end democracy, which he has said he will, promised to do, and <i>we saw him try to do it</i> on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides. It didn't take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate. This was Biden's fault they all agree. Occam's Razor says this is over. We aren't going to vote in November. The deal is done because the journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I've yet to hear another explanation from them.</p>
<p>If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph, they'd nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That's how our journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the dictator. This is what it's like after that happened. People inside big companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize. Now their malaise becomes ours. </p>
<p>BTW, if Biden steps aside don't expect the Repubs won't sue saying it's illegal, so guess what -- not only don't you get Biden, you don't even get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the arguments already written.</p>
