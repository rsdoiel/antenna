Easthope opened issue #141: SystemTools module. at Felix Oliver
Friedrich / Oberon A2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, updated: 2024-06-16, from: Oberon A2 at CAS</p>
<p dir="auto">
Hi,<br/> The Oberon subsystem opens in revision.10272 but the
&lt;delete&gt; key doesn't delete, &lt;F1&gt; doesn't set the star and
&lt;F2&gt; doesn't clear marks. HotKeys has preempted the familiar
Oberon key functionalities?
</p>
<p dir="auto">
I found a note that &lt;F12&gt; should disable or toggle HotKeys. In
10272 &lt;F12&gt; gives a report in the log that a SystemTools command
doesn't exist.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
SystemTools was omitted inadvertently?
</p>
<p dir="auto">
Thanks, … Peter E.

<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The other day I was emailing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://starbreaker.org/&quot;&gt;Matthew “Starbreaker” Graybosch&lt;/a&gt; about his recent post titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/robots-txt-nuclear-option/index.html&quot;&gt;“robots.txt: the Nuclear Option”&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a regular reader of this site you know I love this kind of stuff and I especially love nuclear options when it comes to fighting silly tech.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I experimented with blocking everything in the past but this recent
exchange made me want to revisit this idea. With perfect timing, Robb
Knight posted
<a href="https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/">“Perplexity
AI Is Lying about Their User Agent”</a> and that was all the extra
motivation I needed to join the fun.
</p>
<p>
I already had a 403 in place for Mastodon because I don’t want to get a
shit ton of traffic coming my way every time someone posts a link of
mine but I loved Matthew’s idea of returning a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/402">402</a>.
</p>
<p>
So I grabbed 180 or so entries from the
<a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents">Dark Visitors’s agents
list</a> and set up an NGINX redirect based on those UA. Gonna be
interesting to see if this has any effect on the server so I’ll write a
follow-up.
</p>
<p>
I tried to leave out all the RSS fetchers because I love RSS, RSS is
great and if you’re using RSS in 2024 you’re an awesome person BUT I
might have inadvertently broken some RSS feed out there with this move.
If you notice something not working properly let me know and I’ll fix
it.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;hr&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You&#39;re awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

<h1 id="2024-06-15-old-tech-uucp">
2024-06-15 Old tech: UUCP
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@lkh" title="@lkh@social.sdfeu.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="lkh">@lkh</span></a>,
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a> and I have
been trying to connect our servers using old tech for quite a while.
</p>
<h2 id="uucp">
UUCP
</h2>
<p>
The latest effort has been in connecting them using <em>Unix to Unix
copy</em> (UUCP). The benefit is that once you have that, you can also
have <em>remote command execution over UUCP</em> using <code>uux</code>
and it is as terrifying as it sounds.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see whether I can reconstruct my setup.
</p>
<p>
I use Debian.
</p>
<p>
lkh has a “travelling laptop” that is mostly offline, but sometimes it’s
online. That’s when he wants to exchange stuff with us. The laptop is
called Dwalin.
</p>
<p>
My server is Campaign Wiki.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for peering between news servers via UUCP is available
via <code>man 8 send-uucp</code>.
</p>
<h3 id="var-spool-uucp-ssh-authorized-keys">
/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys
</h3>
<p>
This allows Dwalin to connect via ssh.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins public key, ssh executes the remote
# uucico and hands over my login:
restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Udwalin -l&quot; ssh-rsa another-long-string-of-stuff uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-passwd">
/etc/uucp/passwd
</h3>
<p>
This is where Dwalin’s password is stored. This is important because
there’s no actual Dwalin user on my system.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins login on campaignwiki
Udwalin some-long-string-of-stuff
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-sys">
/etc/sys
</h3>
<p>
I kept the defaults and added Dwalin.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins system entry, no Port or
# credentials are given, since dwalin
# is expected to always call in.
system dwalin
called-login Udwalin
local-send /
local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
time any
forward ANY
protocol i
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-config">
/etc/uucp/config
</h3>
<p>
This is where I set my own node name.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me some spool related entries. I’m not sure whether I needed
them.
</p>
<pre><code>nodename campaignwiki

spool     /var/spool/uucp
pubdir    /var/spool/uucppublic
lockdir   /var/spool/uucp/Lock
logfile   /var/spool/uucp/Log     # The UUCP log file
statfile  /var/spool/uucp/Stats   # The UUCP statistics file
debugfile /var/spool/uucp/Debug   # The UUCP debugging file
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
In our case, lkh’s Dwalin is connected to kyonshi’s Erebor system and
here’s me sending a file to Erebor via Dwalin (since I’m not connected
to Erebor directly):
</p>
<pre><code>uucp some-local-file 'dwalin!ereborbbs.duckdns.org!~/'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="news">
News
</h2>
<p>
Yes, we want to exchange news. That means we need to install INN.
</p>
<p>
Look at the requisites:
</p>
<pre><code>perldoc /usr/lib/news/bin/send-uucp.pl
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-send-uucp-cf">
/etc/news/send-uucp.cf
</h3>
<p>
This define the sites to send news to, how to compress them and how big
the batches should be.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin      gzip        1048576
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-newsfeeds">
/etc/news/newsfeeds
</h3>
<p>
Determine the newsgroups to send to Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code># newsfeed entry for dwalin
dwalin\
    :casa.*,campaignwiki.*,erebor.*\
    :Tf,Wnb,B4096/1024:
</code></pre>
<h3 id="var-lib-news-active">
/var/lib/news/active
</h3>
<p>
Add the new newsgroups. We don’t do control messages.
</p>
<p>
Use the <code>ctlinnd</code> to control the INN daemon.
</p>
<pre><code>ctlinnd newgroup erebor.talk y
ctlinnd newgroup erebor.test y
</code></pre>
<h3 id="var-lib-news-newsgroups">
/var/lib/news/newsgroups
</h3>
<p>
Give the new newsgroups a tag line.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>erebor.talk             General talk for EreborBBS
erebor.test             Testing connectivity with EreborBBS
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-readers-conf">
/etc/news/readers.conf
</h3>
<p>
Make sure the users connecting via NNTP can read the new groups, too.
This is not necessary if you read news via the local spool, I think.
</p>
<p>
Add <code>erebor.*</code> to the “readonly” section.
</p>
<pre><code>auth &quot;foreignokay&quot; {
    auth: &quot;ckpasswd -f /var/lib/news/newsusers&quot;
    default: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
}

access &quot;authenticatedpeople&quot; {
    users: &quot;*&quot;
    newsgroups: &quot;*,!junk,!control,!control.*&quot;
}

access &quot;readonly&quot; {
    users: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
    read: &quot;local.*,campaignwiki.*,casa.*,cosmic.*,erebor.*,rec.*,de.*,alt.*&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it-1">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
Check <code>uulog</code>. Here’s where a news article is put into the
queue and a few minutes later, Dwalin calls and the enqueued article is
sent:
</p>
<pre><code>uux dwalin news (2024-06-15 10:22:01.34 3832004) Queuing rnews (D.000R)

</code></pre>
<h2 id="e-mail">
E-Mail
</h2>
<p>
Oh yes, we do.
</p>
<p>
Debian comes with Exim. Exim uses Perl’s “taint” mechanism wherein
user-supplied values cannot be used for commands. They must be untainted
by a lookup. For example, a user supplied sender name like “alex” is
tainted, but if you look it up in <code>/etc/passwd</code> it becomes
untainted. Perl keeps track of this for you, if you want to. Once you
run into the error, however, you need to figure out where you could be
looking up the values you have. Is the local part a user on the system,
is the domain a local domain? I spent way too much time on this.
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-update-exim4-conf-conf">
/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
</h3>
<p>
This is the file generated by <code>update-exim4.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
The result of me answering the questions:
</p>
<pre><code>dc_eximconfig_configtype='internet'
dc_other_hostnames='alexschroeder.ch;campaignwiki.org;communitywiki.org;transjovian.org'
dc_local_interfaces='127.0.0.1 ; ::1'
dc_readhost=''
dc_relay_domains=''
dc_minimaldns='false'
dc_relay_nets=''
dc_smarthost=''
CFILEMODE='644'
dc_use_split_config='true'
dc_hide_mailname=''
dc_mailname_in_oh='true'
dc_localdelivery='mail_spool'
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that the MX records for my domains point to Migadu because that’s
where SMTP mail should go.
</p>
<p>
UUCP is what lkh, kyonshi and I use.
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-110-exim4-config-uucp">
/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/110_exim4-config_uucp
</h3>
<p>
A new router for UUCP mail that has to come before
<code>200_exim4-config_primary</code>. If it comes after the primary,
then it won’t work because the primary router ends with
<code>no_more</code> and as the comment at the end of the file says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <code>no_more</code> above means that all later routers are for
domains in the local_domains list
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This router only accepts mail destined for domains listed in the new
file <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>### uucp      
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

uucp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: uucp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver=accept
    require_files = +/usr/bin/uux
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/uucp
    transport = rsmtp
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-exim4-uucp">
/etc/exim4/uucp
</h3>
<p>
This is a file that translates the domain names I use for recipients to
UUCP names.
</p>
<p>
It only works for Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin   dwalin
</code></pre>
<p>
This means that a mail for <code>lkh@dwalin</code> gets recognised as
such (because of the first column) and it will be sent to the UUCP
system <code>dwalin</code> (because of the second column).
</p>
<p>
The UUCP system <code>dwalin</code> is correct because
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> has a section for <code>system dwalin</code>
(see above).
</p>
<h3 id="etc-exim-conf-d-transport-40-exim4-config-uucp">
/etc/exim/conf.d/transport/40_exim4-config_uucp
</h3>
<p>
The route above says that the transport to use is <code>rsmtp</code>.
</p>
<p>
Define this using a new transport config file:
</p>
<pre><code>### uucp
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

rsmtp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: rsmtp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver=pipe
    command = /usr/bin/uux - -r -a${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}} -gC $domain_data!rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 100
</code></pre>
<p>
This was the biggest problem for me. The examples I saw for the
<code>-a</code> argument to <code>uux</code> used
<code>$sender_address</code>, resulting in an error about the third
argument to <code>uux</code> being tainted. You can see these error
messages in the exim main log (followed by a log entry showing that exim
sends me a en error message):
</p>
<pre><code>2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBd-26 &lt;= alex@alexschroeder.ch U=alex P=local S=461

2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBh-2Q Completed
</code></pre>
<p>
I guess the examples I had seen would only work for older Exim versions
that didn’t do taint checking.
</p>
<p>
The code I’m using means that I’m looking up the sender local part
(“alex” or “root”) in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and if a match is found,
the untainted key is returned (instead of the value from the password
list).
</p>
<p>
You can test these expressions on the command-line:
</p>
<pre><code>exim -d+all -be '${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}'
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it-2">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
As an ordinary user, use <code>mail</code> on the command line to send
mail to <code>lkh@dwalin</code>.
</p>
<p>
Poor <code>lkh</code>. So many test mails.
</p>
<p>
As <code>root</code>, check the exim log:
</p>
<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus:~# tail /var/log/exim4/mainlog
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s a mail being enqueued successfully:
</p>
<pre><code>2024-06-15 14:08:42 1sISD4-00GIbQ-1a &lt;= alex@alexschroeder.ch U=alex P=local S=513

<p>
Note the <code>uucp_router</code> and the <code>rsmtp</code> transport
being used.
</p>
<p>
Check <code>uulog</code>. Here’s where four mails are put into the queue
and a few minutes later, Dwalin calls the enqueued messages are sent:

<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way, way, way back in 2009, we reported on a small hobby operating
system called StreamOS – version 0.21-RC1 had just been released that
day. StreamOS was a 32-bit operating system written in Object Pascal
using the Free Pascal Compiler, running on top of FreeDOS. It turns out
that its creator, Oleksandr Natalenko (yes, the same person), recovered
the old code, and republished it on Codeberg for posterity. It’s not a
complete history, rather a couple of larger breadcrumbs stuck together
with git. I didn’t do source code management much back in the days, and
there are still some intermediate dev bits scattered across my backup
drive that I cannot even date properly, but three branches I pushed
(along with binaries, btw; feel free to fire up that qemu of yours and
see how it crashes!) should contain major parts of what was done. ↫
Oleksandr Natalenko It may not carry the same import as Doom for the
SNES, but it’s still great to see such continuity 15 years apart. I hope
Natalenko manages to recover the remaining bits and bobs too, because
you may never know – someone might be interested in picking up this 15
year old baton.</p>

for SNES full source code released by former Sculptured Software

<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>The complete source code for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System
(SNES) version of Doom has been released on archive.org. Although some
of the code was partially released a few years ago, this is the first
time the full source code has been made publicly available. ↫ Shaun
James at GBAtemp The code was very close to being lost forever, down to
a corrupted disk that had to be fixed. It’s crazy how much valuable,
historically relevant code we’re just letting rot away for no
reason.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-mac-enclaves-and-exclaves">A brief history of
Mac enclaves and exclaves</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Howard Oakley has written an interesting history of secure enclaves
on the Mac, and when he touches upon “exclaves”, a new concept that
doesn’t have a proper term yet, he mentions something interesting. While
an enclave is a territory entirely surrounded by the territory of
another state, an exclave is an isolated fragment of a state that exists
separately from the main part of that state. Although exclave isn’t a
term normally used in computing, macOS 14.4 introduced three kernel
extensions concerned with exclaves. They seem to have appeared first in
iOS 17, where they’re thought to code domains isolated from the kernel
that protect key functions in macOS even when the kernel becomes
compromised. This in turn suggests that Apple is in the process of
refactoring the kernel into a central micro-kernel with protected
exclaves. This has yet to be examined in Sequoia. ↫ Howard Oakley I’m
not going to add too much here since I’m not well-versed enough in the
world of macOS to add anything meaningful, but I do think it’s an
interesting theory worth looking into by people who posses far more
knowledge about this topic than I do.</p>

<h2 id="imagine-rss-as-a-cover-story">Imagine RSS as a cover story</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> has never been
on the cover of a magazine, so you can’t say ChatGPT is stealing this
from anyone. In fact I’m offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press
has chosen to focus on the bullshit idea that it’s plagiarizing
journalists. Such narcissists. Everything is about them. It’s sick
because the ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If
they’re doing their jobs, they’re reporting facts that exist whether or
not they wrote a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a
local paper that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series">NLCS</a>.
I don’t owe a news org anything because I read the news on their site.
The news doesn’t belong to them.
</p>
<p>
The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn’t so
far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no
billionaires involved, so they didn’t consider it newsworthy I guess.
Someday we’re going to have to accept that we have to make our own news,
in the sense of Scoop Nisker’s famous line – “If you don’t like the news
go out and make some of your own.” So here we go. I asked ChatGPT to
imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story.

PS: Does the concept of a cover story even exist now that we rarely read
printed magazines?

written a crawler for the network of blogrolls via

and/or RSS feeds. When I started the project, I had no idea what I’d
find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don’t know the extent
of it, but there’s a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I’m
thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the
blogrolls, and see what we get from that. And I’m beginning to see the
utility of FeedLand as a feed operating system, which is what I wanted
it to be. It’s not just a feed reader. It’s able to do things most feed
readers don’t do, maybe none do. We don’t have a good grasp of the depth
of the feed products either. I will of course share the results when
they are shareable.</p>

<p>Three movies I’ve watched in the last few days: 1. Fight Club. 2. The
Matrix. 3. The Devil’s Advocate. I had seen all of them before. But they
go together. And they’re all about the same thing, about choosing to
live in a dream, or to live the life you’re actually living. All three
are excellent movies that I watched straight through from beginning to
end, which is really unusual for me these days.</p>
