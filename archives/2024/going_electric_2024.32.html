Democratic U.S. Presidential candidate Kamala Harris announced her VP
pick this week in Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who has recently passed
laws supporting Minnesota’s transition to carbon-free power and lower
tailpipe emissions.

However, the CEO of the nation’s largest EV company, whose personal and
corporate mission is supposedly to ensure a transition to sustainable
transport, is still backing a ticket that routinely lies about EVs and
wants to subsidize polluting gas vehicles.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of August 2024. Summer is fully upon us and it’s time
to make the most of the warm weather! Just like
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/">
ultra-competitive e-bike selling year</a> last year, 2024 has become the
year of the e-bike sales. So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any
one of which could become your next electric bike.
