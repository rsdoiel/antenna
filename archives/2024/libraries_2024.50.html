<h2 id="a-progress-update-and-a-renewed-commitment-to-community">A
progress update and a renewed commitment to community</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-12, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Looking back over 2024, we wanted to reflect on where we are in meeting
our goals, and report on the progress and plans that affect you - our
community of 21,000 organisational members as well as the vast number of
research initiatives and scientific bodies that rely on Crossref
metadata.
</p>
<p>
In this post, we will give an update on our roadmap, including what is
completed, underway, and up next, and a bit about what’s paused and why.
We’ll describe how we have been making resourcing and prioritisation
decisions, including a revised management structure, and introduce new
cross-functional program groups to collectively take the work forward
more effectively.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive">
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/scale-of-crossref.png"
alt="screenshot from slidedeck titled Scale of Crossref. Contains various stats." width="75%">
</figure>
</div>
<p>
It’s important to acknowledge that Crossref has evolved significantly
from just five years ago - our member count has more than doubled from
10,000 to 21,000 organisations since 2019 and they include all kinds of
organisations such as funders, universities, government bodies, NGOs,
and of course scholar- and library-led publishers. The smaller
organisations now collectively contribute the majority of Crossref
funding. We’ve gone from 100 million records to 160 million in five
years, and our metadata is retrieved more than 2 billion times monthly,
quadrupling what it was five years ago.
</p>
<p>
It’s within this context that we’ve spent quite a lot of time thinking
about scalability, how we collect and process feedback and contributions
from many organisations, how to automate our operations, and refining
the plans for the next few years.
</p>
<h2 id="our-strategic-agenda-remains-the-same">
Our strategic agenda remains the same
</h2>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">

<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/strategic-themes-programs-landscape-slide.png"
alt="screenshot from Strategy page showing Crossref strategic themes." width="75%">
</figure>
</div>
<p>
A few times a year we update the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/strategy">strategy page</a> where
there is a quadrant of projects showing what’s completed, in progress,
up next, and in planning/ideas - for each strategic theme. We also link
from there to our live
<a href="https://roadmap.productboard.com/e6fdeba8-a5b3-4aef-8104-d48863ba975e" target="_blank">public
roadmap</a> which shows more specifics about individual projects,
including projected timelines, and is updated more frequently.
</p>
<p>
If you’ve been watching the strategy page, checking in on the public
roadmap or this blog, or joining
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/events">webinars and annual
meetings</a>, you’ll know that we’ve had some longstanding plans
to—among other things—reduce technical debt, rebuild our metadata
management system, move to the cloud, modernise our schema, support
multiple languages, and partner with multiple data sources to build the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">Research
Nexus</a>.
</p>
<p>
You’ve heard us talk about these initiatives a lot, but you’ve not seen
particularly swift action.
</p>
<h2 id="moving-the-work-forward-more-effectively">
Moving the work forward more effectively
</h2>
<p>
Earlier this year, it became clear that our almost three-year project to
build a new relationships API had not worked out. The project, dubbed
‘manifold’, was to initially deliver data citations, and eventually
replace our central metadata system, but what was prototyped didn’t
scale, even with a subset of our metadata. We weren’t confident enough
about the project’s timeline or costs to justifiably continue investing
further time and resources.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, we’d barely scratched the surface of our aim to pay down
technical and operational debt, and we’d also been neglecting to keep
the live system up to date with the numerous metadata changes that have
been queued up, waiting to be implemented.
</p>
<p>
We knew the manifold project was ambitious – our system has grown in
complexity over the years. We were trying to rebuild the car while
driving it (our system needed to continue to operate and be maintained
by our team) while trying to design a new approach to manage the many
relationships between 160+ million database records. In the years we
worked on this project, we learned a lot that will inform future plans
for a large system redesign.
</p>
<p>
In March this year, we decided to pause the manifold project. We
apologised to our community partners for not delivering the promised
data&lt;-&gt;literature matches they hoped to use. They were frustrated
but thankfully understanding.
</p>
<p>
We then resolved to focus on backend infrastructural changes, conduct
cross-training so that all of our staff would become familiar with
current in-use systems instead of greenfield tech (for now), and start
to make a dent in the backlog of bugs and long-promised schema updates
in our mainstream services.
</p>
<p>
We’re happy to report some movement on these things and some milestones
that have been achieved in these areas in recent months.
</p>
<h2 id="fostering-a-happy-and-dedicated-team">
Fostering a happy and dedicated team
</h2>
<p>
Any kind of work can only happen when our staff are in a good place,
feeling supported and comfortable to question things, and well-equipped
with information, purpose, and clear priorities. In June, when the whole
staff met up in person, we had some really good conversations about
culture, communication, and about sharing responsibilities. Some people
ran birds-of-a-feather sessions to explore the issues that had been
keeping them up at night, such as authentication/security, and
rebuilding the Crossref System (CS), and the team also co-created a set
of prioritisation drivers that are now in use within our roadmap and
planning processes.
</p>
<p>
Taking on feedback from the all-staff meeting and then the July board
meeting, we thought strategically about the organisational structure
Crossref would need over the next few years to reflect the growth in
scope and size, and fulfil its longer term goals. We have long had an
ambitious agenda but realised we didn’t yet have the capacity to do it
all. So we came to the conclusion that we needed an updated team and
management structure to take us through the next phase of our
development.
</p>
<p>
The structural changes were concluded at the end of November. They
included:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Moving Technology under Operations, since Technology—though a vital
enabler—still works in service to our mission and in support of our
community, just like other operational things like board governance and
finance.
</li>
<li>
Reframing product development as Programs and Services, and reducing our
workstreams from five product portfolios to three programs. We formed
cross-team steering groups around clearly articulated program areas
(more on those below).
</li>
<li>
Broadening the leadership to include an Executive team and an extended
Director team, and forming a Senior Management Team (SMT). These changes
ensure that the collective responsibility for Crossref now rests on a
wider group of experts who can back each other up and share the risk and
the knowledge, rather than on just a few individuals.
</li>
<li>
We started recruiting for directors for two new leadership positions.
We’ll welcome a new Director of Programs and Services and a new Director
of Technology in the new year.
</li>
<li>
Evolving the strategic initiatives team into a data science team,
integrating research &amp; development functions throughout all teams
and with the SMT taking collective responsibility for strategic
initiatives.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, with the shift in approach for product development and by
sharing responsibility for strategic initiatives and research among the
wider team, we made the difficult decision that four positions would no
longer work within the new structure.
</p>
<h2 id="a-new-approach-joined-up-initiatives-and-cross-functional-programs">
A new approach: joined-up initiatives and cross-functional programs
</h2>
<p>
Research has always been an important role for Crossref, but as this
function had been annexed from our regular work, it became hard to
coordinate strategic initiatives across the wider organisation. In
recent years we inadvertently created more technical debt for ourselves,
i.e., built multiple prototype tools without plans for adoption or
moving them into production. Strategic initiatives, by their nature,
need thorough research and high-level alignment, so we made such
initiatives—things like
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs-resourcing-crossref">Resourcing
Crossref for Future Sustainability (RCFS)</a> and improving the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/research-integrity">Integrity
of the Scholarly record (ISR)</a>—the responsibility of the whole senior
management team.
</p>
<p>
Some useful research had been conducted, but we were never in a position
to act on any of it. Particularly promising work has been in the field
of
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/metadata-matching">metadata
matching</a>, and with the growth in the community reliance on our
metadata, and attention on data quality rightly increasing, we decided
to create a new data science team to be dedicated to this work, led by
Dominika Tkaczyk.
</p>
<p>
We had also struggled with a traditional product management approach
since all our tools and activities are interconnected, and we found we
were trying to do too many things at once but not all of them very
effectively. We also acknowledged that product management comes from the
commercial e.g. retail world and therefore is designed to help companies
sell/upsell, which is not our goal. So we looked to other approaches
more suitable to mission-based nonprofits.
</p>
<h3 id="introducing-three-programs">
Introducing three programs
</h3>
<p>
We have introduced cross-functional program management in order to work
towards the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
better cross-team alignment
</li>
<li>
shared responsibility
</li>
<li>
improve communication and learning
</li>
<li>
make more progress on the things members need.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Supporting the strategic theme of co-creation, a new program,
facilitated by Program Lead Lena Stoll, now manages and oversees all
activities around <strong>co-creation and community trends</strong>. A
cross-team steering group just began meeting regularly and will be
responsible for interfaces such as reports/dashboards, record
registration interfaces, connections and collaborations such as
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/">Open Funder
Registry</a>, <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR</a>,
<a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a> auto-update, as
well as <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/" target="_blank">OJS</a> and
other partner integrations. This program also includes the Crossref
website and any front-end things to support other programs. And it
includes ISR (the integrity of the scholarly record) and our tools in
this area such as Crossmark and retraction/correction tooling, and
Similarity Check for text comparisons.
</p>
<p>
Supporting the strategic theme of complete and global metadata and
relationships, a new program, facilitated by Program Lead Martyn
Rittman, now manages and oversees all activities relating to
<strong>contributing to the Research Nexus</strong>. Working
particularly closely with the metadata team, led by Patricia Feeney,
this program addresses how metadata is modelled, used, enriched, and
extended. Work includes our APIs, incorporating external data sources
like <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/" target="_blank">Retraction
Watch</a> and
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data">Event Data</a>,
building out metadata matching services with the new data science team,
supporting the community of metadata users with API sprints and more
modern options for retrieving metadata based on usage and need.
</p>
<p>
Supporting the strategic theme of open and sustainable operations and
keeping to the POSI framework, a new program, facilitated by Program
Lead Sara Bowman, now manages and oversees all activities relating to
<strong>making our operations more open, transparent, and
sustainable</strong>. This program focuses on supporting and
strengthening the core functions our members rely on and enabling future
growth. It includes metadata deposit and processing, most apps for
e.g. managing titles, authentication, and architectural and
infrastructural projects like moving from the data centre to the AWS
cloud service. This program also includes modernising our operations in
general, which is not just technology but also finance and human
resources, so projects like membership process automation, fee modelling
and financial analyses, and business system integrations.
</p>
<p>
The Programs will start to be reflected across our website and in our
communications from next year.
</p>
<h2 id="what-are-crossrefs-new-prioritisation-drivers">
What are Crossref’s new prioritisation drivers?
</h2>
<p>
These are the drivers that our ~40 staff co-created in June that are
guiding decisions about the priorities on our roadmap. New ideas will be
evaluated in the following areas:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Encourage participation from new or under-represented communities
</li>
<li>
Respond to and lead trends in scholarly communications
</li>
<li>
Benefit the greatest number of members and users
</li>
<li>
Reflect on how the community works with each other and allow members to
self-serve
</li>
<li>
Expand to support and connect relevant resource types and metadata
fields
</li>
<li>
Make it easier to create and update metadata
</li>
<li>
Enhance metadata for completeness and accuracy
</li>
<li>
Make it easier to retrieve and use metadata
</li>
<li>
Automate repetitive/manual tasks
</li>
<li>
Address technical and operational debt
</li>
<li>
Maintain critical systems and operations and ensure their security
</li>
<li>
Control or reduce costs - to Crossref, our community, or the environment
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We’re happy to report that the changes made this year have resulted in a
productive last few months of the year. As reported in our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/2024/2024-12-09-a-look-back-at-crossref2024">annual
meeting</a>, here is the progress update.
</p>
<h3 id="whats-paused">
What’s paused
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
A relationships API endpoint and, therefore, a specific data citation
feed
</li>
<li>
Manifold, the the three-year effort to modernise our tech stack
</li>
<li>
Most of the strategic initiatives prototypes that can’t yet be scaled,
such as Labs API and Labs reports
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whats-recently-completed">
What’s recently completed
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
We succeeded in moving the entire Crossref corpus to an open-source
database, PostgreSQL
</li>
<li>
Fixed numerous REST API data quality issues and lots of troublesome bugs
</li>
<li>
Schema development - support for ROR as a Funder identifier is live and
currently in testing
</li>
<li>
We automated some very manual membership and billing processes, saving
hundreds of staff hours a year
</li>
<li>
Released a new form for journal article record registration, building on
the grant registration form
</li>
<li>
Upgraded
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/re-introducing-participation-reports-to-encourage-best-practices-in-open-metadata/">Participation
Reports</a> to include Affiliations and ROR IDs
</li>
<li>
Launched a new <a href="https://www.crossref.org/learning/">API Learning
Hub</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since the rest of the community stops for no Crossref product roadmap
issue, we also progressed a number of community and governance
initiatives:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Grant
Linking System (GLS)</a> reached 5 years with over 40 funders joining
Crossref and registering over 130,000 grants and awards, including use
of facilities and projects
</li>
<li>
Our research for Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability (RCFS)
with the Membership &amp; Fees Committee is going well, and we’ll have
new fee proposals for review in 2025
</li>
<li>
The integrity of the Scholarly Record (ISR) conversations have deepened,
and we’ve formed strong relationships with editorial experts and
research integrity sleuths, who are getting up to speed on our metadata,
and we’re working with some sleuthing consultants to change our
processes to handle deceptive member behaviour such as paper mills,
cloned journals, and citation manipulation. The new data science team
plays a role here, along with membership and governance.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whats-currently-in-focus">
What’s currently in focus
</h3>
<p>
In our efforts to do less but do it more effectively, we have two
current priorities:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Get out of the physical data centre and into the cloud.
</li>
<li>
Develop
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-schema-development-plans">Schema
5.4</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These two projects are underway, involving lots of communication and
learning. Since we haven’t released any schema updates in many years,
all our staff are learning for the first time how a metadata schema
model is interpreted in a systemic way, learning about the structure of
research objects, and honing the process as they go. We’ve high hopes
we’ll be in a position to release continuous metadata schema versions
and catch up on the backlog over the coming years.
</p>
<h3 id="whats-next">
What’s next
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Continuous metadata development, with contributor roles up next
</li>
<li>
Retraction Watch data integrated into the REST API so users have a
single source of retraction/correction data
</li>
<li>
Upgraded preprint matching and notifications
</li>
<li>
Modelling more equitable fees through the RCFS projects
</li>
<li>
Piloting a non-voting membership category
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we’re fully in the cloud and in the groove of metadata updates, and
with the support of newly-hired technology and program directors joining
in the new year, we’ll turn our attention to rebuilding the central
metadata system that we call the Crossref System, or “CS” and report
more on this next year.
</p>
<p>
So that was our summary of 2024 and an indication of what’s coming in
2025 and beyond; sorry it’s so long, and thanks for reading this far!
Next year we’ll get back to more regular updates as the strategic agenda
and the programs progress.

<h2 id="a-summary-of-our-annual-meeting">A summary of our Annual
Meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
The Crossref2024 annual meeting gathered our community for a packed
agenda of updates, demos, and lively discussions on advancing our shared
goals. The day was filled with insights and energy, from practical demos
of Crossref’s latest API features to community reflections on the
Research Nexus initiative and the Board elections.
</p>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/2025-board.png" alt="graphic with headshots of panelists" style="float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0; width: 50%;">
<p>
Our Board elections are always the focal point of the Annual Meeting. We
want to start reflecting on the day by congratulating our newly elected
board members: Katharina Rieck from Austrian Science Fund (FWF), Lisa
Schiff from California Digital Library, Aaron Wood from American
Psychological Association, and Amanda Ward from Taylor and Francis, who
will officially join (and re-join) in January 2025. Their diverse
expertise and perspectives will undoubtedly bring fresh insights to
Crossref’s ongoing mission.
<div>

</div>
<p>
The meeting started with a recap of our mission and priorities. Ed Pentz
reiterated the Research Nexus vision of increasing transparency of the
connections that make up the scholarly record and underpin the research
ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
Crossref is dedicated to openness, community ownership, and a stable,
accessible infrastructure that researchers, publishers, funders, and
institutions can rely on for the long term. This is demonstrated by
Crossref’s commitment to the
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank">the
Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a>, which constitute
commitments to building a resilient and transparent infrastructure for
research—sustainability, community governance, and openness. Ed
emphasized how Crossref is aligning with these principles and
collaborates with other adopters to reflect and continuously align these
with the needs of the scholarly community, with a public consultation on
proposed revisions to POSI forthcoming next year.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=ebg6NvNDb7hiGdPe&amp;t=80" target="_blank">Ginny
Hendricks highlighted key membership and metadata trends</a>. She noted
that as of 2024, half of Crossref members are based in Asia. This year,
as always in recent years, we saw many new organizations from Indonesia,
Turkey, India, and Brazil join us. Removing those fast-growing countries
for the chart’s clarity, we can see that some of the next most active
countries are Pakistan, Mexico, Spain, Bangladesh, and Ecuador, among
others.
</p>
<p>
There are now ~163 million open metadata records with Crossref DOIs, and
Ginny pointed out increases in the registration of preprints,
peer-review reports, and grants. In terms of metadata elements, it’s
good to see that more publishers recognize the importance of including
abstracts and ROR IDs in their metadata records. Also, in line with the
community’s concerns about integrity, our members have been enriching
their records with direct assertions of retractions.

</figure>
</div>
<p>
Then, Ginny went on to report on the progress towards our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/strategy/">strategic goals</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Contribute to an environment where the community identifies and
co-creates solutions for broad benefit
</li>
<li>
A sustainable source of complete, open, and global scholarly metadata
and relationships
</li>
<li>
Manage Crossref openly and sustainably, modernizing and making
transparent all operations so that we are accountable to the communities
that govern us.
</li>
<li>
Foster a strong team because reliable infrastructure needs committed
people who contribute to and realize the vision and thrive in doing it.

Demos
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=yVVxcwPCRYJL5JWd&amp;t=1916" target="_blank">Lena
Stoll and Patrick Vale’s session</a> gave members a practical preview of
our latest tools.
</p>
<p>
Patrick started by reflecting on the challenge of making our identifiers
useful for people using screen readers (and other assistive
technologies). He thanked all who responded to our past consultation on
the topic and presented the Crossref DOI Accessibility Enhancer – the
browser plug-in initially available for Firefox (and soon also for
Chrome). He shared the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/doi-accessibility-enhancer" target="_blank">Gitlab
repo</a> for anyone interested in trying it and invited feedback as
we’re hoping to iterate on this.
</p>
<p>
Patrick then went on to talk about our openness to community
contributions to Crossref tools, with an example of the recent
contribution from CWTS Leiden to our
<a href="https://crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">Participation
Reports</a>. Thanks to their work, our members can now see the
proportion of works they’ve registered that include affiliation
information and ROR IDs, alongside the previously available key metadata
such as references, abstracts, ORCID iDs, funding information, or
Crossmark.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Lena demonstrated the latest extension of our record management
tool that’s just been made available to make manual registration of
metadata records for journal articles easier.
<a href="https://manage.crossref.org/records" target="_blank">The new
form</a> is flexible and driven by our metadata schema. Importantly for
our members, it simplifies the workflow with input validations and
automated ISSN matching, and it enables members to register author
affiliations with an integrated ROR look-up. We hope this will support
our smaller members, who are relying on our helper tools to register
their content.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the session, members were encouraged to use these tools and
explore new resources available through Crossref. We believe that by
taking advantage of these resources, you can enhance your research and
publishing experience, and contribute to the growth and development of
the scholarly community.
</p>
<h3 id="the-discussion-about-open-scholarly-infrastructure">
The discussion about open scholarly infrastructure
</h3>
<p>
The panel on open scholarly infrastructure brought together experts with
a wide range of experience in the field. Moderated by Lucy Ofiesh,
Crossref’s Chief Operating Officer, the discussion featured six invited
speakers who shared their insights on the opportunities and challenges
facing the scholarly ecosystem: Ed Pentz, Crossref; Sarah Lippincott,
Dryad; Amélie Church, Sorbonne University; Joanna Ball, DOAJ; Ann Li,
Airiti; and Richard Bruce Lamptey, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science
and Technology.
</p>
<p>
The panel talked about what openness in scholarly infrastructure means,
why it’s important, its sustainability, and how to tackle challenges and
gaps across the ecosystem. They highlighted frameworks like the
Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI), the
<a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona
Declaration</a>, and the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6557302" target="_blank">FOREST
Framework</a> as key tools for guiding work on governance,
sustainability, and equity. The discussion highlighted the need for more
collaboration, inclusivity, and practical ways to ensure open
infrastructure remains sustainable in the long run.
</p>
<p>
They also stressed how openness supports research integrity. How
transparent systems allow researchers to question methods, verify
findings, and preserve data. Amelie Church expanded on this point,
underscoring the important role of open infrastructure in addressing
challenges to integrity. She explained that such transparency enables
the scholarly community to scrutinize research processes, ensuring the
quality of outputs and their impact on society. Without openness,
researchers face barriers to maintaining trust in their work, making
open infrastructure necessary for research integrity and public
confidence in science.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“By focusing on accessibility, transparency, and community engagement,
open infrastructure can reshape academic and research ecosystems in
transformative ways.” ~Richard Bruce Lamptey
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Regarding sustainability, Sarah Lippincott stressed the importance of
aligning funding models with community needs while addressing governance
challenges. She pointed out that while initial funding can launch
infrastructure, long-term sustainability requires consistent community
investment and robust governance frameworks. This balance, she
explained, is essential to ensure equity and transparency.
</p>
<p>
Collaboration was another important topic. Joanna Ball and Sarah
Lippincott shared examples of how pooling expertise and resources—such
as in the global support for ROR—can strengthen systems and make them
more sustainable. These initiatives show the power of collective efforts
in addressing technical and resource barriers. However, inclusivity
remains an ongoing challenge.
</p>
<p>
The panel discussed the ways in which language barriers, resource
limitations, and reliance on proprietary systems continue to exclude
researchers from underrepresented regions. Ann Li highlighted how
addressing these disparities is critical to ensuring the global
accessibility of open infrastructure. By fostering inclusive practices,
the scholarly community can mitigate biases and build tools that reflect
a broader range of research contributions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
”My hope is that open infrastructure can have the resources that it
needs to thrive, not just merely survive, and also that open
infrastructure communities and organizations look to the value of
frameworks that we’ve talked about today to help align themselves and
improve their policies and practices, because there’s always room for
growth, even in the best, most well-intentioned communities.” ~Sarah
Lippincott, Dryad
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The panel wrapped up the discussion by expressing optimism for the
future of open scholarly infrastructure and emphasized the importance of
continued investment, collaboration across organizations, and
transparency in operations. The discussion reinforced the idea that open
infrastructure provides a strong foundation for research that is
equitable, sustainable, and accessible to all.
</p>
<h3 id="updates-from-our-community">
Updates from our Community
</h3>
<p>
We enjoyed talks from our community about increasing their participation
in the Research Nexus by adopting, using and enhancing metadata in
different ways. Robbykha Rosalien hosted talks from the EuropePMC, Dutch
Research Council, eLife, and CSIRO featured in Session I, and Amanda
French hosted CLOCKSS, Sciety, and Redalyc in Session II.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=1VV79KhplCHsWXNt&amp;t=3701" target="_blank">Michael
Parkin talked about preprints in Europe PMC</a>. Europe PMC is a
database for life science literature and a platform for content-based
innovation. They started indexing preprints via Crossref REST API in
2018. Michael presented their work on discoverability of preprints in
their database, including reflections on early challenges, as well as
the latest efforts in surfacing available community reviews.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=euFBcIGYp1UEDrHz&amp;t=4169" target="_blank">Hans
de Jonge talked about the Dutch Research Council’s (NWO)</a> dedication
to open science, with policies ensuring that publications and data
funded by NWO are openly available. They embrace open science principles
for their own metadata and is a signatory of the Barcelona Declaration
on Open Research Information. Hans focused on NWO’s recent introduction
of Grant IDs through Crossref’s Grant Linking System (GLS). He shared
their approach, the motivations behind introducing Grant IDs, and some
challenges they faced.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=eNYAyjvIlX0OkCBJ&amp;t=5002" target="_blank">Frederick
Atherden explained how eLife</a>, a nonprofit led by scientists, use
Crossref’s Grant Linking System to include grant DOIs in their
publication metadata. It allows authors to add grant DOIs during
submission, and they developed a tool to match grant numbers with DOIs
during the proofing process to improve accuracy. Their goal is to follow
best practices for metadata, making content easier to find and link to.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=1haopH2ahnb-xllw&amp;t=5522" target="_blank">Brietta
Pike covered how CSIRO</a> is working to improve metadata quality for
its journals, making research more discoverable and trustworthy. CSIRO
faced challenges like inconsistent XML tagging, outdated systems, and
data loss. To address these, they formed a project team, created a clear
XML stylesheet, and updated their workflows. Recent progress includes
better funding data, clearer license information, and more complete
affiliation tagging. These efforts aim to support a more transparent and
accessible research environment.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/5ZI8idIDL_A?si=5FaVcSbwCfyo_OOX&amp;t=9150" target="_blank">Alicia
Wise of CLOCKSS</a> talked about recent collaborations seeking to
safeguard our cultural and scholarly heritage over the long term.
CLOCKSS, a community-run archive, is dedicated to preserving scholarly
content to remain accessible and unchanged for future generations. True
preservation requires securely storing content in trusted archives that
are actively maintained. A group of librarians and publishers developed
a guide to help publishers preserve content, they also established an
archival standard for EPUB formats to ensure ebooks can be stored
effectively, and launched a pilot project to track preserved books,
helping libraries and scholars identify safely stored titles.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/5ZI8idIDL_A?si=0fLneFHGEaSsnSzC&amp;t=10082" target="_blank">Mark
Williams from Sciety</a> talked about how Sciety uses Crossref metadata
to create detailed preprint histories. By partnering with organizations
and communities worldwide, Sciety platform gathers public reviews,
highlights, and recommendations on preprinted research, helping
researchers evaluate the quality and relevance of new studies. Through
linking related preprints and journal articles, Sciety builds a
connected view of each research work. Although challenges like
inconsistent terminology and identifier gaps persist, these efforts
enhance the visibility and credibility of preprints.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/5ZI8idIDL_A?si=93KJA-36wgJ3Apg2&amp;t=10708" target="_blank">Arianna
Becerril-García of AmeliCA/Redalyc</a> shared insights on diamond
open-access journals in Latin America. Redalyc is an open-access
infrastructure that supports journals by providing free services like
visibility and production tools. Redalyc has a role in sustaining Latin
America’s unique approach to open-access publishing, where most journals
are backed by academic institutions and public funds, allowing free
access for both readers and authors. Arianna stressed the need to treat
these journals as digital public goods and urged the communities they
serve to help ensure their long-term sustainability. Despite limited
resources and global under-recognition, these journals serve an
international research audience, including authors from Europe, Africa,
and Asia. Redalyc and other open infrastructures play a key role by
offering tools that reduce production costs and improve discoverability,
all without financial barriers. Noted was how this approach aligns with
UNESCO’s open science framework, which promotes inclusivity and
addresses long-standing inequalities in scholarly publishing.

Aftrenoon of more resources and updates from Crossref
</h3>
<p>
After a mid-day break (in Europe),
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZI8idIDL_A&amp;t=98s" target="_blank">Luis
Montilla kicked off the second session with a practical tutorial of
Crossref’s REST API</a>. Following his last year’s
<a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/h3yygefpyf" target="_blank">intro to
the Crossref API</a>, this time he offered a step-by-step guide to help
attendees maximize the API’s capabilities for metadata retrieval with
advice on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Managing large data requests with pagination and
iterations</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Incorporating safety mechanisms</strong> - to avoid hitting rate
limits, Luis recommended adding pauses between requests and sharing
example scripts to streamline this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For those interested in learning more, look at the new Crossref
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/learning/">API Learning Hub</a>— a new
resource offering guides, scripts, and training materials to simplify
complex queries. Please share questions about things you’re not sure
about in our
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/metadata-retrieval/27" target="_blank">community

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZI8idIDL_A&amp;t=1508s" target="_blank">Patricia
Feeney followed with updates on metadata schema changes</a>. She
introduced our recent shift to integrate the Funder Registry with ROR,
which allows members to use a single identifier system, simplifying data
management by reducing redundancy. Patricia explained that, for now, the
current identifiers remain valid, so members won’t need to make
immediate changes. She also outlined planned support for version
metadata, typed citations, and future plans to expand support for
contributor role vocabularies, and invited community participation in a
planned multilingual metadata working group.

We’ve heard a lot of support for our current
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">GEM program</a>. While it was
clear from our poll that publishing revenue is not the most relevant
measure of size or capacity for all those present – establishing a good
alternative proved challenging. The idea of considering the size of the
organization as its largest entity has been discussed, and important
points were raised about budgets in different types of distributed
organizations (e.g., on the position of libraries within large
universities).

<a href="https://youtu.be/5ZI8idIDL_A?si=UHj-O3PGG58AyQxF&amp;t=6396" target="_blank">Lucy
highlighted some of the key accomplishments of the year so far</a>,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Research for Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability (RCFS)
</li>
<li>
Integrity of the Scholarly Record (ISR)
</li>
<li>

<li>
Upgraded Participation Reports to include Affiliations and ROR IDs
</li>
<li>
Launched a new API Learning Hub
</li>
<li>
Paused further development of a Relationships API
</li>
<li>
Migrated to a new open-source database
</li>
<li>
Schema development - ROR as Funder identifiers
</li>
<li>
REST API bug fixes and metadata consistency fixes.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then she reflected on the membership growth––Crossref is now made up of
21,000 organizations from 160 countries. We reviewed our 2024 year-end
financial forecast. As we’re bouncing back from COVID-19, our travel
expenses have grown this year, and so have the fees for cloud services
hosting. These are all as planned and happen in the context of healthy
growth, including that from adoption and increased usage of paid
services. We’re in a healthy financial position as membership revenue
and usage fees, like content registration and Similarity Check document
checking fees, continue to grow from the previous year.
</p>
<p>
Thank you to everyone who joined us for Crossref2024. This year’s
meeting showcased our collective dedication to advancing open,
accessible research infrastructure and underscored the power of
collaboration in building a stronger scholarly community. As we reflect
on the rich discussions and insights shared during the event, it’s clear
our community is committed to advancing open and sustainable scholarly
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, we’ll continue collaborating with members and partners to
tackle challenges, expand accessibility, and foster collaboration. A key
focus will be enhancing tools and metadata standards to serve the
community better. Through innovative solutions and strategic initiatives
like the Research Nexus, our collective efforts will make research more
connected and accessible for all.

<h2 id="posi-audit">2024 POSI audit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<h2 id="background">
Background
</h2>
<p>
The <a href="https://doi.org/10.24343/C34W2H" target="_blank">Principles
of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a> provides a set of guidelines
for operating open infrastructure in service to the scholarly community.
It sets out 16 points to ensure that the infrastructure on which the
scholarly and research communities rely is openly governed, sustainable,
and replicable. Each POSI adopter regularly reviews progress, conducts
periodic audits, and self-reports how they’re working towards each of
the principles.
</p>
<p>
In 2020, Crossref’s board
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossrefs-board-votes-to-adopt-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure/">voted</a>
to adopt the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure, and we
completed our first self-audit. We published our next review in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/posi-fan-tutte/">2022</a>.
</p>
<p>
The POSI adopters have continued to review the principles,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.54900/n6az7-4xb07" target="_blank">reflecting</a>
on the effects of adopting them and providing a
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posi-v1.1-revisions.pdf" target="_blank">revision
to the principles in late 2023</a>. We use the revised principles for
this latest review.

<p>
We use a traffic light system to indicate where we believe we stand
against each of the 16 principles. Now with up/down arrows to show any
significant movement, and an ‘i’ where there is something of note with
narrative.
</p>
<p>
<i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-red'></i> red
indicates we are not fulfilling the principle. <br>
<i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-yellow'></i> yellow
indicates we are making progress towards meeting the principle. <br>
<i class='fa fas fa-circle font-small font-crossref-green'></i> green
indicates we are fulfilling the principle. <br>
<i class='fa fas fa-circle-arrow-up font-small font-crossref-yellow'></i>
or
<i class='fa fas fa-circle-arrow-up font-small font-crossref-green'></i>
means this is a new change, where we’ve moved ‘up’ the traffic lights,
in comparison to the previous audit. We would use the same if ‘down’
ever happens too. <br>
<i class='fa fas fa-circle-info font-small font-crossref-yellow'></i> or
<i class='fa fas fa-circle-info font-small font-crossref-green'></i>
means that something has changed of note and in comparison to the
previous audit.

Stakeholder governed
</h4>
<p>
We’ve been yellow and we’re still yellow, but it has been improving. In
the past, we’ve reported that we are working towards this but we’re not
there yet because we didn’t have representation on the board from
certain types of members, specifically research funders and research
institutions. In the incoming 2025 board class, we have both. Six out of
our 16 board seats are held by universities, university presses, or
libraries. We also look forward to adding a new research funder, the
Austrian Science Fund (FWF), to the board in January.
</p>
<p>
None of this, though, is hardcoded into the structure of the board. We
extend an open call for board interest; any active member can apply for
consideration. The Nominating Committee prepares a slate with a diverse
range of candidates and organizations, and it is then up to the
membership to elect board members.
</p>
<p>
With only 16 board seats and &gt;21,000 members in 160 countries, being
fully stakeholder-governed is challenging. Further, there are important
contributors to the community that we all rely on who are not eligible
for board seats because they are not members, as defined in our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/bylaws/">by-laws</a>,
such as sponsors, service providers, and metadata users.
</p>
<p>
We don’t consider this principle fulfilled, and that’s a good thing to
keep note of; we must keep aspiring to have a broader, more
comprehensive representation of our evolving community. The board
continues to discuss stakeholder representation.

This was yellow and is now green. In 2023, we met our goal of
maintaining a contingency fund of 12 months of operating costs. We also
topped up this fund in 2024 to keep pace with our growing operating
expenses. The revisions for POSI 1.1 actually removed the specificity of
a 12-month timeline, allowing each adopting organisation to set its own
goal; in Crossref’s case, 12 months remains appropriate.

This was yellow and still is, but we’re making improvements. In
September of this year we migrated our database off of a closed-source
solution and onto
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>.
This has improved the performance of the system and is an important step
towards paying down technical debt and moving the system fully into the
cloud.

This was yellow and is now green. We confirm that we do not hold any
patents, and we have a published

on it that is available for inspection and reuse by anyone in the
community.
</p>
<h2 id="in-summary">
In summary
</h2>
<p>
These are the main changes of note for our 2024 POSI update. The summary
is that we’ve maintained all our greens, and of the four principles that
were yellow last time, two have moved to green (financial reserves;
patent non-assertion) and two have remained yellow but seen some
progress of note (stakeholder governed; open source).

<p>
We continue to learn from the
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posse/" target="_blank">POSI
adopters group</a>—now numbering 23 organisations—and the group will
soon share a draft of POSI v2 for community comment. We look forward to
the ongoing discussions with this group, and others, to keep improving
and holding ourselves to account.
