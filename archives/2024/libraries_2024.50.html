Without Burnout: Managing Polarities Consciously for Sustainable Success
in Publishing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>
<p>
A relentless push for growth can lead to burnout among authors, editors,
and reviewers, while also placing undue pressure on organizations to
maintain high levels of output. How can we better provide the
infrastructure and support systems needed to sustain that growth over
the long term.

<h2 id="a-summary-of-our-annual-meeting">A summary of our Annual
Meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
The Crossref2024 annual meeting gathered our community for a packed
agenda of updates, demos, and lively discussions on advancing our shared
goals. The day was filled with insights and energy, from practical demos
of Crossref’s latest API features to community reflections on the
Research Nexus initiative and the Board elections.
</p>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/2025-board.png" alt="graphic with headshots of panelists" style="float: left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0; width: 50%;">
<p>
Our Board elections are always the focal point of the Annual Meeting. We
want to start reflecting on the day by congratulating our newly elected
board members: Katharina Rieck from Austrian Science Fund (FWF), Lisa
Schiff from California Digital Library, Aaron Wood from American
Psychological Association, and Amanda Ward from Taylor and Francis, who
will officially join (and re-join) in January 2025. Their diverse
expertise and perspectives will undoubtedly bring fresh insights to
Crossref’s ongoing mission.
<div>

</div>
<p>
The meeting started with a recap of our mission and priorities. Ed Pentz
reiterated the Research Nexus vision of increasing transparency of the
connections that make up the scholarly record and underpin the research
ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
Crossref is dedicated to openness, community ownership, and a stable,
accessible infrastructure that researchers, publishers, funders, and
institutions can rely on for the long term. This is demonstrated by
Crossref’s commitment to the
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank">the
Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a>, which constitute
commitments to building a resilient and transparent infrastructure for
research—sustainability, community governance, and openness. Ed
emphasized how Crossref is aligning with these principles and
collaborates with other adopters to reflect and continuously align these
with the needs of the scholarly community, with a public consultation on
proposed revisions to POSI forthcoming next year.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=ebg6NvNDb7hiGdPe&amp;t=80" target="_blank">Ginny
Hendricks highlighted key membership and metadata trends</a>. She noted
that as of 2024, half of Crossref members are based in Asia. This year,
as always in recent years, we saw many new organizations from Indonesia,
Turkey, India, and Brazil join us. Removing those fast-growing countries
for the chart’s clarity, we can see that some of the next most active
countries are Pakistan, Mexico, Spain, Bangladesh, and Ecuador, among
others.
</p>
<p>
There are now ~163 million open metadata records with Crossref DOIs, and
Ginny pointed out increases in the registration of preprints,
peer-review reports, and grants. In terms of metadata elements, it’s
good to see that more publishers recognize the importance of including
abstracts and ROR IDs in their metadata records. Also, in line with the
community’s concerns about integrity, our members have been enriching
their records with direct assertions of retractions.

</figure>
</div>
<p>
Then, Ginny went on to report on the progress towards our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/strategy/">strategic goals</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Contribute to an environment where the community identifies and
co-creates solutions for broad benefit
</li>
<li>
A sustainable source of complete, open, and global scholarly metadata
and relationships
</li>
<li>
Manage Crossref openly and sustainably, modernizing and making
transparent all operations so that we are accountable to the communities
that govern us.
</li>
<li>
Foster a strong team because reliable infrastructure needs committed
people who contribute to and realize the vision and thrive in doing it.

Demos
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=yVVxcwPCRYJL5JWd&amp;t=1916" target="_blank">Lena
Stoll and Patrick Vale’s session</a> gave members a practical preview of
our latest tools.
</p>
<p>
Patrick started by reflecting on the challenge of making our identifiers
useful for people using screen readers (and other assistive
technologies). He thanked all who responded to our past consultation on
the topic and presented the Crossref DOI Accessibility Enhancer – the
browser plug-in initially available for Firefox (and soon also for
Chrome). He shared the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/doi-accessibility-enhancer" target="_blank">Gitlab
repo</a> for anyone interested in trying it and invited feedback as
we’re hoping to iterate on this.
</p>
<p>
Patrick then went on to talk about our openness to community
contributions to Crossref tools, with an example of the recent
contribution from CWTS Leiden to our
<a href="https://crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">Participation
Reports</a>. Thanks to their work, our members can now see the
proportion of works they’ve registered that include affiliation
information and ROR IDs, alongside the previously available key metadata
such as references, abstracts, ORCID iDs, funding information, or
Crossmark.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Lena demonstrated the latest extension of our record management
tool that’s just been made available to make manual registration of
metadata records for journal articles easier.
<a href="https://manage.crossref.org/records" target="_blank">The new
form</a> is flexible and driven by our metadata schema. Importantly for
our members, it simplifies the workflow with input validations and
automated ISSN matching, and it enables members to register author
affiliations with an integrated ROR look-up. We hope this will support
our smaller members, who are relying on our helper tools to register
their content.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the session, members were encouraged to use these tools and
explore new resources available through Crossref. We believe that by
taking advantage of these resources, you can enhance your research and
publishing experience, and contribute to the growth and development of
the scholarly community.
</p>
<h3 id="the-discussion-about-open-scholarly-infrastructure">
The discussion about open scholarly infrastructure
</h3>
<p>
The panel on open scholarly infrastructure brought together experts with
a wide range of experience in the field. Moderated by Lucy Ofiesh,
Crossref’s Chief Operating Officer, the discussion featured six invited
speakers who shared their insights on the opportunities and challenges
facing the scholarly ecosystem: Ed Pentz, Crossref; Sarah Lippincott,
Dryad; Amélie Church, Sorbonne University; Joanna Ball, DOAJ; Ann Li,
Airiti; and Richard Bruce Lamptey, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science
and Technology.
</p>
<p>
The panel talked about what openness in scholarly infrastructure means,
why it’s important, its sustainability, and how to tackle challenges and
gaps across the ecosystem. They highlighted frameworks like the
Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI), the
<a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona
Declaration</a>, and the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6557302" target="_blank">FOREST
Framework</a> as key tools for guiding work on governance,
sustainability, and equity. The discussion highlighted the need for more
collaboration, inclusivity, and practical ways to ensure open
infrastructure remains sustainable in the long run.
</p>
<p>
They also stressed how openness supports research integrity. How
transparent systems allow researchers to question methods, verify
findings, and preserve data. Amelie Church expanded on this point,
underscoring the important role of open infrastructure in addressing
challenges to integrity. She explained that such transparency enables
the scholarly community to scrutinize research processes, ensuring the
quality of outputs and their impact on society. Without openness,
researchers face barriers to maintaining trust in their work, making
open infrastructure necessary for research integrity and public
confidence in science.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“By focusing on accessibility, transparency, and community engagement,
open infrastructure can reshape academic and research ecosystems in
transformative ways.” ~Richard Bruce Lamptey
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Regarding sustainability, Sarah Lippincott stressed the importance of
aligning funding models with community needs while addressing governance
challenges. She pointed out that while initial funding can launch
infrastructure, long-term sustainability requires consistent community
investment and robust governance frameworks. This balance, she
explained, is essential to ensure equity and transparency.
</p>
<p>
Collaboration was another important topic. Joanna Ball and Sarah
Lippincott shared examples of how pooling expertise and resources—such
as in the global support for ROR—can strengthen systems and make them
more sustainable. These initiatives show the power of collective efforts
in addressing technical and resource barriers. However, inclusivity
remains an ongoing challenge.
</p>
<p>
The panel discussed the ways in which language barriers, resource
limitations, and reliance on proprietary systems continue to exclude
researchers from underrepresented regions. Ann Li highlighted how
addressing these disparities is critical to ensuring the global
accessibility of open infrastructure. By fostering inclusive practices,
the scholarly community can mitigate biases and build tools that reflect
a broader range of research contributions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
”My hope is that open infrastructure can have the resources that it
needs to thrive, not just merely survive, and also that open
infrastructure communities and organizations look to the value of
frameworks that we’ve talked about today to help align themselves and
improve their policies and practices, because there’s always room for
growth, even in the best, most well-intentioned communities.” ~Sarah
Lippincott, Dryad
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The panel wrapped up the discussion by expressing optimism for the
future of open scholarly infrastructure and emphasized the importance of
continued investment, collaboration across organizations, and
transparency in operations. The discussion reinforced the idea that open
infrastructure provides a strong foundation for research that is
equitable, sustainable, and accessible to all.
</p>
<h3 id="updates-from-our-community">
Updates from our Community
</h3>
<p>
We enjoyed talks from our community about increasing their participation
in the Research Nexus by adopting, using and enhancing metadata in
different ways. Robbykha Rosalien hosted talks from the EuropePMC, Dutch
Research Council, eLife, and CSIRO featured in Session I, and Amanda
French hosted CLOCKSS, Sciety, and Redalyc in Session II.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=1VV79KhplCHsWXNt&amp;t=3701" target="_blank">Michael
Parkin talked about preprints in Europe PMC</a>. Europe PMC is a
database for life science literature and a platform for content-based
innovation. They started indexing preprints via Crossref REST API in
2018. Michael presented their work on discoverability of preprints in
their database, including reflections on early challenges, as well as
the latest efforts in surfacing available community reviews.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=euFBcIGYp1UEDrHz&amp;t=4169" target="_blank">Hans
de Jonge talked about the Dutch Research Council’s (NWO)</a> dedication
to open science, with policies ensuring that publications and data
funded by NWO are openly available. They embrace open science principles
for their own metadata and is a signatory of the Barcelona Declaration
on Open Research Information. Hans focused on NWO’s recent introduction
of Grant IDs through Crossref’s Grant Linking System (GLS). He shared
their approach, the motivations behind introducing Grant IDs, and some
challenges they faced.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=eNYAyjvIlX0OkCBJ&amp;t=5002" target="_blank">Frederick
Atherden explained how eLife</a>, a nonprofit led by scientists, use
Crossref’s Grant Linking System to include grant DOIs in their
publication metadata. It allows authors to add grant DOIs during
submission, and they developed a tool to match grant numbers with DOIs
during the proofing process to improve accuracy. Their goal is to follow
best practices for metadata, making content easier to find and link to.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/VBnfkOxVr6s?si=1haopH2ahnb-xllw&amp;t=5522" target="_blank">Brietta
Pike covered how CSIRO</a> is working to improve metadata quality for
its journals, making research more discoverable and trustworthy. CSIRO
faced challenges like inconsistent XML tagging, outdated systems, and
data loss. To address these, they formed a project team, created a clear
XML stylesheet, and updated their workflows. Recent progress includes
better funding data, clearer license information, and more complete
affiliation tagging. These efforts aim to support a more transparent and
accessible research environment.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/5ZI8idIDL_A?si=5FaVcSbwCfyo_OOX&amp;t=9150" target="_blank">Alicia
Wise of CLOCKSS</a> talked about recent collaborations seeking to
safeguard our cultural and scholarly heritage over the long term.
CLOCKSS, a community-run archive, is dedicated to preserving scholarly
content to remain accessible and unchanged for future generations. True
preservation requires securely storing content in trusted archives that
are actively maintained. A group of librarians and publishers developed
a guide to help publishers preserve content, they also established an
archival standard for EPUB formats to ensure ebooks can be stored
effectively, and launched a pilot project to track preserved books,
helping libraries and scholars identify safely stored titles.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/5ZI8idIDL_A?si=0fLneFHGEaSsnSzC&amp;t=10082" target="_blank">Mark
Williams from Sciety</a> talked about how Sciety uses Crossref metadata
to create detailed preprint histories. By partnering with organizations
and communities worldwide, Sciety platform gathers public reviews,
highlights, and recommendations on preprinted research, helping
researchers evaluate the quality and relevance of new studies. Through
linking related preprints and journal articles, Sciety builds a
connected view of each research work. Although challenges like
inconsistent terminology and identifier gaps persist, these efforts
enhance the visibility and credibility of preprints.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://youtu.be/5ZI8idIDL_A?si=93KJA-36wgJ3Apg2&amp;t=10708" target="_blank">Arianna
Becerril-García of AmeliCA/Redalyc</a> shared insights on diamond
open-access journals in Latin America. Redalyc is an open-access
infrastructure that supports journals by providing free services like
visibility and production tools. Redalyc has a role in sustaining Latin
America’s unique approach to open-access publishing, where most journals
are backed by academic institutions and public funds, allowing free
access for both readers and authors. Arianna stressed the need to treat
these journals as digital public goods and urged the communities they
serve to help ensure their long-term sustainability. Despite limited
resources and global under-recognition, these journals serve an
international research audience, including authors from Europe, Africa,
and Asia. Redalyc and other open infrastructures play a key role by
offering tools that reduce production costs and improve discoverability,
all without financial barriers. Noted was how this approach aligns with
UNESCO’s open science framework, which promotes inclusivity and
addresses long-standing inequalities in scholarly publishing.

Aftrenoon of more resources and updates from Crossref
</h3>
<p>
After a mid-day break (in Europe),
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZI8idIDL_A&amp;t=98s" target="_blank">Luis
Montilla kicked off the second session with a practical tutorial of
Crossref’s REST API</a>. Following his last year’s
<a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/h3yygefpyf" target="_blank">intro to
the Crossref API</a>, this time he offered a step-by-step guide to help
attendees maximize the API’s capabilities for metadata retrieval with
advice on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Managing large data requests with pagination and
iterations</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Incorporating safety mechanisms</strong> - to avoid hitting rate
limits, Luis recommended adding pauses between requests and sharing
example scripts to streamline this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For those interested in learning more, look at the new Crossref
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/learning/">API Learning Hub</a>— a new

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZI8idIDL_A&amp;t=1508s" target="_blank">Patricia
Feeney followed with updates on metadata schema changes</a>. She
introduced our recent shift to integrate the Funder Registry with ROR,
which allows members to use a single identifier system, simplifying data
management by reducing redundancy. Patricia explained that, for now, the
current identifiers remain valid, so members won’t need to make
immediate changes. She also outlined planned support for version
metadata, typed citations, and future plans to expand support for
contributor role vocabularies, and invited community participation in a
planned multilingual metadata working group.

We’ve heard a lot of support for our current
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/">GEM program</a>. While it was
clear from our poll that publishing revenue is not the most relevant
measure of size or capacity for all those present – establishing a good
alternative proved challenging. The idea of considering the size of the
organization as its largest entity has been discussed, and important
points were raised about budgets in different types of distributed
organizations (e.g., on the position of libraries within large
universities).

The official Annual Meeting part commenced after the discussion, with a
report on the State of Crossref from Lucy Ofiesh, and commenced with our
Board election.
<a href="https://youtu.be/5ZI8idIDL_A?si=UHj-O3PGG58AyQxF&amp;t=6396" target="_blank">Lucy

Then she reflected on the membership growth––Crossref is now made up of
21,000 organizations from 160 countries. We reviewed our 2024 year-end
financial forecast. As we’re bouncing back from COVID-19, our travel
expenses have grown this year, and so have the fees for cloud services
hosting. These are all as planned and happen in the context of healthy
growth, including that from adoption and increased usage of paid
services. We’re in a healthy financial position as membership revenue
and usage fees, like content registration and Similarity Check document
checking fees, continue to grow from the previous year.

<p>
Thank you to everyone who joined us for Crossref2024. This year’s
