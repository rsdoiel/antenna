According to regulatory filings in China, EV automaker
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/xpeng-motors/">XPeng Motors</a> is
planning upgrades to at least two current models. The filings detail
facelifts to the XPeng G6 and G9 SUVs and hint at the automaker’s
strategy of moving on from LiDAR sensors in favor of pure vision
cameras, similar to Tesla.

I bought myself a brand-spankin’ new boat</a> as a treat. Don’t get me
wrong, I’m still on an independent journalist’s salary here though, so
when I say that I had “boat money”, I mean I scraped together enough to
buy a $1,000 electric boat directly from China. It’s now been two years
since that Alibaba delivery, so let’s see how it’s held up and what it
looks like now.

It’s been a four-plus-year journey for Gravity –

Gravity’s development closely, itching to get behind the wheel of a
full-fledged production version to test drive – and that day has finally
come, my friends. Last week, I took a trip to Lucid’s design studio,
where I had my most intimate encounter with the Gravity SUV to date,
including a brief but informative test drive around the Bay Area. There,
I also learned that the official range of the Lucid Gravity is an
impressive 450 miles. Check out images and a video of my experience

to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.

<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price

great holiday deals on a new e-bike! And just like

It’s been a week since the most politically-charged Thanksgiving week in
four years, and the results are in: people are buying more EVs, and
they’re not afraid to hit the road in their new, battery-powered
conveyances. The automotive and EV charging industry analysts report
that DC fast charging sessions were up nearly 50% compared to the same
week last year.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of December 2024. It’s the last chance to grab some
great holiday deals on a new e-bike! And just like
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/">
ultra-competitive e-bike selling year</a> last year, 2024 has turned
into a year of impressive e-bike sales not to be missed. So check out
the awesome e-bikes below, any one of which could become your next
electric bike.

<p>
Nikola stock sinks to a 52-week low, a NHTSA complaint claiming the fuel
cell shuts down unpredictably, and one of hydrogen’s early adopters
remains unconvinced. Is it time for Nikola to throw in the towel on
hydrogen?
