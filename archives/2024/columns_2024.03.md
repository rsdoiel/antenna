## 10 print chr$(205.5 + rnd(1));:goto 10 in JavaScript

date: 2024-01-19, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

Forget about the Vision Pro, or whatever Samsung just brought out, we all know that the pinnacle of computing fun has been released in 1982 in the form of the Commodore 64. One of the coolest things you could show people when writing BASIC on it was the following one-liner: 10 print chr$(205.5 + rnd(1));:goto [&#8230;]

## Speaking to the CIA’s Creative Writing Group

date: 2024-01-19, updated: 2024-01-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p><a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2024/01/09/invisible-ink-at-the-cias-creative-writing-group/">This</a> is a fascinating story.</p>
<blockquote><p>Last spring, a friend of a friend visited my office and invited me to Langley to speak to Invisible Ink, the CIA&#8217;s creative writing group.</p>
<p>I asked Vivian (not her real name) what she wanted me to talk about.</p>
<p>She said that the topic of the talk was entirely up to me.</p>
<p>I asked what level the writers in the group were.</p>
<p>She said the group had writers of all levels.</p>
<p>I asked what the speaking fee was.</p>
<p>She said that as far as she knew, there was no speaking fee.</p></blockquote>
<p>What I want to know is, why haven&#8217;t I been invited? There are nonfiction writers in that group...</p>

## Why is Boeing such a shitty corporation?

date: 2024-01-18, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, My friend Harold Meyerson just wrote this for The American Prospect, and it&#8217;s so good and timely that I wanted to share it with you. In the wake of the midair blowout of a door on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 earlier this month, the lead that Airbus has taken over Boeing in the manufacture and sales of the world&#8217;s commercial aircraft has, not surprisingly, grown.

## A Lesson Learned

date: 2024-01-18, from: David Rosenthal's blog

You know how backups work great until you really need them? Below the fold, a lesson learned from my recent example of this phenomenon.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
A long time ago I was feeling rich, so I spent nearly $2000 on  one of the first-generation Mac Airs.  This led to me travelling with a <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/a-note-of-thanks.html">laptop I could afford to lose</a> instead. I loved the Air for all sorts of reasons but one of its important tasks was to back up my iPhone every day. And, of course, being something of an expert on preserving digital information, then back up the Air to an external USB hard disk using Time Machine. <a href="https://www.lockss.org">Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe</a>.<br />
<br />
In the end I had to upgrade to a more recent M1 Air, not because the old one stopped working, but simply because the USB ports stoppped working, so it could no longer backup the iPhone or update the Time Machine disk. The new Air was impressively fast and had two USB-C ports, which it used both for data and for power. I continued to back up the iPhone and the Air daily<br />
<br />
Fast forward to last month. The new Air's USB-C ports had been a bit flaky for a while, but now one failed. It wouldn't transfer data or power. A few days later the other port stopped transferring power, leaving me with no way to charge it. It was about 85% charged, so I powered it off.<br />
<br />
I thought "I'm OK, I have yesterday's Time Machine so I can get a new M2 Air and initialize it from the disk". So I ordered a new one and, as soon as it was delivered, plugged in the Time Machine disk and fired up the Migration Assistant. It asked me what disk it should use. I wasn't able to select the Time Machine disk because, to my surprise, the Air couldn't see it. Plugging the disk into my Linux desktop revealed that in the couple of weeks since the day before the M1 Air failed, the Time Machine disk had died.<br />
<br />
At this point I remembered that when I powered it off, the M1 Air still had a USB-C port that transferred data, even if it didn't work for power. There were two ways to initialize the M2 Air using the remaining battery, either create a new Time Machine disk using the one USB-C port that transferred data, or via Bluetooth. I found a USB-C external SSD, which I figured would use less power, powered up the M1 Air, plugged in the drive, started a Time Machine backup, and crossed my fingers.<br />
<br />
After a long, agonizing wait the backup finished with still quite a lot of battery left, so I powered off the M1 Air and used the disk to initialize the M2 Air. Apple's Migration Assistant worked flawlessly, and I relaxed. The best thing about the M2 Air is that Apple went back to powering it with MagSafe! Their fragile USB hardware could no longer prevent the machine charging.<br />
<br />
So the lesson was that I needed to have <i>two</i> Time Machine disks and use them alternately, so even if the most recent one failed I would have a backup only one day older.<br />
<br />
The next problem came when I plugged my iPhone into the M2 Air to back it up. I got "unknown error 7014". Google had no trace of "unknown error 7014" so, baffled, I made an appointment with the "Genius" at Apple's Palo Alto store. In the faint hope that the M1 Air could be fixed, I took both Airs and the iPhone with me.<br />
<br />
The Genius was very good. He rapidly figured out that:<br />
<ul>
<li>"unknown error 7014" was caused by the fact that, despite its having been delivered a few days earlier, the M2 Air's operating system was out-of-date. A software update overnight fixed the problem.</li>
<li>He confirmed that the M1 Air's USB-C ports had failed and, to my surprise, explained that the ports were on a daughter-board that could be replaced. It was a $15 part and $90 in labor, and completed overnight.</li>
</ul>
So now I can travel with a Mac Air.<br />
<br />

## I love logos

## Canadian Citizen Gets Phone Back from Police

date: 2024-01-18, updated: 2024-01-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>After 175 million failed password guesses, a <a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/police-must-return-phones-after-175-million-passcode-guesses-judge-says">judge rules</a> that the Canadian police must return a suspect&#8217;s phone.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Judge] Carter said the investigation can continue without the phones, and he noted that Ottawa police have made a formal request to obtain more data from Google.</p>
<p>&#8220;This strikes me as a potentially more fruitful avenue of investigation than using brute force to enter the phones,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>

## Evangelicals for Trump? It's Not About Religion

date: 2024-01-18, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Right after his victory in Iowa, where he received 53% of the evangelical and born-again Christian vote, Donald Trump traveled to New York to plead his case &#8212; literally. He was in federal court today, where he&#8217;ll soon find out how much he&#8217;ll have to pay for defaming a woman he&#8217;s also been found liable for sexually abusing. You may want to think about that for a moment. And let us remember it&#8217;s only January. There are more trials to come starring the leading GOP presidential candidate.

## Code Written with AI Assistants Is Less Secure

date: 2024-01-17, updated: 2024-01-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI&#8217;s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants&#8217; language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future...</p></blockquote>

date: 2024-01-17, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Often lost in the gamesmanship of border politics are details of those who tragically die trying to get to this country. In 2022, the most recent year for which records are available, nearly 700 people perished or disappeared trying to come to the United States. The International Organization for Migration says this is the deadliest land route for migrants worldwide.

## Why Trump ran away with Iowa

date: 2024-01-16, from: Robert Reich's blog

Friends, The mainstream media still don&#8217;t get it. This morning&#8217;s New York Times tried to describe it and utterly failed: &#8220;Donald J. Trump&#8217;s decisive victory in Iowa revealed a new depth to the reservoir of devotion inside his party. For eight years, he has nurtured a relationship with his supporters with little precedent in politics. He validates them, he entertains them, he speaks for them and he uses them for his political and legal advantage.

## Vision Pro’s Long Shadow Over A Boring CES 2024

CES 2024, unlike its predecessors, lacked the usual impact&#160;because&#160;tech companies now&#160;prefer&#160;their own events for product releases.&#160;This&#160;was an in-between year, and no one knew what to build, or whom to copy. As is usually the case, the looming shadow of Apple, along with the launch of its Vision Pro device, only highlighted the fact that this &#8230;
