Eventually it stretched 430 miles to Brindisi &#8212; gateway to the East &#8212; where Roman ships sailed for Greece and Egypt.</p>

## OPINION ǀ To secure peace in the Indo-Pacific, include Taiwan in the UN system

date: 2024-09-11, updated: 2024-09-12, from: Marianas Variety

TAIWAN is an indispensable partner in global supply chains, producing more than 90 % of the world’s high-end semiconductors and a significant portion of the advanced chips that are driving the AI revolution. Moreover, half of the world’s seaborne trade passes through the Taiwan Strait, making it a key international waterway. Yet even though large parts of the world — and billions of people — have enjoyed great prosperity thanks to the peace and stability that prevails across the strait, the People’s Republic of China continues to intensify its aggressive actions against Taiwan. Beijing’s attempts to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and expand authoritarianism throughout the Indo-Pacific region are a profound threat to peace and security all around the world.
