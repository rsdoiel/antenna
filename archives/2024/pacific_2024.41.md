## Heavy strikes shake Beirut as Israel expands Lebanon campaign

date: 2024-10-06, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>BEIRUT (Reuters) &#8212; Massive consecutive strikes hit Beirut&#8217;s southern suburbs from late Saturday into Sunday, Reuters eyewitnesses said, sending booms across the city and sparking flashes of red and white for nearly 30 minutes visible from several kilometers away. The strikes came after days of bombing by Israel of Beirut suburbs considered strongholds for Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, killing its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor. A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Hashem Safieddine, the potential successor, had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city&#8217;s international airport that was reported to have targeted him. The Israeli military said it eliminated Nasrallah in a strike on the group&#8217;s central command headquarters in Beirut on Sept. 27. Hezbollah confirmed he had been killed.</p>
