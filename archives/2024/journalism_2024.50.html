<p>Ten years ago, in Vancouver’s oldest office building, a few

<p>When Fox News pushed back on the lies that the U.S. presidential
election in 2020 was “stolen,” viewers flocked to far-right outlets like

<p>This past year, higher education has weathered significant shifts

<p>The Podglomerate recently brought together some of the brightest

<p>In my Nieman Lab prediction for 2023, I expected to see a rise in
antitrust news. It has indeed been a packed two years for reporters in
this beat, often involving market regulation and consumer protection
stories. Google faced three monopoly trials, with one of them poised to

<p>For many commentators, the 2024 election drove home the power of the
ever-evolving right-wing media ecosystem. There seems to be something
about the parasocial bonds that people build with media personalities
who they spend a lot of time with, and who offer stories to make sense

<p>When public media makes the news these days, it’s usually in the form
of a negative headline. Accusations of liberal bias have made
organizations like PBS and NPR the target of right-wing efforts to

<p>Have you been on social media lately? Most Americans spend a great

became mainstream, and likely even before that, journalists have spent
time on multiple platforms disseminating news and finding sources. But

<p>From the early 2010s until now, our industry saw the rise of what

<p>With the dizzying array of content creators, influencers, podcasters,
