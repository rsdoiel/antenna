(SHS) — Saipan Humane Society is urging the community to take steps in preventing animal cruelty following several recent cases of extreme neglect. One case involved Gouda, a Pit Bull mix who was left behind by an owner who moved off-island. She was found by a Good Samaritan starving and in desperate need of medical attention. Fortunately, the Saipan Dog Control Program staff were able to rescue her. Gouda captured the heart of Saipan Humane Society staff, and is now recovering at their clinic. She will soon be available for adoption.
