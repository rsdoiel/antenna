## Additional Water Restrictions Implemented at the South Rim-Dec. 2024

date: 2024-12-06, from: Press Releases

Effective immediately, the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park will begin phasing into greater water restrictions and conservation measures due to a new break in the Transcanyon Waterline. Until park staff repair the break and water in storage tanks reaches sustainable levels, the park will remain in conservation mode. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/additional-water-conservation-measures-south-rim-december-2024.htm
