Augur 6.2
</p>
<p>
Several stories in Augur issue 6.2 draw on vari­ous traditions and fairy
tales for inspiration. In “<strong>Moon-Eaters &amp; Monsoons</strong>”
by Rachel Evange­line Chiong, twin brothers Amihan and Hagbat set out to
determine what is ailing one of their realm’s gods. They haven’t spoken
in years, and the journey is fraught, their failure to listen to and
understand each other putting both of them in danger. “

<p>
After many years writing short stories and essays, Debbie Urbanski has
published her first novel, After World, about AI at the end of
humanity's physical presence on Earth.
</p>
<p>
The description of <em>After World</em> sounds chilling: "Faced with
uncontrolled and accelerating environmental collapse, humanity asks an
artificial intelligence to find a solution. Its answer is simple: remove
humans from the ecosystem." But it is more than just a post-apocalyptic
novel; it is "the story of an Artificial Intelligence tasked with
writing a novel—only for it to fall in love with the novel’s subject,
Sen, the last human on Earth."
</p>
<p>
While this is clearly a post-apocalyptic novel, mostly about AI, parts
of it feel like nature writing. Debbie explained, "I spent a lot of time
on the nature descriptions, I am surrounded by guidebooks about birds
and trees and plants. I was really interested in the idea that if humans
go away, that the world would be okay. There'd be a lot of other losses,
but especially from an AI perspective, it might be that the easiest way
to save the planet is having our physical bodies removed."
</p>
<p>
Often when people talk about "saving the planet," they really mean
saving humanity. But, said Debbie, "the end of the world often means the
end of us. So some people say my novel's about the end of the world, but
it's really not. It's about the end of humanity's physical presence on
Earth."
</p>
<p>
This sort of subject for a novel can be bleak, but Debbie pointed out
that "I always point that I do find it hopeful that the world is still
around. I don't think humans are necessarily exceptional, or more
important than other species. So there is the idea in the book that
we're one species, and we could save millions of species. I don't think
we should disappear, but I do think it's an interesting thought
experiment to get out of our heads and value other parts of the world."
</p>
<p>
AI is the main theme of the book, and Debbie didn't just jump on the AI
bandwagon when the world heard about GPT and other tools. Back in 2019,
when she had written a first draft, "My first agent thought my book was
too fragmented, and thought there needed to be a cohesive narrator. We
were brainstorming, all humans are gone; who could tell our story? AI
was floating around, I don't think anyone who wasn't involved in tech
thought it would be happening so quickly."
</p>
<p>
Since Debbie's novel focuses on AI, I used GPT-4 to come up with some
questions for our interview. These questions were quite pertinent. for
example, I asked, "The concept of documenting the end of humanity is a
poignant one. What do you believe is the importance of storytelling and
record keeping in the face of extinction?"
</p>
<p>
Debbie replied, "That's really what my book is about. The AI Narrator
uses that as a way to fall in love or care deeply for Sen, the last
human on Earth. So it's a way for the AI narrator to understand humanity
by learning to tell a story."
</p>
<p>
Debbie used Scrivener to write <em>After World</em>, after having worked
on short stories for a long time. "I really love Scrivener. And I
recommend it to writers whenever I can. I don't think it influences how
I write but it kind of captures how I write; it's a perfect fit for how
I write. I love it."
</p>
<p>
Going from a short story collection to a novel was easy. "When I was
working on the short story collection, I found it so useful to be able
to move stuff around. So that seemed a really natural fit."
</p>
<p>
Debbie's experience getting from manuscript to publication was complex.
She went through multiple agents and multiple editors. "With the novel,
because it had been through so many revisions, I kept them all in a
project, but I had different folders for each one. So it was really easy
for me to compare revisions. And I use the split screen a lot. My novel
has braided narratives, so there's different threads going through the
novel. And there is a cool feature, I discovered towards the end, called
Focus Mode, where you could look at just a line, a sentence, or a
paragraph all at once. And that was mind-blowing, I did it sentence by
sentence, but it really let me stop and think do I like the words of the
sentence?"
</p>
<p>
Debbie shared
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkmedePgF2h" target="_blank">a
screen capture of her Scrivener project on Instagram</a>, showing how
complex it was, and appreciates how "I feel like I keep discovering
things about Scrivener."

In Nightmare #133, I found “<strong>The Sound of Children
Screaming</strong>” by <strong>Rachael K. Jones </strong>to be notable.
One of the most terrifying of modern horrors is the slaughter of school

It seems safe to say that the evergreen SF trope of a high-tech city or
culture besieged by low-tech outsiders or “barbarians” goes back at
