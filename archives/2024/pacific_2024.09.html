men, 16-year-old boy charged with sexually assaulting female minors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, updated: 2024-03-04, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>HAGÅTÑA (The Guam Daily Post) — Three men and a 16-year-old boy
charged as an adult were accused of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old
girl and a 13-year-old girl.Manuel Greg Arriola, 34, Patrick Robert
Duenas Arriola, 41, Norman Sablan Santos, 56, and Paul Aguero, 16, were
charged Friday in the Superior Court of Guam with first-degree criminal
sexual conduct as first-degree felonies.According to a magistrate’s
complaint, the male defendants’ charges stemmed from reports made to a
school employee at an elementary school on Feb. 1. An 11-year-old girl
and a 13-year-old girl accused the men of sexually assaulting them.The
11-year-old alleged Manuel Arriola had been touching her sexually since
she was in first grade. She also alleged Manuel Arriola took her to a
secluded area in the jungle near her Dededo residence, laid her down on
a piece of flat plywood and raped her. Manuel Arriola also allegedly
raped the minor on a different occasion at her Dededo residence,
according to the complaint.The 13-year-old also accused Manuel Arriola
of raping her at a Dededo residence.According to the complaint, Patrick
Arriola was accused by the 11-year-old girl of touching her sexually and
raping her inside a van.The 13-year-old reported Patrick Arriola groped
her on numerous occasions, but on one occasion, Patrick Arriola
allegedly “bribed (the 13-year-old girl) to have sex with him by
offering her a vape,” the complaint stated.Santos allegedly sexually
touched the 11-year-old girl starting when she was in the fourth grade,
and also allegedly raped her on the living room floor of her Dededo
residence.The 13-year-old girl accused Aguero of groping her on at least
one occasion, while the 11-year-old girl reported Aguero had sexual
intercourse with her in the bedroom of a Dededo residence and also on
top of a broken table outside the Dededo residence, the complaint
stated.Another female, age 18, also accused Manuel Arriola of raping
her.According to the complaint, another male minor was interviewed and
arrested after telling police that he did “touch a private part of one
of the females.”Santos, when interviewed by officers with the Guam
Police Department, allegedly admitted to touching the 11-year-old’s
private area, the complaint stated.Manuel Arriola was charged with three
counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, Patrick Arriola was
charged with two counts, and Santos and Aguero were charged with one
count each.</p>

<h2 id="dededo-pool-opens-after-4-years">Dededo Pool opens after 4
years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, updated: 2024-03-04, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>HAGÅTÑA (The Guam Daily Post) — Escape the heat and take a dip in the
Dededo Pool, now reopened with free admission until the end of April.“We
are opening it because we have so many young people here that want to be
able to not just go into the pool but to learn to swim,” Angel Sablan,
Department of Parks and Recreation acting director, said Saturday during
the pool’s reopening ceremony.People young and old attended the
ribbon-cutting event on Saturday to celebrate the reopening of the
Dededo Pool after 4 years of closure for maintenance and renovation.The
Dededo Pool first closed from 2017 to 2019 and then shut down in 2020
following complaints about health and safety, according to Post
files.Sablan said he also has plans for the Dededo Sports Complex, which
includes the reopened pool.“One of my intentions is to make this area a
jewel, not just for Dededo (and) the people of Northern Guam, but for
all people. We have the Guam Football Association to my left, we have
the Guam Tennis Center to my right,” Sablan said.The sports complex also
includes baseball fields and a refurbished gym.“This place is going to
be buzzing with activity. We are going to have that walkway that goes
around his entire facility lit up, and we are working with the Guam
Energy Office to put those solar lights in to save us on utilities,”
Sablan said.The occasion was celebrated with an executive order in which
Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero provided two months of free admission to the pool
until April 30.Admission for senior citizens is free. General admission
is $2.The design for the Hagatña pool was completed as of Friday, Sablan
said, and a groundbreaking ceremony is planned for that facility in
August.</p>
