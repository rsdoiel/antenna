## The podcast-only feed, part 1

date: 2024-06-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'm getting my podcast-only feed for Scripting News ready. </p>
<p>It's going to be an Apple-compliant podcast feed. </p>
<p>Of course when it came time to do the logo I went to my reasonably-priced graphics consultant, ChatGPT. It came breathtakingly close on the first attempt, but it repeated part of the story. Every time I asked it to fix a problem, it created another problem, and the image brightness was reduced, not just in terms of pixels but also the creativity of the image. Of course it isn't really creative. I know. Yadda yadda. </p>
<p>Finally I got something that I could live with that I liked but was imperfect. I decided that since the motto of my blog is "It's even worse than it appears" that an obvious imperfection is totally consistent with the philosophy, and we move onward. As they say, still diggin!</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/25/scriptingNewsInlineImageVersion.png"></center>It's even worse than *@#) appears.</div></p>
<p>The prompt for the image: "I'm sure you're aware of my blog, Scripting News, scripting.com. I am doing a new podcast feed for the blog. This feed is designed to get through Apple's submission process so it can be listed in their podcast database. One of the requirements is a 3000 by 3000 image that serves as a logo for the podcast. I need something simple and bold that says 'Scripting News podcast' and then 'With Dave Winer and friends' and 'It's even worse than it appears.' On a background of corn fields in Iowa viewed from the air."</p>

## Briefly on Julian Assange

date: 2024-06-25, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>So, Viv and I were in the car this morning when we heard about the Assange plea deal.</p>
<p>Viv: omg, finally! I only hope he&rsquo;ll now give up hacking 😔<br>
Me: Hmm, or maybe he should give up non-consensual sex. That&rsquo;s where he went wrong, isn&rsquo;t it?<br>
Viv: &hellip;true</p>
<p>I mean, fuck. I know this prosecution has been politically motivated, purely to punish him for his role exposing Western war crimes. The charges he&rsquo;s accepted a plea deal over are the US &ldquo;espionage&rdquo; ones, after all, not the Swedish sexual assault ones, which were dropped long ago. And I don&rsquo;t support politically-motivated prosecutions of people who expose war crimes. But I&rsquo;ve also never been comfortable with any kind of personalised &ldquo;I support Assange&rdquo; sentiment, as if he were a righteous martyr, rather than &ldquo;I support exposing those who commit war crimes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Back in my student activist days, I once got stuck doing a stall where we were trying to get signatures on a petition calling for Assange&rsquo;s charges to be dropped (and this was back when they were the sexual assault charges, not the espionage ones). The organiser of the stall knew full well the attitude I was going to take to this, so he gave me a stack of leaflets and told me to hand them out around Campus Centre. I took the stack, went upstairs, dropped them all straight in the bin, then chilled out in the cafeteria for an hour before reporting back. I think he knew that&rsquo;s what I was going to do, too, lol. I didn&rsquo;t get scolded for skipping out on nearly the whole stall, which I usually would&rsquo;ve been.</p>
<p>Anyway, Assange is married now, so maybe he has straightened himself out. I don&rsquo;t know. I think it&rsquo;s good there&rsquo;s a resolution at last to the political prosecution (although I would note, cynically, that so many years have passed that the &ldquo;deterrence&rdquo; objective has already been achieved, and the, uh, short-term memory of the political establishment means no one cares what happened during the War on Terror any more, anyway). But Assange himself is still an asshole.</p>

## Quick productivity tip: Renaming lots of files in MacOS Finder

date: 2024-06-24, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

When you select several files in Finder and choose &#8220;rename&#8221; from the context menu, you can batch rename them. You can search and replace text, add to beginning or end or even generate numbered file names. Sadly, there&#8217;s no Regular Expressions support. Check the screencast to see it in action:

## 2024-06-23 Adjudicating the difficulty

date: 2024-06-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-23-adjudicating-the-difficulty">2024-06-23 Adjudicating the difficulty</h1>

<p>I was listening in on an exchange between <a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social">@phf</a> and <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp">@kyonshi</a>. They were talking about <a href="Traveller">Traveller</a> and Peter noted that he didn&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;somewhat mysterious difficulty classes of some tests&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t like this, either! It&rsquo;s exhausting. I feel drained when I do it.</p>

<p>I started thinking about this for a while and maybe the following provides for an interesting way to talk about rules in role-playing games.</p>

<p>Note that the problem shows up in many places. For example, I don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;the ladder&rdquo; in <a href="Fudge">Fudge</a> and <a href="Fate">Fate</a> games where I as the referee need decide whether opponents are &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;very good&rdquo; at fighting the player characters. For me, this is the same problem, except it happens behind the screen. Player&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t know about this.</p>

<p>Using classic D&amp;D or similar rules and running a megadungeon is comparatively easy, because the monster hit dice are tied to dungeon levels. Once I know the dungeon level, I can pick appropriate monsters and their stats automatically determine &ldquo;the difficulty classes of some tests.&rdquo; This might be one of the reasons that makes it easier to run D&amp;D with self-made dungeons.</p>

<p>So this is the first solution to the problem of having to assign difficulties to rolls: The game can have a small number of actions that require a dice roll. Each roll has clear conditions of success. The referee doesn&rsquo;t have to assess the difficulty as soon as the situation is established. D&amp;D would be an example of this kind of game. You roll to hit, to do damage, to save, and all the target numbers are known once the monster is on the table. In classic D&amp;D, traps have only one difficulty setting so thieves only need to know a single number. Hidden doors are either concealed or secret. Those are the two difficult settings for finding the hidden door and thus the referee only needs to know two numbers (1-in-6 or 2-in-6). Of course it breaks down sometimes when a module tells you that a particular door is harder to find (&ldquo;1-in-8&rdquo;) or that a lock is harder to pick (&ldquo;add 20% to the check&rdquo;). But generally speaking, as a referee, very little thought is required. The trade-of is that characters don&rsquo;t have many &ldquo;skills&rdquo;. They have their attack rolls, their saves, the thieves skills, some other d6 abilities like opening doors and listening, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>As soon as skills are introduced, the situations in which dice can be rolled explodes. One way to solve the problem of having to decide the difficulty of every single roll is to a provide a long list of examples from which to extrapolate. I haven&rsquo;t played any game that does that well. Zweihänder provides seven example uses of the skill, one for each difficulty rating. That is amazing.</p>

<p>A game that has a single roll for every skill (great idea) but then provides a lot of help adjudicating the rolls in general isn&rsquo;t helping. I found this to be the case for the few Basic Role-Playing, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, Rolemaster and HARP games I tried. I didn&rsquo;t try many of them. I just checked HARP again and there are examples for some of the skills and not for others, so I&rsquo;d have to play it again to remember whether this was even a problem.</p>

<p>Perhaps one possible solution is to just ignore difficulties and to assume all skill rolls at the default difficulty to be appropriate for adventures. As far as I can remember, this is how we often played these games.</p>

<p>Mongoose Traveller isn&rsquo;t helping, either. There, the target number is always an eight. Almost all the modifiers appear to obvious and well explained, but with the Task Difficulty Dice Modifiers the &ldquo;somewhat mysterious difficulty classes of some tests&rdquo; is back.</p>

<p>Classic Traveller is worse it leans into the referee making up the roll. Sometimes an examples of a skill is provided (&ldquo;navigation expertise can be used as a DM of +1 per level on a throw to determine the needed information&rdquo;) but most of the time it&rsquo;s simply a description of where the skill might be applicable and it&rsquo;s up to the referee to call for an appropriate throw, if at all. At the very beginning, skills are explained as follows: &ldquo;The acquired skills table provides four basic types of results: characteristic alterations (such as +1 strength), weapons expertise (such as blade combat), transport skills (such as ATV), and basic skills (such as navigation).&rdquo; That is to say, sometimes the skill simply means that something can be done. The example that comes to mind is how to recover from serious wounds: &ldquo;Recovery is dependent on medical attention (a medical facility and an individual with medical-3 skill; recuperation to full strength without medical attention is not possible).&rdquo; The medic doesn&rsquo;t have to roll at all. Having the skill is all that counts.</p>

<p>This brings me to the last category: negotiation. This what I learned from Burning Wheel: Before a roll is made, players declare what they want and the referee determines the difficulty of the roll and explains the consequences of failure. Then players decide whether they want to make the roll. Implicitly, they can change their mind, declare a different goal and see whether they like the odds and consequences better. I like this a lot.</p>

<p>Of course, turning every skill roll into a negotiation can be tiresome. If people remember what the previous result of similar negotiations was, the system takes on aspects of case law. As soon as the people of the table realize that a similar situation was resolved using this or that, and there are no circumstances that warrant a change, then the negotiation is skipped.</p>

<p>Then again, a long lists of conditions and modifiers can also take on aspects of case law.</p>

<p>So perhaps this is what I think all these rules texts evolve into: Any rule system where referees set the difficulty imply a system where players can enter a short negotiation. In order to avoid future negotiations, the table remembers the outcomes and uses them as shortcuts for future situations.</p>

<p>Once you know this, the approach by some games to simply do a fixed difficulty roll such as 50% rate of success makes sense if you assume that there is some sort of negotiation and case law powering it all. Sometimes the penalty of failure is scorn and insults, sometimes it&rsquo;s death. It depends on the situation but there&rsquo;s always a way to negotiate for the two outcomes that seem acceptable to the table.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t found a perfect solution, for me. I like it both ways. A game like <a href="Halberds_and_Helmets">Halberts &amp; Helmets</a> is much like D&amp;D where as a game like <a href="Halberts">Halberts</a> is one where all effects outside of combat have to be negotiated but it&rsquo;s not as wild and free as Classic Traveller.</p>

## June 23, 2024

On Thursday, Moody&#8217;s Analytics, which evaluates risk, performance, and financial modeling, compared the economic promises of President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Authors Mark Zandi, Brendan LaCerda, and Justin Begley concluded that while a second Biden presidency would see cooling inflation and continued economic growth of 2.1%, a Trump presidency would be an economic disaster.

## The Name ‘Siddhartha’

date: 2024-06-24, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>Since Vivian was a teenager, apparently, it&rsquo;s been his long-held dream to name a son Siddhartha and call him Sid for short, so as to honour both his Hindu heritage <em>and</em> Syd Barrett, his rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll idol. Pretty much as soon as Viv told me this dream, I poured cold water on it. Honestly, I did not believe that &ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo; was a name that actual, real-life human beings are given. Vivian insisted it was, so after a few years of back-and-forth, I finally deigned to search the internet to see if I could find any actual, real-life human beings with this name. The result was that every single &ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo; I found was a French speaker (of Indian heritage) – professionals living in cities like Lyon, Geneva, Montreal&hellip; so of course I took this back to Vivian and said all accusatorily, &ldquo;You want to give our child a French name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This turns out to be a really good way to wind him up – I can say this, because he&rsquo;s compelled me to make the same argument repeatedly since – because he starts whining, &ldquo;Nooooo, it&rsquo;s an Indian name!&rdquo; and I tell him that random LinkedIn profiles on the internet don&rsquo;t lie, and our child is not getting a French name.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It&rsquo;s really funny how worked up he gets about it. Anyway.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;re actually <em>having</em> a child, of course, we&rsquo;re having all these discussions again, even though we don&rsquo;t know Baby&rsquo;s sex yet. &ldquo;Sid&rdquo; has been Viv&rsquo;s pet name for the growing creature in my belly, and I do often go along with it, although I also point out regularly that that&rsquo;s <em>never</em> going to be their actual name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he jokes, &ldquo;when you die in childbirth, there&rsquo;ll be no one to stop me putting whatever I want on the birth certificate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha-ha,&rdquo; I retort, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not gambling on those odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, we <em>have</em> started putting together an <em>actual</em> shortlist, consisting of names that are Indian in origin, but are either <em>also</em> English/Irish names <em>or</em>, at least, don&rsquo;t sound markedly foreign in English. This is what Viv said he really liked about the whole &ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo;/&ldquo;Sid&rdquo; thing, and I think <em>that&rsquo;s</em> a fair enough goal&hellip; just not the actual name &ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo;. Un­for­tun­ately, Viv&rsquo;s next favourite name isn&rsquo;t so much &ldquo;an Irish name&rdquo; as &ldquo;the Irish word for &lsquo;bread&rsquo;&rdquo;, but we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Actually, as far as <em>girls&rsquo;</em> names go there are a number of French-origin names I like – I&rsquo;m talking ones well-assimilated into English though – but regardless, I think I have to stand on my principles now.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

## ★ WWDC 2024: Apple Intelligence

date: 2024-06-23, updated: 2024-06-25, from: Daring Fireball

Apple is focusing on what it can do that no one else can on Apple devices, and not really even trying to compete against ChatGPT *et al.* for world-knowledge context. They’re focusing on unique differentiation, and eschewing commoditization.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/23/scriptingNewsAd.gif" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I'm going to start a new podcast-only feed, and <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/23/howRssStartedTheRealStory.m4a">this will be first episode</a>. 14 minutes. It tells the story of RSS as a remarkable coming-together of tech, news, publishing and blogging. The first burst came from Netscape and four leading web pubs, Salon, Red Herring Wired and Motley Fool. As a leading blogger and developer of blogging tools, I jumped on board as soon as I heard of it, as did the people at Blogger. RSS was an instant standard with a great installed base, and retained its simplicity. You have no idea how remarkable that is. It grew like a weed. An installed base developed. There was confusion for a couple of years, between 2000 and 2002, about what RSS was, but the market stayed with the format specified by Netscape in 1999. Then in 2002, at UserLand we did a deal with the NY Times to get their news flowing through RSS, and in the next year, the <i>entire news world supported RSS.</i> That's the story. You can write all about who did what in a background story, but the big story, the miracle, mostly remains untold. What matters is an open format took root and retained its simplicity. And it pays to understand why it was not a strong enough foundation to be successful, first because the vendors didn't work with each other, and then because Twitter made subscription one click, where it was ridiculous how hard it was to subscribe to a feed in RSS. We should learn from this, and not repeat the same mistakes, and of course until the real story is out there, we can't learn from it. This is a 14-minute podcast. I cut off the last five minutes because I got lost in the weeds. All of this is documented in the archive of this blog and the sites it points to. And if there's interest I'll happily talk about it in a future podcast.

## (Weekend Edition) Field Notes: June 23, 2024

On My Mind This past week, I devoted time to “personal maintenance,” undergoing the usual array of medical tests necessary to preempt potential health issues. Additionally, I faced a dreaded dental surgery — which, despite the use of lasers and sedatives, did not necessarily mean less pain or discomfort. As a result, my writing, reading, &#8230;

There's a new star in the kittyverse, <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/23/wordleKitty.png">Wordle Kitty</a>. I let her do my Wordle-play. Today, she was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2272846162922776&set=a.113966572144090&type=3&notif_id=1719149825702718&notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&ref=notif">feeling</a> a little under the weather so Wordle Kitty checked into the town urgent care center where they gave her some medicine which gave her the strength for a “splendid” performance at the days Wordle puzzle. So while she’s feeling a bit ill under it all is a feeling of splendor and the usual over the top cuteness! :-)

## Does personal AI require Big Compute?

date: 2024-06-23, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

I don&#8217;t think it does. Not for everything. We already have personal AI for autocomplete. Do we need Big Compute for a personal AI to tell us which pieces within our Amazon orders are in which line items in our Visa statements? (Different items in a shipment often appear inside different charges on a card.) [&#8230;]

## June 22, 2024 

date: 2024-06-23, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

This year my brother&#8217;s aluminum skiff had a stowaway. A mouse had clung tight to its perch in the bow eye during the trip from the boat&#8217;s winter berth in the front yard to the town landing, bouncing on a trailer. It continued to hold on as my brother and nephew launched the skiff and crossed the choppy harbor to a mooring.
