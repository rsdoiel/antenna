Baltimore Banner, turning two, celebrates a subscriber bump and a new
education hub</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>The Baltimore Banner celebrated its second birthday this week with a
“B” cake, balloons, and a pair of announcements. First up, the nonprofit
newsroom shared it now has 49,000 paid subscribers. Of those, 47,000 are
individual subscribers and 2,000 are institutional subscribers who have
activated their accounts. (Previously, The Banner included other group

news industry ready for another pivot to video?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago much of the news industry lost its head over
a supposed “pivot to video” after Facebook pushed live and other formats
with the promise of monetization to come. That didn’t work out so well
for publishers, many of whom had hired expensive video teams and found
they had to row…</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>It’s no secret that news publishers have struggled to make money and
sustain their businesses in the digital era. Ad revenue has been
siphoned away by Big Tech and money from print advertising has been in
continual decline. A solution to this problem is simple on the face of
it, but not so in practice:…</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-18, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO — In 2019, Mukhtar Ibrahim launched the nonprofit Sahan
Journal to cover Minnesota’s immigrants and communities of color. Almost
five years later, the outlet he established has become an inspiration
for other nonprofit news founders across the country. Sahan Journal has
grown from a one-man show to a staff of 20+, and from…</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>“News use across online platforms is fragmenting”: That’s one of the
findings from Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism
(RISJ) in its 2024 Digital News Report, out Monday. As the use of
Facebook for news declines, a number of other platforms — YouTube,
TikTok, WhatsApp — are picking up the slack, “with six networks now…</p>

strange history of white journalists trying to “become” Black</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>A peculiar desire seems to still haunt some white people: “I wish I
knew what it was like to be Black.” This wish is different from wanting
to cosplay the coolness of Blackness — mimicking style, aping music and
parroting vernacular. This is a presumptive, racially imaginative
desire, one that covets not just the rhythm…</p>
