<h1 id="2024-07-31-hashtags">2024-07-31 Hashtags</h1>

<p>I implemented <a href="oddmu/oddmu-hashtags.1">a new subcommand for Oddmu</a>.
I was mostly curious to see
whether Administration had alread overtaken role-playing games, that
is, RPG. I am happy to report that administration issues are still far
from the top of the list. <em>Homo ludens</em> is still winning out. 😄</p>

## The NYT is weird

date: 2024-07-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Someone in charge at the NYT needs to take a step back and view events, and the NYT role in those events, from the point of view of an ordinary non-NYT-employed citizen, bewildered at the enormous risks journalists are taking with the system of government of the United States. </p>
<p>In the context of who we are as a country, what the Repubs do and say is to be very mild about it "weird." What word would you prefer the Democrats use? Imagine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William Safire</a> were here, the great linguist columnist of the NYT, wrote that column. (Safire was a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ab14f5b9-2b55-406f-9b78-057313c03d63">Republican</a> btw.)</p>
<p>And to the Democrats, no matter what the NYT says, keep using the term. This is where you get to speak out about what they're doing over there, and how it's not journalism. One of the rare things you agree with Trump on. </p>
<p>Podcast: <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/31/theNYTIsWeird.m4a">3 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>PS: Safire went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science">Bronx Science</a>! I did not know that. (So did I.) I love the idea of writers who aren't scared of tech stuff. </p>
<p>PPS: Even Richard Nixon would think today's so-called Republicans were weird. </p>
<p>PPPS: The NYT is totally unmoored, a word I bet Safire would like. </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

People who get their sense of self-esteem from having procreated are placing a heavy burden on their children. What if the child doesn't live up to their expectations? How will they treat the child then! Creating a new human is not an accomplishment. Treating that new life as a full person starting at birth, and through their whole life, <i>that's</i> an accomplishment. For a man to father a child just means they have a functioning reproductive system. It's not anything to be proud or to expect to be rewarded or respected for.

## Intermittent Social media fasting 

date: 2024-07-31, from: Om Malik blog

As a diabetic, my life is a constant&#160;balance&#160;between hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic levels—and proper food consumption is&#160;key&#160;to&#160;maintaining&#160;steady&#160;blood&#160;sugar levels. Work, travel and access to&#160;the right kinds&#160;of&#160;food determine&#160;how&#160;successfully&#160;I&#160;can&#160;keep my sugar levels in my desired&#160;range.&#160; At&#160;the start of the pandemic lockdown, I decided to embrace intermittent fasting. Losing weight wasn’t the primary&#160;motive;&#160;instead, I wanted to bring some discipline&#160;to&#160;when and &#8230;

## Using personal weeknotes as a tool for attention

date: 2024-07-30, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Since leaving my day job two years ago, I&#8217;ve been writing personal weeknotes. In short: once a week, I publish on my blog a set of notes about what I did the past week. I believe weeknotes started inside organizations (here&#8217;s a good primer on professional weeknotes), but I appreciate using the weekly checkpoint as [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

The <a href="https://this.how/podcast0/">Podcast0</a> project is teaching me how to read the archive of my own blog. Until now I had not carefully read the story I tell on my blog more than a few days after it happened. Here's I'm learning to reconstruct the summer of 2004, one of the most creative periods of my life, at least that's viewable in such a public and preserved way. Am I the first to do this for any blog? If you know of an example of historic research done using the archive of a blog, please send me a note. I'd love to learn about what you learned! Also because of its longevity and continuity, I offer <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html">this blog</a> as some kind of record of what happened in the last 30 years or so. I see it as a complete work of writing, a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco">fresco</a> writing.

I said on <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html">Thursday</a> that Biden's speech last Wednesday had the potential to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address">Gettysburg</a> address, if it the United States turns back toward democracy and government of the people, by the people and for the people. Biden has the potential of being as great a president as Lincoln. Let that settle in for a moment. I get goosebumps when I think about it. If he hadn't taken that stand, he could have become known as the US equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II#Life_in_exile">Kaiser Wilhelm</a>.

## Childless vs childful

date: 2024-07-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Notes accumulated during the day -- not in any particular order. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>I keep a solid line between my personal life and blogging, learned the hard way. When I started blogging in 1994, I didn't have such a solid line, and found that I couldn't have a personal life if I made it public. But now I want to reveal something. I am "childless" which is a term I find pretty insulting, as if being child<i>ful</i> is the only normal state of being. </p>
<p>I find, in general childful people are not great friends or family members. They want special privileges and they often get them. If childful vs childless is going to be an issue in this campaign, I say -- bring it on. We should have this discussion. </p>
<p>I'm often tempted to offer advice to the parents, but I won't offer it unless asked, except this. If you have children, there's a good chance one or more of them will not have children, and you should love them the same, and provide models of acceptance while they're growing up, by bringing childless people into your home, so the kids know that this is one of the legitimate choices in life, offering proof that you won't love them any less if they go down that path. And here's the hard part, imho, for people with children -- <i>keep that promise. </i></p>
<p>BTW, people say it's seflish to not have children, but I don't agree, in fact I think it's the opposite. There was a point in human evolution where the struggle to survive for our species was fed by procreation, but some time in the last hundred years we crossed a line, where increasing human population worked against species survival. Our understanding of the meaning of procreating, like so much else about our civilization, has not yet caught up with the current reality. </p>

## Fixing curl install failures with Ansible on Red Hat-derivative OSes

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Over the past few months, I've noticed some of my automation failing on Red Hat-derivative OSes like Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux. The reason for this has to do with the inclusion of a <code>curl-minimal</code> package in some distros, which conflicts with <code>curl</code> if you try installing the full package.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the fix for this is a little strange, and so only ends up in Ansible's <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/dnf_module.html">dnf</a> module, not in the more cross-compatible <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_module.html">package</a> module.</p>

## Hacking Pi firmware to get the fastest overclock

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Hacking Pi firmware to get the fastest overclock</span>

<p>Since boosting my Pi 5 from the default 2.4 GHz clock to <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-5-can-overclock-314-ghz">3.14 GHz on Pi Day</a>, I've wanted to go faster. Especially since many other users have topped my Geekbench scores since then :)</p>

<p>In March, Raspberry Pi introduced new firmware that unlocked frequencies above 3,000 MHz for overclocking. This summer, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/numa-emulation-speeds-pi-5-and-other-improvements">NUMA Emulation patches</a> boosted performance another 5-10% through memory access optimizations.</p>

<p>But even with a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/overclocking/comments/3d1y4j/comment/ct1sk4e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">golden sample</a> Pi 5, I haven't seen anybody go much beyond 3.1 or 3.2 GHz. The problem seemed to be power supply—the Pi's firmware limits the SoC to a maximum of 1.000V.</p></div>

I think we've done enough segregation for one campaign, now please please I beg you, let's <i>work together,</i> regardless of labels, to save the country we all love. I have a philosophy, I don't care how you got to the party, if you took a subway, walked, rode a bike, or came by Uber or a Cadillac limousine. We all got here, and have a common purpose, so lets all love each other and party our way to victory. Regardless of race, creed, color or whatever.

## Providing Security Updates to Automobile Software

<p>Auto manufacturers are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cars-are-now-rolling-computers-so-how-long-will-they-get-updates-automakers-cant-say/">just starting to realize</a> the problems of supporting the software in older models:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s phones are able to receive updates six to eight years after their purchase date. Samsung and Google provide Android OS updates and security updates for seven years. Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">halts servicing</a> products seven years after they stop selling them.</p>

## Learning your own learning process

I love Nick Zentner&#8217;s videos because he&#8217;s so good at describing his thinking, especially what he is looking at and why. He pulls in reference resources, learning from others even as he makes that learning his own. Borrowing someone else&#8217;s notes really doesn&#8217;t help because it&#8217;s the taking of the notes that matters &#8212; we [&#8230;]

I bought an iPhone that I now don't need, and it's arriving today via FedEx. I wanted to know whether I should just refuse delivery, or accept it and then return it. Obviously it's easier for me to refuse. I asked ChatGPT and it gave me a detailed reply. Apple's chatbot saw it as a "technical" question and wasn't prepared to help. Sales support is one of those applications where cost is totally justified. A human helper would cost a lot more I imagine than a LLM chat system. I tried calling 1-800-CALL-APPLE and talked to a human who was very nice, but couldn't find anything in her manual about refusing delivery.

## New Research in Detecting AI-Generated Videos

<blockquote><p>The new tool the research project is unleashing on deepfakes, called &#8220;MISLnet&#8221;, evolved from years of data derived from detecting fake images and video with tools that spot changes made to digital video or images. These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames.</p>
<p>Such tools work because a digital camera&#8217;s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-07-27 Tired of programming

date: 2024-07-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-27-tired-of-programming">2024-07-27 Tired of programming</h1>

<p>My summer break has begun, and I am tired.</p>

<p>I wanted to work on some sort of editor.
I contributed some lines to Anvil, an Acme-inspired editor, and then I figured I should go back to text editing because writing acceptable GUI editing is just sooo much effort. So now I’m trying to use ed again…
I&rsquo;m experimenting with using <code>rlwrap</code> around <code>ed</code> and it&rsquo;s not so bad if you&rsquo;re just writing, like writing an email.
But really writing, organizing, moving things around… it really doesn&rsquo;t work all that well.
I had imagined a sort of conversational UI – which I guess ed has? – if ed is your grumpiest of companions! – and I guess I was looking at my Oddmu site generator and Markdown file server and thinking: what sort of editor would I need to maintain this?
What sort of minimal SVG editing capabilities would be nice to have? That was my starting point.
Then I dropped the graphics because writing that seemed like a pain.
Then I started thinking about the GUI components: using fonts with Harfbuzz, Unicode support, hyphenation (per language), spell-checking (per language), and on and on.
It&rsquo;s too much.</p>

<p>But where does that leave me? Adding a few features to ed?
Am I in fact reinventing vi, badly?</p>

<p><a href="2024-06-01-editor">2024-06-01 Fonts are important</a>,
<a href="2024-06-13-anvil">2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple cursors</a>,
<a href="2024-07-24-ed">2024-07-24 My ed, wondering</a></p>

<p>I wanted to work on a local Gridmapper variant, written in Common Lisp.
I already have a working prototype in Common Lisp and I already have a Javascript web application in production.
This is a single file, a stand-alone SVG+Javascript web application. It works online and offline.
Thus, my entire tinkering with CL right now has as its goal to produce a native application that would work without a browser.</p>

<p>Whenever I start working on native GUI stuff, like working with SDL2 or Cairo or similar libraries, my eyes start bleeding.
Vanilla JS and the browser really is a pretty nice virtual machine available to many of us.
Having spent a day trying to get SDL2, SDL2 gfx and Cairo sorted out for this Common Lisp app I&rsquo;m looking at really makes me want to drop it all for another two years and focus on JavaScript instead.
It can&rsquo;t be that bad! Javascript gives me the DOM and SVG and all that, practically for free…</p>

<p>And three different bindings Common Lisp bindings for SDL2 in various states of neglect is draining.
Switching from one to the other is tricky since the first one had many idiomatic helpers functions that the other is lacking.
But the first one is lacking a gfx port.
Then again, I guess I can add circle drawing using lines.</p>

<p>Everything takes so long. So damn long.</p>

<p><a href="2022-07-20_Gridmapper_CL">2022-07-20 Gridmapper CL 5</a>, <a href="2024-07-24-gridmapper-local">2024-07-24 Gridmapper Local</a></p>

<p>A while ago I started collecting links with quotes instead of relying on browser bookmarks or third parties. I remember at one point my bookmarks were just HTML files generated by the browser. Good times! And there was Delicious, a service now defunct, I guess. So now I keep <a href="Bookmarks">bookmarks on this site</a>. It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>I wondered whether I should write a tool that monitors those pages, and when new items get added, a feed is updated.
Just a little program… it doesn&rsquo;t seem hard. So I gave it try.  I like documentation first, these days so I began with a man page for it. Good, good. Then I though that perhaps I should use the same Markdown parser as Oddmu uses.
So I needed to write this tool in Go. How hard can it be?
It&rsquo;s a bit harder than writing it in Perl.
Oh, and I needed to parse the RSS file, too.
Or use SQLite to store data.
It keeps getting harder.</p>

<p>Well, I spent some time on it and now I&rsquo;m tired again.
This too, takes too long!</p>

<p>I feel defeated. Am I too impatient?</p>

<p>I should read a book.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-07-27</strong>. In an attempt to overcome my sadness, I decided to spice up my shell life…</p>

<pre><code># hipster shell
alias ls='echo Using exa instead;exa'
alias du='echo Using dust instead;dust'
alias top='echo Using htop instead;htop'
alias find='echo Using fd instead;fd'
alias grep='echo Using rg instead;rg'
alias files='echo Using yazi instead;yazi'
alias cal='echo Using khal instead;khal'
alias screenshot='grimshot'
alias copy='wl-copy'
alias paste='wl-paste'
</code></pre>

<p>I set up <code>khal</code> and <code>khard</code> which required me to set up <code>vdirsyncer</code> to sync the remote calendars (and contacts) to local copies. This is also good for backup, I guess.</p>

<p>Let me know if you know of other such tools.</p>

<p><strong>2024-07-29</strong>. I overcame my block and wrote the bookmarks-to-feed program in Perl: <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bookmark-feed.git">bookmark-feed</a>. 🔖 🤝 <img loading="lazy" src="/pics/rss.svg" alt="RSS" /></p>

<p>I installed a daily cron job:</p>

<pre><code>47  23  *  *   *     /usr/bin/nice /home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/bookmark-feed /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*_Bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*-bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/bookmarks.rss
</code></pre>

<p>The readable variant is this: <code>bookmark-feed markdown-files… feed-file</code>.
The files it looks at once a day are my <a href="Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>.
The feed it generates is <a href="/wiki/bookmarks.rss">bookmarks.rss</a>.
The database it uses is <a href="/wiki/bookmarks.db">bookmarks.db</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do expiration from the database but uses only the last 40 items for the feed.</p>

<p>When populating the database, all I had was the timestamp of the Markdown pages, so the existing bookmarks are all relatively unsorted – they are sorted by the timestamp of the most recent addition to the whole category, which pretty weird.</p>

## MNT Pocket Reform progress

date: 2024-07-29, from: Jirka's blog

There have  been some  changes both  on the  hardware and  the software side. The hardware part was quite important yet simple: the current CPU module has  a WiFi chip without  any cooling. As the  CPU is relatively hod (at least for the ARM) the WiFi  part is hot, too - and it seems to work bad  when hot.  So the  quick fix is  to add  a small  thermal pad (about 2 mm thick) so the chip will be connected to the heatsink. The long-term solution would be to use a cooler CPU.

Now it isn't even one of the services I use that I can post to with my writing tool (those are Bluesky, Mastodon, WordPress). None of them are anything like the aggregator of people that Twitter was, and I can't even reach it from my writing tool. I really want to solve this problem, but I absolutely can't do this on my own. No time, patience, and it's not my job to do all that coding. As observed the other day, my time should be spent on writing tools for the web and directly related products. This is the kind of project that should be handled as an open source thing.
