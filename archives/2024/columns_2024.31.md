<p>I implemented <a href="oddmu/oddmu-hashtags.1">a new subcommand for Oddmu</a>.
I was mostly curious to see
whether Administration had alread overtaken role-playing games, that
is, RPG. I am happy to report that administration issues are still far
from the top of the list. <em>Homo ludens</em> is still winning out. üòÑ</p>

## More Cryptocurrency Gaslighting

date: 2024-08-01, from: David Rosenthal's blog

On 30<sup>th</sup> June Amy Castor and David Gerard reported that <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2024/06/30/sec-sues-consensys-over-metamask-swaps-and-staking/"><i>SEC sues Consensys over MetaMask Swaps and Staking</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The SEC is charging Consensys for unauthorized sales of securities through MetaMask Staking and for failure to register as a broker and a dealer while offering crypto trades and staking services through MetaMask Staking and Swaps. The SEC says that Consensys took $250 million in fees as an unregistered broker.<br />
<br />
MetaMask is Consensys‚Äô main money maker ‚Äî a popular browser-based wallet that also lets you stake ETH and buy and sell crypto via decentralized exchanges with ‚Äúswaps.‚Äù
</blockquote>
Consensys' defense strategy poses potentially serious problems for the concept of open source, because they are gaslighting about the software that is the basis for the SEC's complaint being open source. Were the court to (a) fall for their gaslighting but (b) agree with the SEC's complaint it could provide a basis for imposing liability on open source developers.<br />
<br />
I am afraid that the explanation for why this is so is necessarily rather long but I and others think that it needs to be understood. So stock up with supplies for the journey and follow me below the fold.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Before the House of Representatives Committee on House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion, William C. Hughes, Senior Counsel &amp; Director of Global Regulatory Matters for Consensys <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA21/20231115/116579/HHRG-118-BA21-Wstate-HughesB-20231115.pdf">testified thus</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Our firm develops and offers the most popular unhosted wallet software in digital assets, the MetaMask wallet. This offering is open source software that can be downloaded for free from the Apple app or Google extension store, and installed on any Google Chrome browser, iPhone, or Apple desktop computer. The wallet is an interface that allows the user to read and write to the blockchain without any intermediary‚Äôs help, akin to how a web browser is a consumer‚Äôs direct connection to the open web.
</blockquote>
Why was Hughes stressing that the MetaMask wallet was open-source? Consensys responded to the suit by claiming that MetaMask was <a href="https://consensys.io/blog/company-statement-on-the-sec-action-against-consensys">just software that they wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We are confident in our position that the SEC has not been granted authority to regulate software interfaces like MetaMask.
</blockquote>
Consensys claims that their <a href="https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-launches-metamask-learn-the-next-step-in-democratizing-web3">software is open source</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Consensys is a leading Ethereum and decentralized protocols software company. We enable developers, enterprises, and people worldwide to build next-generation applications, launch modern financial infrastructure, and access the decentralized web.
...
On this trusted, open source foundation, we are building the digital economy of tomorrow. 
</blockquote>
Specifically including <a href="https://metamask.io/developer/">MetaMask</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Build your dapp using the same infrastructure and APIs powering web3's most popular open-source wallet.
</blockquote>
It is true that MetaMask's wallet <i>was</i> originally truly open source, under the MIT license. But as of 4 years ago, the license <a href="https://medium.com/metamask/evolving-our-license-for-the-next-wave-of-metamask-users-81b0b494c09a">changed</a> to a Consensys-specific license that prevents commercial use if it serves more than 10K users/month. So in this post "open source" means readable, it does not mean the canonical definition of Free Open Source Software.<br />
<br />
But notice Consensys' focus on the wallet software. That is not what the SEC is suing them about. The SEC's complaint is about the services MetaMask provides customers who use the wallet. Consensys' strategy is to conflate the wallet and the services, and claim that all the wallet does is interface to the blockchain.<br />
<br />
Lets use an analogy to see why this distinction is important. When I use an open-source browser to access a financial institution's website, such as <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/">Vanguard's</a> it receives a bunch of HTML and JavaScript. It isn't technically open source because it doesn't carry an open source copyright license, but I can read it. But it doesn't implement any of the services Vanguard offers me, such as trading mutual funds and transferring dollars to or from my bank account. These are implemented as closed-source, the browser under control of Vanguard's HTML and JavaScript is just a wrapper around them.<br />
<br />
Consensys seems to claim that because the "smart contracts" implementing these services are just open source software they do not control and in whose operations they are not involved, they are not acting as a broker because they don't take custody of the customer's tokens.<br />
<br />
I should pick a nit. I've written before, for example in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/01/blockchain-gaslighting.html"><i>Blockchain Gaslighting</i></a> and <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/03/more-cryptocurrency-gaslighting.html"><i>More Cryptocurrency Gaslighting</i></a>, about the crypto-bros habit of loudly and repeatedly making provably false statements in the hope that no-one will bother to check them. This post is, strictly speaking, not about gaslighting because the repeated statements are technically true, but they are intended to be interpreted in a broader context in which they are false.<br />
<br />
The reason Consenssys' statements are technically true is that the wallet functionality is open source, at least in the sense that it can be read. But, a couple of weeks ago, Jon Reiter and the team at Chainargos came out with a three-part series examining how MetaMask's services actually work that reveals the lie underlying Consensys' arguments:<br />
<ol>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-swap-really-works-e2919c4ebd4a"><i>How MetaMask Swap Really Works</i></a> uses <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x66faafe68a2bc3ab0bca75fa84a50dfeca263789ad176d8411c7ad6fa17039f9">Etherscan</a> and <a href="https://evm.storage/eth/0x66faafe68a2bc3ab0bca75fa84a50dfeca263789ad176d8411c7ad6fa17039f9">Sim explorer</a> to trace a single MetaMask swap transaction.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-staking-really-works-65c4e4ba5f9b"><i>How MetaMask Staking Really Works</i></a> examines four different staking staking contracts and uses the same techniques to follow a <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4b3b10bc1b5540ba7895cee7101ecbfb4cd6255a5d88165368789c366ddad305">transaction</a> from one of them. It also discusses how one part of MetaMask Bridge works.</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-bridge-really-works-3a716db94c21"><i>How MetaMask Bridge Really Works</i></a> covers the rest of MetaMask Bridge's functionality, again including a <a href="https://bscscan.com/tx/0x06dc87b6344f161e7ee594cfda3cc8cecb43647a1882abadc38e3e8146c9f540">sample transaction</a>.</li>
</ol>
In each case the structure of the transaction is basically the same. For the details you should read the three posts, but to oversimplify:<br />
<ul>
<li>The customer's wallet invokes a function, for example <tt>MetaMask:Swap Router.swap()</tt>, on one of MetaMask's open source contracts. The call parameters identify a specific contract, which in the swap case MetaMask calls the "aggregator" and Chainargos calls the <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-swap-really-works-e2919c4ebd4a">"execution strategy"</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It is the algorithm that the user told their broker to use to execute this order
</blockquote>
These contracts are closed-source, owned and controlled by Consensys. Part of their function is to transfer the fees for executing the transaction to a Consensys wallet.</li>
<li>The open-source function validates inputs, identifies the "adapter" that implements the requested algorithm, and formats a block of parameters with which to invoke it.</li>
<li>The open-source function <i>transfers control of the customer's tokens to a MetaMask contract</i>. In the case of MetaMask Swap this is an open-source contract, in other cases it is an upgradeable or closed-source contract.</li>
<li>That contract invokes the <i>closed-source, MetaMask owned</i> adapter contract with the encoded parameters.</li>
<li>The adapter performs the transaction, returning the proceeds to the customer after subtracting the fee, which it sends to the Consensys wallet.</li>
</ul>
Note first that the actual algorithm performing the transaction is closed-source, MetaMask's open-source software simply provides the wrapper exposed to the customer. And second that in each case a closed-source MetaMask contract takes control of the customer's tokens in order to perform the requested transaction. In some cases even the open-source contract is upgradeable, meaning that MetaMask can change what it does on a whim. In some cases the contracts have functions such as <tt>pause()</tt> demonstrating MetaMask's control over their operation. At minimum, MetaMask needs this control to ensure that the fees for the transaction are routed to their wallet.<br />
<br />
Chainargos concludes that this workflow <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-swap-really-works-e2919c4ebd4a">looks similar to the way a broker works</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>User enters order including an execution strategy.</li>
<li>This order is sent to an order router.</li>
<li>Router looks up the execution adapter for that strategy.</li>
<li>Router sends the tokens intended to be sold, the adapter address, and the incoming order details to a spender contract.</li>
<li>Spender delegates control over the received tokens as required for order execution.</li>
<li>Spender calls a closed-source contract which effects the execution strategy.</li>
<li>Fees are sent from Spender to the ‚ÄúMetaMask Fee Complex‚Äù.</li>
<li>Sale proceeds are returned to the user.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
And they <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-swap-really-works-e2919c4ebd4a">point out that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
that steps 4, 5, and 6 look an awful lot like the concepts of ‚Äútransmittal order‚Äù and ‚Äútransmittal of funds‚Äù from <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/12/04/2013-28951/definitions-of-transmittal-of-funds-and-funds-transfer">here</a>.
</blockquote>
"Here" is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/12/04/2013-28951/definitions-of-transmittal-of-funds-and-funds-transfer"><i>Definitions of Transmittal of Funds and Funds Transfer</i></a>.<br />
<br />
The parts of MetaMask that provide services for which Consensys gets fees <i>cannot</i> be open source in the sense of readable. If they were, anyone could copy them, modify them to direct the fees to themselves, and deploy the result. This would kill off Consensys' $250M cash cow. Consensys has a belt-and-braces moat; if they did they would run into the 10K users/month limit of the license for the open source parts of the system. Note that the <a href="https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/blob/e4d4c9c45a134eace71d020ac0316deddc52213d/LICENSE">license</a> appears to relate only to the open source parts, it isn't clear under what terms the closed source parts are used.<br />

The last of the three Chainargos posts was published July 15<sup>th</sup>, and on July 17<sup>th</sup> a brand-new blog appeared whose first post was <a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@proofs-and-protocols/examining-sec-v-consensys"><i>Examining SEC v. Consensys</i></a> by Daniel Barabander. He is Deputy General Counsel at the cryptocurrency VC Variant, so not an unbiased observer. Early in the post, in the table at the right, Barabander simply asserts that Consensys' technology is non-custodial, i.e. that MetaMask does not take custody of the customer's tokens.<br />
<br />
How can Barabander make this assertion when it is clear that MetaMask's Spender delegates control over the customer's tokens and then invokes MetaMask's closed-source execution strategy? He relies on the fact that the transaction is atomic, it either succeeds completely, or it fails completely.
<a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@proofs-and-protocols/examining-sec-v-consensys">He writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Assuming the adapters are not malicious (which would be another issue entirely), their job is to enable a user to perform an atomic swap‚Äîin a single transaction take token A and exchange it for token B. This would mean that transactions are "all or nothing"‚Äîeither the tokens are swapped or they are not, they cannot end up in possession of the Spender.sol contract or Consensys
</blockquote>
If the transaction succeeds, <i>some</i> of the tokens involved end up in possession of Consensys, because they get the fee. But that is not the big problem with this claim. It is true that the transaction either succeeds or fails completely, but what the transaction does with the control it is delegated over the customer's tokens is determined by MetaMask's closed-source adapters. The customer hands control to MetaMask's closed-source code and blindly trusts it will do what MetaMask claims. Barabander admits that this is the case when he assumes that "the adapters are not malicious".<br />
<br />
Chainargos <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/how-metamask-swap-really-works-e2919c4ebd4a">points out that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If you can publish adapters, call setAdapter on the router and modify the input ‚Äúdata‚Äù blob you can do anything you like.<br />
<br />
Even if you only have some of that power you can do pretty much anything you like with the input tokens.
</blockquote>
As I understand it, only MetaMask can do these things. Barabander <a href="https://paragraph.xyz/@proofs-and-protocols/examining-sec-v-consensys">admits</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
While there is some admin functionality on the smart contract for a multi-sig that Consensys may control, there is no evidence to suggest the company actively operates the smart contract‚Äôs code.
</blockquote>
Chainargos posted a response to Barabander entitled <a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/in-re-examining-sec-v-consensys-1edfbfee6987"><i>In Re: Examining SEC v. Consensys</i></a>. They note that the contract has a <tt>renounceOwnership()</tt> function that Consensys has not called, there are <tt>pauseSwaps()</tt> and <tt>unpauseSwaps()</tt> for use when the contract gets hacked, and that the admin functionality has to be used to set up the adapter mapping.<br />

In response to the SEC's suit, Consensys <a href="https://amycastor.com/2024/04/27/consensys-gets-a-wells-notice-over-metamask-swaps-and-staking/">countersued</a> in the Northern District of Texas. In their complaint they state (my emphasis):<br />
<blockquote>
MetaMask is simply an interface ‚Äî like a web browser ‚Äî that allows digital asset holders to seamlessly interact with the Ethereum network, including all other users and applications participating on the network. <i>MetaMask neither holds customers‚Äô digital assets nor carries out any transaction functions</i>.
</blockquote>
It is a little strange to say that MetaMask the wallet doesn't hold customer's digital assets - what is a "wallet" for? But the MetaMask wallet is unhosted, <i>Consensys</i> doesn't hold customer's digital assets in MetaMask wallets. But Consensys' services accessed via the wallet do take control of them using closed-source "smart contracts" that they control.<br />
<br />
It is possible that the court will decide that Consensys is acting as a broker, but will accept their assertion that the software they use to do it is open source. This would be a problem, in that it could be a precedent for assigning liability to the developers of open source software.<br />

**@Jessica Smith's blog** (date: 2024-08-01, from: Jessica Smith's blog)

<p>I should‚Äôve known I‚Äôd be in for a wild conversation when Viv burst into my room all like, ‚ÄúDid you hear what Canada is doing to the polar bears?!?‚Äù</p>
<p>Apparently (I have not seen whatever he saw), some town in Canada is trying to deter polar bears from entering the town by capturing them, depriving them of food and subjecting them to ‚Äúshock therapy‚Äù for two months, before releasing them back into the wild? Like, what kind of scheme is this. &ldquo;Oh no no, we can&rsquo;t <em>kill</em> the polar bears, so we&rsquo;re just going to lock them up for two months and torture them, before dropping them off right back where there&rsquo;s still no food.&rdquo; And Viv is raging, insisting that the mining companies should be required to deposit truckloads of seals in the area where the polar bears are so they have something to eat, and I&rsquo;m like&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the crux of the issue here. Anyway, idk, it made me laugh (even though it sucks for the polar bears). Very Canadian things.</p>

## The NYT is weird

date: 2024-07-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Someone in charge at the NYT needs to take a step back and view events, and the NYT role in those events, from the point of view of an ordinary non-NYT-employed citizen, bewildered at the enormous risks journalists are taking with the system of government of the United States. </p>
<p>In the context of who we are as a country, what the Repubs do and say is to be very mild about it "weird." What word would you prefer the Democrats use? Imagine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William Safire</a> were here, the great linguist columnist of the NYT, wrote that column. (Safire was a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ab14f5b9-2b55-406f-9b78-057313c03d63">Republican</a> btw.)</p>
<p>And to the Democrats, no matter what the NYT says, keep using the term. This is where you get to speak out about what they're doing over there, and how it's not journalism. One of the rare things you agree with Trump on. </p>
<p>Podcast: <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/31/theNYTIsWeird.m4a">3 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>PS: Safire went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science">Bronx Science</a>! I did not know that. (So did I.) I love the idea of writers who aren't scared of tech stuff. </p>
<p>PPS: Even Richard Nixon would think today's so-called Republicans were weird. </p>
<p>PPPS: The NYT is totally unmoored, a word I bet Safire would like. </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

People who get their sense of self-esteem from having procreated are placing a heavy burden on their children. What if the child doesn't live up to their expectations? How will they treat the child then! Creating a new human is not an accomplishment. Treating that new life as a full person starting at birth, and through their whole life, <i>that's</i> an accomplishment. For a man to father a child just means they have a functioning reproductive system. It's not anything to be proud or to expect to be rewarded or respected for.

date: 2024-07-31, from: Om Malik blog

As a diabetic, my life is a constant&#160;balance&#160;between hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic levels‚Äîand proper food consumption is&#160;key&#160;to&#160;maintaining&#160;steady&#160;blood&#160;sugar levels.

## Using personal weeknotes as a tool for attention

The <a href="https://this.how/podcast0/">Podcast0</a> project is teaching me how to read the archive of my own blog. Until now I had not carefully read the story I tell on my blog more than a few days after it happened. Here's I'm learning to reconstruct the summer of 2004, one of the most creative periods of my life, at least that's viewable in such a public and preserved way. Am I the first to do this for any blog? If you know of an example of historic research done using the archive of a blog, please send me a note. I'd love to learn about what you learned! Also because of its longevity and continuity, I offer <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html">this blog</a> as some kind of record of what happened in the last 30 years or so. I see it as a complete work of writing, a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco">fresco</a> writing.

## Childless vs childful

date: 2024-07-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Notes accumulated during the day -- not in any particular order. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span></p>
<p>I keep a solid line between my personal life and blogging, learned the hard way. When I started blogging in 1994, I didn't have such a solid line, and found that I couldn't have a personal life if I made it public. But now I want to reveal something. I am "childless" which is a term I find pretty insulting, as if being child<i>ful</i> is the only normal state of being. </p>
<p>I find, in general childful people are not great friends or family members. They want special privileges and they often get them. If childful vs childless is going to be an issue in this campaign, I say -- bring it on. We should have this discussion. </p>
<p>I'm often tempted to offer advice to the parents, but I won't offer it unless asked, except this. If you have children, there's a good chance one or more of them will not have children, and you should love them the same, and provide models of acceptance while they're growing up, by bringing childless people into your home, so the kids know that this is one of the legitimate choices in life, offering proof that you won't love them any less if they go down that path. And here's the hard part, imho, for people with children -- <i>keep that promise. </i></p>
<p>BTW, people say it's seflish to not have children, but I don't agree, in fact I think it's the opposite. There was a point in human evolution where the struggle to survive for our species was fed by procreation, but some time in the last hundred years we crossed a line, where increasing human population worked against species survival. Our understanding of the meaning of procreating, like so much else about our civilization, has not yet caught up with the current reality. </p>

## Fixing curl install failures with Ansible on Red Hat-derivative OSes

The reason for this has to do with the inclusion of a <code>curl-minimal</code> package in some distros, which conflicts with <code>curl</code> if you try installing the full package.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the fix for this is a little strange, and so only ends up in Ansible's <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/dnf_module.html">dnf</a> module, not in the more cross-compatible <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_module.html">package</a> module.</p>

## Hacking Pi firmware to get the fastest overclock

<p>Since boosting my Pi 5 from the default 2.4 GHz clock to <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-5-can-overclock-314-ghz">3.14 GHz on Pi Day</a>, I've wanted to go faster. Especially since many other users have topped my Geekbench scores since then :)</p>

<p>In March, Raspberry Pi introduced new firmware that unlocked frequencies above 3,000 MHz for overclocking. This summer, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/numa-emulation-speeds-pi-5-and-other-improvements">NUMA Emulation patches</a> boosted performance another 5-10% through memory access optimizations.</p>

I felt like it might as well have been <i>Slave Owners for Harris</i> or <i>Reformed Republicans for Harris.</i> I don't have anything against people of my gender and approximate race, but I also am a child of Holocaust survivors, and I happen to be one of the elites the Repubs claim to hate, and also am one of at least two castes that Democrats tend to blame for all our problems (other than White Dudes). I think we've done enough segregation for one campaign, now please please I beg you, let's <i>work together,</i> regardless of labels, to save the country we all love. I have a philosophy, I don't care how you got to the party, if you took a subway, walked, rode a bike, or came by Uber or a Cadillac limousine. We all got here, and have a common purpose, so lets all love each other and party our way to victory. Regardless of race, creed, color or whatever.

## Providing Security Updates to Automobile Software

date: 2024-07-30, updated: 2024-07-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Auto manufacturers are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cars-are-now-rolling-computers-so-how-long-will-they-get-updates-automakers-cant-say/">just starting to realize</a> the problems of supporting the software in older models:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today‚Äôs phones are able to receive updates six to eight years after their purchase date. Samsung and Google provide Android OS updates and security updates for seven years. Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">halts servicing</a> products seven years after they stop selling them.</p>
<p>That might not cut it in the auto world, where the average age of cars on US roads is only going up. A <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/average-age-vehicles-united-states-2024.html">recent report</a> found that cars and trucks just reached a new record average age of 12.6 years, up two months from 2023. That means the car software hitting the road today needs to work¬≠&#8212;and maybe even improve&#8212;¬≠beyond 2036. The average length of smartphone ownership is just ...</p></blockquote>

I bought an iPhone that I now don't need, and it's arriving today via FedEx. I wanted to know whether I should just refuse delivery, or accept it and then return it. Obviously it's easier for me to refuse. I asked ChatGPT and it gave me a detailed reply. Apple's chatbot saw it as a "technical" question and wasn't prepared to help. Sales support is one of those applications where cost is totally justified. A human helper would cost a lot more I imagine than a LLM chat system. I tried calling 1-800-CALL-APPLE and talked to a human who was very nice, but couldn't find anything in her manual about refusing delivery.

## New Research in Detecting AI-Generated Videos

<blockquote><p>The new tool the research project is unleashing on deepfakes, called &#8220;MISLnet&#8221;, evolved from years of data derived from detecting fake images and video with tools that spot changes made to digital video or images. These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames, manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames.</p>
<p>Such tools work because a digital camera&#8217;s algorithmic processing creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships between values are very different in user-generated or images edited with apps like Photoshop...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-07-27 Tired of programming

date: 2024-07-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-27-tired-of-programming">2024-07-27 Tired of programming</h1>

<p>My summer break has begun, and I am tired.</p>

<p>I wanted to work on some sort of editor.
I contributed some lines to Anvil, an Acme-inspired editor, and then I figured I should go back to text editing because writing acceptable GUI editing is just sooo much effort. So now I‚Äôm trying to use ed again‚Ä¶
I&rsquo;m experimenting with using <code>rlwrap</code> around <code>ed</code> and it&rsquo;s not so bad if you&rsquo;re just writing, like writing an email.
But really writing, organizing, moving things around‚Ä¶ it really doesn&rsquo;t work all that well.
I had imagined a sort of conversational UI ‚Äì which I guess ed has? ‚Äì if ed is your grumpiest of companions! ‚Äì and I guess I was looking at my Oddmu site generator and Markdown file server and thinking: what sort of editor would I need to maintain this?
What sort of minimal SVG editing capabilities would be nice to have? That was my starting point.
Then I dropped the graphics because writing that seemed like a pain.
Then I started thinking about the GUI components: using fonts with Harfbuzz, Unicode support, hyphenation (per language), spell-checking (per language), and on and on.
It&rsquo;s too much.</p>

<p>But where does that leave me? Adding a few features to ed?
Am I in fact reinventing vi, badly?</p>

<p><a href="2024-06-01-editor">2024-06-01 Fonts are important</a>,
<a href="2024-06-13-anvil">2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple cursors</a>,
<a href="2024-07-24-ed">2024-07-24 My ed, wondering</a></p>

<p>I wanted to work on a local Gridmapper variant, written in Common Lisp.
I already have a working prototype in Common Lisp and I already have a Javascript web application in production.
This is a single file, a stand-alone SVG+Javascript web application. It works online and offline.
Thus, my entire tinkering with CL right now has as its goal to produce a native application that would work without a browser.</p>

<p>Whenever I start working on native GUI stuff, like working with SDL2 or Cairo or similar libraries, my eyes start bleeding.
Vanilla JS and the browser really is a pretty nice virtual machine available to many of us.
Having spent a day trying to get SDL2, SDL2 gfx and Cairo sorted out for this Common Lisp app I&rsquo;m looking at really makes me want to drop it all for another two years and focus on JavaScript instead.
It can&rsquo;t be that bad! Javascript gives me the DOM and SVG and all that, practically for free‚Ä¶</p>

<p>And three different bindings Common Lisp bindings for SDL2 in various states of neglect is draining.
Switching from one to the other is tricky since the first one had many idiomatic helpers functions that the other is lacking.
But the first one is lacking a gfx port.
Then again, I guess I can add circle drawing using lines.</p>

<p>Everything takes so long. So damn long.</p>

<p><a href="2022-07-20_Gridmapper_CL">2022-07-20 Gridmapper CL 5</a>, <a href="2024-07-24-gridmapper-local">2024-07-24 Gridmapper Local</a></p>

<p>A while ago I started collecting links with quotes instead of relying on browser bookmarks or third parties. I remember at one point my bookmarks were just HTML files generated by the browser. Good times! And there was Delicious, a service now defunct, I guess. So now I keep <a href="Bookmarks">bookmarks on this site</a>. It&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>I wondered whether I should write a tool that monitors those pages, and when new items get added, a feed is updated.
Just a little program‚Ä¶ it doesn&rsquo;t seem hard. So I gave it try.  I like documentation first, these days so I began with a man page for it. Good, good. Then I though that perhaps I should use the same Markdown parser as Oddmu uses.
So I needed to write this tool in Go. How hard can it be?
It&rsquo;s a bit harder than writing it in Perl.
Oh, and I needed to parse the RSS file, too.
Or use SQLite to store data.
It keeps getting harder.</p>

<p>Well, I spent some time on it and now I&rsquo;m tired again.
This too, takes too long!</p>

<p>I feel defeated. Am I too impatient?</p>

<p>I should read a book.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-07-27</strong>. In an attempt to overcome my sadness, I decided to spice up my shell life‚Ä¶</p>

<pre><code># hipster shell
alias ls='echo Using exa instead;exa'
alias du='echo Using dust instead;dust'
alias top='echo Using htop instead;htop'
alias find='echo Using fd instead;fd'
alias grep='echo Using rg instead;rg'
alias files='echo Using yazi instead;yazi'
alias cal='echo Using khal instead;khal'
alias screenshot='grimshot'
alias copy='wl-copy'
alias paste='wl-paste'
</code></pre>

<p>I set up <code>khal</code> and <code>khard</code> which required me to set up <code>vdirsyncer</code> to sync the remote calendars (and contacts) to local copies. This is also good for backup, I guess.</p>

<p>Let me know if you know of other such tools.</p>

<p><strong>2024-07-29</strong>. I overcame my block and wrote the bookmarks-to-feed program in Perl: <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bookmark-feed.git">bookmark-feed</a>. üîñ ü§ù <img loading="lazy" src="/pics/rss.svg" alt="RSS" /></p>

<p>I installed a daily cron job:</p>

<pre><code>47  23  *  *   *     /usr/bin/nice /home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/bookmark-feed /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*_Bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*-bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/bookmarks.rss
</code></pre>

<p>The readable variant is this: <code>bookmark-feed markdown-files‚Ä¶ feed-file</code>.
The files it looks at once a day are my <a href="Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>.
The feed it generates is <a href="/wiki/bookmarks.rss">bookmarks.rss</a>.
The database it uses is <a href="/wiki/bookmarks.db">bookmarks.db</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t do expiration from the database but uses only the last 40 items for the feed.</p>

<p>When populating the database, all I had was the timestamp of the Markdown pages, so the existing bookmarks are all relatively unsorted ‚Äì they are sorted by the timestamp of the most recent addition to the whole category, which pretty weird.</p>

## MNT Pocket Reform progress

date: 2024-07-29, from: Jirka's blog

There have  been some  changes both  on the  hardware and  the software side. The hardware part was quite important yet simple: the current CPU module has  a WiFi chip without  any cooling. As the  CPU is relatively hod (at least for the ARM) the WiFi  part is hot, too - and it seems to work bad  when hot.  So the  quick fix is  to add  a small  thermal pad (about 2 mm thick) so the chip will be connected to the heatsink. The long-term solution would be to use a cooler CPU.

## When technology moves backwards

date: 2024-07-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I don't when technology moves backwards.</p>
<p>I'm always trying to push it the other way.</p>
<p>It's like being a ball player wanting to win a game.</p>
<p>Or a musician wanting to record a hit.</p>
<p>A VC wanting a 10x return.</p>
<p>A diplomat achieving growth and peace.</p>

## How and why to write letters to voters

date: 2024-07-28, from: Jonudell blog

If you don&#8217;t live in a swing state, but would like to do more than just send money to help encourage voter turnout in those places, what are your options? For me the best one is Vote Forward, which orchestrates letter-writing to registered voters. I sent hundreds of such letters in 2020 and am aiming &#8230; <a href="https://blog.jonudell.net/2024/07/28/how-and-why-to-write-letters-to-voters/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">How and why to write letters to voters</span></a>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/07/26/oldTwitterLogo.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Before Twitter broke the API, it was a quick way for me to channel items from my blog to almost all the people who follow me on the social web. Now it isn't even one of the services I use that I can post to with my writing tool (those are Bluesky, Mastodon, WordPress). None of them are anything like the aggregator of people that Twitter was, and I can't even reach it from my writing tool. I really want to solve this problem, but I absolutely can't do this on my own. No time, patience, and it's not my job to do all that coding. As observed the other day, my time should be spent on writing tools for the web and directly related products. This is the kind of project that should be handled as an open source thing.
