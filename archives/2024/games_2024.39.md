date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-23, from: Polygon Website

A new trailer for Marvel Studios’ Thunderbolts* may not have revealed why there’s an asterisk in the title — bracing for a Dark Avengers reveal at the end — but it did tease an unexpected addition to the team: Bob. Who is Bob? Bob’s a guy in hospital scrubs who just happens to be on [&#8230;]

## Warhammer 40K Kill Team: Hivestorm is way more than a starter set

date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website

I once joked that Games Workshop’s Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team was the sick man of the British company’s otherwise thriving family of science fiction wargames. After a high-profile relaunch in 2018, the small unit miniatures skirmish game has grown to become one of the pillars of the entire 40K franchise. With the new Warhammer 40,000 [&#8230;]

## We got a peek at the cozy Hobbit life sim game and it understands the damn brief

We’re living in the middle of a bounty of Middle-earth media. Last year’s wretched Gollum game, 2026’s apparent Gollum duology, The Rings of Power’s elven kings, War of the Rohirrim’s horse maidens, and more video games of various scope and subject reportedly still on the way.  And yet none of the above is giving the [&#8230;]

## This little sci-fi movie takes time loops on a new track

date: 2024-09-22, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website

In Groundhog Day, some unexplained force — maybe celestial, certainly moral — traps misanthropic weatherman Bill Murray in a single, repeated day until he sheds his attitude and becomes a better person. In Palm Springs, shiftless wedding guests Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti fall into a time-loop vortex, a freak of astrophysics, in a cave. [&#8230;]

## My Old Ass director says Aubrey Plaza didn’t need to look like her time-traveling younger self to be perfect

In the new time-travel comedy My Old Ass, Maisy Stella and Aubrey Plaza play two versions of the same character, Elliott: One is a young, confident teenager, and the other is her older self.

## Zack Snyder’s new Netflix show is his take on The Boys

date: 2024-09-21, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website

“Fuck the gods” is a sentiment that feels like it’s everywhere right now, from the more literal interpretation of Netflix’s Kaos to the variety of “eat the rich” narratives tapping into the simmering anger at the present growing inequality.

## Hades is unmatched when it comes to video game storytelling

date: 2024-09-21, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website

I’m often let down by game stories. With rare exceptions —&#160;Half-Life, Shadow of the Colossus, games that knew when to shut the hell up —&#160;I’ve found them tiresome, forgettable, and frustratingly aping film and television stories. Bad writing isn’t to blame. There are many smart, well-crafted stories in video games lessened by the need to [&#8230;]
