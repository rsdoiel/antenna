## Warhammer 40K Kill Team: Hivestorm is way more than a starter set

date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website

I once joked that Games Workshop’s Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team was the sick man of the British company’s otherwise thriving family of science fiction wargames.

We’re living in the middle of a bounty of Middle-earth media. Last year’s wretched Gollum game, 2026’s apparent Gollum duology, The Rings of Power’s elven kings, War of the Rohirrim’s horse maidens, and more video games of various scope and subject reportedly still on the way.  And yet none of the above is giving the [&#8230;]

In Groundhog Day, some unexplained force — maybe celestial, certainly moral — traps misanthropic weatherman Bill Murray in a single, repeated day until he sheds his attitude and becomes a better person.
