The March/April 2024 issue of Asimov’s is quite a strong one. It opens
with a “<strong>How Sere Kept Herself Together</strong>” by
<strong>Alex­ander Jablokov</strong>, the third in a series of stories
featuring Sere, an investigator, who in this case starts off looking
into a kidnapping, but finds herself embroiled in a far more complex
case. The worldbuilding is nicely done and the novella does a good

Pitched as a reimagining of Zorro against the backdrop of Mexican
anticolonial resis­tance, <strong>Sun of Blood and Ruin </strong>– the
debut novel by Mariely Lares – manages to be a fun com­fort read with a

<p>I got the best news today from one of the artists whose work went out
in the Heritage Auction that someone who bought a drawing from him long
ago, and sold it for a lot more recently, is sending him 10% of the
profits. So the idea of cutting in the artists is starting to catch on.
And I’m glad.</p>

Kate Heartield studied journalism but had always written fiction. "I'm
one of those people who has been a fiction writer since I was a kid. I
wrote at 11 o'clock at night when I had a full-time newspaper job and a
kid. I would take a few years off from time to time, but for the most
part, I've always written fiction."
</p>
<p>
Now, with about half her time devoted to journalism and half to fiction,
Kate has written eight novels and two interactive games, and focuses
mostly on historical fantasy.
</p>
<p>
We discussed the writing process; Kate draws on her experience as a
journalist when writing fiction. "I start with a really skeletal draft,
and I have to add to it as I go; I'm not one of those people who cuts
from draft to draft. I think part of that is my journalistic training,
that I've trained myself to write in as few words as possible. And then
with fiction, sometimes to build tension and to have emotion and bring
the reader into the piece, longer work is actually better paced for
that. I've learned about my process that my first draft is probably
about 75% as long as the final draft will be."
</p>
<p>
One of Kate's recent novels is <em>The Embroidered Book</em>, a
historical fantasy about Marie Antoinette in the 18th century. I asked
Kate if it was easier to have this skeleton of truth that she could add
to in telling a fantasy story?
</p>
<p>
"It was easier in some ways. I really liked telling a story that's in
amongst the real facts of history, that uses the real facts of history
as a scaffolding and then fills in some secret knowledge in between
those facts. I suppose it does give me touch points along the way, or
milestones to hit so that I have a structure that I can start with. And
then I can work with that and change it in a way that suits the story
that I'm trying to tell.
</p>
<p>
"In other ways, it also does make it more difficult. Because if you get
to a point in the story, where you think, 'Oh, actually, for character
arc purposes, I need something else to happen,' if you've already
committed to telling a story that is not going to deviate from history,
you've got to be really creative and find a way to do that without
actually departing from those facts. So it's similar to straightforward
historical fiction, like Hilary Mantel's books, in that you're still
telling a character story within those facts, and so you've got to find
a way to work within that, which can be a challenge."
</p>
<p>
Historical fiction relies on in-depth research and Kate said, "I use
Scrivener as a hub for all my research. In the Research folder, I have a
bunch of text documents that are my running bibliography and links to
sources and interesting web pages. I write myself copious notes that all
go into Scrivener as well.“
</p>
<p>
I asked whether Kate outlines her novels. "I do outline. I tend to work
more with a synopsis than an outline, in the sense that I learned that a
bullet-point outline, or point form as we say in Canada, is not that
useful for me because it doesn't have the connective tissue of
storytelling in it. It doesn't have the <em>becauses</em> and
<em>therefores</em> and <em>thens</em>, whereas a synopsis is a story,
even if it is a short and kind of boring story. It has the logic of a
story behind it because it's got to be written in complete sentences and
with all of that connective tissue. So what I tend to do now is write
myself a synopsis, typically one or two pages. Once I have all my notes
about character arcs and the basic beats that I want to hit in the
story, I'll write it as a synopsis and then I'll keep that running
synopsis in Scrivener, in one of my documents in the Research folder.
The reason I call it a running synopsis is because I am the kind of
person that changes as I go."
</p>
<p>
Kate builds a timeline for her novels using Scrivener and
<a href="https://www.aeontimeline.com" target="_blank">Aeon
Timeline</a>. "The one really interesting way that I use Scrivener now
is to help me with my timeline. I have it integrated into Aeon Timeline,
which allows me to put metadata in Scrivener that will then appear in
the timeline. That helps me a lot, because one thing I have found as
someone writing historical fiction, and also as a reviser who changes as
I go, is I end up with my character ages being wrong, or I end up with
some sort of continuity error at the end. I find that using Scrivener
deliberately to tie into all of my note-taking in my timelines is really
helpful, because that way, if I change anything in the document, I'm
immediately going to change it in all my notes."

The Deadlands Winter ’24
</p>
<p>
The Winter 2024 issue of The Deadlands is full of lovely prose and quiet
stories meditating on life and death. In the beautifully written
“<strong>Threnody in Dark Wood</strong>” by <strong>Avra Margariti,
</strong>a profes­sional mourner who sings the dead through the Doorway
receives a mysterious assignment to attend an empty funeral with a
sealed coffin and soon realizes this is a job unlike any other.
