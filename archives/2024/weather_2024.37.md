URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 669
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 AM CDT Thu Sep 12 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern Alabama
  Florida Panhandle
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Thursday morning and afternoon from 550 AM until
  100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes possible

SUMMARY...As Francine's center continues moving northward over MS
and weakens further through midday (per NHC forecast), a slot of
wind/moisture/instability fields favorable for supercells and a few
tornadoes will shift slowly northward/inland as well.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
north and south of a line from 35 miles west southwest of Evergreen
AL to 35 miles south southeast of Marianna FL. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...This tornado watch replaces tornado
watch number 668. Watch number 668 will not be in effect after
550 AM CDT. 

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 50 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean
storm motion vector 16030.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CDT Thu Sep 12 2024

Valid 121300Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS...AND FROM THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE TO
NORTH-CENTRAL ALABAMA...

...SUMMARY...
A few tornadoes are possible today, mainly in the morning and
afternoon from the Florida Panhandle to north-central Alabama.
Scattered large hail and severe gusts (some significant) are
expected across the eastern Montana vicinity during the afternoon to
early evening.

...Synopsis...
Over the CONUS, in mid/upper levels, a highly amplified initial
pattern will become more blocky through the period.  A strong
northern-stream trough with an intermittently closed cyclone is
apparent in moisture-channel imagery from the Canadian Rockies
southward over ID to the central Great Basin.  The 500-mb low is
forecast to move northeastward across western and northern MT to
near the southwestern corner of SK by the end of the period.  By
then, the attached trough will deamplify slightly and become more
positively tilted, extending from the low to central UT.  A
baroclinic leaf with strongly difluent flow aloft precedes the
trough in satellite imagery over southeastern ID, western WY and
central MT, with an eastward shift and some reinforcement expected
today as small vorticity maxima pivot northeastward out of the
trough.

Meanwhile, an initially separate, weak 500-mb low now over the Red
River near PRX, and the remnants of Tropical Storm Francine aloft,
are progged to merge over the upper Delta/Mid-South region today
into tonight.  The result after 06Z should be a slow-moving
mid/upper-level low over AR, nearly stacked above the weakening
low-level vortex just to the east around MEM.  [See NHC advisories
for latest forecast track/intensity guidance on Francine.]  An
anticyclone aloft should form later today and expand tonight
northeast of that low, over the Upper Great Lakes region. 

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a warm front across northernmost
FL to the coastal FL Panhandle, then slightly inland over the
western Panhandle, southwestern AL and southeastern MS.  This
boundary will move slowly northward/inland today, demarcating the
north rim of mid-70s F surface dewpoints.  Meanwhile, a surface low
was drawn over eastern MT west of GDV, with slow-moving cold front
south-southwestward across northeastern/central WY.  The low and
front will continue slow/intermittent eastward progress today, then
move into the western Dakotas around 22-00Z, then eastward to the
central Dakotas late overnight. 

...Northern Great Plains...
Strong-severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon into
evening, along and behind the front, with the most probable severe
potential arising from activity moving north-northeastward from
northern WY.  High-based supercells and multicells are possible,
offering large hail and severe gusts.  Some of the activity may
aggregate upscale into one or two bowing clusters, racing northward
accompanied by a swath of better-organized, potentially significant
(65+ kt) gust potential.  

Thunderstorms may develop along the front in early-mid afternoon, as
well as in and near the Bighorns, where diurnal heating of elevated
terrain preferentially removes MLCINH earliest.  A corridor of
favorable surface moisture will remain near and behind the front and
ahead of this convection.  Meanwhile, midlevel temperatures will
cool and steepen low/middle-level lapse rates, as large-scale ascent
spreads over the area, both ahead of the ejecting mid/upper trough
and in the left-exit region of a cyclonically curved 300-mb jet
segment.  This will occur atop a deep and well-mixed boundary layer
containing nearly dry-adiabatic lapse rates.  A northerly flow
component west of the front will enhance storm-relative winds in the
inflow layer, as well as low-level and deep-layer shear,
strengthening lift and helping to maintain and further organize the
convection.  MLCAPE of 500-1200 J/kg and 45-55 kt effective-shear
magnitudes will support the severe potential.

Convection forming later and farther east near the front over the
western Dakotas, from late afternoon into evening, also may pose a
strong to locally severe gust threat for a few hours, and the
marginal outlook area has been expanded eastward somewhat to give
more room for that process.  Flow aloft will bear a substantial
component parallel to the convective axis, indicating a largely
training or linear configuration is possible, along the western rim
of a 50-60-kt LLJ fostering warm advection and moisture transport
above the surface.  However, the near-surface airmass over the
central Dakotas should stabilize with time and eastward extent
tonight, limiting duration and eastward shift of the threat. 

...Southeastern CONUS...
Tropical Storm Francine is forecast to continue moving northward
over MS, and to lose definition as it interacts more closely with
the mid/upper-level low.  Accordingly, associated deep-layer winds
will continue to weaken, but low-level shear will remain favorable 
through most of the day well east-southeast to southeast of center. 
A destabilizing airmass along and south of the warm/marine front
will support a continued, slow inland shift of supercell potential
amid enlarged hodographs.  The favorable environment will be bounded
on the west by a dry slot and veering low-level flow, on the
northeast by unsuitably stable air in heavy precip and north of the
front, and on the south by a gradual weakening of low-level winds
and shear as the cyclone center pulls away and fills.  In the
favorable corridor, where inflow parcels are surface-based, expect
effective SRH in the 200-500 J/kg range, very rich moisture, low
LCL, and weak MLCINH.  The threat should diminish overnight as the
airmass slowly stabilizes inland, and the system continues to weaken
overall.

Mesoscale Discussion 2051
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Wed Sep 11 2024

Areas affected...southeastern Louisiana coastal areas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 111250Z - 111615Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for occasional tornadoes may begin to increase
near southeastern Louisiana coastal areas by late morning (10
AM-Noon).  Trends are being monitored for the possibility of a
tornado watch.

DISCUSSION...The center of Francine has been migrating across and
northeast of the Gunnison Oil Platform vicinity of the northwestern
Gulf of Mexico during the past hour or so, and is still roughly 170
miles from its forecast south central Louisiana coastal landfall
later today.  However, the leading edge of a broader convective
precipitation shield preceding Francine is beginning to overspread
coastal areas, accompanied by saturating thermodynamic profiles with
lapse rates trending moist adiabatic in mid-levels.

In the wake of this regime, and with the continued approach of
Francine, model forecast soundings suggest that a subtle increase in
boundary-layer temperatures and dew points may contribute to modest
destabilization by midday along coastal areas from west of
Boothville into the Vermilion Bay vicinity.  It appears that this
will coincide with more notable strengthening of low-level wind
fields, which are forecast to contribute to enlarging low-level
hodographs increasingly supportive of convection with embedded
low-level mesocyclones potentially capable of producing tornadoes.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0202 AM CDT Tue Sep 10 2024

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
The upper trough over the western US will quickly intensify
Wednesday, as a shortwave perturbation and mid-level jet streak move
onshore over the West Coast. As the trough strengthens, mid-level
flow over much of the West will increase. A surface low will deepen
over the northern Great Basin, while a cold front moves onshore and
also strengthens. To the east, TS Francine will approach the Gulf
Coast with offshore winds likely over parts of the mid South. Strong
surface winds, low humidity, and thunderstorms over parts of the
West and central US will support critical fire-weather concerns
Wednesday.

...Great Basin...
Ahead of the deepening trough, a potent mid-level jet streak will
move over parts of the western Great Basin beginning early
Wednesday. A deepening surface low in parts of the eastern Basin
will drive 20-25 mph winds over much of NV into western UT.
Augmented by downslope flow off the Sierra and the approaching cold
front, a brief period of winds of 25-30 mph will be possible along
with RH below 15%. Widespread critical fire-weather conditions are
likely over parts of the Great Basin. Fire-weather concerns should
diminish behind the front as cooler and more quiescent conditions
are expected behind the front into early Thursday.

...Lee of the Rockies and High Plains...
As the trough approaches, height falls and stronger flow aloft will
overspread the Rockies and High Plains. A surface low will deepen
first in eastern MT, with a lee trough extending south into the
central High Plains. Near the lee trough, strong southerly winds
will overlap with areas of low RH and drying fine fuels. Elevated
fire weather concerns are expected over parts of the High Plains
Wednesday afternoon and evening.

...Mid South...
As Francine approaches the Gulf Coast Wednesday and Wednesday night,
offshore pressure gradients will increase over parts of the lower MS
Valley and Mid South. While humidity values are not expected to be
overly low with the tropical air mass approaching, strong gusts are
expected to overlap with areas of relatively dry fuels and little
recent rainfall. Brief elevated fire-weather conditions are possible
before rain chances increase into early Thursday.

...Northwest Thunder...
Ahead of the cold front, increasing mid-level moisture and strong
lift from the trough will promote scattered thunderstorms Wednesday
afternoon. Lightning may interact with areas of somewhat drier fuels
over parts of the Northwest and northern Rockies before broader
wetting rainfall develops. However, these storms will likely have
higher precipitation efficiency with a cooler air mass and more
plentiful Pacific moisture in place. This lends significant
uncertainty on the threat for any lightning ignitions.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
LA GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Some tornado threat associated with Tropical Cyclone Francine may
approach the Louisiana Gulf Coast by early Wednesday morning.

...Synopsis...
Tropical Storm Francine will potentially intensify into a hurricane
as it moves north-northeastward across the western Gulf of Mexico.
Meanwhile, a strong mid/upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to
dig southeastward into the Pacific Northwest and northern CA.
Diurnal thunderstorms capable of locally gusty winds will be
possible from the eastern Great Basin into parts of the Rockies, and
also across the FL Peninsula. More isolated storms will also be
possible from the central Plains into the parts of the upper
Midwest, which may also be capable of locally gusty winds. Organized
severe-thunderstorm potential is expected to remain low, with the
possible exception of the LA Gulf Coast region late in the period in
association with Francine. 

...LA Gulf Coast vicinity...
Refer to NHC forecasts and advisories for more information regarding
Tropical Storm Francine. Based on the current forecast track, the
most favorable environment for low-topped supercells associated with
Francine should remain offshore for most of the forecast period.
However, some outer bands may begin to approach the LA Gulf Coast
prior to 12Z Wednesday morning, accompanied by an increase in
low-level shear/SRH. A small Marginal Risk has been included near
the immediate LA Gulf Coast for the potential of an increasing
tornado threat prior to the end of the forecast period.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Mon Sep 09 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broad trouhging over the Northwest should continue today as an
embedded perturbation moves eastward over the northern Rockies.
Southwesterly flow aloft is forecast to increase over much of the
West as the broad trough slowly shifts east. At the surface, a cold
front will move into the Rockies, bringing a cooler air mass to
parts of the Northwest, but gusty winds to parts of the Cascades. A
lee trough developing east of the Rockies will help support isolated
dry thunderstorms over parts of WY and MT. Periods of stronger
surface winds and low RH will support elevated to near-critical
fire-weather conditions.
 
...Northwest and Great Basin....
Stronger flow aloft is expected to persist today over much of the
Northwest and northern Great Basin. Surface winds should increase to
15-25 mph as momentum from aloft mixes down. Downsloping and
mid-level drying should keep the air mass quite dry with diurnal RH
minimums below 15% likely. Several hours of widespread elevated to
near-critical fire-weather conditions are likely across the northern
Sierra and Great Basin.

Farther north, more moderate RH of 25-30% is expected beneath the
upper trough and behind the cold front. Despite the arrival of a
cooler Pacific air mass, downslope winds of 15-25 mph should overlap
with dry fuels and pockets of lower RH during the day. Overlapping
with recent lightning and fire activity, a few hours of elevated to
near-critical conditions are possible in the lee of the Cascades as
winds increase.

...Northern Rockies...
Stronger westerly flow head of the embedded shortwave will aid in
deepening a lee trough east of the Rockies. Westerly surface winds
should strengthen in turn, supporting pockets of downslope winds of
15-25 mph across parts of MT and WY. With hot temperatures and
little recent rainfall, afternoon RH values should remain quite low,
generally below 20%. Increasing winds, receptive fuels, and
persistent dry conditions should support several hours of elevated
to near critical fire-weather conditions over parts of the northern
Rockies.

...Dry Thunder...
Isolated, high-based thunderstorms appear likely over parts of the
Rockies (mainly WY and MT) today ahead of the shortwave trough. Weak
buoyancy, and PWATs of 0.5 to 0.7 inches, atop dry and well-mixed
low levels will support poor precipitation efficiency and the
potential for strong outflow winds. At least isolated storms are
expected over areas of receptive fuels. Thus, dry lightning
ignitions are possible, especially across parts of north-central WY,
where storm coverage appears greatest.

## SPC Sep 9, 2024 1630 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook

Day 1 Convective Outlook

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
NEW YORK...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging winds may occur this afternoon across parts of New
York.

...New York...
Within large-scale upper troughing over the Northeast and eastern
Canada, an embedded shortwave trough over southern Ontario and the
upper Great Lakes will continue to move across the Northeast this
afternoon and evening. Ascent associated with this shortwave trough
and related mid-level jet is supporting isolated thunderstorms
across southern Ontario and vicinity. This activity will spread
east-southeastward this afternoon across parts of NY. The airmass
over this region should become only weakly unstable as filtered
daytime heating occurs, with poor mid-level lapse rates, persistent
cloud cover, and modest low-level moisture limiting destabilization.
Still, gradually increasing west-northwesterly winds at low/mid
levels will foster around 25-35 kt of deep-layer shear. This should
support modest thunderstorm organization, with multicells/small
clusters potentially evolving along and downstream of Lake Ontario.
Isolated strong to damaging winds should be the main threat with
this convection as it moves across much of NY this afternoon and
early evening, before eventually weakening with eastward extent with
the loss of daytime heating.

...Northern/Central Rockies and High Plains...
Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon over portions of the northern/central Rockies as a weak
shortwave trough continues eastward. Low-level moisture and related
instability are both expected to remain rather meager into the High
Plains, which should limit updraft intensities. Still, isolated
strong/gusty winds may occur with this high-based activity across
parts of MT/WY where low-level lapse rates can become steepened.
Greater low-level moisture is present farther east into the Dakotas,
along/east of a weak surface low/trough. But, increasing
low/mid-level temperatures and a strong cap should generally inhibit
thunderstorm development through much of the day with eastward
extent across the northern/central Plains.
