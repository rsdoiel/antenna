## Lessons learned in The Building of Lost Causes

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Ten years ago, in Vancouver&#8217;s oldest office building, a few colleagues and I launched what seemed like an impossible venture: a digital newspaper that would stand up to one of the most powerful forces on earth, the oil and gas industry. We funded it through crowdfunding and a handful of &#8220;social impact&#8221; investors who knew...

## Blocking out the audience’s siren song

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

When Fox News pushed back on the lies that the U.S. presidential election in 2020 was &#8220;stolen,&#8221; viewers flocked to far-right outlets like OAN and Newsmax. As the Dominion Voting System&#8217;s lawsuit against Fox News showed, people inside Fox News were so nervous about losing parts of their audience that they caved and gave the...

## Journalism education leads the change we seek

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

This past year, higher education has weathered significant shifts and/or turmoil in leadership; inclusion, diversity and equity practices, and student enrollment, all influenced by economic challenges, demographic changes and political headwinds. College athletics, too, have new policies around name, image, and likeness (NIL) rights, moving toward professionalism and giving athletes greater control over their personal...

## Newsrooms break new ground in AI

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

I’m thrilled to see so many news organizations — in some cases with the help of key funding partners — investing in a concerted exploration of generative AI and what it means for the mission and business of journalism. Our industry has an unfortunate history of having disruptive emerging technologies inflicted upon it, putting us...

## Podcasting becomes the primary strategy, not an afterthought

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The Podglomerate recently brought together some of the brightest minds in audio — from the founder of Lemonada to the president of iHeartPodcasts — to reflect on podcasting in 2024. While observations ranged from the transformative rise of AI to the importance of robust attribution tracking and analytics, there was a clear takeaway from the...

## Get ready for the AI-driven world of news

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Will 2025 be the year that users embrace generative AI-enabled news? There’s no shortage of players betting that it’s coming.  Ask Perplexity about some current event, and it’ll helpfully summarize the information from a half-dozen news sites, including links so you can check its accuracy for yourself.  MIcrosoft’s Bing and Google’s Gemini — and others — will...

## Antitrust and AI news converge and get local

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In my Nieman Lab prediction for 2023, I expected to see a rise in antitrust news. It has indeed been a packed two years for reporters in this beat, often involving market regulation and consumer protection stories. Google faced three monopoly trials, with one of them poised to reshape ad revenues for news publishers. Similarly,...

## Progressive media at a crossroads

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

For many commentators, the 2024 election drove home the power of the ever-evolving right-wing media ecosystem. There seems to be something about the parasocial bonds that people build with media personalities who they spend a lot of time with, and who offer stories to make sense of day-to-day public life, that goes deeper than celebrity...

## Public media reconciles its past with the present

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

When public media makes the news these days, it&#8217;s usually in the form of a negative headline. Accusations of liberal bias have made organizations like PBS and NPR the target of right-wing efforts to defund the entire system. And reports of audience and revenue decline have left newsroom leaders &#8220;fried and frozen,&#8221; a phrase coined...

## Conflict of interest norms will shift

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Have you been on social media lately? Most Americans spend a great deal of time there, and journalists are no different. Since social media became mainstream, and likely even before that, journalists have spent time on multiple platforms disseminating news and finding sources. But the line between journalist-with-a-capital-J and content creator is starting to blur....

## The moral injury epidemic

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In 2019, Wendy Dean, Simon Talbot, and Austin Dean wrote in the journal Federal Practitioner about an increase in clinicians leaving medicine due to &#8220;burnout.&#8221; The reality, they argued, was something different — the reason for so many resignations was the gap between their moral values of putting patient care first, and the inhumane reality...

## Adaptive partnerships in the AI data marketplace

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Journalism faces unprecedented challenges in 2025 as the intersection of artificial intelligence, content creation, and business models reaches a critical juncture. As Google and Meta continue to pivot away from news while introducing new generative AI search and chatbots, the limited revenue and access to audiences that publishers were able to obtain from referral traffic...

## Outlets pivot to promoting action, not just news

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

From the early 2010s until now, our industry saw the rise of what I&#8217;ll call Community Engagement 1.0 — that is, consulting communities about their information needs and genuinely serving our audiences by delivering journalism that fills in those gaps. The earliest explanation of this that I&#8217;ve seen is from a 2011 blog post titled...

## AI adoption matures in small and local newsrooms

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

This past year has been professionally gratifying, as larger local news organizations have begun to take AI adoption seriously. They have refocused internal resources to move beyond mere experimentation, integrating AI-powered products into meaningful workflows. These well-resourced newsrooms now approach AI adoption with the discipline derived from formal product management principles and the software development...

## Local media gets its swagger back

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

With the dizzying array of content creators, influencers, podcasters, and AI bots flooding the market with information and, many times, misinformation, consumers are at the very least exhausted and frustrated by the news or at the very worst avoiding news altogether. Although there is increasing distrust in national news, local news outlets — whether legacy...

## Focus on the people who elect populists

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

I can already imagine the flood of articles we&#8217;ll see analyzing the impact of Trump&#8217;s second presidency on journalism in the coming years. And I understand the concern — Trump’s return to power will indeed affect journalism, much like any government that seeks to undermine or attack our profession. But here’s the problem: When we...
