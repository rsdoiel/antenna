## The media becomes an activist for democracy

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

It&#8217;s time for American journalism to rewrite its own job description. The model used to go like this: Bad things happen. Journalists reveal them. Voters demand change. Politicians respond by reforming institutions. We call this accountability journalism, and it&#8217;s the foundation of the fourth estate. Of course, these linkages were always stronger in theory than...

## Embracing influencers as allies

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

A friend recently shared a social media post about a political scandal rocking Jackson, Mississippi. The post caught my attention because it drew on reporting work done by The Marshall Project&#8217;s local journalists there. But it generated more engagement than any of our own stories — or those from other area news organizations — had...

## Action over analysis

They say that defining the problem is the key to finding the solution. Much work for many years has gone into articulating the many problems confronting journalism and the media. These problems include: A lack of trust in news media to be unbiased and to help people live informed and fulfilling lives. The increase in...

## The New York Times will hire a pro-Trump columnist

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In January 1973, two months after Richard Nixon&#8217;s resounding election victory, the New York Times announced that it was adding a new columnist to its opinion pages: William Safire, a speechwriter for Nixon and his vice president, Spiro Agnew. Safire would go directly from bashing news outlets like the Times on behalf of a dishonest,...

## Watch your language

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

As we enter the new year, journalists need to reassert vigilance about the words we use and whether our choices play down the severity of conditions other humans face. Too often, the humanity of our sources gets diminished in the rush to report. One area that most concerns me is how the Trump administration plans...

## News websites hit an evolutionary dead end

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The news website is dying. It&#8217;s about time, too: Websites are terrible at distributing news. When the internet was fresh and new, it made a lot of sense for media houses to experiment with this new technology. My former employer, the Mail &#038; Guardian, is rightly proud that it was the first-ever African news organization...

## Taking lessons from independent bookstores

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The next time you find yourself leisurely browsing the shelves at your local independent bookstore, ask yourself how that store is still in business.

Take a good look around, because that little store might just hold some answers about...

## No more baby steps in fixing crime coverage

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

We know the beats before we hear them. The crime stories that permeate our phones, laptops, TVs, and radios repeat the same narratives so many time. Every day of our lives, we can expect to see images of police tape outstretched, red and blue lights flashing, sirens blaring, officers inspecting a crime scene. We can...

## Science journalism becomes plain old journalism

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

There are pivotal, life-altering moments when access to trusted information and expert analysis is critical. Cast your mind back to 2020, when news of a deadly coronavirus was all-consuming, and we needed to know: Am I safe? Are my loved ones safe? Why did this happen? How long will this last? Almost overnight, it seemed...

## Accommodating journalists is in — or you’re out

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time over the past year surrounded by cancer patients. Also, being one. I was at the beginning of my journalism career when a cancer diagnosis knocked me off center. I&#8217;m in my early 20s, and none of my ailments are immediately obvious, which is why I&#8217;ve been adamant online and...

## AI turns news into a conversation

In 2025, we won&#8217;t just read the news — we&#8217;ll talk to it, and it will talk back. News will transform from something we passively consume to something we actively experience through voice-first AI that turns text into conversation and readers into participants. I&#8217;m talking about unleashing the most powerful form of human communication —...

## Covering Trump 2.0, now with less Trump

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In the spring of 2017, during the first 100 days of Donald Trump 1.0, I taught a class called Media and Policy Processes. We focused on the media&#8217;s role not only in covering policymaking, but also actively participating: helping government actors signal their positions and preferences to other policymakers, shifting and reflecting public opinion that...

## The rebirth of local news

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The narrative around the news business has felt static for years. We&#8217;re caught in the grips of an ongoing &#8220;mediapocalypse,&#8221; characterized by buyouts, layoffs, and shuttered newsrooms. No one can deny that the environment is challenging. But the emphasis of the story too often obscures a trend that should be the source of real optimism:...

## To hell with algorithms

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

During economic downturns, people seek small comforts to offset broader hardships — what Estée Lauder chairman Leonard Lauder dubbed the &#8220;Lipstick Effect&#8221; 25 years ago. In 2025, I predict we&#8217;ll see a similar pattern in news consumption: an embrace of human-curated content as comfort food for our algorithm-weary minds. This comfort-seeking behavior parallels trends in...

## Adjusting to a tech-heavy but code-light world

In 2025 — and beyond — we will discover, once again, that the transformative new shiny gizmos we put to work in newsrooms are just the beginning of a long, continuous journey to improving journalism and society. In the past couple of years, newsrooms have been flooded with offers for new state-of-the-art software solutions that...

## Journalism as a social service

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

It&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day, 2022. Nearly everyone in the U.S. is commemorating the holiday. Most are gathering with friends and family, some for the first time since the start of the COVID pandemic, combatting a rising epidemic of loneliness and alienation plaguing every community in the country. When they turn on NPR&#8217;s morning news roundup, they&#8217;re...

## A renewed appetite for print

date: 2024-12-11, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In August, I canceled my weekend delivery of a print newspaper. By November, I&#8217;d resubscribed, longing for something I missed most during the pandemic: serendipity. This past Saturday, while leafing through The New York Times, I learned that Kim Deal, former bassist of the Pixies, lives in Dayton, Ohio. I stumbled upon an article about...

The decision by the European Federation of Journalists, the largest such organization in Europe, to stop posting on Twitter as of January 20, 2025, signals a broader media shift towards social media and news sharing alternatives. &#8220;The EFJ considers that it can no longer ethically participate in a social network that its owner has transformed...

## Journalists fight digital decay

date: 2024-12-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

As journalists, authors, and photographers, our work shapes how history remembers the world. But in 2025, the fight to preserve this work feels more urgent than ever. Digital fragility and denialism threaten to erode the integrity of our stories, making preservation a moral imperative. Decades of photojournalism, often captured under the most challenging conditions, are...

## A generation of journalists moves on

date: 2024-12-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Journalism should be the greatest job in the world, but for many journalists — even at top news outlets — it isn’t. Even the best journalists have to worry about layoffs, changes in ownership, stagnant pay and the life sacrifices the job often requires. Freeing four wrongfully convicted people from prison with her reporting wasn’t...

## Prediction markets go mainstream

## Maybe we really are done with news?

Years of year-end predictions reveal a journalism industry battered about by change.

These topics are all important and worthy of our attention,...

## A new generation of knowledge management tools

The typical inverted-pyramid news article is like airplane food — edible but to no one&#8217;s taste.

## The podcast middle class will continue to shrink

date: 2024-12-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

During the podcasting gold rush of the 2010s, the industry saw an injection of capital into its middle class: the creators who did this work professionally but who weren&#8217;t multimillionaires, those whose success was modest, not explosive. The podcast middle class is a range of shows operating in the $100,000 to $500,000 budget range, which...

## Newsrooms fight back against criminalization

In 2025, attacks on journalists are set to escalate. A disturbing global trend continues to expand: the use of criminal law to silence journalists.

## Humanness > authenticity

date: 2024-12-10, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Rather than focus on authenticity, media organizations will double down on journalists&#8217; humanness in its many forms.

## Journalists embrace transparency about the business side

For as long as we’ve been talking about journalism’s credibility crisis, we’ve been talking about one possible solution: more transparency about how journalists do their jobs. The story goes like this: People distrust the news because they don’t know how it gets made, which leads to inaccurate assumptions about journalists’ motivations and practices. So if...

For many commentators, the 2024 election drove home the power of the ever-evolving right-wing media ecosystem. There seems to be something about the parasocial bonds that people build with media personalities who they spend a lot of time with, and who offer stories to make sense of day-to-day public life, that goes deeper than celebrity...

## Public media reconciles its past with the present

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

When public media makes the news these days, it&#8217;s usually in the form of a negative headline. Accusations of liberal bias have made organizations like PBS and NPR the target of right-wing efforts to defund the entire system. And reports of audience and revenue decline have left newsroom leaders &#8220;fried and frozen,&#8221; a phrase coined...

## Conflict of interest norms will shift

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Have you been on social media lately? Most Americans spend a great deal of time there, and journalists are no different. Since social media became mainstream, and likely even before that, journalists have spent time on multiple platforms disseminating news and finding sources. But the line between journalist-with-a-capital-J and content creator is starting to blur....

## The moral injury epidemic

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In 2019, Wendy Dean, Simon Talbot, and Austin Dean wrote in the journal Federal Practitioner about an increase in clinicians leaving medicine due to &#8220;burnout.&#8221; The reality, they argued, was something different — the reason for so many resignations was the gap between their moral values of putting patient care first, and the inhumane reality...

Journalism faces unprecedented challenges in 2025 as the intersection of artificial intelligence, content creation, and business models reaches a critical juncture.

## Outlets pivot to promoting action, not just news

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

From the early 2010s until now, our industry saw the rise of what I&#8217;ll call Community Engagement 1.0 — that is, consulting communities about their information needs and genuinely serving our audiences by delivering journalism that fills in those gaps. The earliest explanation of this that I&#8217;ve seen is from a 2011 blog post titled...

This past year has been professionally gratifying, as larger local news organizations have begun to take AI adoption seriously.

## Local media gets its swagger back

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

With the dizzying array of content creators, influencers, podcasters, and AI bots flooding the market with information and, many times, misinformation, consumers are at the very least exhausted and frustrated by the news or at the very worst avoiding news altogether. Although there is increasing distrust in national news, local news outlets — whether legacy...

## Focus on the people who elect populists

date: 2024-12-09, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

I can already imagine the flood of articles we&#8217;ll see analyzing the impact of Trump&#8217;s second presidency on journalism in the coming years. And I understand the concern — Trump’s return to power will indeed affect journalism, much like any government that seeks to undermine or attack our profession. But here’s the problem: When we...
