## 2024 Anarchist’s Gift Guide: Day 5

date: 2024-12-01, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Day 5: Hans Karlsson &#38; Jason Lonon Scorps/Inshaves Good scorps/inshaves are expensive and difficult to come by. Most of the used and discount scorps I’ve seen are not worth messing with.

Day 3: Old Town Utility Jacket (&#38; a Work Jacket) For many years, Old Town has made fantastic custom workwear (chairmaker John Brown was a customer). It now seems that the company is simplifying its operations and not taking on any new customers for custom work. But despair not, for Old Town is still supplying...

## ‘Backwoods Chairmakers’ Supplemental Details

date: 2024-11-25, from: Lost Arg Press blog

Following some questions from a couple of readers, Andy Glenn, author of &#8220;Backwoods Chairmakers: In Search of the Appalachian Ladderback Chairmaker,&#8221; writes: The post-and-rung chairs found in the final chapters of “Backwoods Chairmakers“ were printed without dimensions. This was by design; it was not an omission or mistake.&#160;The intention is for the chairmaker to make...
