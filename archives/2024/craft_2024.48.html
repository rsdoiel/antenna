<p>Day 5: Hans Karlsson &amp; Jason Lonon Scorps/Inshaves Good
scorps/inshaves are expensive and difficult to come by. Most of the used
and discount scorps I’ve seen are not worth messing with. I’ve tried
grinding them and even cold-bending their handles in an effort to make
them work. Most times the old tool simply wasn’t made…</p>

<p>Day 2: Origin Work Jeans Made in MaineI’m always looking for good
