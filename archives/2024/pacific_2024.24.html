<p>(BPT) - In today’s world, environmental consciousness is a driving
force behind consumer purchase decisions for everyday items like
clothing, housewares and even tires. With sustainability on the minds of
drivers — many considering EVs or hybrid vehicles to reduce their carbon
footprint — Hankook Tire recently explored drivers’ preferences when
shopping for tires that are also good for the planet. Here’s where the

<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest misconceptions in baseball is that teams without highly ranked farm systems have no prospects to offer in trade deadline deals. In fact, every organization has prospects other teams covet &amp;#8212; even those with the bottom-ranked farms &amp;#8212; and if a team is determined to make a deal, a deal can usually be had. That said, it&amp;#8217;s far easier for teams to land their top trade targets if they have a larger pool of attractive prospects to deal from, and it&amp;#8217;s easier for those teams to part with talented prospects when they have more in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

Truth 51: The China Poli-tricking has Begun!!!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-11, updated: 2024-06-12, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is the perception of the Governor’s statement
to “pivot away from China” seems to have been totally misinterpreted, as
it’s just a poli-trick! The assertion that the Governor and those who
appreciate his pivot of dedicating our resources away from China are
“against Chinese Tourists,” are so far from the truth they must be in
the Andromeda Galaxy seeing time lapses of the CNMI. I want to make it
perfectly CLEAR, as I’m sure it is safe to say that virtually “NO ONE is
against Chinese Tourists coming to the CNMI.”  But WE (the CNMI)
shouldn’t be putting “all our bets on China” figuratively given the fact
WE cannot and will never be able to predict what the Chinese Government
will do, as everything can change in the blink-of-an-eye for TRUE!  The
Governor made a “SAFE &amp; SOUND” call, and I don’t see the Governor
nor anyone trying to prevent Chinese Tourists from coming — just
political talk (poli-tricking) against the Governor and no ideas offered
on what else WE can do beyond China. Yet, WE the People have two entire
industries (Cannabis Tourism &amp; Hemp Industry) that have yet to be
fully functioning and one is even costing us money.  I don’t see the
China supporters doing any supporting and promoting of these two
potential NEW Revenues for the CNMI. PROPONENTs &amp; OPPONENTs of China
need to read my last opinion Op ed on the Casino Commission, which is
something everyone needs to read about our own self-destruction and our
future that is definitely beyond China’s influence alone that WE can
control — for TRUE! WE must and can do a much better job of controlling
our fate!</p>
