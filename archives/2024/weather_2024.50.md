...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley into
much of the Southeast States today and tonight. The potential for
severe thunderstorms currently appears low.

...Southeast States...
Neutral height tendencies will tend to prevail over the region as a
low-amplitude shortwave trough over the Lower Ohio Valley and
Tennessee Valley races east-northward toward the Mid-Atlantic
seaboard. Convergence will tend to remain weak diurnally near a
northward-shifting warm front across the Tennessee Valley, until
modest surface cyclogenesis occurs tonight across the ArkLaMiss and
Mid-South, coincident with a stronger secondary cold front
accelerating southeastward across the ArkLaMiss/East Texas.
Semi-steady warm/moist advection will persist in/near the warm
sector spanning parts of Louisiana/Mississippi/Alabama into
eventually nearby portions of Georgia and Tennessee. 

The persistent warm advection regime over the middle Gulf Coast will
maintain isolated thunderstorm chances through the day. Despite
40-50 knot mid-level flow, weak low to mid-level lapse rates will
modulate updraft intensities and tend to limit the likelihood of
overly organized convection for much of the day. 

The potential for thunderstorms should regionally increase tonight
as the aforementioned upstream cold front/modestly deepening surface
low interact with higher theta-e air. Even with favorable low-level
moistening/destabilization trends, the scenario may not provide
sufficient destabilization for robust deep convection tonight. As
mentioned in the prior outlook discussion, most convection-allowing
guidance remains rather subdued as far as severe attributes, with
the typically aggressive FV3 being a modest exception.

Subsequent outlooks will closely reevaluate this scenario and the
potential need for low wind/tornado probabilities, as more favorable
destabilization trends could prompt more of a severe risk given the
severe-conducive deep-layer/low-level shear.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CST Mon Dec 09 2024

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA COAST...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST...

...Synopsis...
Critical to extremely critical fire weather conditions are expected
Tuesday morning along the southern California coast. An unseasonably
strong surface high across the northern Great Basin will maintain a
robust offshore pressure gradient along the southern CA coast for
much of Tuesday and into early Wednesday (see the current D1 Fire
Outlook for additional details regarding the synoptic regime).
Recent guidance continues to suggest that the LAX-DAG gradient
should peak sometime during the 12-17 UTC period Tuesday morning at
around -9 to -10 mb. A gradient of this magnitude typically supports
wind gusts within the coastal terrain between 50-70 mph, though
localized stronger gusts appear possible based on some high-res
solutions. 

By early Tuesday morning the offshore flow regime will be well
established with 12 hours of preceding downslope warming/drying. Not
only will this support more widespread areas of single-digit RH
values (and extremely critical fire weather conditions), but should
also promote rapid curing/drying of 1 and 10-hour fuels.
Consequently, the greatest fire weather threat will likely emerge
Tuesday morning. Recent ensemble guidance and high-res deterministic
solutions suggests extremely critical conditions will be most
widespread across western Los Angeles and eastern Ventura counties
within the San Gabriel and Sierra Madre mountains, though localized 
extremely critical conditions will be possible further south along
the southern CA coast.

## SPC Dec 8, 2024 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance is in good agreement that a deep upper trough
will be over much of the central and eastern CONUS early
D4/Wednesday morning. At the same time, a surface low is forecast to
be over eastern PA, with an attendant cold front extending
southwestward from this low across the central Carolinas,
southeastern GA, and northern FL.

A shortwave trough is forecast to move within the larger upper
troughing, moving from the TN Valley/Southeast through the
Mid-Atlantic on D4/Wednesday. This evolution will help induce a more
negative tilt to the parent troughing while encouraging an eastward
shift and deamplification as well. The cold front will also quickly
shift eastward off the East Coast. A fairly narrow warm sector may
precede this front, but poor lapse rates will limit instability.
This low buoyancy will counter the strong shear expected, resulting
in mostly weak updrafts and tempering any severe potential.

Stable conditions are expected across the CONUS on D5/Thursday as
high pressure shifts from the northern Plains into the OH Valley.
Some modest moisture return may potentially begin across TX on
D6/Friday ahead of a low-amplitude, southern-stream shortwave trough
expected to move across the southern Plains late D6/Friday and early
D7/Saturday. Guidance varies on the strength and speed of this wave,
limiting predictability, but some thunderstorms are possible across
central/east TX and LA late D6/Friday and early D7/Saturday as this
wave interacts with the return moisture.
