Tesla held its quarterly report yesterday, and stated that six major
products would be ready for action next year. This would suggest that

oh, just <em>all human work</em>.

But we’ve heard all this before, and forgive us for saying that it seems
slightly more likely that the boy is crying wolf.

Remember the ELF? It was one of the first ever electric bike cars to
actually reach production. Nearly a thousand of the hand-built
three-wheeled electric vehicles were delivered between 2013 and 2019,
when an unfortunate bankruptcy seemed to mark a regrettable end to the
world’s first production electric bike car.

<p>
But just like any good comeback story, it turned out that the last
chapter had yet to be written.

faster? It’s true, but perhaps not how you expected.
