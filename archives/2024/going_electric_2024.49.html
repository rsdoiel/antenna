bike. More specifically, it’s about how today, on Giving Tuesday, the
e-bike company Lectric eBikes is setting an example not just for the
entire e-bike industry, but for modern capitalism as a whole with a
philanthropic program that speaks to the core of the company’s values.

<p>
We don’t want to sound alarmist,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/14/which-electric-vehicles-qualify-us-federal-tax-credit-ev-2024/">but
it sure looks like President-elect Donald Trump and his billionaire
buddies are plotting to kill federal EV tax credits somewhat sooner than
later</a> – and the tariffs they’re promising aren’t going to make cars
cheaper anytime soon, either. So if you’re in the market for a new EV,
the time is now to score a sweet 0% financing deal and get those tax
credits
