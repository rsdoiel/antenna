<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/jeep/">Jeep</a> and Dodge owner
Stellantis announced a new partnership on Thursday to develop new EV
batteries with “game-changing” energy density. Stellantis said the new
batteries are expected to unlock significantly more range and 50% faster
charging speeds. Even better, they’re expected to cost less than half
the price per kWh of current battery tech.

bike. More specifically, it’s about how today, on Giving Tuesday, the

entire e-bike industry, but for modern capitalism as a whole with a
philanthropic program that speaks to the core of the company’s values.
