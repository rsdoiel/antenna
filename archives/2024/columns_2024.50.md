**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/08/29/hope.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Yesterday I did a <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/12/09/weAllOwnAndNoOneOwnsPodcasting.html">podcast</a> about why it's important to choose humble names for groups of developers working on open formats, using podcasting as an example. Another case in point, the <a href="https://socialwebfoundation.org/">Social Web Foundation</a>, which is about ActivityPub and the Fediverse, when there are many other forms of the social web. Here's where the rubber meets the road. They're having a meeting in Brussels where people can demo their social web apps, but it's only about ActivityPub. If you have a project for Bluesky, or Threads, or non-ActivityPub Mastodon, or <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> for that matter, you should feel welcome there, regardless of what their <a href="https://socialwebfoundation.org/2024/11/01/fosdem-2025-social-web-devroom-call-for-participation/">Call For Participation</a> says.

## 2024-12-09 Burned

date: 2024-12-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-12-09-burned">2024-12-09 Burned</h1>

<p>This page is about me burning myself on a Raclette table-grill.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no longer quite sure of the timeline. I think I got the burn on 2024-12-03 or 2024-12-04.</p>

<p><strong>2024-12-05</strong>: Two days ago I got myself a second degree burn about one inch in diameter from our Raclette oven. I hadn’t burned myself in about forty years, I think and I feel like a kid again, observing the body as it reacts. The healing powers are so weird.</p>

<p>Also I’m thankful for these self-healing capabilities we have! And thankful for this accident to be a curiosity instead of an emergency. A good reminder to be thankful for all the good days we have and I hope you’re having a good day! Live long and prosper. Or, as I usually tell me wife: healthy, happy, and in love. Be well.</p>

<p><strong>2024-12-07</strong>: The skin around the burn had reddened and had swollen a bit. I went to the pharmacy and got a disinfectant cream and wound pads. This was Saturday afternoon and no more doctors were available. Since this wasn’t an emergency, there&rsquo;s was rush.</p>

<p><strong>2024-12-09</strong>:  The minor burn resulted in some sort of low-key infection, so now it&rsquo;s antibiotic to swallow and antibiotics to apply.</p>

<p>Some things I&rsquo;m learning from this experience:</p>

<ol>
<li>I knew about cold, running water and left my arm under that cold tap for many long minutes. Maybe not long enough? I don&rsquo;t know. It felt ready to fall off. 😆</li>
<li>The burn might look like a typical abrasion but you have to keep it super clean. Best cover it with those special wound covers that don&rsquo;t stick to the wound (nothing we would have had at home so off to the pharmacy you go, immediately, unlike me).</li>
<li>It might look dry and clean like blisters you got from a long hike but the bedsheets or long sleeves or whatever will pass on germs and since there is a piece of your exterior protection missing, you&rsquo;ll get an infection. The skin around the wound is a bit red, the area a bit swollen, a bit warmer. And that already concerns the doctors.</li>
</ol>

## December 9, 2024 

date: 2024-12-10, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

The sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Syria yesterday took oxygen away from the airing of President-elect Trump&#8217;s interview with Kristen Welker of NBC&#8217;S Meet the Press. The interview told us little that we didn&#8217;t already know, but it did reinforce what we can expect in the new administration.

## 2024-12-09 ed is the standard

date: 2024-12-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-12-09-ed-is-the-standard">2024-12-09 ed is the standard</h1>

<p><code>ed</code> is <a href="true-path">the standard editor</a>, they say.
I have strange fascination with it.</p>

<p><code>ed</code> is a window in the past.
This is a line-based editor, not a screen-based editor.
It can be used with a line-printer instead of a screen.
This also means that working with it is very different.
I&rsquo;ll try to collect some interesting command sequences
on this page.</p>

<p>I use <code>ed</code> to send mail from the command line. One way
I do this is by using <code>mail</code> on the server. It&rsquo;s a
line-oriented mail client. You can use any editor with
it, but the default feels very close to <code>ed</code>.</p>

<p>When I started reading newsgroups again, I used <code>tin</code>
and made it use <code>ed</code> as the editor.</p>

<p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s growing on me. 😅</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m not alone! On fedi, I&rsquo;m following
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@aartaka" title="@aartaka@merveilles.town">@aartaka</a> who occasionally posts things
about <code>ed</code>.</p>

<p>And so, in order to get better with it, I decided
to write this page. I expect to be adding to it.</p>

<p>Also check out <a href="https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/actually-using-ed/">Actually using ed</a>
by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@tejr" title="@tejr@mastodon.sdf.org">@tejr</a>.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>Try <code>man ed</code> or <code>info ed</code> to learn more about the commands
available to you within <code>ed</code>.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://io.mwl.io/@mwl" title="@mwl@io.mwl.io">@mwl</a>. wrote <a href="https://mwl.io/nonfiction/tools#ed">Ed Mastery</a>
which motivated me to get into <code>ed</code>.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-new-file">Create a new file</h2>

<p>Start <code>ed</code> without a file name. You&rsquo;ll be editing &ldquo;lines&rdquo; in a &ldquo;buffer&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The commands to use:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>i</code> to insert a few lines</li>
<li><code>.</code> on a line by itself ends the insertion of lines</li>
<li><code>w filename</code> writes the buffer to a file (and prints the number of bytes written)</li>
<li><code>q</code> quits the editor</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed
i
Hello World!

This is a letter from me to you.
.
w hello.txt
47
q
</code></pre>

<h2 id="edit-an-existing-file">Edit an existing file</h2>

<p>When we provide ed with a filename, it is read into the buffer (and the number of bytes read are printed).
The current line is the last line of the buffer.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>a</code> appends new lines after the current line</li>
<li><code>.</code> on a line by itself ends the appending of lines</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed hello.txt 
47
.
This is a letter from me to you.
a

And that was it!
.
w
65
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>ed</code> is line-oriented and so we can provide line numbers and line ranges to our commands.
If you omit a line number or the range, these commands apply to the current line only.
A range is two comma-separated line numbers.
If you omit numbers, defaults are &ldquo;from the first line&rdquo; and &ldquo;to the last line&rdquo;.
Thus, a single comma means &ldquo;all the lines&rdquo;.
<code>$</code> is always the last line.
Relative addressing with negative offsets like <code>-1</code> and positive offsets like <code>+1</code> works as well.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>p</code> prints the lines</li>
<li><code>n</code> numbers the lines</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all equivalent:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>1,5p</code></li>
<li><code>1,$p</code></li>
<li><code>,p</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So now let&rsquo;s number the lines and then append to the first paragraph.
Use <code>n</code> to find the right line number to append to, and use <code>p</code> at the end to proofread.</p>

<pre><code>,n
1	Hello World!
2	
3	This is a letter from me to you.
4	
5	And that was it!
3a
It's pretty short, I know. I didn't have enough time to make it longer.
.
w
137
,p
Hello World!

This is a letter from me to you.
It's pretty short, I know. I didn't have enough time to make it longer.

And that was it!
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how we could only append new lines after the third line. We couldn&rsquo;t append new words to the third line itself.
What we can do is join two lines, though.
Unfortunately, that doesn&rsquo;t add a space!</p>

<p>One option is to add a single line containing a space.
The other option is to use a substitution to add a space. That&rsquo;s what we will use.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>s/from/to/</code> replaces regular expression <code>from</code> with string <code>to</code>.</li>
<li><code>j</code> joins lines in the range</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing that this concerns lines 3 and 4 there is no need to use <code>n</code>.</p>

<pre><code>3s/$/ /
3,4j
p
This is a letter from me to you. It's pretty short, I know. I didn't have enough time to make it longer.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="processing-with-other-tools">Processing with other tools</h2>

<p>There is no way to process the buffer with external tools, but there is a way to do it with the current file.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>w</code> writes the file</li>
<li><code>e</code> edits a filename, replacing the current buffer; or if the argument starts with an exclamation mark, executes the command and replaces the buffer with the output</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>w
137
e !fold -s %
fold -s hello.txt
138
,p
Hello World!

This is a letter from me to you. It's pretty short, I know. I didn't have 
enough time to make it longer.

And that was it!
</code></pre>

<h2 id="to-insert-some-command-output">To insert some command output</h2>

<p>I like to start my blog posts with a level one heading, a date, and some text.
Here&rsquo;s how I would insert a date. Note the invisible space after the <code>#</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>r</code> reads lines from a filename, inserting them into the current buffer; or if the argument starts with an exclamation mark, executes the command and inserts the lines from the output into the buffer</li>
</ul>

<pre>
ed
i
#<mark> </mark>
.
r !date --iso
11
a
 ed is the standard
.
,j
p
# 2024-12-09 ed is the standard
</pre>

<h2 id="using-the-buffer-as-a-workspace">Using the buffer as a workspace</h2>

<p>OK, I know this is weird. But in theory we can think of the buffer
as a huge one-dimensional workspace. We can insert lines from files
and process output here and there, and we can write line ranges
to files.</p>

<p>Here we are writing a haiku, don&rsquo;t like the last line, insert a new
third line and then write just the first three lines to the file.
The fourth line not saved but it is still available in the buffer.</p>

<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed
i
The words grow from lines
a growing snake on the screen
trying to escape
.
w haiku.txt
73
i
running off the page
.
1,3w
77
</code></pre>

<p>In this sense it&rsquo;s unclear what the default filename of the buffer is.
It&rsquo;s the one-dimensional desktop!</p>

<ul>
<li><code>f</code> prints the default filename, or sets it if a filename is provided</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>f
haiku.txt
</code></pre>

<h2 id="using-marks-and-line-arithmetic">Using marks and line arithmetic</h2>

<p>Perhaps working with the buffer as a long, one-dimensional workspace
makes more sense if you drop markers as you work with files. Use <code>k</code>
followed by a lower case letter.</p>

<p>Here we insert a first haiku, mark the first line, insert a new haiku,
mark its beginning, and then we print the two, using the marks and
some line arithmetic.</p>

<pre><code>r haiku.txt
77
1ka
a
Lines grow from the left
voices talking in my head
overhead, a lamp
.
-2kb
'a,'a+2p
The words grow from lines
a growing snake on the screen
running off the page
'b,'b+2p
Lines grow from the left
voices talking in my head
overhead, a lamp
'b,$w haiku2.txt
68
</code></pre>

<h2 id="hit-enter-too-soon">Hit Enter too soon</h2>

<p>Something I do often enough: I hit the Enter key when I didn&rsquo;t mean to.
Fix it by beginning the new line with a space. Finish the line, and join the previous line with the current line:</p>

<pre><code>i
Hello
 World!
.
-1,.j
p
Hello World!
</code></pre>

I've got the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/09/bingeworthyScreenShot.png">new version of Bingeworthy</a> running here. When I saw how the database code worked, I had to redo it from scratch. It was probably my first SQL project, and I barely knew what I was doing. It's too bad, because looking at it from that point of view I could see how SQL could have been much simpler by making some of the optional features automatic. A higher layer on top of SQL is possible, it seems to me. Having ChatGPT review my ideas has been invaluable in this project. I'm going to use it myself for a while, and see how I want to reorganize the user interface. There were opportunities for factoring I didn't take back then because I was in a rush to do something else.

That's part of what it means for it to be open. Developers and users are free to use anyone's ideas, or not use them, even if they claim to be the Holy Church of Some Open Format. No one can form an organization that owns the future of the open format because then it wouldn't be open.

## Trust Issues in AI

date: 2024-12-09, updated: 2024-12-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>For a technology that seems startling in its modernity, AI sure has a long history. Google Translate, OpenAI chatbots, and Meta AI image generators are built on decades of advancements in linguistics, signal processing, statistics, and other fields going back to the early days of computing&#8212;and, often, on seed funding from the U.S. Department of Defense. But today&#8217;s tools are hardly the intentional product of the diverse generations of innovators that came before. We agree with Morozov that the &#8220;refuseniks,&#8221; as he <a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/forum/the-ai-we-deserve/">calls</a> them, are wrong to see AI as &#8220;irreparably tainted&#8221; by its origins. AI is better understood as a creative, global field of human endeavor that has been largely captured by U.S. venture capitalists, private equity, and Big Tech. But that was never the inevitable outcome, and it doesn&#8217;t need to stay that way...</p>

## The Pi 500 is much faster, but lacks M.2

<p>They're also selling a Pi 500 Kit, complete with a Power Supply, Mouse, and micro HDMI to HDMI cable, for $120. This is the first time Raspberry Pi is selling a complete package, where every part of a desktop computer could be Pi-branded—and makes me wonder if uniting all these parts into one could result in an eventual Pi Laptop...</p>

<p>Before we get too deep, <em>no</em>, the Pi 500 does not include a built-in M.2 slot. <em>Sort-of</em>.</p>

## We’ve done it before

date: 2024-12-09, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

During WWII, the United States government incarcerated over one hundred thousand Americans because they were of Japanese descent, two-thirds of them American citizens. Their bank accounts were locked and they were forced to leave behind their homes, pets, businesses and possessions to live in remote, barren camps guarded by armed soldiers. They had to grow [&#8230;]

## Why AI will eat the browser

date: 2024-12-08, from: Om Malik blog

In this week&#8217;s edition of my newsletter, CrazyStupidTech, I posted a reported essay on the future of browsers in the age of AI, with reflections on their past, and their role in our multi-device, machine-first, information-dense extended reality. My thinking was prompted by immersing myself in new devices (such as Vision Pro) and new technologies &#8230;

These are all worthy goals, but in my experience Mozilla has been an <i>obstacle</i> to these things. I wrote in a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/113617569413777710">comment</a> on Mastodon, "A long time ago they invited me to present my ideas, and like an idiot I thought that's what they wanted, instead it was an ambush, people mostly wanting to ridicule me because they thought anything that a person does can't be any good, it has to come from a big company like Mozilla or Google. I thought then and still do now, how do they justify wasting their time on such a ridiculous thing. I kept on doing what I was doing, but switched off their browser first chance I got." If they really want to get behind projects that make the open web stronger, I'd be happy to help guide them, but only if they've sobered up and take that mission statement seriously, instead of just as a justification for holding on to their jobs a little bit longer.
