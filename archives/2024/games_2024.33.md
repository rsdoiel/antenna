date: 2024-08-16, updated: 2024-08-16, from: Polygon Website

Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s new trailer is chock-full of details that my Tumblr mutuals keep screenshotting and dissecting. But those uninitiated with the deeper lore of the franchise might be wondering why everyone is specifically going feral for the woman who shapeshifts from the form of a giant crow. I mean, besides the fact that [&#8230;]

Medallions are an item added in Fortnite as of Chapter 5 Season 1, but as seasons have progressed, they’ve been changed.

## Wolverine’s live-action mask had to contend with VFX and the fandom

date: 2024-08-16, updated: 2024-08-16, from: Polygon Website

Fans and filmmakers have been feuding over what Wolverine’s costume should look like in live action since the first X-Men movie ditched his bumblebee-colored comics costume in favor of black leather, then lampshaded the change with some only-for-fans character snark. (X-Men ’97 recently referenced that moment and flipped the script.) A deleted scene in 2013’s [&#8230;]
