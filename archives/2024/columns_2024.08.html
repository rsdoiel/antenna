<p>
LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have
become increasingly capable and can now interact with tools (i.e., call
functions), read documents, and recursively call themselves. As a
result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the
rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how
LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about
the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.
</p>
<p>
In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites,
performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL
injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need
to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely
enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and
leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of
such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show
that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in
websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread
deployment of LLMs…

Apart from getting started in the midst of one of Silicon Valley’s
regular downturns, another great thing about the beginnings of Nvidia
was that instead of insisting on the “minimum viable product” our VCs,
Sutter Hill and Sequoia, gave us the time to develop a real architecture
for a family of chips. It enabled us to get an amazing amount of
functionality into a half-micron gate array;
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/hardware-io-virtualization.html">I/O
virtualization</a>, a DMA engine, a graphics processor that rendered
curved surfaces directly, not by approximating them with triangles, a
sound engine and support for game controllers. As I write, after a three
decade-long history of bringing innovations to the market, Nvidia is
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c43661bb-a087-4a54-a4b4-a6549d9156c3">America’s
third most valuable company</a>. <br /> <br /> I’ve written
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search/label/venture%20capital">several
times</a> about how in pursuit of a quicker buck, VCs have largely
discarded the slow process of building an IPO-ready company like Nvidia
in favor of building one that will be acquired by one of the dominant
monopolists. These VCs don’t support innovation. Even if their
acquisition-bound companies do innovate in their short lives, their
innovations are rarely tested in the market after the acuisition.<br />
<br /> Below the fold I discuss a new paper that presents a highly
detailed look at the mechanisms the dominant companies use to neutralize
the threats startups could pose to their dominance.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> In
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845"><i>Coopting
Disruption</i></a> law professors Mark Lemley (Stanford) and Matthew
Wansley (Cardozo) ask a good question:<br />
<blockquote>
Our economy is dominated by five aging tech giants—Alphabet, Amazon,
Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Each of these firms was founded more than
twenty years ago: Apple and Microsoft in the 1970s, Google and Amazon in
the 1990s, and Facebook in 2004. Each of them grew by successfully
commercializing a disruptive technology—personal computers (Apple),
operating systems (Microsoft), online shopping (Amazon), search engines
(Google), and social networks (Facebook). Each of them displaced the
incumbents that came before them. But in the last twenty years, no
company has commercialized a new technology in a way that threatens the
tech giants. Why?
</blockquote>
The TL;DR of Lemley and Wansley’s answer to their question
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">is</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
While there are many reasons for the tech giants’ continued dominance,
we think an important and overlooked one is that they have learned how
to coopt disruption. They identify potentially disruptive technologies,
use their money to influence the startups developing them, strategically
dole out access to the resources the startups need to grow, and seek
regulation that will make it harder for the startups to compete. When a
threat emerges, they buy it off. And after they acquire a startup, they
redirect its people and assets to their own innovation needs.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">They observe
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
a company that is started with the goal of being swallowed by a tech
giant probably isn’t contributing much to society.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
They start by identifying the advantages and disadvantages the
incumbents possess in their efforts to monetize innovations. Their list
of advantages is:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“large incumbents can take advantage of economies of scale” not just in
manufacturing, but also in marketing an distribution by exploiting their
existing customer relationships.
</li>
<li>
“Large incumbents can also take advantage of economies of scope.
Innovation creates “involuntary spillovers”—new knowledge that has
economic value beyond the specific product that the firm was
developing.”
</li>
<li>
“large incumbents can access capital at a lower cost” for example from
retained earnings from their cash cows.
</li>
<li>
“large incumbents may have another potential advantage—a longer
investment time horizon” even more so now with the compression of VC
time horizons.
</li>
</ul>
Their list of incumbents disadvantages in innovation is more
interesting:<br />
<ol>
<li>
“their success will cannibalize their own market share” or “More
generally, a monopolist has diminished incentives to introduce new
products, improve product quality, or lower prices because any new sales
generated replace its existing sales.” Economists call this “Arrow’s
replacement effect”; more specifically: “The general lesson is, all else
equal, the larger a firm’s market share and the less it is threatened by
competition, the weaker its incentives to innovate. So we should expect
large incumbents to not innovate much. And if they can dispense with the
competitors rather than have to compete with them, they will do that.”
</li>
<li>
“their managers prefer to deliver incremental innovations to their
existing customers”. Unlike Arrow’s theory, “Christensen’s theory of
disruptive innovation, … focuses on the career incentives of middle
managers … Incumbent managers have an incentive to deliver sustaining
innovations—incremental improvements in quality to the firm’s existing
products that will please its existing customers. But they have
substantial disincentives to pursue projects that upset the apple cart,
even if doing so would bring new customers to the firm” The fundamental
problem is that “Housing an innovation project inside a firm with
diverse lines of business creates conflict with those other businesses.
Some firm assets—cash, cloud computing, equipment, facilities, and
engineers’ time—are rivalrous and finite, so executives must be willing
to fight internal constituencies to devote those resources to
innovation.” Ingenuity, NASA’s wildly successful Mars helicopter is a
good example, as Eric Berger reports in
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/before-ingenuity-ever-landed-on-mars-scientists-almost-managed-to-kill-it/"><i>Before
Ingenuity ever landed on Mars, scientists almost managed to kill
it</i></a>. It was competing for cost, weight and risk with
Perseverance’s primary mission.
</li>
<li>
“their single veto point decision-making structure encourages
risk-aversion” More specifically: “Inside a large incumbent, decisions
about whether to fund an innovative project must pass through one veto
point. In the venture capital market, many competing investors
independently decide whether to finance an innovative idea. Inside a
firm, an employee with an innovative idea must pitch an idea to managers
who ultimately report to one executive gate-keeper. In the venture
capital market, if a would-be startup founder pitches an idea to ten VC
firms, and nine of them are not persuaded, the idea gets funded.” The
advantage of market-based finance over internal finance applies not just
to the initiation but also the continuation of an innovation project.
Inside a firm, an executive who has soured on a project can terminate
it. In the venture capital market, when a startup’s initial investors
grow skeptical, the company can still pitch outsiders on infusing more
cash.” The authors make this important point (my emphasis): “And while
economists often describe markets as efficient, there is no reason to
believe individual corporate executives make efficient (or even
rational) decisions. Just ask Twitter. Markets work not because private
executives make good decisions but because the ones who make bad
decisions get driven out. But <b>that dynamic only works with
competition</b>.”
</li>
<li>
“they cannot appropriately compensate employees working on innovation
projects.” The reason they cannot is that: “Startups solve this problem
by giving employees stock options. Every employee with significant
equity knows that if the startup successfully exits, they will be
rewarded. Stock in a large, diversified public company does not create
similar incentives. The incentives are diluted because the value of the
stock will be affected by too many variables unrelated to the success of
the specific innovation project.” And that: “large firms do not
recognize internal “property rights” to innovations that employees
develop. If they did, employees might become reluctant to share
information. But not protecting internal property rights gives
innovative employees incentive to leave. If employees at a large firm
found their own startup and raise venture capital to fund it, they will
earn a much greater share of the profits of the innovation.”
</li>
</ol>
The authors go on to describe five techniques incumbents use to
neutralize the threat of disruption that innovative startups might pose;
network effects, self-preferencing, paying for defaults, cloning, and
coopting the disruptor. They claim other have described the first four,
but they don’t amount to an adequate explanation for why the tech giants
haven’t been disrupted. I will summarize each of the four in turn..
<h3>
Network effects
</h3>
Nearly three decades ago W. Brian Arthur, in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967"><i>Increasing
Returns and Path Dependence in the Economy</i></a> explained how
increasing returns to scale, or network effects, of technology markets
typically led to them being dominated by one player. Consider a new
market opened up by a technologcal development. Several startups enter,
for random reasons one gets bigger then the others, network effects
amplify its advantage in a feedback loop.<br /> <br /> This effect is
more important now, as the the giants’ business models have evolved to
become
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">platforms</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The tech giants’ core businesses are built on platforms. A platform is
an intermediary in a two-sided market. It connects users on one side of
the market with users on the other side for transactions or
interactions.<br /> …<br /> Platforms tend to exhibit network
effects—the addition of a new user increases the value of a platform to
existing users and attracts new users.
</blockquote>
This is precisely the mechanism Brian Arthur described, but applied to a
business model that has since been enabled by the Internet.<br />
<h3>
Self-preferencing
</h3>
Self-preferencing happens when a platform isn’t just a two-sided market,
but one in which the platform itself is
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">a vendor</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Amazon, for example, both invites third party vendors to sell their
products in its online marketplace and sells its own house brands that
compete with those vendors. Amazon has a powerful advantage in that
competition. It has access to data on all of its competitors—who their
customers are, which products are selling well, and which prices work
best. And it controls which ads consumers see when they search for a
specific product. Assuming Amazon uses that information to prefer its
own products to those of its competitors (either by pricing
strategically or by promoting its own products in search results) –
something alleged but not yet proven in a pending antitrust case – the
result is to bias competition. Vendors cannot realistically protest
Amazon’s self-preferencing (or just go elsewhere) because Amazon has
such a dominant share in the online retail market.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Paying for defaults
</h3>
The value of the default position is notorious
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">because</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Alphabet pays Apple a reported $18 billion (with a b) each year for
Google to be the default search engine on iOS devices. Android and iOS
together account for 99% of the U.S. mobile operating system market.
Consequently, almost everyone who uses a smartphone in America is
accustomed to Google search. Alphabet claims that “competition is just a
click away.” But research and experience have shown that defaults can be
somewhat sticky. So controlling the default position can give Alphabet
(or whoever wins the Apple bid) an advantage. That said, someone has to
be the default, and it might be better for consumers if the default is
the search engine most users already prefer. The real problem might be
the idea of paying for placement, whoever wins the bidding war.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Cloning
</h3>
There are many examples of a tech giant tryng to neutralize the threat
from a startup by using the threat of cloning their product to force the
startup to sell itself, or of actually cloning the product and using
their market power to swamp the startup. Meta’s addition of Reels to
Instagram in response to Tik Tok is an obvious example. But the authors
make two good points:
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">First</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Cloning is only objectionable if the tech giant wins out not by
competition on the merits, but by exclusionary conduct.
</blockquote>
Second, that cloning
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">often fails</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Google+, Google’s effort to build a social media service that combined
the best of Facebook and Twitter was an abject failure. Apple’s effort
to control the music world’s move to streaming by offering its own
alternative to Spotify hasn’t prevented Spotify from dominating music
streaming and eclipsing the once-vibrant (and Apple-dominated) market
for music downloads. Meta’s effort to copy Snap, then TikTok, by
introducing Stories and Reels has not proven terribly successful, and
certainly has not prevented those companies from building their markets.
</blockquote>
The fact that the giants can clone a startup’s product leads the authors
to <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">ask</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If the product is cloneable, then why would you buy the company and burn
cash paying off its VCs?
</blockquote>
There are two possible answers. It may be faster and easier, though
likely not cheaper, to “acquihire” the startup’s talent than to recruit
equivalent talent in the open market. Or it may be faster and easier,
though likely not cheaper, to acquire the company and its product rather
than cloning it.
<h3>
Inadequate Explanation
</h3>
The authors use the example of
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">Microsoft</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Microsoft enjoyed strong network effects in the 1990s as the dominant
maker of operating system software – far more dominant than it is today.
It cloned internet browser technology from upstarts like Netscape, and
it engaged in anticompetitive conduct designed to ensure that it, not
Netscape, became the browser of choice.82 But Microsoft’s victory over
Netscape was short-lived. New startups – Mozilla and then Google – came
out of nowhere and took the market away from it. Microsoft still
benefits from network effects, and it still uses cloning and
self-preferencing to send users to its Edge browser. But it doesn’t
work. Microsoft employed all the tools of a dominant firm in a network
market, but it still faced disruption.
</blockquote>
So these four techniques aren’t an explanation for the recent dearth of
disruption.<br />
<h3>
Coopting disruption
</h3>
The authors imagine themselves as a tech giant, asking what else they
would do to prevent disruption, and coming up with
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">four new
techniques</a>:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“First, you would learn as much as you can about which companies had the
capability to develop disruptive innovations and try to steer them away
from competing with you – perhaps by partnering with them, or perhaps by
investing in them.”
</li>
<li>
“Second, you would make sure that those companies could not access the
critical resources they would need to transform their innovation into a
disruptive product.”
</li>
<li>
“Third, you would tell your government relations team to seek regulation
that would build a competitive moat around your position and keep
disruption out.”
</li>
<li>
“Fourth, if one of the companies you were tracking nevertheless did
start to develop a disruptive product, you would want extract that
innovation—and choke off the potential competition—in an acquisition.”
</li>
</ul>
These are the techniques they call “coopting disruption”, pointing out
that the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">tech giants
have</a>:<br />
<ul>
<li>
“built a powerful reconnaissance network covering emerging competitive
threats by investing in startups as corporate VCs and by cultivating
relationships with financial VCs.”
</li>
<li>
“accumulated massive quantities of data that are essential for many
software and AI innovations, and they dole out access to this data and
to their networks selectively.”
</li>
<li>
“asked legislators to regulate the tech industry—in a way that will
buttress incumbents.”
</li>
<li>
“repeatedly bought potentially competitive startups in a way that has
flown—until a few years ago—below the antitrust radar.”
</li>
</ul>
The authors detail many examples of each of these techniques, for
example Facebook conditioning access to user data on the purchase of
advertising, and Google’s purchase of DoubleClick and YouTube.
Interestingly, they contrast the recent purchasing of the tech giants
with Cisco’s famously successful purchases in the 90s:
<blockquote>
The Cisco story exemplifies how the venture capital market, as a market,
is better at exploring a series of risky ideas than a firm with a single
risk-averse gatekeeper. It also illustrates how the advantages of a
large incumbent—in this case access to markets and existing customer
relationships—can sometimes extract more market value out of a
technology than a new entrant.
</blockquote>
The rapid evoluution of networking technology at the time meant that
even Cisco, the largest company in the market, didn’t have the R&amp;D
resources to explore all the opportunities. They depended upon VCs to
fund the initial explorations, rewarding them by paying over the odds
for the successes. Their market power then got the successes deployed
much faster than a startup could.<br />
<h3>
Why Is Cooption Bad?
</h3>
The authors explain the
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">harms of
cooption</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Our claim here is that the same dynamics that inhibit disruptive
innovation by longstanding employees of large incumbents inhibit
disruptive innovation by new employees from acquired startups.<br />
…<br /> The tech giants win from coopting disruption even though it
destroys social value. In fact, they benefit in two ways. They make
faster incremental progress on the sustaining innovations that they
want. They get the new code, the valuable intellectual property, and the
fresh ideas of the startup. And, critically, they also kill off a
competitor. They no longer have to worry about the startup actually
developing the more disruptive innovation and leapfrogging them or other
tech giants acquiring the startup and using its assets to compete with
them.
</blockquote>
And, by making the innovators from the startup rich, the acquirer
greatly reduces their incentives for future innovation.
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/02/the-stanford-digital-library-project.html">Andy
Bechtolsheim</a> is an outlier.<br />
<h3>
Remedies?
</h3>
Lemley and Wansley, who seem to think in fours, make a set of four
proposals for how these harms might be reduced:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<b>Unlocking Directorates</b> — under the Clayton Act “interlocking
officers and directors between companies that compete, even in part, are
illegal <i>per se</i> – without any inquiry into whether the companies
in fact restrained competition because of their overlapping interests or
whether the conduct offered procompetitive benefits.” Companies with
less than $4.1M in revenue are exampt, which excludes most startups;
this should be revised.
</li>
<li>
<b>Limiting Leveraging of Data and Networks</b> — “we would impose on
incumbent tech monopolists a presumptive duty of nondiscrimination in
access where the defendant (1) provides or sells data or network access
to at least some unaffiliated companies and (2) refuses to provide or
sell the same data or network access to the plaintiff company on
comparable terms, but (3) the plaintiff does not operate a competing
network or otherwise compete with the defendant in the market from which
it collected the relevant data.”
</li>
<li>
<b>Regulating Regulation</b> — “Done right, regulation of technology can
be beneficial and even necessary to the development of that technology,
minimizing the risk of harm to third parties and ensuring that the world
views the technology as safe and trustworthy. But all too often
regulation has become a way to insulate incumbents from competition,
with predictable results.” The authors’ suggestions exemplify this
difficulty, being rather vague and aspirational.
</li>
<li>
<b>Blocking Cooptive Acquisitions</b> — this is the most complex of the
four proposals, and builds on
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/45467503"><i>Nascent
Competitors</i></a> by C. Scott Hemphill &amp; Tim Wu, who write:<br />
<blockquote>
We favor an enforcement policy that prohibits anticompetitive conduct
that is reasonably capable of contributing significantly to the
maintenance of the incumbent s market power. That approach implies
enforcement even where the competitive significance of the nascent
competitor is uncertain.
</blockquote>
Justifying blocking mergers because of a nascent threat that might never
materialize is problematic. But it is only more so than the current way
anti-trust works, by projecting likely harm to consumer welfare, which
also might never materialize (although it almost always does). Lemley
and Wansley explain
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">the dilemma</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
antitrust enforcers need a strategy for blocking cooptive acquisitions
that works within existing case law (or plausible improvements to that
law) and is surgical enough to avoid chilling investment.
</blockquote>
Some cases are
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">obvious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For cooptive acquisitions like Facebook/Instagram deal, we think
Hemphill and Wu’s strategy makes sense. Zuckerberg’s email arguing for
acquiring startups like Instagram because “they could be very disruptive
to us” is a smoking gun of anticompetitive intent.
</blockquote>
But Lemley and Wansley go further, arguing for blocking megers based the
startup’s ability to
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">innovate distruptive
technology</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Of course, an approach to policing startup acquisitions based on
innovation capabilities need limits. Many startups have some innovation
capabilities that could have a significant effect on competition. We can
cabin enforcement in three ways—by focusing on specific technologies and
specific firms and by looking at the cumulative effects of multiple
acquisitions.
</blockquote>
Their examples of technologies include generative AI and virtual and
augmented reality, both cases where it is already too late. The
companies they identify “Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta”
are all veterans of multiple acquisitions in these areas. But they argue
that committing to
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4713845">challenge fuure
mergers</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
would create socially desirable incentives for startups. A startup
developing one of the listed technologies would gain stronger incentives
to turn its innovations into the products that its management team
believed would garner the highest value on the open market—rather than
the one most valuable to the tech giants. They would also gain stronger
incentives to build a truly independent business and go public since an
acquisition by the tech giants would be a less likely exit.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these would all be worthwhile steps, and I’m all in favor of
updating anti-trust law and, even better, actually enforcing the laws on
the books. But I am skeptical that the government can spot potentially
disruptive technologies before the tech giants spot and acquire them.
Especially since the government can’t be embedded in the VC industry the
way the tech giants are. Note that many of the harms Lemley and Wansley
identify happen shortly after the acquisition. Would forcing Meta to
divest Instagram at this late date restore the innovations the
acquisition killed off?<br /></p>

The only way Microsoft or OpenAI would know this would be to spy on
