<h2 id="how-to-create-and-switch-window-layouts-in-scrivener">How to
Create and Switch Window Layouts in Scrivener</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Scrivener&amp;#39;s window contains a lot of elements: the Binder on the left, the Inspector on the right, the Editor in the middle, the Toolbar and Format bar at the top, and the Footer bar at the bottom. You&amp;#39;ll probably always have the Editor visible, but you don&amp;#39;t always need to see all the other elements. You can hide the elements you&amp;#39;re not using to make Scrivener&amp;#39;s window simpler.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
If you often change which elements are visible in Scrivener's window,
it's a good idea to create window layouts. These are saved settings that
quickly switch what Scrivener displays, so you don't have to go to menus
or use keyboard shortcuts to change your window's view. In this article,
we'll show you how you can create and switch Scrivener window layouts.
</p>
<p>Understanding window layouts</p>
<p>
In
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/tame-the-scrivener-window" target="_blank">Tame
the Scrivener Window</a>, we looked at the three main elements in
Scrivener's window: the Binder (left), the Editor (center), and the
Inspector (right).
</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/tame-window/full-window2.png" />
</figure>
<p>
When you're planning or editing a project, you'll probably want to keep
the
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/use-folders-and-texts-to-power-up-the-scrivener-binder" target="_blank">Binder</a>
visible; that's the left-hand sidebar that holds the parts of your
project. If you want to view or add synopses, add metadata, or attach
notes to files, then you'll use the Inspector, the right-hand sidebar.
(It has
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/get-to-know-the-scrivener-inspector" target="_blank">many
other features</a>.) And you'll always want to view the
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/customize-the-scrivener-editor-1-setting-up-the-editor" target="_blank">Editor</a>,
the central pane; in fact, you can't hide it. The Editor is where you
write; it also displays your project in
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/plan-your-project-with-scriveners-outliner" target="_blank">Outline</a>
and
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard" target="_blank">Corkboard</a>
views.
</p>
<p>
Adjusting the window layout for the task you are performing can make it
easier to work on your projects. By removing elements you don't need,
you also remove distractions. (For the ultimate in distraction-free
writing, get to know
<a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/how-to-write-without-distractions-with-scrivener" target="_blank">Scrivener's
Composition Mode</a>.)
</p>
<p>Scrivener's built-in window layouts</p>
<p>
Scrivener comes with seven built-in window layouts. You can see these by
choosing Window &gt; Layout; the submenu shows each of these layouts by
name, and a small graphic gives you an idea of what each one looks like.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/window-layout1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;312&quot; /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;These layouts include the basic, three-pane view, as in the screenshot above; specific views that highlight the Outliner and Corkboard; and a useful dual-navigation view, that can fill your screen, and let you view the Binder, along with three other elements.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    






            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/window-layout2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;You can hide these built-in layouts from this menu if you wish; see the note below.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Creating custom window layouts in Scrivener</p>
<p>
The stock window layouts are great to give you an idea of what you can
do to change Scrivener's display, but you can go much further by
creating your own window layouts. Creating a layout means that you
adjust different elements in the Scrivener window, and then save its
settings. You can then switch to that layout at any time without
manually changing all the settings.
</p>
<p>
Before you do this, it's a good idea to save your current window layout,
so you can revert to it at any time. To save this layout, choose Window
&gt; Layouts &gt; Manage Layouts. A dialog displays showing a thumbnail
of the current layout.
</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;figure class=&quot;article__image&quot;&gt;
                
                    &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/blog-articles/window-layout3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;581&quot; /&gt;
                
                                &lt;/figure&gt;
        
    






            &lt;p&gt;To save this layout, click + and enter a name. Now, no matter how much you change Scrivener&amp;#39;s window, you&amp;#39;ll be able to come back to this layout by choosing it from the bottom of the Window &amp;gt; Layouts menu, or from the Manage Layouts dialog.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
<em><strong>Note</strong>: you can choose to hide the stock layouts from
the Layouts menu if you wish. Click … at the bottom of this dialog, then
choose Hide Built-In Layouts in Menus.</em>
</p>
<p>
Here's what window layouts save:
</p>
<pre><code>The size and position of the window, and the sizes of elements within them, such as how wide the Binder is or the ratio between the two splits.
The visibility of the Binder, collection list, and Inspector.
Whether the Editor is split; horizontally, vertically, or not at all.
Which element is visible in each split: Editor, Corkboard, or Outliner.
Whether the Header or Footer are visible in each split.
Whether the Ruler and Format Bar are visible.
Whether the window is in full-screen mode.</code></pre>
<p>
Some other settings are saved; see section 12.3.2 of the Scrivener
manual for details.
</p>
<p>
When you save layouts, there are two options that you can check:
</p>
<pre><code>Save outliner and corkboard settings: this saves the Corkboard card size, ratio, card wrapping, and other display elements, as well as freeform and label view.
Preserve all metadata appearance options: this saves label tinting used in the various areas of the interface; and pin, stamp, and keyword chip visibility in the Corkboard.</code></pre>
<p>Switching window layouts in Scrivener</p>
<p>
Now that you saved one or more window layouts in Scrivener, it's easy to
switch. There are two ways to do this.
</p>
<p>
Choose Window &gt; Layouts, then choose the name of the layout you want
to use. The built-in layouts are in the top section of the menu, and the
ones you've saved are in the bottom section.
</p>
<p>
Or choose Window &gt; Layouts &gt; Manage Layouts, or press
Command-Shift-) on Mac, or Ctrl+) on Windows. This brings up the dialog
you used to save layouts. You might want to use this option if you have
saved several window layouts and forget exactly how they look.
</p>
<p>
There are three ways to choose a layout from this dialog:
</p>
<pre><code>Double-click a layout to switch to it. On the Mac, double-click the thumbnail; on Windows, double-click the layout&amp;#39;s name.
Select a layout and press Return.
Select a layout and click Use.</code></pre>
<p>
If you make changes to a window layout and want to save the changes,
select the layout, click …, then choose Update Selected Layout.
</p>
<p>
You can export and import window layouts if you want to share them, or
if someone else has created a layout you want to use. From the … menu,
choose Export Selected Layout or Import Layout. This will save or import
a .scrlayout file.
</p>
<p>
Window layouts are a practical tool in Scrivener that lets you shift the
way you look at a project, whether you're planning, writing, revising,
or editing. Learn how to use window layouts to simplify Scrivener's
display when you want to, and to show more details when you need to.
</p>
<p>
For more on window layouts, see section 12.3 of the Scrivener manual.

Di Filippo Reviews Robert J. Sawyer’s The Downloaded</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-19, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
<strong>The Downloaded</strong>, Robert J. Sawyer (Shadowpaw Press
978-1989398999, trade paperback, 199pp, $14.95) May 2024
</p>
<p>
It’s a testament to Robert Sawyer’s skill—and his generational
wisdom—that he has created, with his latest book, a novel that is at

Egan rebooting Neil R. Jones’s <b>Professor Jameson</b> cycle. This book
exemplifies the “best of both worlds” approach that charts a viable
future

<p>
I’ve read a lot of Greek and Roman mythology retell­ings recently, so
it’s nice to see Celtic/ British mythol­ogy getting some love too. In
<strong>Song of the Huntress</strong>, Lucy Holland
(<strong>Sistersong</strong>, 2021) brings the Wild Hunt to Cornwall and
Wessex in the mid-700s. This is some centuries after the Roman conquest
and departure; Saxons
