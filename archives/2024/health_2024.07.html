metabolomics unveiled the role of butanoate metabolism in the
development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa hypoxic biofilm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a versatile opportunistic
pathogen which causes a variety of acute and chronic human infections,
some of which are associated with the biofilm phenotype of the pathogen.
We hypothesize that defining the intracellular metabolome of biofilm
cells, compared to that of planktonic cells, will elucidate the
metabolic pathways and biomarkers indicative of biofilm inception.
Disc-shaped stainless-steel coupons (12.7 mm diameter) were employed as
a surface for static biofilm establishment. Each disc was immersed in a
well, of a 24-well microtiter plate, containing a 1-mL Lysogeny broth
(LB) suspension of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 9027, a strain
known for its biofilm prolificacy. This setup underwent oxygen-depleted
incubation at 37°C for 24 hours to yield hypoxic biofilms and the
co-existing static planktonic cells. In parallel, another planktonic
phenotype of ATCC 9027 was produced in LB under shaking (200 rpm)
incubation at 37°C for 24 hours. Planktonic and biofilm cells were
harvested, and the intracellular metabolites were subjected to global
untargeted metabolomic analysis using LC-MS technology, where small
metabolites (below 1.5 kDa) were selected. Data analysis showed the
presence of 324 metabolites that differed (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05)
in abundance between planktonic and biofilm cells, whereas 70
metabolites did not vary between these phenotypes (<italic>p</italic>
&gt; 0.05). Correlation, principal components, and partial least square
discriminant analyses proved that the biofilm metabolome is distinctly
clustered away from that of the two planktonic phenotypes. Based on the
functional enrichment analysis, arginine and proline metabolism were
enriched in planktonic cells, but butanoate metabolism was enriched in
biofilm cells. Key differential metabolites within the butanoate pathway
included acetoacetate, 2,3-butandiol, diacetyl, and acetoin, which were
highly upregulated in the biofilm compared to the planktonic cells.
Exogenous supplementation of acetoin (2 mM), a critical metabolite in
butanoate metabolism, augmented biofilm mass, increased the structural
integrity and thickness of the biofilm, and maintained the intracellular
redox potential by balancing NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. In conclusion,
<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> hypoxic biofilm has a specialized
metabolic landscape, and butanoate pathway is a metabolic preference and
possibly required for promoting planktonic cells to the biofilm state.
The butanoate pathway metabolites, particularly acetoin, could serve as
markers for biofilm development.

id="dysbiosis-of-the-gut-microbiota-and-its-effect-on-α-synuclein-and-prion-protein-misfolding-consequences-for-neurodegeneration">Dysbiosis
of the gut microbiota and its effect on α-synuclein and prion protein
misfolding: consequences for neurodegeneration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Abnormal behavior of α-synuclein and prion proteins is the hallmark of
Parkinson’s disease (PD) and prion illnesses, respectively, being
complex neurological disorders. A primary cause of protein aggregation,
brain injury, and cognitive loss in prion illnesses is the misfolding of
normal cellular prion proteins (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into an infectious form
(PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). Aggregation of α-synuclein causes disruptions in
cellular processes in Parkinson’s disease (PD), leading to loss of
dopamine-producing neurons and motor symptoms. Alteration in the
composition or activity of gut microbes may weaken the intestinal
barrier and make it possible for prions to go from the gut to the brain.
The gut-brain axis is linked to neuroinflammation; the metabolites
produced by the gut microbiota affect the aggregation of α-synuclein,
regulate inflammation and immunological responses, and may influence the
course of the disease and neurotoxicity of proteins, even if their
primary targets are distinct proteins. This thorough analysis explores
the complex interactions that exist between the gut microbiota and
neurodegenerative illnesses, particularly Parkinson’s disease (PD) and
prion disorders. The involvement of the gut microbiota, a complex
collection of bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses etc., in various
neurological illnesses is becoming increasingly recognized. The gut
microbiome influences neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter synthesis,
mitochondrial function, and intestinal barrier integrity through the
gut-brain axis, which contributes to the development and progression of
disease. The review delves into the molecular mechanisms that underlie
these relationships, emphasizing the effects of microbial metabolites
such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) in regulating brain functioning. Additionally, it looks at how
environmental influences and dietary decisions affect the gut microbiome
and whether they could be risk factors for neurodegenerative illnesses.
This study concludes by highlighting the critical role that the gut
microbiota plays in the development of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and
prion disease. It also provides a promising direction for future
research and possible treatment approaches. People afflicted by these
difficult ailments may find hope in new preventive and therapeutic
approaches if the role of the gut microbiota in these diseases is better
understood.

report: Metagenomics next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of
septic shock due to Fusobacterium necrophorum in a 6-year-old child</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Fusobacterium necrophorum</italic> (<italic>F.
necrophorum</italic>) infection is rare in pediatrics. In addition, the
detection time of <italic>F. necrophorum</italic> by blood culture is
long, and the positive rate is low. Infection with <italic>F.
necrophorum</italic> bacilli usually follows rapid disease progression,
resulting in high mortality. In previous reports of <italic>F.
necrophorum</italic>-related cases, the most dangerous moment of the
disease occurred after the appearance of Lemierre’s syndrome. We report
an atypical case of a 6-year-old female patient who developed septic
shock within 24 h of admission due to <italic>F. necrophorum</italic>
infection in the absence of Lemierre’s syndrome. <italic>F.
necrophorum</italic> was identified in a blood sample by metagenomics
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) but not by standard blood culture. The
patient was finally cured and discharged after receiving timely and
effective targeted anti-infection treatment. In the present case study,
it was observed that the heightened virulence and invasiveness of
<italic>F. necrophorum</italic> contribute significantly to its role as
a primary pathogen in pediatric septic shock. This can precipitate
hemodynamic instability and multiple organ failure, even in the absence
of Lemierre’s syndrome. The use of mNGS can deeply and rapidly identify
infectious pathogens, guide the use of targeted antibiotics, and greatly
improve the survival rate of patients.

the microbial puzzle: exploring the intricate role of gut microbiota in
endometriosis pathogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Endometriosis (EMs) is a prevalent gynecological disorder characterized
by the growth of uterine tissue outside the uterine cavity, causing
debilitating symptoms and infertility. Despite its prevalence, the exact
mechanisms behind EMs development remain incompletely understood. This
article presents a comprehensive overview of the relationship between
gut microbiota imbalance and EMs pathogenesis. Recent research indicates
that gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in various aspects of EMs,
including immune regulation, generation of inflammatory factors,
angiopoietin release, hormonal regulation, and endotoxin production.
Dysbiosis of gut microbiota can disrupt immune responses, leading to
inflammation and impaired immune clearance of endometrial fragments,
resulting in the development of endometriotic lesions. The dysregulated
microbiota can contribute to the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
triggering chronic inflammation and promoting ectopic endometrial
adhesion, invasion, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, gut microbiota
involvement in estrogen metabolism affects estrogen levels, which are
directly related to EMs development. The review also highlights the
potential of gut microbiota as a diagnostic tool and therapeutic target
for EMs. Interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
and the use of gut microbiota preparations have demonstrated promising
effects in reducing EMs symptoms. Despite the progress made, further
research is needed to unravel the intricate interactions between gut
microbiota and EMs, paving the way for more effective prevention and
treatment strategies for this challenging condition.

case report of Pseudomonas citronellolis and Escherichia coli isolated
from acute suppurative appendicitis: reveals the potential intestinal
colonization and pathogenicity of Pseudomonas citronellolis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Human infections caused by <italic>Pseudomonas citronellolis</italic>,
an environmental bacterium, are infrequent, with only two cases related
to uncommon urinary tract infections and bacteremia reported in recent
years. All these cases typically occurred in elderly patients with
compromised or decreased immune function. Simultaneously, the epithelial
barrier disruption induced by invasive biopsy procedures or
gastrointestinal disorders such as gastroenteritis provided a pathway
for <italic>Pseudomonas citronellolis</italic> to infiltrate the
organism. In this study, we present the first report of a case where
<italic>Pseudomonas citronellolis</italic> and <italic>Escherichia
coli</italic> were isolated from the inflamed appendix of a patient
without underlying conditions. Compared to the <italic>Escherichia
coli</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas citronellolis</italic> has never been
isolated in patients with appendicitis. We identified the species using
MALDI-TOF MS and genetic sequencing. Based on our findings, we highlight
the perspective that <italic>Pseudomonas citronellolis</italic> can
colonize the intestines of healthy individuals and may trigger
infections like appendicitis.

range expansion of Acinetobacter phage vB_Ab4_Hep4 driven by a
spontaneous tail tubular mutation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Bacteriophages (phages) represent promising alternative treatments
against multidrug-resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>
(MDRAB) infections. The application of phages as antibacterial agents is
limited by their generally narrow host ranges, so changing or expanding
the host ranges of phages is beneficial for phage therapy. Multiple
studies have identified that phage tail fiber protein mediates the
recognition and binding to the host as receptor binding protein in phage
infection. However, the tail tubular-dependent host specificity of
phages has not been studied well. In this study, we isolated and
characterized a novel lytic phage, vB_Ab4_Hep4, specifically infecting
MDRAB strains. Meanwhile, we identified a spontaneous mutant of the
phage, vB_Ab4_Hep4-M, which revealed an expanded host range compared to
the wild-type phage. A single mutation of G to C was detected in the
gene encoding the phage tail tubular protein B and thus resulted in an
aspartate to histidine change. We further demonstrated that the host
range expansion of the phage mutant is driven by the spontaneous
mutation of guanine to cytosine using expressed tail tubular protein B.
Moreover, we established that the bacterial capsule is the receptor for
phage Abp4 and Abp4-M by identifying mutant genes in phage-resistant
strains. In conclusion, our study provided a detailed description of
phage vB_Ab4_Hep4 and revealed the tail tubular-dependent host
specificity in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> phages, which may provide
new insights into extending the host ranges of phages by gene-modifying
tail tubular proteins.

can we learn from treatments of oral lichen planus?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Oral lichen planus (OLP), a T-lymphocyte-mediated disease of the oral
mucosa, has a complex pathogenesis that involves a number of factors.
The disease is characterized by recurrent episodes and requires
continuous follow up, and there is no curative treatment available.
Erosive lichen planus, among others, has a risk of malignant
transformation and requires standardized treatment to control its
progression. Different clinical subtypes of oral lichen planus require
appropriate treatment. Pharmacological treatments are the most widely
available and have the greatest variety of options and a number of novel
pharmacological treatments are presented as highlights, including JAK
enzyme inhibitors. The second is photodynamic therapy, which is the
leading physiological treatment. In addition, periodontal treatment and
psychological treatment should not be neglected. In this review, we
briefly discuss the most recent developments in therapies for oral
lichen planus after summarizing the most widely used clinical
treatments, aiming to provide different proposals for future clinical
treatment.

<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Monkeypox or mpox virus (mpox) is a double-stranded DNA virus that poses
a significant threat to global public health security. The F3 protein,
encoded by mpox, is an apoenzyme believed to possess a double-stranded
RNA-binding domain (dsRBD). However, limited research has been conducted
on its function. In this study, we present data on the transcriptomics
and proteomics of F3L-transfected HEK293T cells, aiming to enhance our
comprehension of F3L.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The gene expression profiles of pCAGGS-HA-F3L transfected HEK293T cells
were analyzed using RNA-seq. Proteomics was used to identify and study
proteins that interact with F3L. Real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA
levels of several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HEK293T cells
(or Vero cells) after the expression of F3 protein.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 14,822 genes were obtained in cells by RNA-Seq and 1,672 DEGs
were identified, including 1,156 up-regulated genes and 516
down-regulated genes. A total of 27 cellular proteins interacting with
F3 proteins were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and 19 cellular proteins with large differences
in abundance ratios were considered to be candidate cellular proteins.
Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
enrichment analyses showed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in
immune-related pathways, including type I interferon signaling pathway,
response to virus, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like
receptor signaling pathway, etc. Moreover, some selected DEGs were
further confirmed by real-time PCR and the results were consistent with
the transcriptome data. Proteomics data show that cellular proteins
interacting with F3 proteins are mainly related to RNA splicing and
protein translation.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Our analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data showed that (1) F3L
up-regulates the transcript levels of key genes in the innate immune
signaling pathway, such as <italic>RIGI, MDA5, IRF5, IRF7, IRF9, ISG15,
IFNA14</italic>, and elicits a broad spectrum of antiviral immune
responses in the host. F3L also increases the expression of the FOS and
JNK genes while decreasing the expression of TNFR2, these factors may
ultimately induce apoptosis. (2) F3 protein interacts with host proteins
involved in RNA splicing and protein translation, such as SNRNP70,
POLR2H, HNRNPA1, DDX17, etc. The findings of this study shed light on
the function of the F3 protein.

prospective case control design with 201 subjects including 61 CD
patients and 140 non-CD controls. The culture methods included MGIT,
TiKa and Pozzato broths, and were deemed MAP positive, if IS900 PCR
positive. A phage amplification assay was also performed to detect MAP.
Cytokine analysis of the TU/ACU samples was performed using Simple Plex
cytokine reagents on the Ella ELISA system. Statistical analyses were
done after log transformation using the R software package. The
meta-analysis combined three studies.

<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Most subjects had MAP positive blood cultures by one or more methods in
3 laboratories. In our cytokine study comparing CD to non-CD controls,
IL-17, IFNγ and TNFα were significantly increased in CD, but IL-2, IL-5,
IL-10 and GM-CSF were not increased. In the meta-analysis, IL-6, IL-8
and IL-12 were significantly increased in the CD patients.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Most subjects in our sample had MAP infection and 8 of 9 subjects
remained MAP positive one year later indicating persistent infection.
While not identical, cytokine expression patterns in MAP culture
positive CD patients in the TU/ACU study showed similarities (increased
IL-17, IFNγ and TNFα) to patterns of patients with Tuberculosis in other
studies, indicating the possibilities of similar mechanisms of pathogen
infection and potential strategies for treatment.

characterization of chicken infectious anaemia viruses isolated in Korea
and their pathogenicity in chicks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Chicken infectious anaemia virus (CIAV) causes severe anemia and
immunosuppression through horizontal or vertical transmission in young
chickens. Especially, vertical transmission of virus through the egg can
lead to significantly economic losses due to the increased mortality in
the broiler industry. Here, 28 CIAV complete sequences circulating in
Korea were first characterized using the newly designed primers.
Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete sequences revealed that CIAV
isolates were divided into four groups, IIa (2/28, 7.1%), IIb (9/28,
32.1%), IIIa (8/28, 28.6%) and IIIb (9/28, 32.1%), and exhibited a close
relationship to each other. The major groups were IIb, IIIa and IIIb,
and no strains were clustered with a vaccine strain available in Korea.
Also, for viral titration, we newly developed a quantitative PCR assay
that is highly sensitive, reliable and simple. To investigate the
pathogenicity of three major genotypes, 18R001(IIb), 08AQ017A(IIIa), and
17AD008(IIIb) isolates were challenged into one-day-old
specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks. Each CIAV strain caused anaemia,
severe growth retardation and immunosuppression in chickens regardless
of CIAV genotypes. Notably, a 17AD008 strain showed stable cellular
adaptability and higher virus titer <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as
higher pathogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, our study
provides valuable information to understand molecular characterization,
genetic diversity and pathogenicity of CIAV to improve management and
control of CIA in poultry farm.

<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is a common complication in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with chemotherapy or
immunotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of HBV reactivation
and its effect on survival in HCC patients treated with HAIC and
lenvatinib plus PD1s.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We retrospectively collected the data of 213 HBV-related HCC patients
who underwent HAIC and lenvatinib plus PD1s treatment between June 2019
to June 2022 at Sun Yat-sen University, China. The primary outcome was
the risk of HBV reactivation. The secondary outcomes were overall
survival (OS), progression−free survival (PFS), and treatment−related
adverse events.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Sixteen patients (7.5%) occurred HBV reactivation in our study. The
incidence of HBV reactivation was 5% in patients with antiviral
prophylaxis and 21.9% in patients without antiviral prophylaxis,
respectively. The logistic regression model indicated that for HBV
reactivation, lack of antiviral prophylaxis (<italic>P</italic>=0.003)
and tumor diameter (<italic>P</italic>=0.036) were independent risk
factors. The OS and PFS were significantly shorter in the HBV
reactivation group than the non-reactivation group
(<italic>P</italic>=0.0023 and <italic>P</italic>=0.00073,
respectively). The number of AEs was more in HBV reactivation group than
the non-reactivation group, especially hepatic AEs.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
HBV reactivation may occur in HCC patients treated with HAIC and
lenvatinib plus PD1s. Patients with HBV reactivation had shorter
survival time compared with non-reactivation. Therefore, HBV-related HCC
patients should undergo antiviral therapy and HBV-DNA monitoring before
and during the combination treatment.

<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Malaria has always been a serious infectious disease prevalent in the
world. Antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and artemisinin have been
the main compounds used to treat malaria. However, the massive use of
this type of drugs accelerates the evolution and spread of malaria
parasites, leading to the development of resistance. A large number of
related data have been published by researchers in recent years.
CiteSpace software has gained popularity among us researchers in recent
years, because of its ability to help us obtain the core information we
want in a mass of articles. In order to analyze the hotspots and develop
trends in this field through visual analysis, this study used CiteSpace
software to summarize the available data in the literature to provide
insights.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Method
</title>
<p>
Relevant literature was collected from the Web of Science Core
Collection (WOSCC) from 1 January 2015 to 29 March 2023. CiteSpace
software and Microsoft Excel were used to analyze and present the data,
respectively.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 2,561 literatures were retrieved and 2,559 literatures were
included in the analysis after the removal of duplicates. An irrefutable
witness of the ever-growing interest in the topic of antimalarial drug
resistance could be expressed by the exponentially increased number of
publications and related citations from 2015 to 2022, and its sustained
growth trend by 2023. During the past 7 years, USA, Oxford University,
and David A Fidock are the country, institution, and author with the
most publications in this field of research, respectively. We focused on
the references and keywords from literature and found that the research
and development of new drugs is the newest hotspot in this field. A
growing number of scientists are devoted to finding new antimalarial
drugs.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
This study is the first visual metrological analysis of antimalarial
drug resistance, using bibliometric methods. As a baseline information,
it is important to analyze research output published globally on
antimalarial drug resistance. In order to better understand the current
research situation and future research plan agenda, such baseline data
are needed accordingly.

adjunctive therapies for cerebral malaria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Cerebral malaria (CM) is one of the most severe complications of malaria
infection characterized by coma and neurological effects. Despite
standardized treatment of malaria infection with artemisinin-based
combination therapies (ACT), the mortality rate is still high, and it
primarily affects pediatric patients. ACT reduces parasitemia but fails
to adequately target the pathogenic mechanisms underlying CM, including
blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption, endothelial
activation/dysfunction, and hyperinflammation. The need for adjunctive
therapies to specifically treat this form of severe malaria is critical
as hundreds of thousands of people continue to die each year from this
disease. Here we present a summary of some potential promising
therapeutic targets and treatments for CM, as well as some that have
been tested and deemed ineffective or, in some cases, even deleterious.
Further exploration into these therapeutic agents is warranted to assess
the effectiveness of these potential treatments for CM patients.

knowledge, attitude, and perception towards monkeypox among healthcare
workers and medical students: an Egyptian cross-sectional study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Monkeypox (Mpox) is a re-emerging infectious disease representing a new
global challenge. It poses a substantial threat to countries,
particularly those with a low number of cases. Due to its popularity as
a tourist destination and its proximity to many African refugees, Egypt
is potentially at risk of Mpox importation. Therefore, effective disease
management necessitates healthcare workers (HCWs) to possess adept
knowledge, along with a positive attitude and behavior. The study aimed
to assess the knowledge, attitude, and perception of Egyptian HCWs and
medical students towards human Mpox.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The present cross-sectional study data was collected from participants
between October and December 2022 via a questionnaire. The questionnaire
comprised 31 questions in the knowledge section, 11 questions in the
attitude section, and 14 in the perception section.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The present study involved a total of 1,034 HCWs and medical students.
It was found that 55.3% of the participants demonstrated adequate
knowledge about Mpox, whereas 44.5% and 39.8% of the respondents
exhibited favorable attitudes and perceptions towards the disease,
respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that adequate
knowledge was significantly observed in ages older than 40 years
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), married participants
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and doctors (<italic>p</italic> &lt;
0.001). The positive attitude was significantly observed among the male
sex (<italic>p</italic> = 0.045), urban residents (<italic>p</italic> =
0.002), and nurses (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Conversely, married
participants (p = 0.013), doctors (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and
individuals employed in pharmacy and laboratory departments
(<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) experienced an increase in positive
perception.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Knowledge, attitude, and perception towards Mpox among Egyptian HCWs and
medical students exhibit suboptimal levels. Addressing these gaps is
crucial to controlling and effectively preventing disease transmission.

<p>
<italic>Bacille Calmette-Guérin</italic> (BCG) is a live strain of
<italic>Mycobacteriu</italic>m <italic>bovis</italic>
(<italic>M.bovis</italic>) for use as an attenuated vaccine to prevent
<italic>tuberculosis</italic> (TB) infection, while it could also lead
to an infection in immunodeficient patients. <italic>M.bovis</italic>
could infect patients with immunodeficiency via BCG vaccination.
Disseminated BCG disease (BCGosis) is extremely rare and has a high
mortality rate. This article presents a case of a 3-month-old patient
with disseminated BCG infection who was initially diagnosed with
hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) and eventually found to have X-linked
severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID). <italic>M.bovis</italic> and
its drug resistance genes were identified by metagenomics
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) combined with targeted next-generation
sequencing (tNGS) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Whole exome
sequencing (WES) revealed a pathogenic variant in the common γ-chain
gene (<italic>IL2RG</italic>), confirming X-SCID. Finally,
antituberculosis therapy and umbilical cord blood transplantation were
given to the patient. He was successfully cured of BCGosis, and his
immune function was restored. The mNGS combined with the tNGS provided
effective methods for diagnosing rare BCG infections in children. Their
combined application significantly improved the sensitivity and
specificity of the detection of <italic>M.bovis</italic>.
