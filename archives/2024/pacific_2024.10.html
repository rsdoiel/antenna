<p>FOR decades, very few women in the Northern Mariana Islands had been
able to break through and run viable campaigns for the highest
leadership positions. In the 2022 gubernatorial race, Christina “Tina”
Marie Elise Sablan and Leila Haveia Fleming Staffler mounted a bid as
the Democratic nominees for Governor and Lt. Governor respectively but
came up short. Four years prior, Rita Aldan Sablan ran for Lt. Governor
as an independent candidate in 2018.</p>

charged Friday in the Superior Court of Guam with first-degree criminal
sexual conduct as first-degree felonies.According to a magistrate’s
complaint, the male defendants’ charges stemmed from reports made to a
school employee at an elementary school on Feb. 1. An 11-year-old girl
and a 13-year-old girl accused the men of sexually assaulting them.The
11-year-old alleged Manuel Arriola had been touching her sexually since
she was in first grade. She also alleged Manuel Arriola took her to a
secluded area in the jungle near her Dededo residence, laid her down on
a piece of flat plywood and raped her. Manuel Arriola also allegedly
raped the minor on a different occasion at her Dededo residence,
according to the complaint.The 13-year-old also accused Manuel Arriola
of raping her at a Dededo residence.According to the complaint, Patrick
Arriola was accused by the 11-year-old girl of touching her sexually and
raping her inside a van.The 13-year-old reported Patrick Arriola groped
her on numerous occasions, but on one occasion, Patrick Arriola
allegedly “bribed (the 13-year-old girl) to have sex with him by
offering her a vape,” the complaint stated.Santos allegedly sexually
touched the 11-year-old girl starting when she was in the fourth grade,
and also allegedly raped her on the living room floor of her Dededo
residence.The 13-year-old girl accused Aguero of groping her on at least
one occasion, while the 11-year-old girl reported Aguero had sexual
intercourse with her in the bedroom of a Dededo residence and also on
top of a broken table outside the Dededo residence, the complaint
stated.Another female, age 18, also accused Manuel Arriola of raping
her.According to the complaint, another male minor was interviewed and
arrested after telling police that he did “touch a private part of one
of the females.”Santos, when interviewed by officers with the Guam
Police Department, allegedly admitted to touching the 11-year-old’s
private area, the complaint stated.Manuel Arriola was charged with three
counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, Patrick Arriola was
charged with two counts, and Santos and Aguero were charged with one
count each.</p>

years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-04, updated: 2024-03-04, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>HAGÅTÑA (The Guam Daily Post) — Escape the heat and take a dip in the
Dededo Pool, now reopened with free admission until the end of April.“We
are opening it because we have so many young people here that want to be
able to not just go into the pool but to learn to swim,” Angel Sablan,
Department of Parks and Recreation acting director, said Saturday during
the pool’s reopening ceremony.People young and old attended the
ribbon-cutting event on Saturday to celebrate the reopening of the
Dededo Pool after 4 years of closure for maintenance and renovation.The
Dededo Pool first closed from 2017 to 2019 and then shut down in 2020
following complaints about health and safety, according to Post
files.Sablan said he also has plans for the Dededo Sports Complex, which
includes the reopened pool.“One of my intentions is to make this area a
jewel, not just for Dededo (and) the people of Northern Guam, but for
all people. We have the Guam Football Association to my left, we have
the Guam Tennis Center to my right,” Sablan said.The sports complex also
includes baseball fields and a refurbished gym.“This place is going to
be buzzing with activity. We are going to have that walkway that goes
around his entire facility lit up, and we are working with the Guam
Energy Office to put those solar lights in to save us on utilities,”
Sablan said.The occasion was celebrated with an executive order in which
Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero provided two months of free admission to the pool
until April 30.Admission for senior citizens is free. General admission
is $2.The design for the Hagatña pool was completed as of Friday, Sablan
said, and a groundbreaking ceremony is planned for that facility in
August.</p>

        &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:18px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:times new roman,times,serif;&quot;&gt;The Office of the President is pleased to inform the public that significant progress has been made regarding the COFA Amendments Act, which has been included in the six-bill FY24 appropriations package recently released by the House of Representatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;, times, serif; font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;As Congress prepares to vote on this package to avert a potential partial government shutdown on Friday, March 8, we are informed that Speaker Johnson intends to present the appropriations bills collectively, as a single legislative package also known as a &amp;ldquo;minibus&amp;rdquo;, streamlining the legislative process for swifter passage, contingent upon sufficient support from both chambers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;, times, serif; font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;The COFA Amendments Act, remains identical as the version previously approved by the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction in November 2023, with minor adjustments related to Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits. The new language in the VA provisions mainly stipulates the necessity of government-to-government agreements between the United States and each of the three Freely Associated States (FAS) countries to facilitate expanded veterans care and services. More information on this will be shared in due course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;, times, serif; font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;The bill ultimately retains all core elements, including mandatory funding, education provisions, and the inclusion of CIFA (Compact Impact Fairness Act) without alterations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;, times, serif; font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;In terms of next steps, should the package pass in the House this week, it would then proceed to the Senate for final approval, before it would go to President Biden to be signed into law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;, times, serif; font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;This turning point is the result of months of collective efforts of many people and the engagement and collaboration between our governments, demonstrating our shared commitment to advancing our mutual interests and the strong and enduring partnership between the FSM and the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
        &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;, times, serif; font-size: 18px;&quot;&gt;The FSM government is optimistic about the forward movement of the legislation. President Simina stated, &amp;quot;This development reinforces our confidence in the strength of our partnership with the United States.
