Broody: What Is A Broody Hen And How To Stop It</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: The Tiny Life blog</p>
<p>

lingo that goes along with it, you might have heard reference to a
broody hen, so it’s a fair question to wonder—what is a broody hen?

happens when your hen’s mothering instinct takes over, whether or not
she has fertilized eggs.
