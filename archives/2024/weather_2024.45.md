Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CST Wed Nov 06 2024

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF WEST
TX...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of west and central
Texas, with the greatest threat expected Thursday evening/night
across parts of west Texas. Large hail, isolated severe gusts, and a
tornado or two are all possible.

...Parts of west and central TX...
A deep mid/upper-level low is forecast to move slowly eastward
across AZ/NM on Thursday, before accelerating later Thursday night
into early Friday morning. An expansive surface ridge will initially
cover much of the western/central CONUS, though weak cyclogenesis is
expected later in the period in the vicinity of an inverted surface
trough over west TX. Seasonably rich surface moisture will stream
westward across parts of western/central TX through the day, with
increasing moisture also expected atop a relatively shallow
cool/stable layer into parts of northwest TX and southwest OK by the
end of the period. 

Elevated convection will be possible near/north of the effective
warm front through the day, with isolated diurnal storm development
also possible within the moistening/destabilizing warm sector. Storm
coverage and the organized severe threat are expected to increase
later in the evening into the overnight hours, as the low-level jet
nocturnally intensifies and the mid/upper-level low approaches the
region.  

Moderate instability and rather strong deep-layer shear will support
the potential for a few supercells and organized clusters,
especially across parts of the Permian Basin and Edwards Plateau
regions. A threat for large hail and localized severe gusts will
accompany the strongest storms. Also, while the bulk of the
nocturnal convection may tend to be somewhat elevated, increasingly
rich low-level moisture will support some potential for
surface-based supercells near the surface trough/low, with favorably
veering wind profiles supporting a threat of a tornado or two.  

...Lower FL Keys...
Hurricane Rafael is forecast to move westward across the southern
Gulf of Mexico on Thursday; see NHC forecasts and advisories for
more information. Relatively strong low-level flow to the east of
Rafael may still be in place across the lower Keys at the start of
the forecast period, though weakening is expected through the day as
Rafael moves away from the region. While a low-probability tornado
threat cannot be ruled out across parts of the lower Keys, the
magnitude of the threat from 12Z onward appears too limited for
probabilities at this time.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1037 AM CST Wed Nov 06 2024

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF VENTURA AND
LOS ANGELES COUNTIES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

Current observations show strong offshore flow across
terrain-favoring areas surrounding the Los Angeles metropolitan
area, with sustained 30+ mph winds (and gusts well exceeding 60 mph)
amid RH near 15 percent in the Ventura Valley region. These
conditions should persist through much of the afternoon,
necessitating the maintenance of Extremely Critical highlights.
Observations in higher-terrain areas around Los Angeles toward the
Laguna Mountains show solidly Critical conditions ongoing, with 20+
mph sustained winds and gusts exceeding 45 mph coinciding with 15-20
percent RH. These conditions should continue to the end of the
period. Finally, guidance consensus continues to show Elevated
conditions across the northern California Valley region, where
downslope flow will encourage 15-20 mph sustained northerly winds
amid 15-20 percent RH through the period.

..Squitieri.. 11/06/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CST Wed Nov 06 2024/

...Synopsis...
Between a highly amplified large-scale ridge over the West Coast,
and a deep midlevel trough extending from the northern Plains into
the Four Corners, a belt of strong deep-layer northerly flow will
overspread the Great Basin into southern CA. In response, an
expansive surface anticyclone will be reinforced over the
Intermountain West. These factors will yield a strong offshore
pressure gradient and ample upper-level support across southern CA,
leading to a strong Santa Ana wind event.

...Southern California...
From Wednesday morning into Wednesday night, the tightening offshore
pressure gradient (LAX-DAG peaking around -7 to -8 mb), coupled with
the strong deep-layer north-northeasterly flow directed toward the
coast, will favor sustained northeasterly surface winds of 30+ mph
and gusts upwards of 60 mph across much of southern CA. Higher gusts
(70+ mph) are expected over the wind-prone mountains and slopes.
These strong/gusty winds will combine with lower teens/single-digit
RH, leading to dangerous fire-weather conditions. The most volatile
and long-duration combination of strong winds and low RH over
receptive fuels is expected over the wind-prone Santa Ana corridor
of southern Ventura and northern Los Angeles Counties -- where
Extremely Critical fire-weather conditions are expected.

...Northern/Central California...
The tight pressure gradient peripheral to the strong surface
anticyclone and enhanced deep-layer northerly flow will also favor
strong northerly surface winds amid low RH over the western
Sacramento Valley to the coast. Given modestly receptive fuels
across this region, elevated to locally critical fire-weather
conditions are expected from Wednesday morning into Wednesday night.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING OVER THE LOWER FLORIDA KEYS...

...SUMMARY...
A couple of brief tornadoes will be possible within outermost
fringes of the circulation of Hurricane Rafael, through this
evening, across the Keys and the far southwestern Florida Peninsula.

...South Florida and the Keys...
Hurricane Rafael will track toward/across western Cuba tonight. 
Model guidance continues to trend toward weaker low-level wind
fields over south FL and shunting the risk southwestward/offshore. 
Will maintain the ongoing risk areas as CAM solutions show a few
discrete cells in the outer bands of the system later this afternoon
and evening.  However, the overall risk appears to be lessening.

## Tropical Depression Fourteen-E Forecast Discussion Number 1

Tropical Depression Fourteen-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP142024
800 AM MST Wed Nov 06 2024
 
The National Hurricane Center has been tracking a well-defined low 
pressure system located several hundred miles southwest of the 
southwestern Mexican coast.  Beginning around 2300 UTC on Tuesday, 
deep convection formed over the low-level circulation and cold cloud 
tops have persisted for over 15 hours.  TAFB has classified this 
system with a T2.0, indicating that is has reached the necessary 
requirements of maintaining deep, organized convection.  Therefore, 
the system is being designated as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E and 
the initial intensity is set to 30 kt.  Scatterometer data is 
expected later today which should provide a better intensity 
estimate.
 
The depression is drifting northeastward at 3 kt.  A narrow 
mid-level ridge is building to the north of the cyclone and expected 
to turn the depression eastward later today.  The system should 
briefly accelerate and turn more east-southeastward to southeastward 
on Thursday before drifting back to the east-southeast on Friday in 
the low-level flow.  The NHC track forecast lies between the simple 
and corrected consensus aids.
 
Surrounding dry mid-level humidities and moderate vertical wind 
shear seem to be the limiting factors preventing the depression from 
any significant strengthening.  Global models indicate there should 
be a brief period in about day or so that the deep-layer vertical 
wind shear should relax slightly and possibly allow for a little 
strengthening.  The depression is expected to lose its organized 
deep convection over the weekend and open into a trough.  However, 
there is a possibility this occurs sooner.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0648 AM CST Wed Nov 06 2024

Valid 061300Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE LOWER
FLORIDA KEYS...

...SUMMARY...
A couple of brief tornadoes will be possible within outermost
fringes of the circulation of Hurricane Rafael, from late morning
into the evening, across the Keys and the far southwestern Florida
Peninsula.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, mean troughing will remain over the Rocky
Mountain States as a strong subsynoptic trough -- now evident in
moisture-channel imagery over the Four Corners region -- strengthens
to a closed cyclone.  The associate 500-mb low is expected to become
better-developed throughout the period as it closes off and
retrogrades south-southwestward across AZ.  In response to these
developments, height rises are forecast across the southern Plains
and Gulf Coast region, while ridging also builds westward from the
Bermuda high.  In turn, this should shift Hurricane Rafael westward
toward the central Gulf, following today's crossing of western Cuba,
per NHC forecast. 

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a frontal-wave low over ON north
of Lake Huron, with cold front across Lower MI, IN, western parts of
KY/TN/MS, central LA, and the shelf waters off the TX Gulf Coast. 
Under height rises and weakening/largely parallel flow aloft, the
frontal segment south of about I-40 should become quasistationary
through the remainder of the period.  Given those factors, weak
midlevel lapse rates, and negligible mid/upper support, associated
thunderstorms should have an unconditional severe potential below 5%
for gusts and less than 2% for tornado, with no large-hail threat. 

...FL Keys and vicinity...
Although Rafael will be pivoting more westward away from the region
than previous forecast cycles suggested, and is a relatively small
hurricane, the influence of ambient shear imparts a northeastward
tilt to the overall convective pattern.  This will lead to the
passage of peripheral cells and perhaps (over the Lower Keys)
banding features.  The track forecast also should result in the
largest low-level shear remaining west and south of EYW, but
still-favorable hodographs passing across the outlook area from this
afternoon into tonight.  As such, the outlook lines are shifted
slightly westward, in keeping with NHC track-forecast trends, but
still kept at 5% "slight" levels over the Lower Keys for this cycle.

See latest NHC advisories for forecast track/intensity of Rafael,
and tropical-related watches/warnings.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0354 PM CST Tue Nov 05 2024

Valid 071200Z - 131200Z

An active mid-level flow regime is likely to continue over the CONUS
through the extended forecast period. Strong troughing over the
western US will gradually shift eastward this weekend, followed by
shortwave ridging. By early next week, the upper ridge will break
down, allowing stronger jet energy to move back over the West ahead
of a deepening Pacific trough. This active and progressive flow
pattern will continue through the end of the period, supporting the
potential for critical fire-weather over parts of California.

...Southern California...
On the backside of the strong trough, northerly flow will linger
over southern California D3/Thursday into early D4/Friday. Offshore
winds will remain fairly strong early in the period before weakening
rapidly into this weekend. As the winds gradually fade, very low
humidity should persist into the first part of the weekend. This may
keep some risk for localized fire-weather concerns through D6/Sunday
across parts of southern California.

Later in the weekend and into early next week,  onshore flow will
return, increasing RH as a progressive, low-latitude flow regime
persists. Fire-weather concerns will lessen temporarily before
potentially returning ahead of another deepening trough midweek next
week. Medium-range guidance shows the potential for a period of
offshore winds behind the large Pacific trough into week 2. Strong
winds and very low relative humidity could overlap with very dry and
dense fuels across much of southern California. Model guidance
varies enough on the magnitude and timing of the onset of offshore
winds that probabilities will be withheld for the time being.
However, significant fire-weather concerns are possible at the end
of the extended forecast period and through next week.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 PM CST Tue Nov 05 2024

Valid 052000Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PORTIONS OF
SOUTHERN WISCONSIN AND FROM THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY INTO THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Locally damaging winds and perhaps a tornado or two may occur across
a portion of the Lower and Mid Mississippi Valleys, and central to
southern Wisconsin.

...20Z Update...
With the primary mid-level forcing moving away from the ArkLaMiss,
storm coverage should generally remain more isolated through the
remainder of the afternoon. Furthermore, regional VAD profiles
suggest low-level shear have been decreasing with time. Given these
observational trends, tornado probabilities have been reduced in the
region.

The marginal risk across Wisconsin has been adjusted based on
surface observations. A line of shallow convection moving east
through western Wisconsin may produce isolated strong/damaging winds
as it moves into areas where at least muted heating has occurred.
KMKX VAD suggests strong enough flow in the lowest 1-2 km to support
this risk.

..Wendt.. 11/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1019 AM CST Tue Nov 05 2024/

...LA/MS...
A large upper trough is present today over the central US, with the
primary surface boundary extending from eastern AR southward into
central LA.  Scattered thunderstorms have been occurring along and
ahead of this boundary, including several storms exhibiting low and
mid level rotation.  Winds aloft are expected to weaken through the
day, but there is a continued chance of isolated tornadoes for a few
hours late this morning and early afternoon.  Therefore have added a
small SLGT risk area.  Please refer to MCD #2213 for further details
on this environment.

...AR/TN/KY/IN...
A narrow line of thunderstorms is noted along the boundary across
eastern AR.  Several morning CAM solutions suggest this line may
maintain some character through the afternoon and it tracks
northeastward across parts of the mid MS Valley.  Visible satellite
imagery shows breaks in the clouds across this region, providing
some heating and destabilization.  Also, low level wind fields will
remain rather strong ahead of the convection.  This may be
sufficient for locally gusty/damaging wind gusts this afternoon.

....WI...
A few low-topped showers and thunderstorms will likely form later
this afternoon near a deepening surface low over WI.  Widespread
clouds will limit destabilization, but there is some potential for
locally gusty/damaging winds during the peak-heating period.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN LOS ANGELES AND
SOUTHERN VENTURA COUNTIES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Afternoon Update...
Confidence remains high that a strong offshore wind event will
develop across much of southern California beginning early Wednesday
and continuing into Thursday morning. Santa Ana winds with isolated
gusts to 60 mph are possible across Los Angeles and Ventura
counties. These strong winds will overlap with very low RH as low as
8-10% supporting extremely critical fire-weather conditions.

The latest CANSAC WRF also shows strong offshore winds developing
across portions of Orange and San Diego counties Wednesday afternoon
and continuing through early Thursday. While offshore gradients are
not as strong, gusts of 40-50 mph and RH of 10-15% will support
several hours of critical fire-weather conditions amidst dry fuels.
Have expanded the Critical area across all of coastal Orange/San
Diego counties and into portions of the western inland Valleys. See
the prior discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 11/05/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0213 AM CST Tue Nov 05 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level ridge will amplify over the eastern Pacific and CA
coast, as a belt of strong midlevel northerly flow extends from the
Northwest to southern CA. This large-scale pattern will reinforce a
strong surface anticyclone over the Intermountain West, leading to a
robust offshore pressure gradient across southern CA. 

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient will be peaking from the morning into
the afternoon/evening time frame, with most guidance depicting a
LAX-TPH pressure gradient less than -13 mb and LAX-DAG gradient less
than -6 mb -- both indicating a strong Santa Ana event across
southern CA. This pressure gradient, combined with the strong
deep-layer northerly flow directed toward the coast, will promote
30+ mph sustained northeasterly surface winds across the typical
wind-prone Santa Ana corridors. Over the wind-prone mountains and
valleys of southern Ventura and northern/northwestern Los Angeles
Counties, gusts of 60+ mph will combine with RH decreasing into the
lower teens/single digits for several hours -- leading to extremely
critical fire-weather conditions atop receptive fuels.

...Northern/Central California...
The tightening pressure gradient and strong deep-layer northerly
flow will yield another day of breezy/gusty northerly surface winds
amid low RH across the western Sacramento Valley into the Coastal
Range. Given modestly receptive fuels, elevated to locally critical
fire-weather conditions are expected.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF
CENTRAL/WEST-CENTRAL TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible, beginning Thursday
afternoon across central/west-central parts of Texas.

...TX...
A mid- to upper-level low will meander slowly east across the Desert
Southwest during the period.  In between a surface high centered
over the central High Plains and TC Rafael in the Gulf of Mexico,
easterly low-level flow in the western Gulf Basin and TX will favor
a gradual westward push of modified moisture return into
west-central TX.  A surface trough will likely serve as the western
delimiter of moisture/instability.  Models indicate at least weak to
moderate buoyancy developing by mid-late afternoon in the Concho
Valley.  Shear profiles will support storm organization, including
the possibility for supercells.  Have made a small westward
adjustment to low-severe probabilities over west-central TX based on
the latest model guidance.  Large hail appears to be the primary
threat, although a confined zone may exhibit a short-duration threat
for a tornado.  A hail/wind risk could linger well into the evening
and perhaps early overnight depending on storm-scale details
unknown/not resolvable at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 2202
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0837 AM CST Mon Nov 04 2024

Areas affected...central/eastern Oklahoma and north Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 041437Z - 041700Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe/tornado threat is likely to increase by late
morning.

DISCUSSION...A very moist airmass is present from north Texas to
much of eastern Oklahoma with dewpoints in the upper 60s. This has
already yielded 1000 to 1500 J/kg MLCAPE with minimal surface
heating. Given the minimal inhibition (per SPC mesoanalysis and
regional 12Z RAOBs), expect widespread thunderstorm development by
late morning to early afternoon. Moderate instability and strong
shear will support supercells capable of all hazards. Parts of
central and south-central Oklahoma (near the I-35 corridor) have the
greatest uncertainty. Outflow from this mornings storms has advanced
east of I-35 with low 60s dewpoints and northerly/westerly flow.
However, strong, southerly flow is trying to stall this boundary and
lead to northward/westward airmass recovery within this corridor. 

A tornado watch will eventually be needed, but it is unclear whether
the threat will start to increase in the next 1 to 2 hours or closer
to mid-day when the primary ascent overspreads the region. Trends
will be monitored and a watch will be issued when an organized
severe threat appears imminent.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
SOUTHWEST TEXAS INTO CENTRAL OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms will be possible through tonight,
primarily from the Permian Basin and South Plains into Oklahoma.

...Northwest TX into OK...
Scattered clusters of rain and storms persist this evening from
extreme southeast NM across the South Plains and into central OK.
The large-scale instability gradient currently extends south of the
aggregate outflow, roughly from Midland TX to Ardmore OK, with
1000-1500 J/kg MUCAPE to the south.  

Given the persistent southerly flow regime through tonight, a moist
and unstable air mass will likely spread north, with elevated
instability increasing over currently rain-cooled areas from
northwest TX into OK. 

In the near term, the greatest supercell threat will remain over the
Permian Basin, in closer proximity to the most unstable air, with
hail or brief tornado risk. With time, storms may tend to
consolidate just north of the instability gradient, with an
increasing low-level jet supporting locally damaging gusts. Ambient
SRH over 200 m2/s2 may also favor embedded circulations at times,
especially if the activity can consolidate into a squall line as
indicated by some models.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 698
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
230 PM CDT Sat Nov 2 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  West Texas

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 230 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast
this afternoon into the evening across the Permian Basin.  A few
supercells capable of large to very large hail (1 to 2.5 inches in
diameter) and severe gusts (60-70 mph) are expected.  As the
low-level winds strengthen late this afternoon into the early
evening, a risk for a couple of tornadoes may develop with the more
intense supercells to the south of and immediately near an outflow
boundary draped from west to east across the area.  Storms will
likely grow upscale into one or more small clusters later this
evening with severe wind and hail becoming the primary hazards.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 50 statute miles
north and south of a line from 10 miles southwest of Carlsbad NM to
40 miles northeast of Midland TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 23025.
