<p>
When Rivian posted its now legendary
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzwM8KE2L3I">tank turn</a>”
video back in 2019, it forced a lot of people to realize that electric
drive could open up new possibilities for the way cars move. Now,
Hyundai Rotem is promising to build a silent, electric-drive battle tank
that can pull off the same trick — and a whole lot more.

<a href="https://pedegoelectricbikes.com/">Pedego</a> is said to be
collaborating with Newport Beach, California-based
<a href="https://electricbikecompany.com/">Electric Bike Company</a>,
bringing highly customized US-made electric bikes into Pedego’s lineup,
according to an announcement from Electric Bike Company.
</p>
<p>
<em>[Update October 25, 2024: According to Electric Bike Company, who
provided a press release and detailed information used in the article
below, the partnership originally described in this article was approved
by a portion of Pedego’s board as well as the private equity firm
Verlinvest, which purchased Pedego. However, Pedego has explained in a
message to its franchise shop owners that the partnership and
announcement is not accurate and was not supported by Pedego in any
official capacity. Instead, Pedego claimed that this particular
situation was meant to be a small, discreet test on a single model
(Model J) in two of their stores.]</em>

charm of the classic VW minibus with today’s EV tech, creating something

people in their tracks and everyone had questions about it. Having the
chance to be one of the first to drive this iconic vehicle was very
exciting and I have some thoughts.

Kubota’s Ze-421 and Ze-481 model zero-turn electric lawn mowers are the
latest in the company’s Ze Electric Zero-Turn range, promising reduced
maintenance, simpler operation, and higher levels of operator comfort.
The big question now is: <strong>when will they be available in the
US</strong>?

Russians have begun testing a locally-made electric motorcycle for
combat use in their war against Ukraine. It is no secret that the nearly
three-year-long invasion has led to significant Russian losses including

Russians appear to be getting even more creative with their military
vehicle selection.

<p>
Amazon is using a new, proprietary AI solution called Vision-Assisted
Package Retrieval (VAPR) to reduce the time and effort it takes for
delivery drivers to locate packages in their vans. Is it a game-changer,
