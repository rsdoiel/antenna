## If not React, then what?

date: 2024-12-02, from: OS News

Rejecting an engrained practice of bullshitting does not come easily. Frameworkism preaches that the way to improve user experiences is to adopt more (or different) tooling from the framework&#8217;s ecosystem. This provides adherents with something to&#160;do&#160;that looks plausibly like engineering, except it isn&#8217;t. It can even become a totalising commitment; solutions to user problems outside the framework&#8217;s expanded cinematic universe are unavailable to the frameworkist. Non-idiomatic patterns that unlock significant wins for users are bugs to be squashed. And without data or evidence to counterbalance bullshit artists&#8217;s assertions, who&#8217;s to say they&#8217;re wrong? Orthodoxy unmoored from measurements of user outcomes predictably spins into&#160;abstruse absurdities.&#160;Heresy, eventually, is perceived to carry heavy sanctions. It&#8217;s all nonsense. ↫ Alex Russell I&#8217;m not a developer, but any application that uses frameworks like React that I&#8217;ve ever used tend to be absolute trainwrecks when it comes to performance, usability, consistency, and platform integration. When someone claims to have an application available for a platform I use, but it&#8217;s using React or Electron or whatever, they&#8217;re lying in my eyes &#8211; what they really have is a website running in a window frame, which may or may not even be a native window frame. Developing using these tools indicates to me a lack of care, a lack of respect for the users of your product. I am militantly native. I&#8217;d rather use a less functional application than a Chrome web application cosplaying as a real application, and I will most likely not even consider using your service if all you have is a website-in-a-box. If you don&#8217;t respect me, I see no need to respect you. If you want an application on a specific platform, use that platform&#8217;s native tools and APIs to build it. Anything else tells me all I need to know about how much you truly care about the product you&#8217;re building.

## The Hall SC-VGA-2 video processor, the Atari ST and NeXTSTEP: more tales of the unscreenshotable

date: 2024-12-02, from: OS News

This is the Hall Research Technologies SC-VGA-2, sold as a &#8220;VGA/HDTV Video Processor.&#8221; In addition to slicing, dicing and pureeing, apparently, it will take any of a bundle of input formats and both rescale and resample them on the fly into the VGA or HDTV signal you desire, including 60Hz rates. This came from a seller specializing in teleprompter equipment and Hall still sells an HDMI version with additional resolutions &#8230; for around US$500. However, this or the slightly newer SC-VGA-2A and SC-VGA-2B are all relatively common devices and found substantially cheaper used. Let&#8217;s try it out and show some sample output, including those delicious NeXTSTEP system messages and some ST grabs. ↫ Cameron Kaiser With the obscurity of some of the hardware Cameron Kaiser details on his website, I&#8217;m not surprised he has some seriously unique needs when it comes to taking screengrabs. He couldn&#8217;t very well not take the device apart, and inside it appears to be a system with two small processors, at least one of which is an Intel 8051 8bit microcontroller. Kaiser goes into his usual great detail explaining and showing how the device works. If you&#8217;ve got unique screengrabbing needs, this might be of interest to you.

## MNT Pocket Reform Sculpt 24.10 preview image

date: 2024-12-02, from: OS News

Within in the last release cycle we worked on adding and extending the support for the i.MX8MP SoC as also found in one of the SoM options for the MNT Pocket Reform and are happy to show-case a first preview version of Sculpt running on this handy computing device. ↫ Josef Söntgen If you have a Pocket Reform &#8211; I reviewed its bigger sibling earlier this year &#8211; you can now run Genode on it. Not everything is working flawlessly yet &#8211; most notably audio and NVMe need work &#8211; but networking is operational, so you can actually browse the web. I&#8217;m not sure how much overlap there is between Genode users and Pocket Reform owners, but at least both groups now know it&#8217;s an option.
