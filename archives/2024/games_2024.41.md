## We need to talk about the ‘humans’ in Metaphor: ReFantazio

date: 2024-10-13, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website

Metaphor: ReFantazio is not a horror game — it’s a fantasy RPG with a story that keeps getting better as it goes along and a combat system that’s complex and satisfying. But whenever I run into the “humans,” monsters whose visual design look nothing like any human I’ve ever seen in my life, I feel [&#8230;]

Tomb Raider fans, bless them, spend a lot of time wondering how the series all syncs up. If the Lara Croft we saw in the original ’90s games is the same one as the rougher-around-the-edges Lara from the Survivor trilogy, then what happened in between to have it all make sense?  Luckily, answers appear on [&#8230;]

## The best thing about Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom? The music

date: 2024-10-12, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website

There’s been a slight sense of anticlimax after the release of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. It’s a very good game, of course, but perhaps a few steps shy of the greatness we expect of the series. Its new, indirect gameplay style, with Zelda conjuring echoes of objects and monsters to solve puzzles [&#8230;]

## New California law means digital stores can’t imply you’re buying a game when you’re merely licensing it

When you turn on your Xbox Series X, open the Microsoft Store, and buy Farming Simulator 22, you might think you own the game, but you’d be wrong. You actually paid for a license to play the game — not to own it. Companies can revoke the license at any time. It doesn’t happen all [&#8230;]
