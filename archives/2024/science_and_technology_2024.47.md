## FLTK 1.4.0 brings Wayland support

date: 2024-11-19, from: OS News

FLTK 1.4.0 has been released. This new version of the Fast Light Toolkit contains some major improvements, such as Wayland support on both Linux and FreeBSD. X11 and Wayland are both supported by default, and applications using FLTK will launch using Wayland if available, and otherwise fall back to starting with X11. This new release also brings HiDPI support on Linux and Windows, and improves said support on macOS. Those are the headline features, but there&#8217;s more changes here, of course, as well as the usual round of bugfixes. Right after the release of 1.4.0, a quick bugfix release, version 1.4.0-1, was released to address an issue in 1.4.0 &#8211; a build error on a single test program on Windows, when using Visual Studio. Not exactly a major bug, but great to see the team fix it so rapidly.

## Why did Windows 95 setup use three operating systems?

date: 2024-11-19, from: OS News

Way back in April of this year, I linked to a question and answer about why some parts of the Windows 98 installer looked older than the other parts. It turns out that in between the MS-DOS (the blue part) and Windows 98 parts of the installation process, the installer boots into a small version of Windows 3.1. Raymond Chen posted an article detailing this process for Windows 95, and why, exactly, Microsoft had to resort to splitting the installer between MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows 95. The answer is, as always, backwards compatibility. Since Windows 95 could be installed from MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, and Windows 95 (to fix an existing installation), the installer needed to be able to work on all three. The easiest solution would be to write the installer as an MS-DOS program, since that works on all three of these starting points, but that would mean an ugly installer, even though Windows 95 was supposed to be most people&#8217;s first experience with a graphical user interface. This is why Microsoft ended up with the tiered installation process &#8211; to support all possible starting points in the most graphical way possible. Chen also mentions another fun fact that is somewhat related to this: the first version of Excel for Windows was shipped with a version of the Windows 2.1 runtime, so that even people without Windows could still run Excel. Even back then, Microsoft took backwards compatibility seriously, and made sure people who hadn&#8217;t upgraded from MS-DOS to Windows 2.x yet &#8211; meaning, everyone &#8211; could still enjoy the spreadsheet lifestyle. I say we pass some EU law forcing Microsoft to bring this back. The next version of Excel should contain whatever is needed to run it on MS-DOS. Make it happen, Brussels.

## DOJ will push Google to sell Chrome to break search monopoly

date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News

Speaking of Google, the United States Department of Justice is pushing for Google to sell off Chrome. Top Justice Department antitrust officials have decided to ask a judge to force Alphabet Inc.’s Google to sell off its Chrome browser in what would be a historic crackdown on one of the biggest tech companies in the world. The department will ask the judge, who ruled in August that Google&#160;illegally monopolized&#160;the search market, to require measures related to artificial intelligence and its Android smartphone operating system, according to people familiar with the plans. ↫ Leah Nylen and Josh Sisco Let&#8217;s take a look at the history and current state of independent browsers, shall we? Netscape is obviously dead, Firefox is hanging on by a thread (which is inconspicuously shaped like a giant sack of money from Google), Opera is dead (its shady Chrome skin doesn&#8217;t count), Brave is cryptotrash run by a homophobe, and Vivaldi, while an actually good and capable Chrome skin with a ton of fun features, still isn&#8217;t profitable, so who knows how long they&#8217;ll last. As an independent company, Chrome wouldn&#8217;t survive. It seems the DoJ understands this, too, because they&#8217;re clearly using the words &#8220;sell off&#8221;, which would indicate selling Chrome to someone else instead of just spinning it off into a separate company. But who has both the cash and the interest in buying Chrome, without also being a terrible tech company with terrible business incentives that might make Chrome even more terrible than it already is? Through Chrome, Google has sucked all the air out of whatever was left of the browser market back when they first announced the browser. An independent Chrome won&#8217;t survive, and Chrome in anyone else&#8217;s hands might have the potential to be even worse. A final option out of left field would be turning Chrome and Chromium into a truly independent foundation or something, without a profit motive, focused solely on developing the Chromium engine, but that, too, would be easily abused by financial interests. I think the most likely outcome is one none of us want: absolutely nothing will happen. There&#8217;s a new administration coming to Washington, and if the recent proposed picks for government positions are anything to go by, America will be incredibly lucky if they get someone smarter than a disemboweled frog on a stick to run the DoJ. More likely than not, Google&#8217;s lawyers will walk all over whatever&#8217;s left of the DoJ after 20 January, or Pichai will simply kiss some more gaudy gold rings to make the case go away.

## Google is reportedly killing Chrome OS in favour of Android

date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News

Mishaal Rahman, who has a history of being right about Google and Android-related matters, is reporting that Google is intending to standardise its consumer operating system efforts onto a single platform: Android. To better compete with the iPad as well as manage engineering resources more effectively, Google wants to unify its operating system efforts. Instead of merging Android and Chrome OS into a new operating system like rumors suggested in the past, however, a source told me that Google is instead working on fully migrating Chrome OS over to Android. While we don’t know what this means for the Chrome OS or Chromebook brands, we did hear that Google wants future “Chromebooks” to ship with the Android OS in the future. That’s why I believe that Google’s rumored new Pixel Laptop will run a new version of desktop Android as opposed to the Chrome OS that you’re likely familiar with. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority The fact both Chrome OS and Android exist, and are competing with each other in some segments &#8211; most notably tablets &#8211; hasn&#8217;t done either operating system any favours. I doubt many people even know Chrome OS tablets are a thing, and I doubt many people would say Android tablets are an objectively better choice than an iPad. I personally definitely prefer Android on tablets over iOS on tablets, but I fully recognise that for 95% of tablet buyers, the iPad is the better, and often also more affordable, choice. Google has been struggling with Android on tablets for about as long as they&#8217;ve existed, and now it seems that the company is going to focus all of its efforts on just Android, leaving Chrome OS to slowly be consumed and replaced by it. In June, Google already announced it was going to replace both the kernel and several subsystems in Chrome OS with their Android counterparts, and now they&#8217;re also building a new version of Chrome for Android with extensions supports &#8211; to match Chrome on Chrome OS &#8211; as well as a terminal application for Android that gives access to a local Linux virtual machine, much like is available on Chrome OS. As mentioned, laptops running Android will also be making an entrance, including a Pixel laptop straight from Google. The next big update for Android 15 contains a ton of new proper windowing features, and there&#8217;s more coming: improved keyboard and mouse support, as well as external monitors, virtual desktops, and a lot more. As anyone who has ever attempted to run Android on a desktop or laptop knows, there&#8217;s definitely a ton of work Google needs to do to make Android palatable to consumers on that front. Of course, this being Google, any of these rumours or plans could change at any time without any sense of logic behind it, as managers fulfill their quotas, get promoted, or leave the company.

## iOS 18.1 will reboot iPhones to a locked state after 72 hours of inactivity

date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News

In recent weeks, law enforcement in the United States discovered, to their dismay, that iPhones were automatically rebooting themselves after a few days of inactivity, thereby denying them access to the contents of these phones. After a lot of speculation online, Jiska Classen dove into this story to find out what was going on, and through reverse-engineering they discovered that this was a new security feature built by Apple as part of iOS 18.1, to further make stolen iPhones useless for both thieves as well as law enforcement officers. It&#8217;s a rather clever feature. The Secure Enclave Processor inside the iPhone keeps track of when the phone was last unlocked, and if that period exceeds 72 hours, the SEP will inform a kernel module. This kernel module will then, in turn, tell the phone to gracefully reboot, meaning no data is lost in this process. If the phone for whatever reason does not reboot and remains powered on, the module will assume the phone&#8217;s been tampered with somehow and kernel-panic. Interestingly, if the reboot takes place properly, an analytics report stating how long the phone was not unlocked will be sent to Apple. The reason this is such a powerful feature is that a locked iPhone is entirely useless to anyone who doesn&#8217;t have the right code or biometrics to unlock it. Everything on the device is encrypted, and only properly unlocking it will decrypt the phone&#8217;s contents; in fact, a locked phone can&#8217;t even join a Wi-Fi network, because the stored passwords are encrypted (and I&#8217;m assuming that a locked phone does not provide access to any methods of joining an open network either). When you have a SIM card without any pincode, the iPhone will connect to the cellular network, but any notifications or calls coming in will effectively be empty, since incoming phone numbers can&#8217;t be linked to any of the still-encrypted contacts, and while the phone can tell it&#8217;s received notifications, it can&#8217;t show you any of their contents. A thief who&#8217;s now holding this phone can&#8217;t do much with it if it locks itself like this after a few days, and law enforcement won&#8217;t be able to access the phone either. This is a big deal in places where arrests based purely on skin colour or ethnicity or whatever are common, like in the United States (and in Europe too, just to a far lesser degree), or in places where people have to fear the authorities for other reasons, like in totalitarian dictatorships like Russia, China or Iran, where any hint of dissent can end you in harsh prisons. Apple is always at the forefront with features such as these, with Google and Android drunkenly stumbling into the open door a year later with copies that take ages to propagate through the Android user base. I&#8217;m legitimately thankful for Apple raising awareness of the need of features such as these &#8211; even if they&#8217;re too cowardly to enable them in places like China &#8211; as it&#8217;s quite clear a lot more people need to start caring about these things, with recent developments and all.

## Migrating Windows VMs from Proxmox BIOS/KVM to FreeBSD UEFI/Bhyve

date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News

Another excellent guide from friend of the website Stefano Marinelli. A client of mine has several Windows Server VMs, which I had not migrated to FreeBSD/bhyve until a few weeks ago. These VMs were originally installed with the traditional BIOS boot mode, not UEFI, on Proxmox. Fortunately, their virtual disks are on ZFS, which allowed me to test and achieve the final result in just a few steps. This is because Windows VMs (server or otherwise) often installed on KVM (Proxmox, etc.), especially older ones, are non-UEFI, using the traditional BIOS boot mode. bhyve doesn’t support this setup, but Windows allows changing the boot mode, and I could perform the migration directly on the target FreeBSD server. ↫ Stefano Marinelli I link to guides like these because finding such detailed guides born out of experience, written by actual humans with actual experience &#8211; instead of bots on content farms &#8211; is remarkably hard. There&#8217;s more than enough similar content like this out there covering Windows or popular Linux distributions like Red Hat, but the BSDs tend to fall a bit short here. As such, promoting people writing such content is something I&#8217;ll happily do. Marinelli also happens to host the Matrix server (as part of his BSD Cafe effort) that houses the OSNews Matrix room, accessible by becoming an OSNews Patreon.

## Linux 6.12 released

date: 2024-11-18, from: OS News

Version 6.12 of the Linux kernel has been released. The main feature consists of the merger of the real-time PREEMPT_RT scheduler, most likely one of the longest-running merger sagas in Linux&#8217; history. This means that Linux now fully supports both soft and hard real-time capabilities natively, which is a major step forward for the platform, especially when looking at embedded development. It&#8217;s now no longer needed to draw in real-time support from outside the kernel. Linux 6.12 also brings a huge number of improvements for graphics drivers, for both Intel and AMD&#8217;s graphics cards. With 6.12, Linux now supports the Intel Xe2 integrated GPU as well as Intel&#8217;s upcoming discrete &#8220;Battlemage&#8221; GPUs by default, and it contains more AMD RDNA4 support for those upcoming GPUs. DRM panics messages in 6.12 will show a QR code you can scan for more information, a feature written in Rust, and initial support for the Raspberry Pi 5 finally hit mainline too. Of course, there&#8217;s a lot more in here, like the usual LoongArch and ARM improvements, new drivers, and so on. and if you&#8217;re a regular Linux user you&#8217;ll see 6.12 make it to your distribution within a few weeks or months.

## AI poetry out-humans humans as readers prefer bots to bards

<h4>Uncultured swine prone to believe complexity of verse is machine-generated babble</h4> <p>A study in the US has found that readers can&#39;t tell the difference between poems written by famous poets and those written by AI aping their style. To make matters worse – for anyone fostering a love of literature at least – research subjects tend to like AI poetry more than they do verse from human poets.…</p>

## Free Towns OS: an open source recreation of FM Towns OS

date: 2024-11-17, from: OS News

A few weeks ago I linked to a story by Misty De Meo, in which they explored what happened to the various eccentric Japanese PC platforms. One of the platforms mentioned was FM Towns, made by Fujitsu, which came with its own graphical operating system from the era of Windows 3.x. I had never heard of this one before, but it looks incredibly interesting, with some unique UI ideas I&#8217;d love to explore, if only I could read Japanese. Since learning Japanese is a serious life-long commitment, I can safely say that&#8217;s not going to happen. It seems I&#8217;m not the only one interested in FM Towns, as a new project called Free Towns OS (or Tsugaru OS in Japanese) aims to provide an open source replacement for the Free Towns operating system. The goal of this project is to write a copyright-free FM Towns OS to run free games and the re-released games, or why not a brand-new game for FM Towns. without concerns of violating copyrights of the files included in the original Towns OS. Let&#8217;s see how far we can go! But, so far so good. Now Tsugaru OS is capable of running the three probably the most popular free games, Panic Ball 2, VSGP, and Sky Duel. All playable without single file from the original Towns OS. ↫ Free Towns OS GitHub page That&#8217;s a pretty good milestone already. The project aims to eventually also be able to run on real hardware instead of just emulators, but further than that, it&#8217;s difficult for me to extract more information from the descriptions since not every paragraph has been translated to English just yet. Finding English information on FM Towns OS in general is hard, so I&#8217;m also not entirely sure just how much the project has already been able to recreate. I definitely hope this effort attracts more interest, hopefully also from outside of Japan so we can get a translated version people outside of Japan can use.

## Microsoft finally publishes ISO for Windows on ARM

date: 2024-11-17, from: OS News

This option is for users that want to create a Windows 11 on Arm virtual machine on supported hardware using an ISO file or to install Windows 11 on Arm directly without a DVD or USB flash drive.  The ISO file can also be used to manually create bootable installation media (USB flash drive) to install Windows 11 on Arm, but it may be necessary to include drivers from the device manufacturer for the installation media to be successfully bootable. This download is a multi-edition ISO which uses your product key to unlock the correct edition. ↫ Windows on ARM ISO download Oddly enough, up until now, Microsoft hadn&#8217;t published a Windows 11 on ARM ISO yet. With this new ISO, ARM users can do a fresh install, and create Windows on ARM virtual machines. Not the biggest news in the world, but it&#8217;s a little bit surprising it&#8217;s taken them this long to publish this ISO file.
