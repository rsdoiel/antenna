Thanks for Your Service Lt. Col. Camacho</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, updated: 2024-07-15, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is I’ve decided to lead by example, as I’ve
been waiting to give Locals/Politicians a chance to THANK Lt. Col.
Edward C. Camacho for his 43 years of Service first, as I just wrote an
Op ed about the need for us to say THANKS more.  Lt. Col. Camacho is a
REAL “Bad-A**,” for TRUE and may have been one of, if not the highest
serving Chamorro to ever be in the military along with PSS’s
Commissioner. But I can remember when Lt. Col. Camacho was chosen to be
our DPS Commissioner, as I was sooo glad along with many others to know
we had someone we could TRUST.  His genuine humility and appreciation
for such an honor with teers for being appointed was something I will
never forget. It is truly touching when grown men cries and it is truly
a special and even a historic event when it’s a Lt. Col.  There was no
doubt in the minds of many citizens that he was the RIGHT man who is
made of the Right-Stuff — training/experience, integrity, respectful and
humble! I’m sure the average reader would love to have Lt. Col. Camacho
on their team figuratively.</p>

<p>(CNMI Department of Lands and Natural Resources &amp; University of
Washington) — Åga enthusiasts can rejoice as the species reached an
important milestone recently. The Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi), known
in Chamorro as “Åga,” has been listed as an endangered species in the
Marianas since 1984. Though once plentiful, the introduction of the
Brown Tree Snake to Guam in the 1940’s led to their decline and listing,
with the population on Luta or Rota being the last remaining of what had
been a thriving species.</p>
