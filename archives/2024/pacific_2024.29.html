<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;After two friendlies in blazing heat and humid weather, the U.S. women&amp;#8217;s national team is headed to France for the Paris Olympics. With a 1-0 win against Mexico and a dreary scoreless draw against Costa Rica, head coach Emma Hayes&amp;#8217; plan of attack is still unclear. The game against Costa Rica in particular showed what not to do with the U.S. registering 26 shots (12 on goal) and 80% possession. Costa Rica took just two shots and they were both in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Tornadoes have been a subject of film fascination since &amp;#8220;The Wizard of Oz&amp;#8221; in 1939, but Dutch filmmaker Jan de Bont helped to solidify the appeal of the cinematic cyclone with his 1996 summer blockbuster &amp;#8220;Twister,&amp;#8221; about a group of adrenaline junkie storm chasers. A new installment, &amp;#8220;Twisters,&amp;#8221; arrives 28 years after de Bont&amp;#8217;s film, chasing away all those &amp;#8220;Sharknados&amp;#8221; that have cluttered up the tornado movie subgenre, and reminding us of what made &amp;#8220;Twister&amp;#8221; so appealing to begin with: it wasn&amp;#8217;t necessarily the airborne fauna, but rather, the human dramas that play out as tornadoes roam across the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

Truth 60: Stuck in Reverse needing to go FORWARD!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, updated: 2024-07-17, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is that it’s obvious the CNMI is stuck in
reverse needing to go forward. Ever since the poli-tricking that killed
La Fiesta the CNMI has being slowly going backwards economically with no
end in site because there has yet to be any REAL REFORMS to make the
CNMI a BETTER Tourist destination.  Crying for tourists from China will
NOT fix our economy and it is a small bandage if anything. WE can’t keep
our people nor get new tourists because “the CNMI is out-of-step with
the rest of America/World Tourism.”  IF our leaders would take the RIGHT
steps to turn our economic downfall around, the rest will be easy, as
the real problem is not new tourists but the need for NEW Attractions
which is what WE were supposed to have been setting up during Covid. 
But Ralph was busy with “pipe dream of Mr. Tan with the Deer BS for
“high-end tourists” in the Northern Islands and giving our money away!
Ralph put us in reverse and now we must go FORWARD and I’m fighting FOR
ALL of us in this boat, even my critics who are full of bigotry, I just
keep praying for them!</p>

Thanks for Your Service Lt. Col. Camacho</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, updated: 2024-07-15, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is I’ve decided to lead by example, as I’ve
been waiting to give Locals/Politicians a chance to THANK Lt. Col.
Edward C. Camacho for his 43 years of Service first, as I just wrote an
Op ed about the need for us to say THANKS more.  Lt. Col. Camacho is a
REAL “Bad-A**,” for TRUE and may have been one of, if not the highest
serving Chamorro to ever be in the military along with PSS’s
Commissioner. But I can remember when Lt. Col. Camacho was chosen to be
our DPS Commissioner, as I was sooo glad along with many others to know
we had someone we could TRUST.  His genuine humility and appreciation
for such an honor with teers for being appointed was something I will
never forget. It is truly touching when grown men cries and it is truly
a special and even a historic event when it’s a Lt. Col.  There was no
doubt in the minds of many citizens that he was the RIGHT man who is
made of the Right-Stuff — training/experience, integrity, respectful and
humble! I’m sure the average reader would love to have Lt. Col. Camacho
on their team figuratively.</p>

Washington) — Åga enthusiasts can rejoice as the species reached an
important milestone recently. The Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi), known
in Chamorro as “Åga,” has been listed as an endangered species in the
Marianas since 1984. Though once plentiful, the introduction of the
Brown Tree Snake to Guam in the 1940’s led to their decline and listing,
with the population on Luta or Rota being the last remaining of what had
been a thriving species.</p>
