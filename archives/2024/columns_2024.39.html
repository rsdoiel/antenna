Configuring Odd¬µ via environment variables</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-09-29-configuring-odd¬µ-via-environment-variables">
2024-09-29 Configuring Odd¬µ via environment variables
</h1>
<p>
<a href="Odd%C2%B5">Odd¬µ</a> replaced <a href="Oddmuse">Oddmuse</a> as
my preferred wiki software.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Odd¬µ is a <strong>wiki</strong> ‚Äì a website that can be edited on the
web, using a regular web browser on my phone, for example. Only I get to
edit the wiki these days and there is no way to leave a comment. Send me
an email, instead. I love getting email! üòç
</li>
<li>
Odd¬µ is a <strong>static site generator</strong> (SSG) so that I can in
theory write a bunch of Markdown files locally, run Odd¬µ and upload the
result to the web. The reason I don‚Äôt use it like that is that this
disables online search. If you don‚Äôt need online search or you‚Äôre using
some other software to handle it, static files are a great option.
Static files are also a great option if you need to archive or export
the whole site for offline viewing. Anybody will be able to browse the
HTML files offline.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Odd¬µ reacts to changes made as it runs, so I can edit the Markdown files
remotely, using ssh and my favourite editor or I can edit the Markdown
files locally and sync them with the server and the pages Odd¬µ serves
reflect those changes immediately, no restart required. Earlier versions
required a restart so that Odd¬µ would update its in-memory indexes of
page names and titles.
</p>
<p>
Odd¬µ is also a program that doesn‚Äôt take a config file. Oddmuse, its
predecessor, was famously hackable. There were a gazillion options to
set. You could hook into the parser and add new rules, add new actions,
add new meta data, and on and on. The drawback was an incredible
lock-in. After twenty years, I started to feel it: it was hard to remove
features for any specific wiki because its pages used all a markup that
was incompatible with everything else. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used the
old UseMod markup that was used by MediaWiki, too. Some of my Oddmuse
wikis used the newer Wiki Creole markup that some wiki engine authors
wanted to push <a href="2006-09-04_Wiki_Creole">back in 2006</a>. Some
of my Oddmuse wikis used their own eclectic mix. Some of my Oddmuse
wikis used Markdown. For a while I even added
<a href="Gemtext">Gemtext</a> to the mix! I didn‚Äôt like this
incompatibility between sites and sometimes even between old and new
pages on the same site. This is why Odd¬µ only does Markdown with three
minimal extensions: hashtags, wiki links and fedi account links.
</p>
<p>
Odd¬µ generates HTML using templates so there is no need for options to
control the HTML output. If you want it changed, edit the templates. See
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-templates.5">oddmu-templates(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
Odd¬µ doesn‚Äôt know anything about users, passwords and permissions. If
you want authentication and authorization (which you do, if your wiki is
public), then you need to configure your webserver to ask for passwords
and restrict access accordingly. See
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-apache.5">oddmu-apache(5)</a> and
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-nginx.5">oddmu-nginx(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
Over time, however, I did add a few configuration options to Odd¬µ. This
happens via environment variables.
</p>
<p>
When stdin is a socket, Odd¬µ reads requests from it instead of listening
on port. This allows for systemd-style socket activation. This is what I
use at the moment. Otherwise, it listens on the address from
<strong>ODDMU_ADDRESS</strong> and the port from
<strong>ODDMU_PORT</strong>. ODDMU_ADDRESS may be either an IPV4 address
or an IPv6 address. If ODDMU_ADDRESS is unspecified, then the listener
listens on all available unicast addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6. If
ODDMU_PORT is unspecified, it listens on port 8080. See
<a href="oddmu/oddmu.1">oddmu(1)</a> and
<a href="oddmu/oddmu.service.5">oddmu.service(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
By default, Oddmu tries to identify the language used on every page in
order to allow a style sheet to enable hyphenation for the correct
language. This is important for multi-lingual sites. The library used
detects over 70 languages. This takes memory and time.
<strong>ODDMU_LANGUAGES</strong> allows admins to reduce the number of
languages taken into account. This site, for example, only considers
English and German. See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.1">oddmu(1)</a> and
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-templates.5">oddmu-templates(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
A pretty hairy feature is activated using <strong>ODDMU_FILTER</strong>.
Sometimes, subdirectories are separate sites. If you do not want to
include those sites in searches or archives of the whole site, you need
to identify them. The way to do this is via the environment variable
ODDMU_FILTER. It‚Äôs value is a regular expression matching separate
sites. On this site, my dad‚Äôs old site resides in such a subdirectory. I
use this environment variable to exclude ‚Äúhis‚Äù pages from searches made
on ‚Äúmy‚Äù pages. See <a href="oddmu/oddmu-filter.7">oddmu-filter(7)</a>
for more.
</p>
<p>
And finally, since linking to fediverse accounts involves an outgoing
Webfinger lookup, this feature is disabled by default. You can switch it
on by setting <strong>ODDMU_WEBFINGER</strong> to ‚Äú1‚Äù. It‚Äôs what I do.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.5">oddmu(5)</a> for more.
</p>

<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Odd¬µ">#Odd¬µ</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-29</strong>. I really love the fact that I picked
Markdown. If I miss something, I can just write HTML directly. And with
the decision to use Markdown, all the Markdown writing from years on
GitHub use stays relevant. There‚Äôs no need to tinker with the code. That
still surprises me.

<h2 id="how-do-i-feel-about-the-mnt-pocket-reform">2024-09-29 How do I
feel about the MNT Pocket Reform?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-09-29-how-do-i-feel-about-the-mnt-pocket-reform">
2024-09-29 How do I feel about the MNT Pocket Reform?
</h1>
<p>
SpaceLizard asked:
<a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/what-brought-you-to-the-mnt-community/2132">What
brought you to the MNT community</a>? Well, actually there were three
questions:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
How did you first find out about MNT Reform and/or what brought you
here?
</li>
<li>
What do you do / want to do with your Reform Laptop most?
</li>
<li>
Are cats or dogs better, (or robots)?
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here‚Äôs what I said:
</p>
<p>
I learned about MNT Reform on fedi. I had bought a Purism laptop
<a href="2017-12-23_New_Laptop">in 2017</a> and
<a href="2018-06-08_Librem_13_by_Purism_Mini_Review">I wasn‚Äôt happy</a>.
On a blog post <a href="2021-08-26_New_laptop%2C_again%E2%80%BD">in
2021</a> I mentioned the MNT Reform laptop for the first time. I
mentioned the MNT Pocket Reform in 2022,
<a href="2020-11-20_Small_computer">on a blog post from 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
I still use the Purism laptop as my main laptop, but one of its hinges
broke in 2021 and I needed something else to take on trips. That‚Äôs why I
started looking for an extra small laptop. I wanted something that was
energy efficient, that would allow me to use all my Debian stable tools
for system administration, to write Perl code, to use Emacs, to browse
the web using Firefox, to ssh into my server and do maintenance work
from hotel rooms and the like. The MNT Pocket Reform landed on the list.
</p>
<p>
As it stands right now, I‚Äôm still using Debian testing but I‚Äôd love to
make that switch to Debian stable one day. My secret idea is that I just
have to wait and one day I‚Äôd be able to do it using
/etc/apt/sources.list sorcery. I managed to switch from PureOS to Debian
stable doing that, so I don‚Äôt doubt that there is a way to do it from
Debian testing to Debian stable. Painfully, maybe, but doable.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôd love for battery and wifi to be no problem. Right now, battery life
is good enough for my evening sessions if I have to move to the couch,
and wifi seems to be working fine now that summer is over. I have an
ethernet connection for the Pocket Reform, however, and that‚Äôs very
nice. The cable is 3m long or something. But in a hotel, wifi still
works, as I said.
</p>
<p>
I recently had some emergency sysadmin stuff to do in the evenings while
on holidays and the Pocket Reform did exactly what I needed it to do.
</p>
<p>
Finally, cats are bird murderers and dogs are our best friends. No
question, dogs are better! But also, I don‚Äôt have time in my life for a
dog, so I think I‚Äôll vote for little Internet people in my computers, on
forums, IRC, Discord, Fedi, newsgroups and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Luckily,
<a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@josch" title="@josch@floss.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="josch">@josch</span></a> had some answers
for me!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Instead of doing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> sorcery in the
future, you could replace ‚Äútesting‚Äù by ‚Äútrixie‚Äù today. That way, at the
point in time where ‚Äútesting‚Äù becomes ‚Äústable‚Äù you do not need to edit
your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. The updates and security
mirrors also exist already for trixie but are of course empty but this
means that you can also add those today already and have things set up
for the future:
</p>
<pre><code>deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie main
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie-updates main
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security trixie-security main
</code></pre>
<p>
The one point of pain may be that after the trixie release, the MNT
repositories will continue to build packages for unstable which will
work for a while but will break after new uploads of glibc and friends.
So in the future, you might want to switch out the MNT repo for the
Debian stable repositories on <code>reform.debian.net</code> which are
currently only serving packages for bookworm and not trixie.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This sounds like great advice.

I haven‚Äôt mentioned this before, but I‚Äôm working on the reading
interface for my blog. What you see when you go to scripting.com. I‚Äôm
putting the same kind of attention into it that I did for the

reader earlier this year. There are a few unreleased products that use
the same approach. The way we read the web hasn‚Äôt received enough
attention, we‚Äôve been so focused on the twitter-like interfaces,
forgetting that reading on a full page is important too. We‚Äôve settled
for a pretty awful way of reading. I want to fix writing too, and have
plans for this, but I thought I should do some work on reading as well.
I wish I could show you all the new ideas, but I‚Äôm saving that for a big

work</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/11/14/weTryHarder.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Molly
White wrote a <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/posse/">great
piece</a> on the problem we‚Äôre all facing now that so many of us are
trying to maintain a presence on a few different social web sites. She
describes a situation I‚Äôve been writing about since the mid-late 00s,
with the inception of Twitter and Google Reader, two phenoms that had
very different ideas of what writing on the web should be. That‚Äôs where
the problems started.
</p>
<p>
Before that we had a cross-posting API that was broadly supported and
really worked, based on
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#hrelementsOfLtitemgt">RSS
2.0‚Äôs idea</a> of what a post is. It‚Äôs called the
<a href="https://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog">Metaweblog API</a>, and it‚Äôs
still supported by
<a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_MetaWeblog_API">WordPress</a>
and probably a few other social web sites (I take a broad view of what
the social web is and definitely include WordPress and other blogging
tools. Based on Molly‚Äôs piece, I expect she would see it that way too.)
</p>
<p>
The first approach I took to this problem was to cross-post as Molly
describes, to work around the limits in software. But the limits will
creep into your writing, since you know that people who read your stuff
on Bluesky, Threads or Twitter won‚Äôt see the links, you‚Äôll be reluctant
to them in your writing. I encountered this problem in the mid-teens
when I was trying to cross-post to Medium and Facebook, one supported
links and basic HTML, the other didn‚Äôt. Eventually before
<a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">giving
up</a> on the POSSE approach in 2017, I was barely using links at all. I
was trying to keep four pieces of software happy and doing so made my
writing suck.
</p>
<p>
To get a handle on the problem, I created a list of features I felt all
social web platforms should support and published it at
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting.org</a>. Ultimately I
think we‚Äôre going to have to make a platform that implements a
reasonable subset of this functionality, if only as a demo for the
social web companies to show them what we want. There already are
Mastodon forks that support some of the features (no character limit,
Markdown support).
</p>
<p>
I <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting">published the
code</a> I use to cross-post for my linkblog, that much does work quite
well across the different platforms, and I‚Äôd be happy to operate a
server for people to experiment with. The
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/textcasting.js">server
software</a> runs in Node.js, is already open source. It has a simple
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main/plugins/platforms">plug-in
architecture</a> so support for new platforms can be added without
modifying the server.
</p>
<p>
But my main point is this ‚Äì let‚Äôs
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html">work together</a>.
We really aren‚Äôt very good in tech at building on each others‚Äô work,
that‚Äôs why we get so stuck. I have a lot to say about that too, I‚Äôve
been writing about it on my blog for many many years.
</p>
<p>
And thanks for picking up this thread. It‚Äôs one of the two big threads ‚Äì
along with AI ‚Äì how are we going to make writing on the web work.
</p>
<p>
PS: I started writing this in Mastodon, but obviously I had to fall back
to my blog, because there was no room and I needed to use links or why
bother. ;-)

<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve had the same thought as
<a href="https://presswatchers.org/2024/09/what-if-the-media-has-the-election-all-wrong/">Dan
Froomkin</a>, of course ‚Äì esp given how much voodoo is in weighting
various things, the polls are junk.
</p>
<p>
But, she <i>could</i> be winning much bigger than the polls say. And
wouldn‚Äôt that be nice. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">‚ù§Ô∏è</span>
</p>
<p>
But do you remember part of the 2016 postmortem was that yeah it was a
problem for the racists among us that we elected a black president, and
now they want a woman president. Many of us thought this is the price
we‚Äôre paying for the euphoria we felt in 2008.
</p>
<p>
All he says about Harris is true. She‚Äôs a dream candidate, she had my
vote at ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù How could anyone <i>not</i> see what‚Äôs so obvious,
here‚Äôs someone who organized her party‚Äôs support in the blink of an eye,
and she was ready to run, all the pieces were in place in record time.
Such competence, drive, humor, did I say drive? :-)
</p>
<p>
I worry that maybe all that was enough to get her even with Trump
because now we‚Äôre pressing the race and gender button again, and they
still don‚Äôt buy the idea of a non-white-male, Christian president.
</p>
<p>
Oh and btw her husband is Jewish, and‚Ä¶ all the childless bullshit.
</p>
<p>
So I worry that we may be borderline fucked again. Pray. Pray, even if
you don‚Äôt believe.

Live Gamer Portable 2 Plus - Can‚Äôt record to microSD</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased an &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3TMeYv8&quot;&gt;AVerMedia Live Gamer Portable 2 Plus&lt;/a&gt; to help record screens on devices I test at my desk.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
It‚Äôs claim to fame is being able to record to a microSD card standalone
(at resolutions up to 1080p60), without having a separate computer
attached.
</p>
<p>
For my 4K cameras, I typically use an
<a href="https://amzn.to/4elL8pA">Atomos Ninja V</a>, since it can
record in full 4K resolution, but that thing is $700‚Äîthe Live Gamer
Portable is $120, and runs a lot cooler (and quieter).
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt enjoy dealing with microSD cards, but it‚Äôs more convenient than
having to use OBS or some other recording software on my main computer
just to capture the HDMI output of another device. Especially since I
can‚Äôt pass through the HD or 4K signal through my little Elgato USB
capture card (they do make a few models that do this, but I digress).
</p>
<p>
<em>Anyway</em>, what brings me to this post is the fact I spent way too
long trying to figure out the magical microSD card format required to be
able to record on the device.

markets have dominant products, evolution freezes. Google search, for
example. I should have great search for my blog by now, powered by
Google. It has been here for 26 years. They should have been doing
R&amp;D on how they can be part of a better reading environment on the
web. But reading on the web has just gotten worse over the years. It‚Äôs
why we don‚Äôt like clicking on links, usually what we find at the other
end of the link is obnoxious. To get some peace and quiet we had to go
to Twitter of all places, but now that‚Äôs gotten ridiculous too. The only
corner of the web where there‚Äôs real exciting innovation is ChatGPT. And
what‚Äôs tragic about that is we‚Äôve never made search work on the web, and
search is valuable too, not just the digested version of what was said
that ChatGPT produces. But I‚Äôd like some of my writing to survive the
Great Ingestion. Writing matters, how humans express themselves matters.
In other words we still have work to do in search, AI does not fill that
need, at least not yet.</p>

<p>An idea for a news org. I want a for-pay site where I can ask a
question about the news and get the most up-to-date answer. I‚Äôd like to
link to that page from a blog post, and have it either be frozen, to
document where we were on that day, or dynamic, so that it changes over
time. I‚Äôm sure this product will be here soon, so obvious.</p>

do I care about what <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>
means? Because I plan to add functionality to this space. I‚Äôm tired of
all the stupid limits these products have. Titles or no titles. 300
character limits. No links, etc etc and on and on. Where did they get
the idea that taking features out of writing was something they could
do. What a wrong turn we took there. And now that once we have a chance
to erase the limits, maybe ‚Äì none of the companies running their
products are doing it. I don‚Äôt want the way they do it to be the only
way, the products are <i>deliberately</i> incompatible. Social web is
the best name for what I‚Äôm working on. So I need to reserve this space.
They didn‚Äôt ask for my opinion, the first I heard of it was a press
release. When I ship my thing I want to point back at this and say look
‚Äì I did tell you this was going to be a problem.</p>

<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/DAYZWUXpEyJ">question</a>
came up on Threads as to whether the ActivityPub support in Ghost will
be a full two-way presence in the fedisphere, and apparently the
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@quillmatiq/post/DALtxZ_PiiX">answer</a>
is yes. They are working on a feed reader that also hooks into AP.
That‚Äôs how I would have done it. Really feeds and tweets should always
have been peers. If you want to know the history, blame Google Reader
for that disconnect. Also it highlights the need for a
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/DAYm3v5JLLe">news-zine</a>
focused on the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>. When
the PC first came out there was PC Mag and PC World and then PC Week.
Same for the Mac. And there was InfoWorld that covered everything. Now
we‚Äôre basically using smoke signals between users. A few really
interested users could bootstrap a blog to keep track of what‚Äôs going
on, and share what you learn publicly. That was the advice I gave
<a href="site:scripting.com arrington">Mike Arrington</a> and he started
TechCrunch and that acted as the glue that hooked together the early
blogosphere, feeds and ultimately twitter and its offspring. We need it
again. Users and developers party together has never been more needed as
now.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve taken to ignoring all the autogenerated ‚Äúmemories‚Äù that my phone
would like to show me from four years ago ‚Äî because while the system
simply matches the date, <em>I</em> know that four years ago was the

This is the second week of our holidays. We stayed in Z√ºrich and decided
to live as if we‚Äôre on a trip: hikes, runs, activities (today:
cycling!), restaurants, museums or concerts. I told myself that we can
spend the hotel budget on cultural events and train rides and suddenly
everything seems possible where until now I would have hesitated. Is it
really worth that much money? But since we‚Äôre not paying for the hotel ‚Ä¶
I convinced myself that it‚Äôs OK.

I saw the third flutist sitting around a lot and not playing the flute
and when the volume went up he covered his ears. Poor lad. Did he just
play five notes early in the performance and then he had to wait until
the end? How strange!

Israel executed the largest terrorist attack on this planet since 2001

Maybe a small blip compared to slaughtering 14,000 children, but I still

Last week I was made aware that Elecrow, an electronics manufacturer and

using an unauthorized clone of my voice</a> in some of their YouTube

<p>
I couldn‚Äôt prove it at the time, but there are AI identity detection
services like <a href="https://www.resemble.ai">Resemble.ai</a> that can
at least give some input into whether it was a direct clone or just
something that sounds ‚Äòmidwestern US male.‚Äô
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMofZIT9FcQ">made a

<em>not</em> okay for a corporation to clone someone‚Äôs voice and use it
in their videos without that person‚Äôs consent.

Specifically, the malware ‚Äúlocks‚Äù the user‚Äôs browser on Google‚Äôs login

<h2 id="a-hello-world-for-bluesky">A Hello World for Bluesky?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-24, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
First, a couple of examples/case studies.
</p>
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>About ten years ago I was trying to figure out how to get started
with Node.js. I knew a little JavaScript, but nothing I read about Node
made it click. It‚Äôs server software, so there must be a way to write an
HTTP server? From there, I read all the details about the power it has,
but what I needed was a Hello World script.
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22brent+simmons%22">Brent
Simmons</a> gave me the script, and step by step
<a href="https://inessential.com/2013/12/09/getting_started_with_web_services_using_.html">instructions</a>
on how to write it.
</p>
<p>
I followed his steps, and it worked, and of course I wrote a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/01/29/imBecomingANodejsDeveloper.html">blog
post</a> about it. That was the key I needed that unlocked what Node is,
and helped me see what I could do with it. The first thing I did was
factor out some of the bits so I could make it even simpler and then I
built. I just wanted a few lines of code that created a server and
responded to requests. All I needed was a Hello World to get me going.
</p>
<p>
Now Brent knew that I knew the basics of HTTP servers, we both worked
together on a huge app that had as a small part of it a full HTTP
server, thanks to
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22wes+felter%22">Wes
Felter</a> who wrote it, no one asked him to, one day he showed up with
a server that ran in
<a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>. I was ecstatic.
That‚Äôs the key. If you have something that isn‚Äôt truly new, that might
have some analogies in other worlds, if you want people in those other
worlds to know how to get started, give them the beginning. The first
step.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Another example. How I learned to create and edit a website. It was
1994. I loved the web the way I love ChatGPT today. I knew how to use
it, but I didn‚Äôt know how to make it. Everyone told me it was really
simple and they sent me links to all the docs, but they made no sense,
because they talked about things I didn‚Äôt understand. What I really
needed was a way to make a web page that was as simple as the one Brent
provided for Node-based HTTP servers, with tools and concepts I knew how
to use. I found one, a service provided by
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/04/07/howIDoNewThings.html">Ohio
State University</a>. You emailed a message to them and they put it ‚Äúon
the web‚Äù and sent you back a link to the page. Click the link and
there‚Äôs what you typed. I tried <i>Hello World</i> and got back a link
to a page that said Hello World. So I tried something more complicated,
I did a view source of Hotwired.com‚Äôs home page, and copy and pasted it
into an email. That worked too (with broken images because the urls were
relative).
</p>
<p>
Everything I‚Äôve ever learned how to do required me to first understand
it at this level.
</p>
<p>
Okay here we are in 2024, and I want to understand what Bluesky is. I
know how to use it, but I don‚Äôt know how to <i>make</i> it. But I would
be surprised if it is any more complicated that writing a web content
management system that uses feeds, something I‚Äôve done many times. I
know the components of a message, have iterated over it for the last
thirty years. I even wrote the spec that defines them in RSS 2.0. We‚Äôre
all doing the same thing over and over and Bluesky is no different. I
hear there‚Äôs some nice design for the protocol, but right now I don‚Äôt
care. I want my Hello World. The minimal code I need to add a node to
the network defined by Bluesky and I want to see what it can do with the
same kind of aha moment I had with the web. I want it to work when I try
it, and I want it to reveal what Bluesky is beyond what I can see from
using it. I want to begin to understand the opportunities for interop.
</p>
<p>
Why do I ask? For one, I‚Äôm a student of this stuff, and I want to
understand. But I also am very active in this area, and
<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop">interop
is my product</a> (really read that piece, I mean it, and I think it‚Äôs
Bluesky‚Äôs product too). I‚Äôm into
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html">working
together</a> ‚Äì it happens so infrequently. So here I‚Äôm also trying to
show not just you how to explain what you do for a curious but
time-limited developer, but I want to make this a this.how document that
explains how to do it for everyone, hoping that we as an art and
industry start explaining ourselves better to each other, because we
absolutely need to do this much better imho, ymmv, mmlm, etc.
</p>
<p>
To summarize ‚Äì assume I know how the web works. I‚Äôve worked with the
structures and protocols for systems that are very much like Bluesky.
Don‚Äôt try to explain the design of the protocol, just use it to solve a
problem that I will understand because I use the product and I have
developed lots of stuff like it. It should be possible to show us, to
teach us, what your product does.
</p>
<p>
PS: It could take a few days to put a Hello World together. Because once
you do the first iteration, you may think of a more direct way to
illustrate the idea, and you should do it, iterate until it works, until
you can‚Äôt make it any simpler.
</p>
<p>
PPS: And if you don‚Äôt want to do it, that‚Äôs okay too. I just thought it
was worth the effort to explain what‚Äôs needed to foster a greater
understanding of what you‚Äôre doing and what the opportunities for
interop are.

no doctor would treat you for a serious illness until you got a court
order saying it was due to rape, incest or the life of the mother.
Judges with the power of life and death. In some states with the death
penalty judges have the power to sentence people to death, but not for
having a well-accepted medical procedure. But that‚Äôs the situation women
with a troubled pregnancy are in, if they live in the wrong state. From
the patient‚Äôs point of view, I have a slight inkling about what this is
like because twice in my life I‚Äôve needed health care to save me from
imminent death. The health care system never hesitated to help. But what
if they had said ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt admit you until a judge rules that we can.‚Äù
In the new USA, abortion is like a pardon, something only the government
can grant. Forget about juries of our peers. It raises so many
questions. If a woman is about to miscarry are they even allowed to
admit her to the hospital, or does she have to wait until she is
actually dying? If you can check her in, what are the limits of the
treatment they can provide? Aspirin? Blood? Oxygen? Surgery? And btw,
medicine has advanced a <i>lot</i> since before Roe v Wade. Whatever
practices they had for avoiding abortion can‚Äôt apply now. This is the
kind of thing no society should change the way we changed it as an edict
handed down by judges who are subject to corruption. We are learning
about a serious flaw in our system of government.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-24, updated: 2024-09-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Israel‚Äôs brazen attacks on Hezbollah last week, in which hundreds of
pagers and two-way radios exploded and killed at least 37 people,
graphically illustrated a threat that cybersecurity experts have been
warning about for years: Our international supply chains for
computerized equipment leave us vulnerable. And we have no good means to
defend ourselves.
</p>
<p>
Though the deadly operations were stunning, none of the elements used to
carry them out were particularly new. The tactics employed by Israel,
which has neither confirmed nor denied any role, to hijack an
international supply chain and embed plastic explosives in Hezbollah
devices have been used for years. What‚Äôs new is that Israel put them
together in such a devastating and extravagantly public fashion,
bringing into stark relief what the future of great power competition
will look like‚Äîin peacetime, wartime and the ever expanding ‚Ä¶

Dewayne Hendricks, my friend of nearly four decades, passed away last
Friday at age 74. His
<a href="https://ee380.stanford.edu/Abstracts/140305-slides.pdf">mentors</a>
were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster
Fuller</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran">Paul
Baran</a>. He was a pioneer of wireless Internet connectivity, a serial
entrepreneur, curator of an influential e-mail list, and for the last 30
years on the organizing committee of the
<a href="https://amw.org">Asilomar Microcomputer Workshop</a>.<br />
<br /> For someone of his remarkable achievements he has left very
little impression on the Web. An example is his
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dewayne-hendricks-b118">Linkedin
profile</a>. Below the fold I collect the pieces of his story that I
know or have been able to find from his other friends. If I can find
more I will update this post. Please feel free to add information in the
comments.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>
<h3>
Wayne State University
</h3>
Dewayne was a student at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_State_University">Wayne
State</a>, where he got into systems programming for the IBM 370. They
ran the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Terminal_System">Michigan
Terminal System</a> on a 512K 370/155. He tried to run the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Newcastle_upon_Tyne">University
of Newcastle</a>‚Äôs CMTS, an experimental version of MTS that didn‚Äôt use
dynamic address translation, and ran into performance problems. He
worked with Larry Chace at the University of Illinois to get it running
on their 1+2M 360/75. After Chace rewrote it to swap pages to their 2301
drum storage it ran well.<br />
<h3>
Southern Illinois University
</h3>
While at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Illinois_University">Southern
Illinois Univerity</a> in the ‚Äô70s he worked for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster
Fuller</a> and continued his involvement in IBM systems programming, now
for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VM_(operating_system)">VM/370</a>.
Melinda Varian, historian of that era of IBM‚Äôs groundbreaking
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing)">SHARE</a> user
group, wrote in
<a href="https://www.leeandmelindavarian.com/Melinda/25paper.pdf"><i>VM
and the VM Community: Past, Present, and Future</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Dewayne Hendricks reported at SHARE XLII, in March, 1974, that he had
successfully implemented MVT-CP handshaking for page faulting, so that
when MVT running under VM took a page fault, CP would allow MVT to
dispatch another task while CP brought in the page. At the following
SHARE, Dewayne did a presentation on further modifications, including
support for SIOF and a memory-mapped job queue. With these changes, his
system would allow multi-tasking guests actually to multi-task when
running in a virtual machine. Significantly, his modifications were
available on the Waterloo Tape.<br /> <br /> Dewayne became the chairman
of the Operating Systems Committee of the SHARE VM Project. Under his
guidance, the Committee prepared several detailed requirements for
improvements to allow guest systems to perform better. At SHARE XLV, in
1975, the Committee presented IBM with a White Paper entitled Operating
Systems Under VM/370, which discussed the performance problems of guests
under VM and the solutions that customers had found for these problems.
Many of the solutions that Dewayne and others had found, such as PAGEX,
made their way into VM fairly quickly, apparently as the result of
customers‚Äô persistence in documenting them. By SHARE 49, Dewayne was
able to state that, ‚ÄúIt is now generally understood that either MFT or
MVT can run under VM/370 with relative batch throughput greater than 1.‚Äù
That is to say, they had both been made to run significantly faster
under VM than on the bare hardware. Dewayne and others did similar work
to improve the performance of DOS under VM.

<h3>
Amateur Radio
</h3>
Dewayne was a major figure in developing and sustaining the use of
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">amateur packet
radio</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He has been involved with radio since receiving his amateur radio
operator‚Äôs license as a teen. He currently holds official positions in
several national non-profit amateur radio organizations and is a
director of the Wireless Communications Alliance, an industry group
representing manufacturers in the unlicensed radio industry.
</blockquote>
In
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">particular</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Back in 1986, he ported the popular KA9Q Internet Protocol package to
the Macintosh, allowing the Macintosh platform to be used in packet
radio networks. Today, thousands of amateur radio operators worldwide
use the NET/Mac system he developed to participate in the global packet
radio Internet. This system continues to be developed and deployed by
the amateur radio service.
</blockquote>
Dewayne was a member of the
<a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/who-we-are/">Amateur Radio Digital
Communications Grants Evaluation Team</a> from 2021 to his death. ARDC
grants around <a href="https://www.ardc.net/about/">$5M/year</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
ARDC makes grants to projects and organizations that are experimenting
with new ways to advance both amateur radio and digital communication
science. Experimentation by amateur radio operators has benefited
society in many ways, including the development of the mobile phone and
wireless internet technology. ARDC envisions a world where all such
technology is available through open source hardware and software, and
where anyone has the ability to innovate upon it. To see examples of the
types of grants we make, go to

<h3>
Tetherless Access
</h3>
One of the many ahead-of-their-time companies Dewayne started was
Tetherless Access. He co-founded it with Charlie Brown in 1990 to
develop wireless Metropolitan Access Networks. It went public in 1996 on
NASDAQ and folded two years later. The idea was to use the 900MHz
unlicensed spectrum to distribute Internet connectivity from a base
station via point-to-point links, in contrast to Metricom‚Äôs
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_(Internet_service)">Ricochet</a>
service, started by Dewayne‚Äôs mentor Paul Baran, which four years later
used mesh network technology in the same spectrum.<br /> <br />

<h3>
NSF Projects
</h3>
Dewayne was involved in a number of NSF funded experiments in using
wireless to
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">connect remote
communities</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prior to forming Dandin Group, he was the General Manager of the
Wireless Business Unit for Com21, Inc.¬†He joined Com21 following an
opportunity to participate as the Co-Principal Investigator in the
National Science Foundation‚Äôs Wireless Field Tests for Education
project. The project sucessfully connected remote educational
institutions to the Internet. The test sites ranged from rural primary
schools in Colorado, USA to a University in Ulaan Bataar, Mongolia.

Developing Countries
</h3>
Dewayne was not just active in getting Internet service to under-served
communities with the NSF. The
<a href="http://www.warpspeed.com/Public/DLH_Bio.html">bio on his
website</a> states:<br />
<blockquote>
Tetherless Access was one of the first companies to develop and deploy
Part 15 unlicensed wireless metropolitan area data networks using the
TCP/IP protocols. He has participated in the installation of these
networks in other parts of the world including: Kenya, Tonga, Mexico,
Canada and Mongolia.

Amara Angelica reported that
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000307045638/http://www.techweek.com/articles/8-23-99/wireless.htm"><i>Tonga
first to go wireless for telecommunications</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre replacing the entire existing telecom infrastructure with a
wireless IP [Internet protocol] network,‚Äù says Dewayne Hendricks, CEO of
Fremont-based Dandin Group and former general manager of Com21‚Äôs
wireless business unit. ‚ÄúSince the country is a monarchy, there was only
one guy to convince, Crown Prince Tupouto‚Äôa, and then we just went for
it.‚Äù<br /> <br /> Hendricks‚Äô firm plans to replace Tonga Telecom‚Äôs aging
landline system‚Äîwhich still uses mechanical relays‚Äîwith a broadband
wireless network for data, video and telephony (using voice over IP). It
will run at 30Mbps with user access at 2Mbps and 10Mbps by the end of
next year. ‚ÄúWe can get all the spectrum we want,‚Äù Hendricks says.<br />
<br /> The prince‚Äôs objective, Hendricks says, is to convert the
country‚Äôs largely agricultural workforce, which has an astonishing 95
percent literacy rate, into knowledge workers, such as programmers. The
government launched the Royal School of Science for Distance Learning
last year, using Internet connections to allow students to take courses
at international universities. There are just fewer than 100,000 people
in Tonga scattered across 170 islands.<br /> <br /> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to an
Internet-style mesh network,‚Äù says Hendricks. MMDS, which some carriers
are using to deliver broadband services, won‚Äôt scale well for an IP
network, he says. Hendricks, a technical advisor to the FCC on
ultrawideband (UWB) technology, is considering UWB for the network.
</blockquote>
<a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">Tonga had</a> about 11,000
households and 6,500 phone customers, with an 8-year wait to get a
phone. The goals of the project were to deliver 30Mbit/s IP to each home
for a customer end budget of $450.<br /> <br />

Wired Article
</h3>
In the January 2002 edition of <i>Wired</i>, Brent Hurtig‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/"><i>Digital
Cowboy</i></a> focused on Dewayne‚Äôs work on the reservation:<br />
<blockquote>
At Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation in North Dakota, he‚Äôs installing
a wireless network. In its initial form, the system will meet FCC
requirements governing frequency, power, and transmission technology.
But not for long. Hendricks‚Äô mission is to build the best system
possible - even if it‚Äôs illegal - and he intends to use every tool at
his disposal. Should the FCC crack down, the tribal leaders will hoist
the flag of Native American sovereignty, asserting that they can do
whatever they want with the sky above their reservation.
</blockquote>
Dewayne‚Äôs work on the reservation, in Tonga and elsewhere was an attempt
to demonstrate the problems with the obsolete US
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/01/hendricks/">spectrum allocation
policy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There‚Äôs no sensible reason why Americans shouldn‚Äôt have inexpensive,
ubiquitous, high-performance broadband access, Hendricks says. Using
technologies that are already available or in fast-track development,
everyone could enjoy reliable, fully symmetrical wireless at T1 speed or
better. No more digital divide. No more last-mile problem. No more
compromises. The only things standing in the way are the FCC, Congress,
and ‚Äúother people who just don‚Äôt get it.‚Äù
</blockquote>
<h3>
EE380 Talks
</h3>
Dewayne gave three talks to Stanford‚Äôs EE380 symposium. The first one
was apparently ‚Äúin the ‚Äô90s on wireless MANs‚Äù of which I have so far
found no record.<br /> <br /> The second was on 3<sup>rd</sup> May 2000
entitled
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/000503.html"><i>Wiring
Tonga: From the Ground Up and the Sky Down</i></a>. The abstract
was:<br />
<blockquote>
One of the biggest barriers today standing in the way of deployment of
advanced wireless communications systems turns out not to be the
technology, but restrictions related to regulatory policies. This
presentation will discuss the nature of these barriers and how they have
affected the development of wireless data systems over the years.<br />
<br /> The speaker will also discuss on-going work in which he is
involved to use advanced wireless technology to deploy multiservice IP
systems as part of infrastructure-development projects in the Kingdom of
Tonga and with Native American groups in the US, and how such projects
are able to deal with the limitations imposed by conventional regulatory
barriers.
</blockquote>
The slides are <a href="http://dandin.com/pdf/EE380.pdf">here</a>.<br />
<br /> The third was on 5<sup>th</sup> March 2014 and entitled
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/140305.html"><i>Inventing
a New Internet: Learning from Icarus</i></a>. The abstract read:<br />
<blockquote>
From a future historical perspective, are we descendants of Icarus? Is
our Internet like Icarus‚Äô wings? Are our protocols, ciphers and codes,
brilliant capabilities built on immature engineering, which like Icarus‚Äô
wax and feathers, are capable of taking us to great heights, but
systematically flawed? For a brief historical moment, humanity has flown
high like Icarus, on a vulnerable first generation Internet platform.
Which as been used for securing and using distributed ideas, arts, media
science, commerce, and machines. Promising brilliant futures with the
arrival of networked things, autonomous personalized services and
immersive media. But, now our first generation Internet , built on a
fragile global network of vulnerable codes and protocols, is falling
apart, like Icarus‚Äô wings, through a triple shock from:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Massive dotcom data stalker economy built on mining of terabytes
personal data.
</li>
<li>
Ubiquitous criminal penetration of financial and identity networks, on
our devices, in the cloud.
</li>
<li>
Pervasive state intruders at all levels and every encrypted hardware and
software node.
</li>
</ul>
Humans eventually conquered the barriers to flight and learned to build
durable and resilient aircraft. Similarly, humans must learn to build a
more reliable, private and secure Internet for communications,
innovation and commerce. We will share our thoughts on how we might go
about the design of a more durable and resilient Internet:<br />
<ul>
<li>
How prepared is the Internet for future human benefit?
</li>
<li>
What are the attributes of a future more durable internet?
</li>
<li>
What are the existing assets that could be harnessed?
</li>
<li>
What needs to be developed?

dewayne-net

For many years Dewayne with impeccable taste curated dewayne-net, an
e-mail list to which he sent links, most he found but some contributed
by his friends. A typical e-mail would have the title of the linked
post, a link, and enough of the content to encourage recipients to read
the whole thing. The last e-mails were two on 19<sup>th</sup> August, as
it happens both links that I had sent him earlier. I have been one of
the more frequent contributors, although only perhaps 20% of my
contributions passed the curatorial filter. Prof.¬†Dave Farber‚Äôs
<a href="https://ip.topicbox.com/groups/ip">IP list</a> is a similar and
I believe even longer-standing list; he and Dewayne exchanged links
fairly often.<br /> <br /> As an example of the list in full flow, lets
take April 2022. That month he sent 66 e-mails, many about the COVID
pandemic and the war in Ukraine, obviously both top of mind at the time.
But they included topics including satellite tracking of commercial
aircraft, the Kessler syndrome, the problems of the US patent system,
cybercrime, microplastics, banned math textbooks in Florida, and Elon
Musk‚Äôs purchase of Twitter. I am already greatly missing this window
into Dewayne‚Äôs eclectic set of interests.<br /> <br />

is what it

for the new
<a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_9_pro">Pixel 9
Pro</a>. It shipped 17 days go. It was hell to just tell Google that the
case was lost. I expected at that point they‚Äôd apologize and refund the
money. That was a week ago. Just got an email saying want me to return
the case when it arrives. It‚Äôs never going to arrive. Luckily this is a
cheap product, just $38. If it had happened with the $1300 phone, that
would be a pretty big problem. It‚Äôs amazing that a company the size and
age of Google doesn‚Äôt have a procedure for dealing with products that
are lost (or more likely stolen) in transit. I‚Äôve been through this with
Amazon, they knew what to do, because UPS does lose packages, esp ones
that look like they have phones in them. Anyway I have a fairly large
credit with Google. I don‚Äôt dare use it to purchase anything else, given
how incompetent they are at dealing with fairly common customer
problems.</p>

in San Diego, I attended Scripps and lectured on cot death for three
months as a guest. Scripps at the time was involved with IBM in
developing a line-of-sight optical network, which worked brilliantly on
campus. It was confined to a couple of experimental computer labs, but
you had to keep your fingers off the mouse or keyboard, or your machine
would overload with web pages if browsing. I believe it never made it
into the world of computers for ordinary users, as the machines of the
day could not keep up.</span>

until I learned of <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/">Ubuntu MATE</a>.
The University had a pre-release copy of Ubuntu MATE 14.10, along with a
podcast from Alan Pope and Martin Wimpress, and before I could turn
around I had it on my Asus. It was simple, everything worked, and it
removed the horrors of GNOME 3.</span>

in 2015, my wife became very unwell after a shopping trip. Getting in
touch with some medical friends, they were concerned she‚Äôd had a heart
attack. This was near the mark: she had contracted a virus which had
destroyed a third of her heart muscle. It took her a few years to die,
and a miserable time it was for her and for us both. After the funeral,
I had rented out my house and bought a Toyota motorhome, and I began
traveling around the country. I ran my Asus through a solar panel hooked
up to an inverter, a system which worked well and kept the beast
going.</span>

next Metabox was described as a Windows 10 machine, but I knew that it
would run Tux beautifully ‚Äì and so it did. A few tweaks around the ACPI
subsystem and it computed away merrily, with not a BSOD in sight. A
friend of mine who had popped in for a visit was so impressed with it
that he ordered one too, and that arrived about three months later. A
quick wipe of the hard drive (thank you, Gparted!), both these machines
are still running happily, with not a cloud on the horizon.</span>

new Metabox arrived about six weeks ago, and I decided ‚Äì just out of
curiosity ‚Äì to leave Windows 11 on it. A most stupid decision, but as my
wife was running Windows 11 and had already blown it up once, needing a
full reset (which, to my surprise, worked), I proceeded to charge it for
the recommended 24 hours, and next day, switched it on. ‚ÄúHello‚Äù it said,
in big white letters, and then the nonsense began‚Ä¶ a torrent of unwanted

the ‚ÄúBike Angels‚Äù System for Moving Bikeshares</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-23, updated: 2024-09-23, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
I always like a good hack. And
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/nyregion/citi-bike-scam-nyc.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">this
story</a> delivers. Basically, the New York City bikeshare program has a
system to reward people who move bicycles from full stations to empty
ones. By deliberately moving bikes to create artificial problems, and
exploiting exactly how the system calculates rewards, some people are
making a lot of money.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
At 10 a.m. on a Tuesday last month, seven Bike Angels descended on the
docking station at Broadway and 53rd Street, across from the Ed Sullivan
Theater. Each rider used his own special blue key -¬≠- a reward from Citi
Bike‚Äî¬≠ to unlock a bike. He rode it one block east, to Seventh Avenue. He
docked, ran back to Broadway, unlocked another bike and made the trip
again‚Ä¶

<p>
BTW, to be clear, I have no interest in working on twitter-like systems.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs been like a prison to writers, we‚Äôre stuck with this huge divide,
with crap on both sides.
</p>
<p>
These things exist, they have a jumble of APIs and ways to integrate.
</p>
<p>
And we‚Äôve been playing by the rules laid down by Twitter (ev, biz and
jack) for 18 freaking years. That‚Äôs enough.
</p>
<p>
This will never get sorted out until people realize it needs sorting
out.
</p>
<p>
Not expecting much more to happen there.

<p>Instead of just fact-checking the candidates, and presenting ‚Äúboth
sides,‚Äù how about recording the number of times the candidate threatens
specific races, genders, lifestyles, origins, religions and of course
individual people. Keep a page where you tally the groups he
<i>doesn‚Äôt</i> threaten with expulsion or worse. That would be very
revealing, and in line with the true issue of this election. Time for
you all to get in sync with the actual American history that‚Äôs being
made.</p>

<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/66f038e3-7218-8012-a294-05bb7afa9b97">this
question</a> using Google and StackExchange. There was a bug in this one
line of code, a call to <i>new Date ()</i> in JavaScript, that was
behaving as if months were not 0-based, which they are known to be. The
problem: I was specifying the day as 0 and month, correctly, but the day
had to be 1 in order for it to work and without thinking I had specified
it as 0.</p>

lower interest rates two and a half years after it began to raise them
to get inflation under control, President Joe Biden spoke to the

leaders from around the world can speak to larger questions about the
