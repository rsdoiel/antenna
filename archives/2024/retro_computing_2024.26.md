## More FreeDOS in the news

date: 2024-06-24, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>As we get closer to the 30th anniversary on June 29, we're starting to see news items and articles about FreeDOS. Here's a quick roundup from the last week: {1} SourceForge posted an <a class="" href="https://sourceforge.net/articles/freedos-30th-anniversary-interview-with-jim-hall-from-the-freedos-project/">interview with Jim</a> about FreeDOS at 30 years. It's a long read but full of great notes and history. {2} Slashdot ran a story about <a class="" href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/06/21/1516255/30-years-of-freedos" rel="nofollow">30 years of FreeeDOS</a> with a link to a February article about <a class="" href="https://www.both.org/?p=3991" rel="nofollow">looking ahead</a> to 30 years of FreeDOS. {3} Hackaday also wrote about <a class="" href="https://hackaday.com/2024/06/23/nearly-30-years-of-freedos-and-looking-ahead-to-the-future/" rel="nofollow">nearly 30 years of FreeDOS</a> and looking ahead to the future. If you know of other places that have written about FreeDOS, let us know.</p>
<p>Also check out Lukas's presentation at DevConf.CZ 2024 about <a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVnxv11RsHE" rel="nofollow">FreeDOS and QEMU</a> on YouTube - we linked to DevConf last week, but this is a direct link to Lukas's presentation on YouTube.</p></div>
