Mesoscale Discussion 0063
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CST Sun Jan 14 2024

Areas affected...Southeast New York into the New England region

Concerning...Snow Squall 

Valid 141649Z - 142045Z

SUMMARY...Thermodynamic conditions will remain favorable for snow
squalls as a cold front pushes east into the New England region.

DISCUSSION...Recent regional radar depicts broken bands of shallow
convection along an eastward moving cold front from upstate NY into
eastern PA. Visibility reductions between 1/4 to 1 mile have been
observed with the passage of these bands and are primarily being
driven by bursts of moderate to heavy snow with 25-35 mph wind
gusts. The 12 UTC PIT sounding likely sampled the convective
environment most accurately with nearly dry adiabatic lapse rates
from the surface to ~750 mb, which appears to be represented well by
recent 0-3 km lapse rate analyses. The plume of 8+ C/km low-level
lapse rates is forecast to spread to the northeast into the New
England region through the day in tandem with the cooler mid-level
temperatures associated with the primary trough axis. Low-level
instability should be bolstered by modest diurnal heating between
cloud breaks through the afternoon, and a weak influx of moisture
may support occasional lightning flashes, though sustained,
lightning-producing convection is not necessarily anticipated.
Nonetheless, the combination of improving low-level thermodynamics,
focused ascent along the front, and 30-40 mph winds within the
boundary layer should maintain the snow squall potential well into
the afternoon.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1120 AM CST Sun Jan 14 2024

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Monday.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
An arctic airmass and large upper cyclone will continue to dominate
much of the CONUS on Monday. Little thunderstorm potential is
evident, with one exception across FL. Generally 60s surface
dewpoints will be present along/south of a front over parts of the
FL Peninsula. Poor lapse rates aloft and warm mid-level temperatures
should hinder the development of any more than weak instability for
much of the day. But, enough MUCAPE should eventually be present to
support isolated thunderstorm potential mainly Monday evening into
early Tuesday morning as a weak southern-stream shortwave trough
moves across this region. Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1045 AM CST Sun Jan 14 2024

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, with no changes
or additions made.

..Squitieri.. 01/14/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1109 PM CST Sat Jan 13 2024/

...Synopsis...
Immediately ahead of a stalled cold front across the southern High
Plains, enhanced downslope flow and a modest surface pressure
gradient will contribute to locally dry/breezy conditions over far
southeast NM into the TX Trans-Pecos. While 15-20 mph sustained
westerly surface winds and around 15 percent RH could favor locally
elevated fire-weather conditions, the overlap of dry/breezy
conditions appears too localized/marginal for Elevated highlights at
this time.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1005 AM CST Sun Jan 14 2024

Valid 141630Z - 151200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible over parts of south Florida, as
well as from southeastern New York across parts of New England.

...Synopsis...
Mid-morning water-vapor imagery and upper-air analyses continue to
show the east/northeastward progression of a strong upper wave over
the upper OH River Valley/New England with an attendant - but slowly
occluding - surface cyclone over eastern Canada. A trailing cold
front is noted in surface observations from upstate NY to the
southwest along the southern Appalachians into the lower MS Valley
and TX Gulf Coast region. This boundary will continue migrating
east/southeast through the day as an arctic air mass overspreads
much of the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS. The frigid air will
negate convective potential for most regions today with the
exception of south Florida and parts of New England. 

...South Florida...
A residual frontal boundary from a previous cool air intrusion into
the Gulf is noted in visible imagery across south FL with occasional
convection/lightning flashes noted over the past few hours. Regional
12 UTC soundings sampled poor mid-level lapse rates, but sufficient
elevated buoyancy is in place above the shallow frontal layer to
continue to support isolated thunderstorms through today/tonight as
lift ahead of an approaching mid-level disturbance overspreads the
region.

...New England...
Shallow convection is noted along/behind the cold front across
portions of PA and NY this morning. While this activity is currently
too cool and shallow to support lightning production, a combination
of diurnal warming, a weak influx of moisture from the Mid-Atlantic
coast, and cool mid-level temperatures may provide adequate buoyancy
for a few lightning flashes later this afternoon across southeast NY
into the New England region.
