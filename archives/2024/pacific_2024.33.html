<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Remember when a little puddle of green water was spotted in Halema&amp;#8216;uma&amp;#8216;u? Time flies, because that was late July 2019 &amp;#8212; over five years ago! And because we&amp;#8217;ve had multiple eruptions and intrusions since then, the water lake sometimes feels forgotten in the larger history of Kilauea.&lt;/p&gt;
