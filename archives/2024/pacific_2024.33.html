Report</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh offered former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick a coaching job within the team in January, he told USA Today&amp;#8217;s Jarrett Bell last week. Harbaugh said he spoke to Kaepernick after getting hired as the Chargers head coach about the possibility of Kaepernick joining the team in a coaching capacity, USA Today reported Wednesday. Harbaugh also said nothing has changed since that conversation and Kaepernick hasn&amp;#8217;t reconnected with Harbaugh about the coaching opportunity, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

complaints</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-14, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;DETROIT &amp;#8212; The United Auto Workers Union said on Tuesday it has filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board against Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk over attempts to threaten and intimidate workers. It is unclear whether the NLRB would take action against Trump for his comments on Monday during a two-hour conversation with Musk that was broadcast on social media platform X. The UAW seized upon Trump&amp;#8217;s remarks as the union rallies behind Democratic presidential candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris and encourages its nearly 400,000 workers to vote for her over Trump. The issue is especially pertinent in battleground states like Michigan which could determine who wins the White House in November. The UAW endorsed Harris at the end of July. &lt;/p&gt;
