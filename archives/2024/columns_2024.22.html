<p>
In the past, I’ve booted <a href="https://libreelec.tv">LibreELEC</a> on
the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 in my
“<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/tv-thats-not-necs-pi-powered-55-display">This
is not a TV</a>” Sharp NEC display.
</p>
<p>
According to
<a href="https://libreelec.tv/2023/09/28/rpi5-support/">LibreELEC’s Pi 5
blog post</a>, the new BCM2712 SoC decodes 4K and 1080p content just
fine in H.264, and supports HEVC 4K60 hardware decoding.
</p>
<p>
And they’ve tested AV1, VC1, and VP9 at 1080p with no issue, though 4K
in non-native formats does encounter frame dropping.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to put the Pi through some testing of my own, now that the Pi
5’s been out for months, and LibreELEC version 12 is stable.

<p>Perhaps I should add a new element to the
<a href="http://source.scripting.com/">source namespace</a>, the name of
the author of a blog, if the feed is for a blog. Here’s why I need it. I
am building my blogroll. Every time I find an insightful story about
using tech I use, these days esp AI, I add it to my blogroll so I get to
see any new articles they write when they post. But if their blog has a
catchy name, I’ll never pick it out of the list as I scan for something
new to read. I need the name of the author too. Basically a blogger
should provide their name, but of course it’s completely optional. I’ll
subscribe anyway, if the article is on-topic. I’m soaking this stuff up
now, building my own personal firehose.</p>

<h2 id="tech-is-about-people">Tech is about people</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-31, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Once again we’re at the beginning of a huge tech-induced transformation,
and yet again the people who already occupy a high rung of the ladder of
success, or imagine they do, are pissing all over it, without using it.
</p>
<p>
I remember <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kvell">kvelling</a>
about Napster, about how the ability to program my own music had made it
possible for me to explore my own life in new ways, because music is
inexorably bound to memory. For me the big revelation came on
<a href="http://scripting.com/2000/06/18.html">Father’s Day in 2000</a>
when I heard
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zaCV4niKk">Father and Son</a>
by Cat Stevens on the radio and desperately wanted to hear it again.
</p>
<p>
I had tried Napster a few months earlier and found that it had none of
my music. It was basically just a technology demo. I tried it again, and
this time not only did it have the Cat Stevens song, but it had every
song from my childhood that I hadn’t heard since being a kid listening
to WABC on the transistor radio my grandfather gave me for my birthday
when I was five or six years old.
</p>
<p>
I told this story at a Future of Music conference and was torn apart by
the other people on stage, supposedly creative people, who cared not one
bit about how people used the product they created, and the power of
being able to program our own music. They were the bosses of music and
my job was merely to give them money and admiration and stfu. They tried
to get me off the stage (I was the moderator) but I stood my ground and
of course never forgot.
</p>
<p>
It happened again a few years later at the DNC in Boston, when the
journalists mocked the bloggers because we had no experience as
journalists, and they didn’t like the way we dressed (they wrote
articles about it, in the NYT even). 20+ years later they’re still
complaining, but they forget to blame us for their misery, now. Their
misery is they forget the glory of their job, which is empowering us –
their users – to change the world that so desperately needs changing.
</p>
<p>
It’s happening again with AI, which is opening up creative expression to
people who can’t draw, or aren’t good writers, or people who want to be
better programmers, or who knows – this technology is the most powerful
I’ve used in my long life in tech.
</p>
<p>
The difference is – you have to use something before your criticism
makes any sense. That was the mistake the music industry made with
Napster. What the journalists made regarding bloggers (we’re they’re
sources, tried to say over and over but they don’t listen they just like
to talk and be admired and our job as usual is to give them money and
stfu).
</p>
<p>
My very good friend Doc Searls sees it the same way. He calls it
<a href="https://doc.searls.com/2024/05/28/the-peoples-ai/">People’s
AI</a>. We’re going to build this out the way we did it with blogging
and podcasting a few years ago. It may be our last rodeo, we’re getting
on in years, but I’m so glad I lived to see this.
</p>
<p>
(Sidebar: The people who run tech companies today have no idea how to
build new technology markets, the categories they occupy were built by
others, now gone. I finally figured that’s our disconnect and why
products lose important features when they are taken over by the
inheritors, and why the leaders of Google et al have no idea where to
put AI for users to build with it, or even that the users build the
stuff they use in tech. Say what you want about Jack, Ev and Biz, but
they understood this idea and they did let the users lead.)
</p>
<p>
And btw, don’t miss that it was twelve of us, twelve people, that
finally said what the ladder-occupiers have failed to say for far too
long about Trump – he’s a felon. We’ve known that, but when did Obama,
Biden, Moscow Mitch or anyone else with a name or reputation to protect
say the most obvious truth. They’re all powerless and weak, and if we
want to get out of this mess we’re going to have to lead ourselves.
Waiting for them, that didn’t work.
</p>
<p>
PS: Thanks to Twitter for increasing the character limit, so I can
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1796516437281935415">write my
blog posts</a> on my iPad before starting my day. Like this. ;-)
</p>
<p>
PPS: BTW – here’s
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zaCV4niKk">the song</a>.
Somehow the music industry survived my ability to share this song with
you and my future self.
</p>
<p>
PPPS: I write these pieces with specific people in mind but I rarely say
who they are because it embarrasses them. But I write <i>all</i> my
pieces the my regular readers, who keep me going, almost 30 years (on
Oct 10 this year). I hope they build great things with these ideas, and
they let me help them do it.
</p>
<p>
PPPPS: Doc tends to write brilliant pieces that perfectly describe these
points in time. Let’s travel back to 1997, as Steve Jobs is returning to
Apple, when
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html">Doc
explained</a> that while he loves me, Steve loves no one but Steve.
<span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
PPPPPS: The motto for the podcasting community as it was booting up in
2004 was “users and developers party together.” That was the thing that
Adam and I agreed on. Adam being the user, and I being the developer. Of
course it was his trying to be a developer, and me trying to be a user
that was the spark that created the boom. We both made it safe for
amateurs to do what we do. That’s why podcasting, unlike the music
industry, never went to war with its users. <span

<h2 id="how-ai-will-change-democracy">How AI Will Change Democracy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-31, updated: 2024-05-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to predict that artificial
intelligence will affect every aspect of our society. Not by doing new
things. But mostly by doing things that are already being done by
humans, perfectly competently.
</p>
<p>
Replacing humans with AIs isn’t necessarily interesting. But when an AI
takes over a human task, the task changes.
</p>
<p>
In particular, there are potential changes over four dimensions: Speed,
scale, scope and sophistication. The problem with AIs trading stocks
isn’t that they’re better than humans—it’s that they’re faster. But
computers are better at chess and Go because they use more sophisticated
strategies than humans. We’re worried about AI-controlled social media
accounts because they operate on a superhuman scale…

<p>
On the Pi 4, popular image processing models for object detection, pose
detection, etc. would top out at 2-5 fps using the built-in CPU.
Accessories like the <a href="https://coral.ai">Google Coral TPU</a>
speed things up considerably (and are eminently useful in builds like my
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/building-pi-frigate-nvr-axzezs-interceptor-1u-case">Frigate
NVR</a>), but a Coral adds on $60 to the cost of your Pi project.

<p>
With the Pi 5, if I can double or triple inference speed—even at the
expense of maxing out CPU usage—it could be worth it <em>for some
things</em>.

<p>date: 2024-05-30, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
The fundamental idea behind Bitcoin is that, if you restrict the supply
of something, its price will rise. That is why the system arranges that
there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin by halving the reward paid
for mining the next block every 210,000 blocks (about every four years),
an event called the “halvening” (or more recently just the halving). It
is an article of faith among the crypto-bros that, after the halvening,
the price will rise. For
<a href="https://bitbo.io/halving/">example</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the image below, the vertical blue lines indicate the previous three
halvings (2012-11-28, 2016-7-9, and 2020-5-11). Note how the price has
jumped significantly after each halving.<br />

The most recent halvening happened on Friday, April 19<sup>th</sup>. It
was eagerly awaited so, six weeks later, it is time to go below the fold
and look at the effects.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>
<h3>
Before
</h3>
Lets start back in October when the Bitcoin “price” was in the high
$20Ks. This was a problem, because only the most efficient miners could
make a profit at that “price”. They could look out six months to see the
looming halvening, which would mean that even the most efficient, with
their income halved, would be losing a lot of money. Something needed to
be done. By April the price needed to be at least in the mid $50Ks, or
the Bitcoin mining industry would suffer a bloodbath.<br /> <br />

Coincidentally, October was when Tether started printing USDT at a rate
only before seen during the heady days of 2021. At the start of October
there were 83B USDT, by the halvening there were 110B, 32.5% more.<br />
<br /> The extra supply of 27B USDT, whose primary function is to buy
cryptocurrency, certainly created demand for Bitcoin, whose supply over
the same period increased by only 0.95%. This excess of demand over
supply, as the crypto-bros would have predicted increased the price. But
by 149%, which might have been more than they predicted. Note that it
peaked at $73,094 on March 13<sup>th</sup>, 35 days before the
halvening, and has trended lower since.<br /> <br />

This huge pump in the BTC “price” meant that the most efficient miners’s
margins went from scant to extortionate, and sucked in a whole lot of
mining rigs that had been turned off as being uneconomic. In the graph
of the 30-day moving average hash rate, the rate of increase is lower
until around the start of the pump in October, then it increases as the
pump takes hold. The earlier rate may represent the rate at which
Bitmain can ship the latest rigs, the additional later rate probably
represents re-activated older rigs.<br /> <br /> David Pan’s

including running their operations at full capacity or expanding them to
produce and sell more coins amid soaring Bitcoin prices in the latest

Miners Run Down Bitcoin Inventory to 3-Year Low in a Strategic
Pre-Halving Move</i></a> had more detail on how they were “boosting
their cash reserves”:<br />
<blockquote>
The number of bitcoin held by miners … declined to 1.794 million BTC
this week, the lowest since early 2021, according to data source
CoinMetrics.<br /> <br /> The so-called miner balance has fallen by
27,000 since November, implying steady selling in the months leading up
to the quadrennial mining reward halving.<br /> …<br /> The rally has
allowed miners to take profits at higher prices and fund equipment
upgrades to prepare for the reduced rewards rate, according to
algorithmic trading firm Wintermute.<br /> <br /> “With miners’ holdings
still near an all-time high in USD terms ($124 billion), this sell-off
appears to be a strategic move for profit-taking and operational
upgrades, marking a behavioral change from the last cycle,” Wintermute
said in a weekly newsletter.
</blockquote>
Some miners, having ridden the hype around the halvening and cashed in
their winnings, have pivoted to the probably more durable AI hype, as
David Pan reported in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/bitcoin-miner-core-converts-data-center-infrastructure-for-ai"><i>Bitcoin

<blockquote>
The Austin, Texas-based company deployed 16-megawatt data-center
capacity for AI startup CoreWeave Inc. and plans to convert more going
forward. The move comes amid a slump in Bitcoin mining revenue and
growing demand for data centers to host graphics processing units to
power AI applications.

price trended down. And, as Olga Kharif reported three weeks later,

As might have been expected, halving the miners’ income even from its
pumped-up level has started to force the less efficient players out. The
hash rate graph is extremely noisy, with routine daily swings of more
than 20%, but the graph of the 30-day moving average hash rate shows
that it peaked about a week after the halvening, and a week later
started a downward trend.<br /> <br /> It isn’t just that the miners’
income has been halved. It is also that their costs are rising, as David
Pan’s
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-14/bitcoin-halving-will-deal-a-10-billion-blow-to-crypto-miners"><i>Bitcoin
‘Halving’ Will Deal a $10 Billion Blow to Crypto Miners</i></a>
explains:<br />
<blockquote>
“Power in the US is extraordinarily constrained,” said Adam Sullivan,
chief executive officer at Austin, Texas-based Core Scientific Inc., one
of the largest public Bitcoin mining companies. “Right now, miners are
competing against some of the largest tech companies in the world, who
are trying to find space for data centers, which are high energy
consumers too.”<br /> <br /> The nascent AI industry is drawing in
massive amounts of capital, which is making it harder for miners to
secure favorable electricity rates with utility companies. Amazon.com
Inc. is set to spend almost $150 billion on data centers, while
Blackstone is building a $25 billion empire of centers. Google Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. are also making hefty investments.<br /> <br /> “The
artificial intelligence crowd is willing to pay three or four times what
Bitcoin miners were paying last year” for electricity, said David Foley,
co-managing partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, which has made
investments in both public and private miners. That is happening across
the globe, he said.<br />
</blockquote>
Of course, if the miners’ break-even last year was around BTC=$25K, the
halvening would put it at $50K. So now, at around $67K, the miners can
afford to pay more for power, but not “three or four times” more. Pan
points out another
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-14/bitcoin-halving-will-deal-a-10-billion-blow-to-crypto-miners">problem
for the miners</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The tech giants also have an edge in acquiring power from utilities,
given their consistent revenue stream, whereas crypto mining revenue
fluctuates with the rise and fall in Bitcoin prices. Utilities consider
tech companies as more reliable purchasers given their strong balance
sheets, said Taras Kulyk, CEO at crypto-mining services provider
SunnyDigital.<br /> <br /> With that competition in place, low-cost
power contracts could be tougher to renew when existing agreements
expire. Large-scale Bitcoin miners tend to lock in energy prices,
typically for a few years, said Greg Beard, CEO of public Bitcoin miner
Stronghold Digital Mining Inc.

One might have expected a gradual decrease in the hash rate to start as
soon as the supply of mining rewards was halved. Why did miners
<i>increase</i> the hash rate after their block reward was halved? The
answer is that there was a massive spike in transaction fees. A week
before the average fee had been $2.82. The day before the average fee
was $19.09. On halvening day the average fee was $127, a 565% rise. A
week later it was $4.42. These massive fee spikes caused when everyone
wants to transact are inevitable given that Bitcoin is limited to around
7 transactions per second.<br /> <br />

The day of the halvening the miners made a total of $108M. This bonanza
completely reversed the normal state of the Bitcoin blockchain, in which
transactions are
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/fee-only-bitcoin.html">around 95%
subsidized</a> by inflating the currency with block rewards, to a state
in which the block reward was less than 20% of the miners’ income. As I
discussed in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/fee-only-bitcoin.html"><i>Fee-Only
Bitcoin</i></a>, this is close to the state Bitcoin will be in all the
time after three more halvenings in 2036. I predict that the average fee
then will be around $90/transaction, and that spikes could easily exceed
$540/transaction.<br /> <br /> The explanation for the spike in fees
lies in something else that deliberately coincided with the halvening
which caused a huge surge in demand for transactions. Joel Agbo’s
<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-bitcoin-runes"><i>What
Are Bitcoin Runes? Bringing Memecoins to Bitcoin</i></a> explains:<br />
<blockquote>
Casey Rodarmor, the creator of the Ordinals protocol that lets users
create NFT-like inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, is releasing
Runes, a new protocol that lets users easily create tokens on top of
Bitcoin like Solana and Ethereum. While the
<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/brc-20-tokens">BRC-20</a> and
<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-src-20-tokens-stamps-bitcoin">SRC-20</a>
token standards already exist, these are based on Ordinals theory, which
can result in UTXO proliferation that spam Bitcoin, <br /> <br /> In an
attempt to create a healthier way of etching tokens on the Bitcoin
network, <a href="https://rodarmor.com/blog/runes/">Rodarmor announced
Runes in September 2023</a> and has been working on this since then. As
the protocol nears its launch date, there is an increase in interest
around Runes and what it could mean for Bitcoin.<br />
<blockquote>
<i>“Creating a good fungible token protocol for Bitcoin might bring
significant transaction fee revenue, developer mindshare, and users to
Bitcoin.”</i>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Casey Rodarmor, creator of Runes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
Bitcoin Runes launchedon Block 840,000, following the Bitcoin halving in
April 2024. The creator does not impact Bitcoin, although it adds to the
excitement that follows the fourth Bitcoin halving. Rodarmor states that
Bitcoin Runes’ simplicity and overall architecture will aid the primary
reason for its development – the creation of fungible tokens on the
Bitcoin blockchain.

Miners Bag $109M in Halving Day Rewards as Hashprice Soars to Two-Year
Highs</i></a> summarizes what happened:<br />
<blockquote>
The soaring transaction fees resulted from on-chain users rushing to
create meme-like tokens on bitcoin using the Rune protocol, which is
similar to the ERC-20 standard for creating tokens on Ethereum.<br />
<br /> Although tokens created on Rune are fungible, the values are
subject to speculations on
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/20/runes-protocol-launches-on-bitcoin-sending-fees-soaring-as-users-rush-to-mint-tokens/">various
measures</a> such as how early they were created, the uniqueness and
quality of their symbols, and the potential of being listed on
exchanges.<br /> <br /> According to a Rune explorer, 1,750 Rune
projects have been created as of writing, or as the protocol terms it,
“etched.” For instance, some of the early “etched” projects are called
“<a href="https://runealpha.xyz/runes/840004:6">MASSIVE•PILE•OF•SHIT</a>”
or
“<a href="https://runealpha.xyz/runes/840000:3">DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON</a>“<br />
<br /> Because the protocol utilizes
<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-bitcoin-runes">bitcoin’s
UTXO</a> (unspent transaction output) model, it creates a mechanism
where a user’s transaction for a token issuance will first enter
bitcoin’s mempool and will be successfully created after the transaction
is confirmed.<br /> <br /> As bitcoin influencer Jimmy Song put it
<a href="https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1781518918001078441">here</a>,
explaining the current fee market dynamics, this mechanism also creates
room for “squatters” to snipe a user’s creation by outbidding them using
a higher fee.<br /> <br /> “Whichever comes first gets the symbol and
the asset issuance. But if you want to squat on a good symbol name, you
can just look for mempool transactions that are attempting to create a
new asset and create your own with a bigger fee,” Song wrote.

Just as the April 19 “halving” reduced the amount of tokens awarded to

time. The process is enabled by the Rune protocol, through which people
can create their own fungible tokens. Dune Analytics’ data shows that
the total transactions in Runes dropped to around 45,700 on Monday from
its peak at above 750,000 on April 23.<br /> …<br /> Since the protocol
launch, Runes have generated 2,169 Bitcoin, or approximately $137

<h3>
Tether
</h3>
There are two possible, not mutually exclusive, reasons for the flood of
27B USDT:<br />
<ol type="A">
<li>
Speculators, believing that the halvening would send BTC moonwards,
bought 27B newly created USDT with $27B USD. They used the 27B USDT to
buy BTC, more than doubling the “price”.
</li>
<li>
Holders of BTC pledged it as collateral for loans of 27B newly created
USDT from Tether. They used the 27B USDT to buy BTC, more than doubling
the “price”. They then sold half the newly doubled BTC for USDT, with
which they repaid the loan. At the peak anyone who bought BTC between
the beginning of the pump and November 11<sup>th</sup> November had more
than doubled their money.
</li>
</ol>
Case B is Tether’s “magic money pump”; I wrote about it in 2020’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/12/stablecoins.html"><i>Stablecoins</i></a>
pointing out that, among other research:<br />
<blockquote>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12903"><i>Is Bitcoin Really
Untethered?</i></a> by John Griffin and Amit Shams shows that:<br />
<blockquote>
Rather than demand from cash investors, these patterns are most
consistent with the supply‐based hypothesis of unbacked digital money
inflating cryptocurrency prices.
</blockquote>
Their paper was originally published in 2018 and updated in 2019 and
2020.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12768"><i>Ponzi Funds</i></a> by
Philippe van der Beck, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud and Dario Villamaina
describe a similar “magic money pump” in certain mutual funds whose
holdings are concentrated, as BTC hodlers’ are:<br />
<blockquote>
Flow-driven trading in these securities causes price pressure, which
pushes up the funds’ existing positions resulting in realized returns.
We decompose fund returns into a price pressure (self-inflated) and a
fundamental component and show that when allocating capital across
funds, investors are unable to identify whether realized returns are
self-inflated or fundamental. Because investors chase self-inflated fund
returns at a high frequency, even short-lived impact meaningfully
affects fund flows at longer time scales. The combination of price
impact and return chasing causes an endogenous feedback loop and a
reallocation of wealth to early fund investors, which unravels once the
price pressure reverts.
</blockquote>
This effect mirrors that in Bitcoin. If, for example by wash trading or
borrowing loan-backed USDT, HODL-ers can start a BTC price spike other
speculators will join in and thus create an “endogenous feedback loop”.
In ETFs, van der Beck <i>et al</i> estimate that this effect reallocates
$500M/day to earlier investors.<br /> <br /> I returned to the idea of
“magic money pumps” in 2021’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/08/stablecoins-part-2.html"><i>Stablecoins
Part 2</i></a> as news came out that the DoJ had a criminal
investigation into Tether. Now, Amy Castor and David Gerard’s

discuss law enforcement’s increasing pressure on Tether because of its
use in rampant sanctions evasion. They list Islamic Jihad, Hamas,
Venezuela’s oil industry and Russia’s war on Ukraine as being funded via
Tether:<br />
<blockquote>
Chainalysis found that stablecoins like Tether were used in the vast
majority of crypto-based scam transactions and sanctions evasion in
2023.<br /> <br /> TRM Labs concurred, saying that Tether was the most
used stablecoin in illicit crypto flows in 2023. Tether on the Tron
blockchain in particular had “cemented its position as the currency of
choice for use by terrorist financing entities.”

<h2 id="biden-why-isnt-trump-in-jail">Biden: Why isn’t Trump in
jail?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-30, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Biden would be a fine president if our problems were limited to the
virus, the economy and climate change.
</p>
<p>
He’s like Obama, but with much more experience at getting things done in
Washington.
</p>
<p>
His failure is that the fascist movement in the country is much stronger
now than it was when he took office.
</p>
<p>
Are we better off than we were four years ago? No, sadly we are worse
off. Trump is a much bigger threat now.
</p>
<p>
Biden is a fine LBJ-like president. And like LBJ, he has his Vietnam.
Biden’s war he can’t end is called Trump. Trump isn’t in jail. That’s
the failure right there.
</p>
<p>
The problem could be fixed if we had this discussion out in the open, so
that the press raises it every day and in every press event. They
shouldn’t be trying to embarrass him about his age, that’s rude and
deceptive, instead they should ask why isn’t Trump in jail?
</p>
<p>
If Biden wanted to address this, and it would certainly help his chances
of winning, he would:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fire Garland immediately.
</li>
<li>
Apologize for not firing him sooner. It was a mistake. My mistake. I own
it. I am sorry.
</li>
<li>
Nominate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Raskin">Jamie
Raskin</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cheney">Liz
Cheney</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Gallego">Ruben Gallego</a>
as the new AG.
</li>
<li>
Biden’s number one promise is that he will <i>fully</i> prosecute Trump
and all insurrectionists in his second term, starting now. This would
also serve as a warning to any Trump supporters that tried to overthrow
the government (again, sigh) before or during the election.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Trump is making a fool of Biden by saying openly that he will be a
dictator on Day 1.
</p>
<p>
People who think Trump is losing don’t get it. People are rightly fed up
with Biden. But not for the economy. That’s bullshit. And not because
he’s old. Rather because he’s selling us out, just hoping against hope
that the voters will save us. It’s kind of unreasonable to expect that
when you, the person we elected president to get us out of this hole,
didn’t fire the biggest obstacle to our starting to dig.
</p>
<p>
Depend on Congress, the press, the courts, now the voters.
</p>
<p>
No Biden, you’re the president. This is <i>your</i> job.

<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">
2024-05-23 Death and dying
</h1>
<p>
This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am
old enough to be an adult about it.
</p>
<p>
One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in
Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at
the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see
my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn’t go
myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn’t
there for my sister’s burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours,
back then. I don’t know how things are now. There was school and stuff
and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn’t feel very
close. It just felt weird. I didn’t know what it was supposed to mean.
</p>
<p>
Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are
failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his
heart is failing; they can’t give him his heart medication because the
kidneys are at their limits, can’t have him move around because he’s
weak, and so he’s breaking down. I mean, he’s calm, he knows what’s
happening, and he’s very, very tired. He’s ready to go.
</p>
<p>
I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to
go one day. I don’t want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines.
I’ll be very, very tired. I’ll just want to go home. I also won’t want
anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I’ll feel that I lived a good
life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were
decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will
be able to let go and be at peace. It’s what I hear about my stepfather.
</p>
<p>
But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and
Germany and my, and my mother, and one after another people start
crying, choking up, it’s hard. It’s a that invisible choker, grabbing
us, one after another.
</p>
<p>
I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the
laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our
family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back
to haunt us, now.
</p>
<p>
To go and support each other.
</p>
<p>
Go and hug your loved ones.

<strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn’t look good at
all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping,
mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us,
saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The
doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes,
stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.
</p>
<p>
There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister,
my sister, my half-brother’s wife, their kid, my mom… the kid was the
only one that seemed unperturbed. “Don’t be sad, grandma!”
</p>
<p>
Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of
them super nice. We’ll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not
feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it’s not my
partner that has died.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his
birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I’m happy we were all
there for each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on
the radio.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-05-30</strong>. On the way home. It was good to see the
family again. I gave a little speech in Portuguese, explaining how the
language continues to remain important to us, even if we live a abroad,
and how hard it was for a family where people live in different
countries, alone – but also how our parents divorcing and marrying had
led to an ever growing family. There are more parents, more siblings,
and I love it and it helps. We can all help each other. And my deceased
stepfather was certainly an enrichment for our family, bringing anarchy
and lawlessness and laughter into a family that was rigid and regimented
and dour, and how we all grew with that and how it was important to
remember the good times we had and the lessens we all drew from his
presence. Truly, a great influence for all of us.
</p>
<p>
I still remember how I met him years before my mother met him. He lived
across the river alone with his son, wild and free and I was so jealous.
I wished to love like that! And then my parents divorced, my dad went
back to Switzerland and a year later I followed him and got to live wild
and free like them, it was amazing. And one day I came back and there
were rumors that our mother had found a boyfriend. Imagine my surprise
when it was him! The wild and free guitar playing dude from across the
river! And eventually my friend from school turned into my stepbrother,
moved in with my mom, lived in my room. It was mysterious and magical
and then to see him and his father struggle with my mom, the changes
they brought about, it was a miracle.
</p>
<p>
So, my man, wherever you are, here‘s to you and your last trip, to your
guitars and flutes, your love of music and freedom, your spirit of
independence and love of people and aliens. Cheers! I hope to see you
again.

<p>
A software maker serving more than 10,000 courtrooms throughout the
world hosted an application update containing a hidden backdoor that
maintained persistent communication with a malicious website,
researchers reported Thursday, in the latest episode of a supply-chain
attack.
</p>
<p>
The software, known as the JAVS Viewer 8, is a component of the JAVS
Suite 8</a>, an application package courtrooms use to record, play back,
and manage audio and video from proceedings. Its maker, Louisville,
Kentucky-based Justice AV Solutions, says its products are used in more
than 10,000 courtrooms throughout the US and 11 other countries. The
company has been in business for 35 years…

<p>How can we tell if ChatGPT is intelligent? How can I tell if you’re
intelligent. How do I know I’m intelligent. It could be my
“intelligence” is as algorithmic as ChatGPT’s. It could be that my
intelligence is only a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation">survival
mechanism</a>, and the only way I could think of something I think is
intelligent is if it furthers my chance to reproduce. But what happens
when our intellect instructs us to destroy the environment we depend on
for life? It could be we are already obsolete, without the robots, it
sure feels that way, and that our only
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark">ark</a> that could
lead us to a new place where our species can survive in some form is for
us to morph into electronic beings whose intelligence is distributed
around the planet so we don’t die if it becomes uninhabitable in one
place, but not in others. And a LLM might thrive in an environment that
can’t support human life.</p>

Researchers from the University of Maryland say they relied on publicly

The first is their log-linear graph of the progress of areal density of
hard disk (HDD), tape and NAND flash over the last three decades:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<b>Tape</b> has improved its areal density at a very consistent
~27%/year. This has been possible due in part to improvements in both
media and heads. But, as the graph shows, primarily because the bits on
tape are currently about the size that bits on hard disk were two
decades ago. This gives tape a lot of headroom before it runs into the
pyysical limits.
</li>
<li>
<b>HDD</b> was improving its areal density at around 35%/year until,
around 2010, it got too close to the physical limits. Since then it has
been growing around 6%/year, despite
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search?q=Pangloss&amp;max-results=20&amp;by-date=true">continual
Panglossian predictions</a> from the industry.
</li>
<li>
<b>NAND</b>, in which category IBM includes everything from enterprise
SSDs to SD cards, saw explosive growth from the late 1990s to the late
2000s, growing about 3 orders of magnitude in around a decade.It then
slowed to a mere 32%/year, meaning that it is still growing
significantly faster than the other media.

IBM’s second pair of graphs shows (a) a log-linear plot of the Exabytes
shipped each year since 2008, and (b) the percentage of the total
represented by each medium:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The graph of Exabytes shipped shows NAND growing three times faster than
the other media, that tape’s growth rate is again very consistent, and
that drops in HDD shipments for 2022 and 2023 have made the total
shipments for HDD and NAND about the same.
</li>
<li>
The market share graph shows tape maintaining a small share slightly
eroded by HDD. But NAND is rapidly eroding HDD’s share.

The next slide shows (a) a log-linear plot of the cost of a terabyte
over time (the Kryder rate), and (b) the ratio between NAND and HDD, and
HDD to tape:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The Kryder rate graph shows both NAND’s and HDD’s rate slowing in the
late 2000s. Tape again has a more consistent rate.
</li>
<li>
The cost ratio graph shows why NAND is rapidly eroding HDD’s market
share, as its cost disadvantage is decreasing exponentially. The cost
ratio between tape and HDD has been fairly constant, which likely
explains why tape’s market share has suffered slight erosion.

Their table of 2023 costs shows that NAND is more than 3 times as
expensive as HDD. But this is an average across the whole range of NAND
and HDD markets. Much NAND goes into market segments where it does not
compete with HDD, such as SD cards, USB drives and phones. Whereas most
HDD is 3.5” drives in PCs and data centers, where it competes only with
enterprise flash. So in markets where they compete, the cost
differential will be substantially higher.<br /> <br /> They have two
slides that echo topics I have posted about fairly often. The first
points out that industry projections of future areal density (and thus
cost) routinely exaggerate the rate of growth by at least 10%. This why
I frequently report on how happy the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search?q=Pangloss&amp;max-results=20&amp;by-date=true">good
Dr. Pangloss</a> is with the storage industry.<br /> <br /> The second
of them expresses skepticism about the prospect of DNA storage
impactuing the market. Their cost graph shows the cost to write a
terabyte of DNA is around 10 orders of magnitude more than for HDD, and
the cost to read it once is around 3 orders of magnitude more than
buying a terabyte of HDD. They write:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Very slow to read and write.
</li>
<li>
Very expensive.
</li>
<li>
Large Market size needed to develop technology; a sub-tier below tape
storage is small.
</li>
</ul>
I pointed this out in 2018’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html"><i>DNA’s
Niche In The Storage Market</i></a>. Even if projections about the
increase in demand for archival storage pan out, it will be hard for new
media to compete with tape.<br /> <br /> They also write something
mystifying — “Not so stable”, citing
<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fbiotech12020044"><i>DNA Data
Storage</i></a> by Tomasz Buko, Nella Tuczko, and Takao Ishikawa of the
University of Warsaw. This paper contends that DNA is vastly <i>more</i>
stable than tape, or any current medium:<br />
<blockquote>
For years, a DNA specimen collected from a 700,000-year-old horse was
considered to be the oldest extracted DNA. However, in 2021, this record
was pushed to 1 million years. DNA extracted from mammoth teeth was
successfully extracted and sequenced. Additionally, scientists managed
to sequence 300,000-year-old mitochondrial DNA from humans and bears.
These examples perfectly illustrate the longevity of DNA and proves its
usefulness for archeological purposes or data storekeeping. If stored in
optimal conditions and dehydrated, DNA can possibly endure for millions
of years.

Jon Trantham’s look at the hard disk market was interesting. First, his
graph of demand for nearline HDDs explains why the industry suffered
hard times recently and why they believe the future looks brighter. A
period of rapid growth led to an inventory buildup from exuberant demand
forecasts, but the inventory has been depleted and demand is now rising.
One might be skeptical of the rate of demand recovery in the graph, but
at least the US economy suggests rising demand is plausible.<br />

His slide on IDC’s market forecast supports my contention that IBM’s
cost ratio between NAND and HDD is misleading. The non-cloud HDD market
is projected to be a small proportion of the total, and to grow slowly.
The vast bulk of the HDD market is for cloud storage, and thus the
effective cost ratio is between HDD and enterprise SSDs. This would be
much greater than IBM’s overall estimate of 3.<br /> <br /> <br />

Seagate projects that the capacity per platter will rise from today’s
2.4TB to over 5TB by 2026 (see Dr. Pangloss and IBM) using their
<a href="https://www.seagate.com/innovation/mozaic/">Mozaic HAMR
technology</a>. Current 16TB drives have 9 1.78TB platters. Seagate
recently started shipping 30TB drives with 10 3TB platters. If they are
right a 10 platter drive in 2026 would be 50TB, or around 3x the current
drive capacity. This would certainly help maintain HDD’s market
share.<br /> <br /> Some additional topics:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Seagate is working to move HDDs to the NVMe interface, to simplify and
speed up datacenter systems.
</li>
<li>
Their sustainability efforts include trying to avoid customers shredding
drives at their end-of-life. This is driven by customers requirement for
data security. But Seagate encrypts the data on the platters and
securely erase it by overwriting the key. The problem is to persuade
customers that this satisfies their requirement. Seagate also wants to
recover the rare earth magnets by industrial-scale disassembly of the
drives.
</li>
<li>
Given a target of 98% drive reliability, as the number of platters
increases the number of heads increases and thus the required
reliability of the heads increases. Seagate is advocating that, in the
case of head failure, the drive remains in use with reduced capacity. By
provisioning a pool of spare drives, and avoiding failing an entire
drive if a single head fails, the cost of ownership can be significantly
reduced. 40-60% of all drive failures are single head failures.
</li>
</ul>

The first slide of Microsoft’s Aaron Ogus and Shashidar Joshi’s talk
shows why cloud systems like Azure are dominating the industry.<br />
<br /> Their observations from the experience of running Exabytes of
archival storage containing trillions of objects and servicing billions
of requests each month are:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Writes dominate
</li>
<li>
Reads are infrequent
</li>
<li>
Small reads require low latency random access
</li>
<li>
Large reads require good throughput
</li>
<li>
Archive Storage system needs dynamic provisioning to account for
workload variances
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
All the early studies showed that archival storage workloads are
write-domminated, because most archival data is written and very rarely
accessed. That’s why it has been archived. It is reasssuring to know
that this is still true in the cloud era. Given this, and that the
Service Level Agreements for cloud archives do not require low latency,
it isn’t clear why Microsoft thinks this is important.<br /> <br /> The
challenges Microsoft sees with their current technologies are:
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Mechanical overheads lead to latencies
</li>
<li>
Environmental conditions limit deployment capabilities
</li>
<li>
Uncertainty with roadmaps, capacities and costs
</li>
<li>
Need for media migrations at EOL
</li>
<li>
Opportunity for new storage technologies
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
The environmental requirements of current technologies were one reason
for
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook’s
use of optical storage</a>, it only needed warehouse space not a data
center. Anecdotal reports at the meeting revealed serious issues with
moving tapes between environments.<br /> <br /> The uncertainties are
always with us, not least because the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2017/08/economic-model-of-long-term-storage.html">economics
of long-term storage</a> depend strongly on interest rates. The “need
for media migration at EOL” is one major motivation for the use of
quasi-immortal media, such as Project Silica. But this is illusory. As I
wrote about
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook’s
optical cold storage</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
No-one expects the racks to sit in the data center for 50 years, at some
point before then they will be obsoleted by some unknown new, much
denser and more power-efficient cold storage medium.
</blockquote>
Earlier this year I discussed Microsoft Research’s view of the
“opportunity for new storage technologies” in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/03/microsofts-archival-storage-research.html"><i>Microsoft’s
Archival Storage Research</i></a>. They are pursuing two technologies,
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">DNA storage</a>,
and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">Project
Silica</a>. Ogus and Joshi discuss Project Silica, claiming that it
provides “Performance (Random IO) per TB metric better than currently
available Archive technologies”. But part of the design of Project
Silica is that the write and read drives are different, and
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">thus</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This allows independent scaling of read and write throughput.
</blockquote>
Their claim depends upon the system being configured with enough write
(if they meant I) or read (if they meant O) drives.<br /> <br />
<h3>
<a href="https://digitalpreservation.gov/meetings/DSA2024/loc_dsa2024_website_0107_Moore_LOC_FM_2024.pdf"><i>The
Data Storage Industry Gets Ready for AI</i></a>
</h3>
Fred Moore made the important point that archival storage faced a
significant risk of a Vertical Market Failure (VMF):<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
The Zettabyte scale secondary storage market (cold, archive) has become
the exclusive domain of few suppliers.
</li>
<li>
IBM is the only (1) tape drive developer/supplier controlling the entire
tape ecosystem specifications.
</li>
<li>
Fujifilm and Sony are the only (2) LTO tape media suppliers.
</li>
<li>
HPE, IBM, Quantum and Spectra are the primary large-scale tape and
library suppliers.
</li>
<li>
Seagate, Toshiba and WD are the only (3) remaining HDD suppliers.
</li>
<li>
(Tape - WD), (HDD - Seagate and TDK) are the only R/W head
manufacturers.
</li>
<li>
Will current HDD and tape development roadmaps keep pace with demand?
</li>
<li>
HSDCs leverage their bargaining and buying power to drive down prices
impacting vendor margins, R&amp;D investments.
</li>
<li>
In the event of a secondary storage VMF, sustainability challenges will
become insurmountable for HDDs to address.
</li>
<li>
As supplier profit margins become insufficient, future R&amp;D funding,
roadmaps, will place innovation at significant risk.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Archival storage is a very small part of the total storage industry.
NAND and HDDs pay for their R&amp;D in the much bigger online and
nearline markets. Tape leverages a little of that, in that its head
technology is based on HDD head technology, but in general has to fund
R&amp;D solely from the archive market. And so will potential novel
archival storage technologies, such as DNA and Project Silica.
Fundamentally, companies don’t want to invest in archival storage
because it doesn’t generate income, so the market isn’t just small, but
under significant margin pressure. This is why I wrote
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/03/archival-media-not-good-business.html"><i>Archival
Media: Not a Good Business</i></a> six years ago. If and when NAND
eventually displaces HDD for nearline storage, the reduced market will
definitely cause a VMF, with knock-on effects on tape.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="a-common-web-component-learning-blunder">A common web component
learning blunder</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Through stalking the
<a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/webcomponents">#WebComponents</a>
hashtag and
<a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-components/">my
Frontend Masters course</a>, I’m privy to a lot of developers’ first
experiences with web components. There’s a wide range of people digging
in, but the most common first-time experience I come across is a
developer coming from a classical component framework like React with
JSX going straight to writing vanilla Web Components, becoming
frustrated, and then deeming web components “not ready for primetime.”
</p>
<p>
Ignoring for a moment that web components <em>do</em> exist in the
primetime and power some big and complex primetime web applications like
Adobe’s Photoshop for Web, I half-understand this perspective. I
understand the desire to not have a major dependency. I hate this
bloated <code>node_modules</code> hellhole we’ve built over the last
decade and while I’m not a <code>npm install</code> my problems away
guy… I think this puritanical approach to dependencies is a misstep when
diving into web components for the first time.
</p>
<p>
The analogy I’ve been using is that this is like jumping from a tall 130
kilobyte-story building (ReactDOM) right into the zero kilobyte sewers
of web components. If you take anything from this post, please
understand this: <em>web components (most likely) weren’t designed for
you</em>. Not to dissuade you from using them, but they were
<a href="https://blog.domenic.me/the-extensible-web/">purposefully
designed</a> to be <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">a
low-level bare metal primitive</a> for library authors to build on; they
were designed to be used with a library, a thin layer of abstraction
butter on top.
</p>
<p>
To understand this disparity further, let’s look at an example of what
writing a component in a “modern” framework <em>feels</em> like…
</p>
<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">

Can you do this in vanilla web components? Sure. But it looks like this…

This is a boring, imperative set of instructions for building the
component with a little bit of
<code>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</code><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
mixed in there… and ugchk… it sucks. It’s even more verbose with more
interactive elements or a slew of reactive props and attributes.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see what 7 kilobytes of Lit gets us….
</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>
Now we have a component that’s almost identical to the familiar world of
JSX but <em>without any Babel transforms or build steps</em>. For 7
kilobytes you get a lot more than some syntactic sugar, you get…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A thin, tree-shakeable layer of abstraction for a modern developer
experience
</li>
<li>
Reactive updates without VDOM
</li>
<li>
A more granular component lifecycle with a <code>render()</code>
function
</li>
<li>
A cleaner way of registering and using reactive attributes and
properties without overloading the <code>attributeChangedCallback</code>
</li>
<li>
Template directives like <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="click">@click</span></code> for event handling and
directives for JavaScript values (arrays, objects, etc).
</li>
<li>
And an <code>html</code> tagged template literal with an
under-appreciated superpower ✨ that gives your components atomic
updates under-the-hood.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There’s value in learning how bare metal vanilla web components work in
the same way there’s value in knowing how
<code>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat()</code> works, but you probably want to
use <a href="https://day.js.org/">Day.js</a> for your day-to-day work.
You can totally
<a href="https://hawkticehurst.com/writing/bring-your-own-base-class/">write
your own base class abstraction</a> – and I want you to have the
<code>JeffElement</code> base class of your dreams, I do – but you may
find out
(<a href="https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/building-custom-elements-with-a-library/">like
Cory LaViska from Shoelace found out</a>) that after you write all your
little helper functions and utilities that you’ll end up with something
almost the exact same size and feature set as Lit, but not as well
supported nor as battle-tested.
</p>
<p>
This makes me sound anti-vanilla web components and I’m not that by any
means. Vanilla web components are a perfect fit for
<a href="https://github.com/davatron5000/awesome-standalones">standalone
components</a> and the Light DOM-forward flavor of
“<a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618">HTML web components</a>”,
but I think the people having the most fun in this space are JavaScript
minimalists who already prefer writing vanilla JavaScript. People like
myself.
</p>
<p>
“If I have to use a library how is this any different than any other
framework lock-in?” This is a valid question and one worthy of its own
post, but I think you’ll find the lock-in costs of a web component
library pretty minimal. Because all web components libraries extend a
common base class, there’s a linear pathway out of vendor lock-in if
necessary.
</p>
<p>
What I’m saying is this; next time you’re thinking about jumping from
130 kilobytes of developer convenience, maybe consider giving yourself a
7 kilobyte landing pad to cushion the fall.

new ways to do software docs and user interaction using AI. It’s an
incredible application, it will revolutionize how useful computers are

Quantum computers are probably coming, though we don’t know when—and

cryptographers have been working on quantum-resistant public-key

<p>date: 2024-05-27, updated: 2024-05-27, from: Ron Garret</p>
<p>(Part 8 in a series on the scientific method)In the last installment
I advanced a hypothesis about what truth is, which is to say, I
suggested a way to explain the broad consensus that appears to exist
about truth.  That explanation was: there is an objective reality “out
there”, and true statements are those that in some sense correspond to
the actual state of affairs in that objective</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-27, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>Slop is the new Spam. Slop is unwanted AI-generated content. Most
AI-powered products don’t truly have product/market fit. That’s because
they are easy to build (wrappers) and it’s easy to make grandiose
promises on a website. Delivering value is an entirely other thing.
Product marketing is far ahead of product value in most cases. Hiten

<p>date: 2024-05-27, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>In a recent podcast, Adobe Chief Product Officer Scott
Belsky said that startups and founders jump into the fray and desire to
do the impossible but overlook one small thing — empathy. I have talked
about the need for empathy for more than a decade now
— in 2013, 2014, 2016, and then in 2017. I am glad Scott is taking up
the issue. “What should have …</p>

Jägerstätter and his wife Franziska (Fani) sit at the kitchen table in
their Austrian farmhouse and reminisce about their first meeting. Fani

<p>date: 2024-05-27, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Memorial Day, the day Americans have honored since 1868,
when we mourn those military personnel who have died in the service of
the country—that is, for the rest of us. For me, one of those people is
Beau Bryant. When we were growing up, we hung out at one particular
house where a friend’s mom provided unlimited peanut butter and fluff
sandwiches, Uno games, iced tea and lemonade, sympathetic ears, and
stories. She talked about Beau, her older brother, in the same way we
talked about all our people, and her stories made him part of our world
even though he had been killed in World War II 19 years before we were
born.</p>

<p>While it’s not officially summer yet, the town is coming to life. The
lilacs and apple trees are blooming over the forget-me-nots, and over
them all is the bright blue sky of the coming summer. For me, though,
the clearest sign of the change of seasons is that Buddy is back on the
water, and sunrise photos like this are waiting for me on my phone when
I get up many hours after he has headed out to haul.</p>
