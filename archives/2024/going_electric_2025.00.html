Infantile EV automaker
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/xiaomi/">Xiaomi Automotive</a> has
capped off 2025 with delivery numbers that cannot be ignored. The
company has delivered an impressive 135,000 units of its flagship SU7
EV… after launching it in late March 2024. Looking ahead to 2025, Xiaomi
looks to more than double that EV output with the help of a second model
and an additional phase of its production footprint.

We don’t want to sound alarmist,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/14/which-electric-vehicles-qualify-us-federal-tax-credit-ev-2024/">but
it sure looks like President-elect Donald Trump and his billionaire
buddies are plotting to kill federal EV tax credits somewhat sooner than
later</a> – and the tariffs they’re promising aren’t going to make cars
cheaper anytime soon, either. So if you’re in the market for a new EV,
the time is now to score a sweet 0% financing deal and get those tax
credits
(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/electrek.co/reel/DCjVmEnOFLG/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while
you still can</a>).

<strong>UPDATE</strong>: we’ve got a few new additions for the closing
days of 2024, including sweet deals on the Mustang Mach-E GT (above),
Toyota bZ4X, and more!
