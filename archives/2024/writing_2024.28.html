<h2 id="why-are-romance-novels-so-popular">Why Are Romance Novels So
Popular?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Romance novels are the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;https://freakonomics.com/podcast/romance-novels/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;highest-grossing fiction genre in the world&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; - a useful statistic to quote when faced with readers who still look at them with disdain. The&amp;nbsp;genre has expanded a great deal in recent decades, going beyond the formulaic novel that flourished in the 1970s. Why is this genre so popular, and where is it heading?&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Who reads romance novels?</p>
<p>
Women read more books than men, and women read far more romance novels
than men
(<a href="https://www.rwa.org/the-romance-genre" target="_blank">82% in
2017</a>), whether they are chick lit, historical romance, or romantasy.
The genre has gone far beyond the 1970s cliché of the bodice ripper and
has spawned dozens of sub-genres.
</p>
<p>
Romance novel sales started growing in the 1970s, when Harlequin, the
leading publisher of the genre, started selling its books in locations
other than bookstores. As
<a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/romance-novels/" target="_blank">this
episode of the Freakonomics podcast</a> explains, “You could walk into a
supermarket or drugstore, and find yourself face-to-face with an
alpha-male in a ruffled shirt, his eyes glinting at you from the cover
of a paperback.” Easy to buy, easy to read, these early romance novels
appealed to a captive audience, women shopping.
</p>
<p>
Romance novel enthusiasts are voracious readers. “Industry data shows
that around half of all romance readers go through at least one novel
every week. Some read as many as 30 a month.” Romance novels represent
23% of book sales in the US, and
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/02/1179850128/even-as-overall-book-sales-are-declining-romance-novels-are-on-the-rise" target="_blank">it
is the genre that has been growing the most in recent years, as overall
book sales are declining</a>.
</p>
<p>The history of the romance novel</p>
<p>
The modern romance novel was born in the 1930s in the UK, with books
published by Mills &amp; Boon, and expanded in the 1970s in the US, with
Harlequin, who purchased the British publisher in 1971. But romance
novels have been around as long as the novel. Jane Austen and Charlotte
Brontë wrote the earliest popular romance novels, but the romance novel
goes back to ancient Greece, and the first modern romance novel is
generally considered to be Samuel Richardson’s 1740 novel
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela;_or,_Virtue_Rewarded" target="_blank">Pamela;
or, Virtue Rewarded</a>.
</p>
<p>
Many historical romance novels helped develop the genre, such as those
by Walter Scott, in the 19th century, and by Georgette Heyer, in the
early 20th century. <em>Gone with the Wind</em>, in 1936,
while <a href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2019/02/15/brief-history-romance-novel-recommendations" target="_blank">not
technically classified as a romance novel</a>, has a strong influence on
the way characters are portrayed. Today, historical romance is a huge
part of the genre.
</p>
<p>What drives people to read romance novels?</p>
<p>
Love is one of the major elements of human life, and, as such, the
“plot” of falling in love is universal. Books for women, mostly written
by women, provide a mirror for their lives. As
<a href="https://lithub.com/the-unexpectedly-subversive-world-of-romance-novels/" target="_blank">Helen
Taylor, Professor of English at the University of Exeter says</a>,
“modern romance puts women at the center of the narrative.” Readers can
identify with the heroines of these novels, and share in the experiences
of all women. “Although a woman reads a romance alone, often in secret
away from male family members and workmates, she joins a virtual
communal realm of female readers who share experiences and thus
understand one another’s responses.”
</p>
<p>
Go back a few decades, and there was a stigma to reading romance novels.
They were the feminine equivalent of male pulp fiction: the western,
detective story, or science fiction yarn. Now, readers openly express
their love for the genre, and the literary world is beginning to
recognize the value and relevance of romance fiction, in part because of
the huge popularity of this genre, which generates well over $1 billion
in sales. This shift in perception has helped elevate the genre’s
status, and publishers are actively promoting romance novels, leading to
more readers discovering them.
</p>
<p>How romance novels have changed</p>
<p>
As the popularity of romance novels grew, their characters changed from
being stereotypical rich or noble men and submissive women, to become
stories about real people that readers can identify with. One notable
turning point was Helen Fielding’s
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones%27s_Diary_(novel)" target="_blank">Bridget
Jones’s Diary</a></em>, which spawned the “chick lit” sub-genre by
presenting a flawed character with the same problems as the women
reading the novel.
</p>
<p>
Contemporary romance novels - even those set in historical periods -
feature more strong, independent heroines who defy societal norms and
pursue their desires. These empowering narratives resonate with modern
readers. The romance genre has also become more inclusive, including
characters from diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, and sexual
orientations, which allows more readers to identify with the characters.
</p>
<p>
The genre itself has split into multiple sub-genres. While “category
romance novels” - a term for the standard Harlequin or Mills &amp; Boon
type novel - still make up the largest share of sales, many sub-genres
have grown in popularity: fantasy, gothic, contemporary, historical
fiction, paranormal fiction, and science fiction are all genres that get
blended with romance plots. One popular genre today is
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/feb/02/romantasy-literary-genre-booktok" target="_blank">romantasy,
a genre the Guardian calls “A genre of swords and soulmates”</a>, which
blends both romance and fantasy. While not new - the Diana Gabaldon’s
<em>Outlander</em> series did this more than 30 years ago - the
popularity of this genre has been driven by TikTok and other social
media,
</p>
<p>
Finally, the popularity of erotic romance novels is increasing. While
there have long been novels of this type, the sub-genre went mainstream
with the <em>Fifty Shades</em> series, and the major romance novel
publishers have imprints that publish erotic fiction.
</p>
<p>
The romance novel has evolved as other pulp genres have, and it meets
the desires of a large number of readers. Economically, the value of
this genre is undeniable. It is more vibrant than ever and will continue
to break new ground as writers expand its relevancy to modern women.

<p>John and Craig welcome Aline Brosh McKenna to look at what writers
mean by a “voice,” and how it develops. Some screenwriters’ voice
develops long before their craft, leading people to label them as
“promising” even though the scripts themselves are a mess. Other writers
get all the technical stuff right from the start, but […] The post

Cynthia Pelayo has made a name for herself in horror by bringing to the
