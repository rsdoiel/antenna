find their voice (Encore)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: John August blog</p>
<p>John and Craig welcome Aline Brosh McKenna to look at what writers

<strong>The City of Stardust </strong>by Georgia Summers blends our
recognizable world, mostly through the home of the Everly family in the
English countryside, with the fictional city of Fidelis, a place of
academics and magic that hides a horrific truth. (And that horror really
is bad; we’re talking ritual-sacrifice-of-kidnapped-children kind of
bad.) Violet Everly lives

978-1-66251-391-6, $16.99, 303pp, tp) March 2024. Cover by Olga Grlic.
</p>
<p>
Cynthia Pelayo has made a name for herself in horror by bringing to the
table a mixture of horror, crime fiction, and folklore that always
contains a dash of poetry and by telling stories that invariably take
place in Chicago, a city that Pelayo always turns into a character in
her work.
