Prizes are an important part of the IFComp. Since 1998, the Interactive

the authors of games that score well in
<a href="https://ifcomp.org/comp">the annual rankings</a>. These prizes
come from the IF community, and
<a href="https://ifcomp.org/about/past_prizes">vary in shape</a>, from
cash to books to food to professional services.

email us at
<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=prizes@ifcomp.org">prizes@ifcomp.org</a>

<strong>Forgotten Sisters</strong>, Cynthia Pelayo (Thomas &amp; Mercer
978-1-66251-391-6, $16.99, 303pp, tp) March 2024. Cover by Olga Grlic.
</p>
<p>
Cynthia Pelayo has made a name for herself in horror by bringing to the
table a mixture of horror, crime fiction, and folklore that always
contains a dash of poetry and by telling stories that invariably take
place in Chicago, a city that Pelayo always turns into a character in
her work.
