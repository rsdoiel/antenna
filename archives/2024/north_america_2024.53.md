## German government seeks to downplay Musk's backing of far-right party ahead of general election

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

Berlin — The German government on Monday sought to downplay efforts by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk to get involved in the country's general election campaign by again endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party.


Musk caused uproar over the weekend after backing the AfD in an opinion piece in a major newspaper, leading to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor in protest.


"Freedom of expression also includes the greatest nonsense," government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said, adding that she wouldn't comment further on Musk's statements.


She did, however, say that "it is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election through his statement."


In that context, Hoffmann also pointed out that the AfD is being monitored by Germany's domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and that it has already been recognized as such in some individual German states.


Germany is to vote in an early election on Feb. 23 after Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party governing coalition collapsed last month in a dispute over how to revitalize the country's stagnant economy.


Musk's guest opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag published in German over the weekend, was the second time this month he had supported Alternative for Germany, or AfD.




"The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country," Musk wrote in his translated commentary.


He went on to say the far-right party "can lead the country into a future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity and technological innovation are not just wishes, but reality."


The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country's condition.


The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party.




An ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, the technology billionaire challenged in his opinion piece the party's public image.


"The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!"


Musk's commentary has led to a debate in German media over the boundaries of free speech, with the paper's own opinion editor announcing her resignation, pointedly on Musk's social media platform, X.


"I always enjoyed leading the opinion section of WELT and WAMS. Today an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag. I handed in my resignation yesterday after it went to print," Eva Marie Kogel wrote.


The newspaper was attacked by politicians and other media for offering Musk, a foreigner, a platform.


Musk's opinion piece in the Welt am Sonntag was accompanied by a critical article by the future editor-in-chief of the Welt group, Jan Philipp Burgard, who wrote that while some of Musk's diagnoses of Germany's problems may be correct "his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally wrong."

## The Hottest Climate Debates of 2024

date: 2024-12-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTM2OTA4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNzUwNjU1Mn0.CSYtxU8u104ESeEzOCx5KVS4d1WVFBeCC65E_n-JXNQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The end of 2024 marks the end of four of the busiest years the climate and clean energy community has seen to date. I think it's safe to say the energy transition is in full swing (despite certain opinions <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/chris-wright-energy#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20climate%20crisis%2C%20and%20we%E2%80%99re%20not%20in%20the%20midst%20of%20an%20energy%20transition" target="_self"><u>to the contrary</u></a>), even if it's not yet on a glide path to a future that would avoid devastating climate impacts. </p><p>But with progress comes a new kind of conflict: infighting. Which climate solutions are the <em><em>best</em></em> climate solutions? How can we implement them the <em><em>right way?</em></em> When should other priorities, like affordability and national security, come first, if they should at all? Are those trade-offs even real? Or are they fossil fuel propaganda?</p><p>In a <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-climate-coalition-is-threatening-to-split-apart" target="_self"><u>fantastic piece</u></a> for Heatmap last year, researcher Joshua Lappen drew attention to this increasingly combative undercurrent in the climate coalition, inflamed by the debate over whether a <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-bill-manchin-barrasso-westerman" target="_self"><u>compromise on permitting reform</u></a> would be better for the climate in the long run than no reform at all. That fight — along with the related question of whether conservationists are slowing climate action — continued into 2024. But it wasn’t the only thing climate advocates fought about. Here are four debates that dominated the discourse this year that I think will continue into 2025.</p><h3>1. Will expanding U.S. liquefied natural gas exports help fight climate change or make it worse?</h3><p>Biden ignited a firestorm of controversy in January when he <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/26/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-temporary-pause-on-pending-approvals-of-liquefied-natural-gas-exports/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>paused approvals</u></a> of new liquefied natural gas export terminals until the Department of Energy could re-evaluate LNG’s potential economic and environmental impacts. The move followed protests from environmental groups that had named these facilities their number one climate bogeyman, arguing that new terminals would, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-13/natural-gas-export-projects-hang-in-the-balance-as-biden-mulls-climate-test" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bill McKibben put it</u></a>, “install our reliance on fossil fuels for decades to come.”</p><p>What followed was much back and forth about whether growing U.S. LNG exports would help or hurt efforts to stop climate change. To be sure, producing and burning natural gas releases planet-warming emissions. But past government and academic studies have found that exporting U.S. natural gas could result in lower global emissions overall by helping other countries replace dirtier fuels such as coal or natural gas from Russia, where the industry has much higher methane emissions. Environmentalists pushed back on that narrative, citing a <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/10/liquefied-natural-gas-carbon-footprint-worse-coal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> by Robert Howarth, a Cornell scientist, which found that producing and transporting LNG could be worse for the climate than coal. Critics then <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/a-major-paper-on-liquified-natural-gas-emissions-is-riddled-with-errors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pounced on Howarth's study</u></a>, accusing him of using flawed assumptions about upstream methane emissions, LNG tanker size, and shipping route distances. </p><p>Ultimately, calculating the emissions impact of increased LNG exports requires making <em><em>a lot</em></em> of assumptions. How can we know, for example, whether creating a cheap supply of natural gas will displace coal or deter adoption of renewables? As Arvind Ravikumar, an expert in energy emissions modeling, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self"><u>told my colleague Matthew Zeitlin</u></a>, “There’s no right answer. It depends on who buys, what time frame, which country, and how are they using LNG.”</p><p>A week before Christmas, the Biden administration finally put out its long-awaited study. It modeled a number of different scenarios, but found that approving additional LNG exports beyond what’s already in the pipeline would likely produce at least a small increase in emissions by 2050 in all of them. The report also found that demand from U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere would be met by projects that have already been approved, making additional plants “neither sustainable nor advisable,” as Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm wrote. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.aga.org/news/news-releases/aga-condemns-last-minute-lng-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>natural gas industry</u></a> and its <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/energy/u-s-chamber-comprehensive-new-s-p-global-analysis-demonstrates-importance-of-lng-exports" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supporters</u></a> were quick to question the results, and they’re about to have a much more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration. But the report gives activists a considerable weapon to use in future lawsuits if Trump tries to put LNG approvals on the fast track.</p><h3>2. Is the climate movement too obsessed with disinformation?</h3><p>I checked my phone after dinner one evening in August to find the members of climate X (formerly known as climate Twitter) suddenly at each other's throats over a <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/climate-disinformation-green-transition-workers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>provocative essay published in </u><u><em><em>Jacobin</em></em></u></a> titled “Obsessing Over Climate Disinformation Is a Wrong Turn.” Written by the environmental sociologist Holly Buck, the essay argues that too much focus on the oil and gas industry’s disinformation campaigns risks dismissing or overlooking legitimate concerns people have about the energy transition. “Fighting disinformation becomes a cheap hack for the hard work of listening to people and learning from them,” wrote Buck. “We have to put resources into a different sort of public engagement with climate change, one that sees publics as competent and nuanced rather than as susceptible marks for memes.”</p><p>The message struck a nerve. While many praised the essay, a number of prominent climate activists and journalists with large online followings attacked it, defending the urgency of combating disinformation and accusing Buck of setting up a false dichotomy between this work and public engagement. Aaron Regunberg, a former Rhode Island state representative and lawyer for the nonprofit Public Citizen, <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/climate-crisis-disinformation-fossil-fuels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote a response in </u><u><em><em>Jacobin</em></em></u></a> charging Buck with “arguing with a straw man” and not understanding how insidious the oil industry’s disinformation strategies are. </p><p>Buck tried to clarify her view in a <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/08/climate-disinformation-fossil-fuels-ngos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>followup piece</u></a>, asserting that she was not denying that disinformation was a “serious obstacle to climate action,” but rather that the act of “fighting disinformation” won’t solve what she sees as underlying problems working against the energy transition: the absence of an engagement apparatus that helps regular people understand their options, and a media ecosystem that “profits from our hate and division.”</p><p>What’s clear moving forward is that with a <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>clean energy </u></a>opponent entering the White House and a mega-billionaire who, with X, literally owns a chunk of the media ecosystem standing by his side, both disinformation and the framework that supports it will stay in the spotlight.</p><h3>3. Will data centers stall the energy transition?</h3><p>After remaining basically flat for two decades, U.S. electricity demand is set to grow by an average of 3% per year over the next five years, according to the <a href="https://gridstrategiesllc.com/wp-content/uploads/National-Load-Growth-Report-2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest forecast</u></a> from the energy policy consulting firm Grid Strategies. Domestic manufacturing will drive some of the demand, it predicts, but the majority will come from the buildout of data centers, “supercharged” by the rise of artificial intelligence.</p><p>On one hand, many of the companies building data centers have ambitious clean energy goals. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have signed landmark deals with advanced nuclear and geothermal power companies, helping to get first-of-a-kind deployments of these technologies financed. If those projects are successful, they could pave the way for cheaper, cleaner, 24/7 power for the rest of us. </p><p>But energy-hungry AI is already causing those tech giants to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-google-environmental-report-greenhouse-gases-emissions-3ccf95b9125831d66e676e811ece8a18" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fall behind on their targets</u></a> and driving major investments in fossil fuel infrastructure. My colleague Matthew Zeitlin has chronicled how electricity demand growth is making it harder to close <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/elgin-natural-gas-pjm" target="_self"><u>natural gas</u></a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/coal-gas-plant-retirements" target="_self"><u>coal plants</u></a> . In the states that data centers are flocking to, such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Texas, utilities are revising their integrated resource plans to <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/data-centers-want-clean-electricity-can-georgia-power-deliver-it" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increase the amount of natural gas generation</u></a> they expect to deliver. Exxon and Chevron are gearing up to build natural gas generation “behind the meter,” i.e. serving data centers directly, so they can meet demand more quickly than if they had to hook up to the grid. The gas pipeline company Williams is also planning a <a href="https://www.williams.com/2024/08/20/powering-up-meeting-energy-demand-across-the-mid-atlantic-and-southeast/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Southeast expansion</u></a> to serve data center demand. Energy equipment manufacturer GE Vernova is <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ge-vernova-natural-gas-ai" target="_self"><u>seeing orders for natural gas turbines skyrocket</u></a>. </p><p>There are layers to this debate. Should policymakers require hyperscalers to <a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/ai-additionality-framework" target="_self"><u>bring online new sources of clean energy</u></a> to power their data centers, or will that <a href="https://heatmap.news/ideas/abundance-additionality-permitting-reform" target="_self"><u>prove counterproductive</u></a> and “dampen investment in new industries” — a trade-off familiar to anyone following the <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>back-and-forth over clean hydrogen</u></a>? And is it possible that all the fuss about data center demand is <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-10-ai-data-centers" target="_self"><u>overblown</u></a>? Is there even a <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/189460/ai-data-centers-coal-fossil-fuels-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>business case for AI that supports this buildout</u></a>?</p><p>The incoming Trump administration has <a href="https://x.com/leezeldin/status/1856305964527350149" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promised</u></a> to “unleash U.S. energy dominance” and “make America the AI capital of the world,” so it’s likely this will continue to be one of the top questions for climate hawks for the foreseeable future. </p><h3>4. Are EVs tanking or taking off?</h3><p>The debate over the state of electric vehicle sales <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self"><u>didn’t start in 2024</u></a>, but headlines this year continued to sow confusion over whether or not EVs are catching on in the way climate advocates — and carmakers — hoped. </p><p>Each of the big three automakers, as well as most of the remaining companies serving North America, revised down their EV production plans this year, citing a waning market. In July, General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the company wasn’t going to hit its goal of producing a million EVs per year in North America by 2025. “We’re seeing a little bit of a slowdown here,” she <a href="https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1812943267023274012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said on CNBC</u></a>. “The market just isn’t developing. But we will get there.” Ford <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-ev-suv-canceled" target="_self"><u>cancelled plans</u></a> to produce an electric three-row SUV, delayed its release of an electric medium-sized pickup truck until 2027, and paused production of the F-150 Lightning, and has decided to shift its near-term focus to <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ford-maverick-hybrid-q1-sales" target="_self"><u>selling hybrids</u></a>. </p><p>Among non-U.S. automakers, Stellantis delayed the release of a new <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/744905/ram-1500-ramcharger-rev-delay/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EV Ram pickup truck</u></a> and will put out a hybrid version instead. Volkswagen delayed the North America release of an electric sedan. Several luxury automakers, including Aston Martin and Bentley, delayed the release of their first EVs until 2027. Mercedes-Benz once strived to have EVs make up 50% of its sales in 2025 — now it’s trying to hit that mark in 2030. Tesla sales also slowed significantly in the first half of the year. CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/738534/tesla-25000-car-robotaxi-musk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cancelled plans to build a new low-cost EV</u></a>.</p><p>But while sales numbers may not have met individual automakers’ expectations, overall sales continued to grow. “For every sign of an EV slowdown, another suggests an adolescent industry on the verge of its next growth spurt,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-28/the-slowdown-in-us-electric-vehicle-sales-looks-more-like-a-blip" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a> reported mid-way through the year. During the third quarter, GM saw record EV sales. Honda’s debut EV, the Prologue, jumped up the charts to become one of the top-selling offerings on the market. After looking at <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q3-2024-ev-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third quarter numbers</u></a>, Cox Automotive analysts opined that “a 10% [market] share is well within reach.”</p><p>We’ll have to see how Trump’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-kill-ev-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>plans to eliminate consumer subsidies for EVs</u></a> changes that outlook, but expect there to be plenty more fodder for debate.</p>

## Linda Lavin, Tony-winning Broadway actress who starred in sitcom 'Alice,' dies at 87

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Linda Lavin, a Tony Award-winning stage actress who became a working class icon as a paper-hat wearing waitress on the TV sitcom "Alice," has died. She was 87. 


Lavin died in Los Angeles on Sunday of complications from recently discovered lung cancer, her representative, Bill Veloric, told The Associated Press in an email. 


A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore," the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress. 


The title was shortened to "Alice" and Lavin became a role model for working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin singing the theme song "There's a New Girl in Town," ran from 1976 to 1985. 


The show turned "Kiss my grits" into a catchphrase and co-starred Polly Holliday as waitress Flo and Vic Tayback as the gruff owner and head chef of Mel's Diner. 


The series bounced around the CBS schedule during its first two seasons but became a hit leading into "All in the Family" on Sunday nights in October 1977. It was among primetime's top 10 series in four of the next five seasons. Variety magazine listed it among the all-time best workplace comedies. 


Lavin soon went on to win a Tony for best actress in a play for Neil Simon's "Broadway Bound" in 1987. 


She was working as recently as this month promoting a new Netflix series in which she appears, "No Good Deed," and filming a forthcoming Hulu series, "Mid-Century Modern," according to Deadline, which first reported her death. 


Lavin grew up in Portland, Maine, and moved to New York City after graduating from the College of William and Mary. She sang in nightclubs and in ensembles of shows. 


Iconic producer and director Hal Prince gave Lavin her first big break while directing the Broadway musical "It's a Bird ... It's a Plane ... It's Superman." She went on to earn a Tony nomination in Simon's "Last of the Red Hot Lovers" in 1969 before winning 18 years later for another Simon play, "Broadway Bound." 


In the mid 1970s, Lavin moved to Los Angeles. She had a recurring role on "Barney Miller" and in 1976 was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on Ellen Burstyn's Oscar-winning waitress comedy-drama, "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore." 


Back on Broadway, Lavin later starred Paul Rudnick's comedy "The New Century," had a concert show called "Songs & Confessions of a One-Time Waitress" and earned a Tony nomination in Donald Margulies' "Collected Stories." 


Michael Kuchwara of the AP gave Lavin a rave in "Collected Stories," writing that she "gives one of those complete, nuanced performances, capturing the woman's intellectual vigor, her wry sense of humor and her increasing physical frailty with astonishing fidelity. And Lavin's sense of timing is superb, whether delivering a joke or acerbically dissecting the work of her protegee." 


Lavin basked in a burst of renewed attention in her 70s, earning a Tony nomination for Nicky Silver's "The Lyons." She also starred in "Other Desert Cities" and a revival of "Follies" before they transferred to Broadway. 


The AP again raved about Lavin in "The Lyons," calling her "an absolute wonder to behold as Rita Lyons, a nag of a mother with a collection of firm beliefs and eye rolls, a matriarch who is both suffocating and keeping everyone at arm's length." 


She also appeared in the film "Wanderlust" with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, and released her first CD, "Possibilities." She played Jennifer Lopez's grandmother in "The Back-Up Plan." 


When asked for guidance from up-and-coming actresses, Lavin stressed one thing. "I say that what happened for me was that work brings work. As long as it wasn't morally reprehensible to me, I did it," she told the AP in 2011. 


She and Steve Bakunas, an artist, musician and her third husband, converted an old automotive garage into the 50-seat Red Barn Studio Theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina. 


It opened in 2007 and their productions include "Doubt" by John Patrick Shanley, "Glengarry Glen Ross" by David Mamet, "Rabbit Hole" by David Lindsay-Abaire and "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife" by Charles Busch, in which Lavin also starred on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination. 


She returned to TV in 2013 in "Sean Saves the World," starring "Will & Grace's" Sean Hayes, a show which lasted a season. Lavin also made appearances on "Mom" and "9JKL."

## Stock market today: Asian shares mixed after Wall Street slips, led by tech giants

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

Asian shares were mixed on Monday after stocks fell broadly on Friday as Wall Street closed out a holiday-shortened week on a down note. 


U.S. futures were lower while oil prices were little changed. 


In Asia, South Korea's Kospi added 0.6% to 2,418.80. But shares of Jeju Air Co. lost 8.8% after one of the company's jets skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence, and burst into flames Sunday in South Korea as its landing gear failed to deploy. 179 people died in the crash. 


Political turmoil continued as South Korean law enforcement officials requested a court warrant on Monday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. They are investigating whether his martial law decree on December 3 amounted to rebellion. 


Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.9% to 39,914.21 as the dollar gained against the Japanese yen, trading at 157.83 yen, up from 157.75 yen. The Tokyo market will wrap up trading for 2024 with a year-end ceremony as Japan begins its New Year holidays, the biggest festival of the year. 


The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 0.3% to 20,030.63 while the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.3% at 3,408.72. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dipped 0.9% to 8,191.50. 


On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.1% to 5,970.84. Roughly 90% of stocks in the benchmark index lost ground, but it managed to hold onto a modest gain of 0.7% for the week. 




The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% to 42,992.21. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.5%, to 19,722.03. 


The losses were made worse by sharp declines for the Big Tech stocks known as the "Magnificent 7," which can heavily influence the direction of the market because of their large size. 


A wide range of retailers also fell. Amazon fell 1.5% and Best Buy slipped 1.5%. The sector is being closely watched for clues on how it performed during the holiday shopping season. 


The S&P 500 gained nearly 3% over a 3-day stretch before breaking for the Christmas holiday. On Thursday, the index posted a small decline. 




Despite Friday's drop, the market is moving closer to another standout annual finish. The S&P 500 is on track for a gain of around 25% in 2024. That would mark a second consecutive yearly gain of more than 20%, the first time that has happened since 1997-1998. 


The gains have been driven partly by upbeat economic data showing that consumers continued spending and the labor market remained strong. Inflation, while still high, has also been steadily easing. 


A report on Friday showed that sales and inventory estimates for the wholesales trade industry fell 0.2% in November, following a slight gain in October. That weaker-than-expected report follows an update on the labor market Thursday that showed unemployment benefits held steady last week. 


The stream of upbeat economic data and easing inflation helped prompt a reversal in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy this year. Expectations for interest rate cuts also helped drive market gains. The central bank recently delivered its third cut to interest rates in 2024. 


Even though inflation has come closer to the central bank's target of 2%, it remains stubbornly above that mark and worries about it heating up again have tempered the forecast for more interest rate cuts. 


Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025, which include the labor market's path ahead and shifting economic policies under incoming President Donald Trump. Worries have risen that Trump's preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt, and difficulties for global trade. 


In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 1 cent to $70.61 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 1 cent to $73.78 per barrel. 


The euro fell to $1.0427 from $1.0433.

## Storm system spawns tornadoes across US, leading to 4 deaths

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

Officials assessed the damage on Sunday after a strong storm system moved across the southern United States over the weekend, spawning tornadoes and killing at least four people. 


There were at least 45 reports of tornado damage across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Crews will do damage surveys to confirm tornadoes. 


The storms during busy holiday travels caused some treacherous road conditions along with delays or cancellations at some of the busiest U.S. airports. As of Sunday afternoon, there were over 600 flight delays affecting Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the southern state of Georgia, according to flight tracker FlightAware. 


"It's not unheard of, but it is fairly uncommon to have a severe weather outbreak of this magnitude this late in the year," said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center. 


In the area of Houston, Texas, National Weather Service storm survey crews confirmed that at least five tornadoes hit north and south of the city on Saturday. 


At least one person died. The 48-year-old woman was found about 30 meters from her home in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. She said the exact cause of death wasn't immediately known. 


Four other people in Brazoria County had injuries that weren't considered critical, said Polston, adding that at least 40 homes and buildings were significantly damaged. 


In Montgomery County, north of Houston, about 30 homes were destroyed and about 50 others sustained major damage, county official Jason Smith said. 


In the state of North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on the pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said "it was just a freak accident" and he believed Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland, North Carolina, was killed instantly. 


"It's very sad, just terrible timing," Maffucci said, adding that the storms were responsible for a number of downed trees and "quite a few wrecks." 


Two people were killed in storms in Mississippi, officials said. An 18-year-old died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez in Adams County, said Emergency Management spokesperson Neifa Hardy. Two other people in the home were injured. 


Another person died in Lowndes County and at least eight more were injured across the state, officials said. 


The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. 


Storm damage also was reported in the northern Alabama city of Athens, northwest of Huntsville. 


Holly Hollman, spokeswoman for the city, said most of the damage from the early Sunday morning storms occurred downtown. She said it hurled large HVAC units from the tops of building and ripped the roof off a bookstore. A full-sized, stripped-down military helicopter was toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. 




"I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar," she said of the storm. "I think we are extremely lucky that we got hit late at night. If it had hit during the busy hours, I think we might have had some injuries and possibly some fatalities." 


As of Sunday afternoon, more than 40,000 people were still without power in Mississippi, according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Texas, Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia each had about 10,000 customers without power, it said. 


The storms closed some roads in western North Carolina, a region broadly devastated by Hurricane Helene this fall. That included part of U.S. 441, also known as the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, which closed north of Bryson City due to high winds. 


In Bumpus Cove, Tennessee, Justin Fromkin, president of Raising Hope Disaster Relief, worked Sunday to save what he could from the organization's supply tent — filled with clothes and food — after about 152 millimeters of rain fell. 


He's spent the past few months delivering aid to areas in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee that are still reeling from Helene. The ground in some parts of the mountains is still unstable from Helene, Fromkin said, and Sunday's downpour adds to the problem.

## World leaders react to death of former US President Jimmy Carter

date: 2024-12-30, from: VOA News USA

World leaders and U.S. politicians reacted to news that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who as president brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, has died at age 100.


US President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden


“Today, America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian.



Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well."


US Vice President Kamala Harris


“Throughout his life, President Carter was strengthened by the love and support of his partner of 77 years, First Lady Rosalynn Carter, whose life President Biden and I had the opportunity to celebrate in Georgia last year. After leaving office, President Carter continued his fight for peace, democracy, and human dignity through the Carter Center.


I had the privilege of knowing President Carter for years. I will always remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and legacy continue to inspire me — and will inspire generations to come. Our world is a better place because of President Carter.”


US President-elect Donald Trump


"The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.


Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers."


US Vice President-elect JD Vance


"Jimmy Carter dedicated his life to serving this country. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones. May he Rest in Peace."


Former US President Barack Obama


“Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did — advocating for the public good, consequences be damned. He believed some things were more important than reelection — things like integrity, respect, and compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God’s image. ...


Maranatha Baptist Church will be a little quieter on Sundays, but President Carter will never be far away — buried alongside Rosalynn next to a willow tree down the road, his memory calling all of us to heed our better angels. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Carter family, and everyone who loved and learned from this remarkable man.”


Former US President George W. Bush


"Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to Jack, Chip, Jeff, Amy, and the entire Carter family.


James Earl Carter, Jr., was a man of deeply held convictions. He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations."


Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton


"From his commitment to civil rights as a state senator and governor of Georgia; to his efforts as President to protect our natural resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, make energy conservation a national priority, return the Panama Canal to Panama, and secure peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David; to his post-Presidential efforts at the Carter Center supporting honest elections, advancing peace, combating disease, and promoting democracy; to his and Rosalynn’s devotion and hard work at Habitat for Humanity — he worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world."


Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi 


"In this moment of sorrow, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of former American President Jimmy Carter, as well as to the President and the people of the United States of America. 


His significant role in achieving the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel will remain etched in the annals of history, and his humanitarian work exemplifies a lofty standard of love, peace, and brotherhood. His enduring legacy ensures that he will be remembered as one of the world's most prominent leaders in service to humanity."   


US Secretary of State Antony Blinken 


"Throughout decades of public service, President Carter embodied integrity, compassion, and a commitment to advancing the freedom, security, and welfare of others. 


He channeled that spirit in his foreign policy, from negotiating the return of the Panama Canal to its host nation, to developing arms control agreements with the Soviet Union. And he brought it to his every exchange and conversation, from heads of state to ordinary citizens. 


President Carter also showed us what can be achieved through tireless and principled diplomacy, mediating a landmark deal with Israel and Egypt that helped forge peace between two nations that had spent decades at war. His efforts are an important reminder of what’s possible, especially amidst renewed conflict and suffering in the region." 


Britain's King Charles 


"It was with great sadness that I learned of the death of former President Carter. He was a committed public servant and devoted his life to promoting peace and human rights. 


His dedication and humility served as an inspiration to many, and I remember with great fondness his visit to the United Kingdom in 1977. 


My thoughts and prayers are with President Carter's family and the American people at this time."   


Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 


"Jimmy Carter’s legacy is one of compassion, kindness, empathy, and hard work. He served others both at home and around the world his entire life — and he loved doing it. He was always thoughtful and generous with his advice to me. My deepest condolences to the Carter family, his many loved ones, and the American people who are mourning a former President and a lifelong humanitarian. May his selfless service continue to inspire us all for years to come." 


Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino 


"I offer my condolences to the family and to the people and Government of the United States on the death of former President Jimmy Carter. His stint in the White House was marked by difficult times, and were crucial for Panama in negotiating and signing the Torrijos-Carter Treaties in 1977, which transferred the (Panama) Canal into Panamanian hands and made our country truly sovereign. May his soul rest in peace.”   


Venezuelan Government of President Nicolas Maduro 


"The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela regrets the death of former President of the United States of America, Jimmy Carter, and extends its most sincere condolences to his family and friends. 


Former President Carter was a man of proven commitment to peace and dialog. His contributions to global politics and his dedication to peace have left an indelible mark on the world." 


French President Emmanuel Macron


"Throughout his life, Jimmy Carter has been a steadfast advocate for the rights of the most vulnerable and has tirelessly fought for peace. France sends its heartfelt thoughts to his family and to the American people."


Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese 


"President Carter rose from humble beginnings to leave a remarkable legacy. Beyond being elected to the Presidency or being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, Jimmy Carter's legacy is best measured in lives changed, saved and uplifted.” 


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 


“We express our heartfelt condolences to the American people and to the family of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on his passing. He was a leader who served during a time when Ukraine was not yet independent, yet his heart stood firmly with us in our ongoing fight for freedom. 


He devoted his life to promoting peace in the world and defending human rights. Today, let us remember: peace matters, and the world must remain united in standing against those who threaten these values." 


Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel 


"Condolences to the people and the government of the U.S., and especially the family of President James Carter. Our people remember with gratitude his efforts to better relations, his visits to #Cuba and his speaking out in favor of the release of the Five." 


US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer


"Today, we mourn the loss of one of our most humble and devoted public servants, President Jimmy Carter.


President Carter personified the true meaning of leadership through service, through compassion, and through integrity.


From his legacy as president, to his dedication to improving human rights across the globe, and his tireless efforts alongside his wife Rosalynn, in building a better world through Habitat for Humanity, he inspired millions with his unwavering commitment to justice and equality."


British Prime Minister Keir Starmer


"I was very sorry to hear of President Carter's passing and I would like to pay tribute to his decades of selfless public service.


His presidency will be remembered for the historic Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, and it was that lifelong dedication to peace that saw him receive the Nobel Peace prize.


Motivated by his strong faith and values, President Carter redefined the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and human rights at home and abroad."


US Senator Mitch McConnell


“Elaine and I join the Senate and the nation in mourning the passing of our 39th president, Jimmy Carter.


“President Carter served during times of tension and uncertainty, both at home and abroad. But his calm spirit and deep faith seemed unshakeable. Jimmy Carter served as our commander-in-chief for four years, but he served as the beloved, unassuming Sunday school teacher at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia for forty. And his humble devotion leaves us little doubt which of those two important roles he prized the most."


US House Speaker Mike Johnson


“Today, the thoughts of Americans and the prayers of Congress are lifted up on behalf of the Carter family. President Carter’s story was one of humble beginnings, and his life is a testament to the boundless opportunities available in this great nation. Because of his work in brokering the Camp David Accords and his advocacy with Habitat for Humanity, the world is a more peaceful place, and more Americans have a place to call home. No one can deny that President Carter led an extraordinary life of service to his country. May he rest in peace.”


US Representative Mike Turner


“I am deeply saddened to learn about the death of President Jimmy Carter. President Carter was a man of integrity who was guided by his faith. I join all Americans in saluting President Carter for his lifetime of service, first as a naval officer, then as a senator in the Georgia State Senate, then as Governor of Georgia, and, finally, as President of the United States. I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Carter family.”


US Senator Mark Warner


"President Carter will be remembered by what he built and left behind for us – a model of service late into life, a tireless devotion to family and philanthropy, and a more peaceful world to call home."


US Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin


“Jimmy Carter proved that excellence in public service can extend beyond the White House. His life was an inspiration to those of us who aspire to lead a life of service."

## Key moments in the life of Jimmy Carter

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Jimmy Carter's 1977-1981 presidency included successes like the Camp David peace accords, but also enough controversy for U.S. voters to see him as weak — and send him packing after only one term.


Carter's legacy, however, was largely built on his post-presidency, the longest in U.S. history.


Here are a few key moments in the life of Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100.


The Panama Canal


During his first year in office, Carter went back on a campaign promise and decided to hand back management of the Panama Canal — which had been in U.S. military control since its construction at the start of the 20th century.


"Fairness, and not force, should lie at the heart of our dealings with the nations of the world," he said at the signing of the canal treaties with Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos on September 7, 1977.


Carter was ridiculed for the move, which gave Panama control over the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the end of 1999.


History, however, has looked upon the deal as a deft bit of diplomacy.  


Giving Panama a meatier role in the canal's management in the run-up to the transfer allowed for stability and broke with America's image as an overbearing imperialist power in Latin America.


Morality in politics


Upon his arrival in the Oval Office, Carter looked to distance himself from the realpolitik practiced by his predecessors — a vestige of the Cold War — and placed human rights at the heart of his agenda.


"Our principal goal is to help shape a world which is more responsive to the desire of people everywhere for economic well-being, social justice, political self-determination and basic human rights," he said in a 1978 speech at the U.S. Naval Academy.


In concrete terms, Carter notably signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1977. It was eventually ratified by the United States in 1992 after being blocked for years by the Senate.


Camp David Accords  


In September 1978, Carter invited Israeli Premier Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Camp David, the presidential retreat outside Washington.


After 13 days of secret negotiations under Carter's mediation, two accords were signed that ultimately led to a peace treaty the following year.  


The diplomatic triumph was cited when Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.


Crisis of confidence


In the summer of 1979, the economy rocked by inflation and his approval rating in free fall, Carter addressed the American people in a nationwide televised speech on July 15.


In that half-hour, he responded to his critics on his lack of leadership, instead laying the blame on a national "crisis of confidence."


"The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America," he said.


The speech was poorly received and would come back to haunt him. Five cabinet members resigned that week.


Iran hostage crisis


The hostage crisis — more than 50 Americans were held for 444 days at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran from November 1979 to January 1981 — was the death knell for Carter's presidency.


A failed military rescue mission in April 1980 all but extinguished his chances of reelection later that year.


Operation Eagle Claw was thwarted by sandstorms and mechanical problems — eventually, the mission was aborted. In the subsequent withdrawal, two American aircraft collided, killing eight servicemen.


In the following days, then secretary of state Cyrus Vance resigned, and the mission's failure symbolized Carter's inability to resolve the crisis.


The hostages were eventually freed on the same day that Republican Ronald Reagan took office, after thumping Carter at the polls in November 1980.


The Carter Center


Carter remained extremely active into his 90s despite his retirement from political life.


In 1982, he founded the Carter Center, which has focused on conflict resolution, promoting democracy and human rights, and fighting disease.


Carter — often viewed as America's most successful former president — traveled extensively, supervising elections from Haiti to East Timor, and tackling thorny global problems as a mediator.


The Elders


Carter was also a member of The Elders, a group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007 to promote peace and human rights.


Fellow Nobel peace laureates South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu (who died in 2021), former Liberian President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson and the late U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also belonged to the group.

## Former US President Jimmy Carter dies at 100

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Atlanta, Georgia  — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted numerous interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in the White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in this report.


Former President Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer and Georgia state governor before becoming president, has died at the age of 100.


When Carter took the oath of office as president of the United States on January 20, 1977, he promised a "government as good as its people."


He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his defeat in the 1980 general election.


But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the beginning of a new life, traveling the world "fighting disease, building hope, and waging peace."




"It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and gratification," he told VOA.


As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than 80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.


"I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt. We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama Canal treaty," he said. "So what I have done since then has been kind of an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?"


United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Carter’s “commitment to international peace and human rights.


“President Carter will be remembered for his solidarity with the vulnerable, his abiding grace, and his unrelenting faith in the common good and our common humanity,” Guterres said in a statement. “His legacy as a peacemaker, human rights champion and humanitarian will endure.”


The White House released a statement from President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Sunday: “Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.”


Biden also declared January 9, 2025, as a National Day of Mourning in honor of Carter and directed flags at public buildings to be displayed at half-staff for 30 days.


President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.”




Carter's journey to the White House began in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924.


After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business.


He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia legislator before becoming the state's 76th governor from 1971 to 1975.


In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter narrowly defeated Ford to become president.


The high point of Carter's presidency came in 1978. Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a peace treaty.


"When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership supported by the Soviet Union," he said. "They were the only country that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever been violated."


Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.




But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter's administration turned to Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government of the U.S. backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where he received treatment for cancer.


On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage. Thirteen were released weeks later but what was referred to by the U.S. as the hostage crisis extended through the rest of Carter's presidency.


Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying members of the U.S. military's elite Delta Force, were to fly from there to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran.


"The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier. Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes," he said.




The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their administration.


"When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that was just ... we were just morose that day and for some time after that," Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the operation.


The failure of the mission damaged Carter's credibility with the American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980 presidential election and contributed to Carter's defeat to challenger Ronald Reagan.


"The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day," Carter said. "Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me to fail."




The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president.


In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were initially modest.


"I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help them mediate the dispute and stop a war," he said.


The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80 troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting disease in the poorest parts of the planet.


In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his legacy wasn't his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize, but the eradication of Guinea worm disease.


"There's only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever eradicated, and that was smallpox,” he said, “So Guinea worm is going to soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the earth."


Thanks to Carter’s efforts, there were only 13 cases of Guinea worm recorded in 2022.


Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer in 2015.


Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years.


Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023.




In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA his hopes for the Carter Center’s future.


“I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,” he said. “If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the country I love very much.”


Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House, and his 76-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any president and first lady.


Though his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home in Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the pages of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It includes his memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the Middle East, and a collection of his favorite poems.

## 'Sonic 3' and 'Mufasa' battle for No. 1 at holiday box office

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Two family films dominated the holiday box office this week, with “Sonic the Hedgehog 3” winning the three-day weekend over “Mufasa” by a blue hair.


Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while “Mufasa” brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s “Mufasa” had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million.


It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of “Wicked” and “Moana 2,” which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively.


The vampire horror “Nosferatu” also debuted triumphantly. Robert Eggers’ modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown,” with Timothée Chalamet; the erotic drama “Babygirl” with Nicole Kidman; and “The Fire Inside,” about boxer Claressa Shields.


“Nosferatu” landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting “The Faculty's” $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters. 


It was a gamble to open “Nosferatu” on Christmas, when family films or all-ages blockbusters tend to be prioritized. But it paid off, attracting the coveted 18 to 34-year-old demographic to theaters.


“It was a risky move, but we knew that we had such a great film,” said Lisa Bunnell, who leads distribution for Focus Features. “A lot of people thought we were insane. But I think the more that people thought we were crazy, the more we all felt like it was the right thing to do.”


The response to the unconventional counterprogramming was gratifying. The sarcophagus-inspired popcorn buckets are even reselling for over $100.


“People keep talking about ‘how do we get people back into the movies?’ I think the only way you can get people to go back is to shake it up,” Bunnell said. “You don’t just spoon feed them the same things over and over again.”


The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race.


“Babygirl,” an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival.


“The Fire Inside,” from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend shows where it played in 2006 theaters.


Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to “Wicked,” which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It’s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits.


“Moana 2” rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically.

Christmas Day itself was massive for the industry, with $61 million in ticket sales. Thursday was nearly as big, with $50 million.


“Every day was like Saturday at the box office because of the way the holidays lined up," said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's senior media analyst.


Comscore is projecting that the year will net out with about $8.75 billion in domestic box office receipts. That's down about 3.3% from last year, which cracked $9 billion, and the pre-pandemic normal of $11 billion.


Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, are:


1. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $38 million.

2. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $37.1 million.

3. “Nosferatu,” $21.2 million.

4. “Wicked,” $19.5 million.

5. “Moana 2,” $18.2 million.

6. “A Complete Unknown,” $11.6 million.

7. “Babygirl,” $4.4 million.

8. “Gladiator II,” $4.2 million.

9. “Homestead,” $3.2 million.

10. “The Fire Inside,” $2 million.

## Will New Year's Eve be loud or quiet? What are the top 2025 resolutions?

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

New york — If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone.


A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year’s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.


“As I’ve gotten older over the last few years, it’s like if I don’t make it to midnight, it’s not a big deal, you know?” says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa.


Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member’s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found.


But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way — by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025.


There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don’t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024.


Relaxed New Year's Eve plans for many


Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key.


“A majority of who I’ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don’t know what they’re going to do because they haven’t found anything or things are just really expensive,” she said. “Party packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.”


As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event — about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults — 60 and above — say they won’t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all.


Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland.


“I don’t do anything too crazy for New Year’s, usually. So this is definitely a change,” he said. “I wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.”


Woods will be working New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues.


“Holidays are really hard for people, so I don’t mind working,” she said. “I’m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.”


Younger Americans are more likely to make a resolution


Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year’s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board — about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025.


Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care — more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. “It’s probably a good year to focus on mental health,” he said.


Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health.


Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: “Probably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week — get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That’s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.”


Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. “Mental health is the new one, but I think it’s high up there as well as with regular health,” she said.


She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: “I don’t know if that’s really a resolution, but that’s a goal that I’m setting.”


And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do.


This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. “Hockey’s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,” she said.

## Tornadoes in Texas, Mississippi kill 2 and injure 6 as severe weather system moves east

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Houston, Texas — A strong storm system threatened to whip up tornadoes in parts of the U.S. Southeast on Sunday, a day after severe weather claimed at least two lives as twisters touched down in Texas and Mississippi. 


The National Weather Service's severe storm tracker indicated the system was moving east through Alabama into Georgia shortly before 4 a.m. The agency issued severe thunder storm warnings with the possibility of tornadoes in western Georgia, the northwestern tip of Florida and elsewhere. 


On Saturday, one person died in the Liverpool area, located south of Houston, Texas. Four people suffered injuries that were not considered critical, according to Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. 


There were "multiple touchdown points" in the county between Liverpool, Hillcrest Village and Alvin. Officials knew of around 10 damaged homes but were working to determine the extent of the damage, Polston said. 


In Mississippi, one person died in Adams County and two people were injured in Franklin County, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. 


The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. 


It appeared at least six tornadoes touched down in the Houston area, though more may be discovered when crews go out to survey the damage. There was damage in the area from both tornadoes and straight-line winds, according to Josh Lichter, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. 


North of Houston, mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in Katy and Porter Heights, where the doors of a fire station were blown in, the weather service said. 


Storm damage has been reported in the northern Alabama town of Athens, just northwest of Huntsville. A National Weather Service survey team was expected to begin assessing damage Sunday morning, said meteorologist Chelly Amin. 


Also Sunday, the National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm warnings across portions of the Deep South as the line of storms barreled east through Alabama, Georgia and into South Carolina. Wind gusts of 60 mph (97 kph) were expected in the Spartanburg, South Carolina, area. Damage to trees and powerlines was expected in a number of counties, while a tornada watch was in effect for some parts of the state. 


At 9 a.m. Sunday ET, nearly 65,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, down from 93,000 around 1 a.m., according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Some 54,000 customers were without power in Georgia; 36,000, Alabama; 20,000, Louisiana; and 13,000, Texas.

## North Korea's Kim vows toughest anti-US policy before Trump takes office

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he will implement the "toughest" anti-U.S. policy, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president, the country's state media reported Sunday.


Trump's return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Many experts however say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say.


During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party that ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. "the most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy." Kim said that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into "a nuclear military bloc for aggression."


"This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how," Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.


It said Kim's speech "clarified the strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively" by North Korea for its long-term national interests and security.


KCNA didn't elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of North Korean soldiers.


The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim "fell in love." But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North.


North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals.


Further complicating efforts to get North Korea to rid itself of nuclear weapons is its deepening military cooperation with Russia.


According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles.


Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.


Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington's "unchangeable" hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats.

## AI technology helps level playing field for students with disabilities

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

For Makenzie Gilkison, spelling is such a struggle that a word like rhinoceros might come out as "rineanswsaurs" or sarcastic as "srkastik." 


The 14-year-old from suburban Indianapolis can sound out words, but her dyslexia makes the process so draining that she often struggles with comprehension.


"I just assumed I was stupid," she recalled of her early grade school years. 


But assistive technology powered by artificial intelligence has helped her keep up with classmates. Last year, Makenzie was named to the National Junior Honor Society. She credits a customized AI-powered chatbot, a word prediction program and other tools that can read for her. 


"I would have just probably given up if I didn't have them," she said. 


New tech; countless possibilities


Artificial intelligence holds the promise of helping countless  students with a range of visual, speech, language and hearing impairments to execute tasks that come easily to others. Schools everywhere have been wrestling with how and where to incorporate AI, but many are fast-tracking applications for students with disabilities. 


Getting the latest technology into the hands of students with disabilities is a priority for the U.S. Education Department, which has told schools they must consider whether students need tools like text-to-speech and alternative communication devices. New rules from the Department of Justice also will require schools and other government entities to make apps and online content accessible to those with disabilities. 


There is concern about how to ensure students using it — including those with disabilities — are still learning. 


Students can use artificial intelligence to summarize jumbled thoughts into an outline, summarize complicated passages, or even translate Shakespeare into common English. And computer-generated voices that can read passages for visually impaired and dyslexic students are becoming less robotic and more natural. 


"I'm seeing that a lot of students are kind of exploring on their own, almost feeling like they've found a cheat code in a video game," said Alexis Reid, an educational therapist in the Boston area who works with students with learning disabilities. But in her view, it is far from cheating: "We're meeting students where they are." 


Programs fortify classroom lessons 


Ben Snyder, a 14-year-old freshman from Larchmont, New York, who was recently diagnosed with a learning disability, has been increasingly using AI to help with homework. 


"Sometimes in math, my teachers will explain a problem to me, but it just makes absolutely no sense," he said. "So if I plug that problem into AI, it'll give me multiple different ways of explaining how to do that." 


He likes a program called Question AI. Earlier in the day, he asked the program to help him write an outline for a book report — a task he completed in 15 minutes that otherwise would have taken him an hour and a half because of his struggles with writing and organization. But he does think using AI to write the whole report crosses a line. 


"That's just cheating," Ben said. 


Schools weigh pros, cons 


Schools have been trying to balance the technology's benefits against the risk that it will do too much. If a special education plan sets reading growth as a goal, the student needs to improve that skill. AI can't do it for them, said Mary Lawson, general counsel at the Council of the Great City Schools. 


But the technology can help level the playing field for students with disabilities, said Paul Sanft, director of a Minnesota-based center where families can try out different assistive technology tools and borrow devices. 


"There are definitely going to be people who use some of these tools in nefarious ways. That's always going to happen," Sanft said. "But I don't think that's the biggest concern with people with disabilities, who are just trying to do something that they couldn't do before." 


Another risk is that AI will track students into less rigorous courses of study. And, because it is so good at identifying patterns, AI might be able to figure out a student has a disability. Having that disclosed by AI and not the student or their family could create ethical dilemmas, said Luis Perez, the disability and digital inclusion lead at CAST, formerly the Center for Applied Specialized Technology. 


Schools are using the technology to help students who struggle academically, even if they do not qualify for special education services. In Iowa, a new law requires students deemed not proficient — about a quarter of them — to get an individualized reading plan. As part of that effort, the state's education department spent $3 million on an AI-driven personalized tutoring program. When students struggle, a digital avatar intervenes. 


Educators anticipate more tools 


The U.S. National Science Foundation is funding AI research and development. One firm is developing tools to help children with speech and language difficulties. Called the National AI Institute for Exceptional Education, it is headquartered at the University of Buffalo, which did pioneering work on handwriting recognition that helped the U.S. Postal Service save hundreds of millions of dollars by automating processing. 


"We are able to solve the postal application with very high accuracy. When it comes to children's handwriting, we fail very badly," said Venu Govindaraju, the director of the institute. He sees it as an area that needs more work, along with speech-to-text technology, which isn't as good at understanding children's voices, particularly if there is a speech impediment. 


Sorting through the sheer number of programs developed by education technology companies can be a time-consuming challenge for schools. Richard Culatta, CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education, said the nonprofit launched an effort this fall to make it easier for districts to vet what they are buying and ensure it is accessible. 


Mother sees potential


Makenzie wishes some of the tools were easier to use. Sometimes a feature will inexplicably be turned off, and she will be without it for a week while the tech team investigates. The challenges can be so cumbersome that some students resist the technology entirely. 


But Makenzie's mother, Nadine Gilkison, who works as a technology integration supervisor at Franklin Township Community School Corporation in Indiana, said she sees more promise than downside. 


In September, her district rolled out chatbots to help special education students in high school. She said teachers, who sometimes struggled to provide students the help they needed, became emotional when they heard about the program. Until now, students were reliant on someone to help them, unable to move ahead on their own. 


"Now we don't need to wait anymore," she said.

## What is the Native American Church and why is peyote sacred to members?

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

The Native American Church is considered the most widespread religious movement among the Indigenous people of North America. It holds sacred the peyote cactus, which grows naturally only in some parts of southern Texas and northern Mexico. Peyote has been used spiritually in ceremonies, and as a medicine by Native American people for millennia.


It contains several psychoactive compounds, primarily mescaline, which is a hallucinogen. Different tribes of peyote people have their own name for the cactus. While it is still a controlled substance, U.S. laws passed in 1978 and 1994 allow Native Americans to use, harvest and transport peyote. However, these laws only allow federally recognized Native American tribes to use the substance and don't apply to the broader group of Indigenous people in the United States.




The Native American Church developed into a distinct way of life around 1885 among the Kiowa and Comanche of Oklahoma. After 1891, it began to spread as far north as Canada. Now, more than 50 tribes and 400,000 people practice it. In general, the peyotist doctrine espouses belief in one supreme God who deals with humans through various spirits that then carry prayers to God. In many tribes, the peyote plant itself is a deity, personified as Peyote Spirit.


Why was the Native American Church incorporated? 


The Native American Church is not one unified entity like, say, the Catholic Church. It contains a diversity of tribes, beliefs and practices. Peyote is what unifies them. After peyote was banned by U.S. government agents in 1888 and later by 15 states, Native American tribes began incorporating as individual Native American Churches in 1918.


In order to preserve the peyote ceremony, the federal and state governments encouraged Native American people to organize as a church, said Darrell Red Cloud, the great-great grandson of Chief Red Cloud of the Lakota Nation and vice president of the Native American Church of North America.


In the following decades, the religion grew significantly, with several churches bringing Jesus Christ's name and image into the church so their congregations and worship would be accepted, said Steve Moore, who is non-Native and was formerly a staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund.


"Local religious leaders in communities would see the image of Jesus, a Bible or cross on the wall of the meeting house or tipi and they would hear references to Jesus in the prayers or songs," he said. "That probably helped persuade the authorities that the Native people were in the process of transformation to Christianity."


This persecution of peyote people continued even after the formation of the Native American Church, said Frank Dayish Jr. a former Navajo Nation vice president and chairperson for the Council of the Peyote Way of Life Coalition.


In the 1960s, there were laws prohibiting peyote in the Navajo Nation, he said. Dayish remembers a time during that period when police confiscated peyote from his church, poured gasoline on the plants and set them on fire.


"I remember my dad and other relatives went over and saved the green peyote that didn't burn," he said, adding that it took decades of lobbying until an amendment to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1994 permitted members of federally recognized Native American tribes to use peyote for religious purposes.


How is peyote used in the Native American Church? 


Peyote is the central part of a ceremony that takes place in a tipi around a crescent-shaped earthen altar mound and a sacred fire. The ceremony typically lasts all night and includes prayer, singing, the sacramental eating of peyote, water rites and spiritual contemplation.




Morgan Tosee, a member of the Comanche Nation who leads ceremonies within the Comanche Native American Church, said peyote is utilized in the context of prayer — not smoked — as many tend to imagine.


"When we use it, we either eat it dry or grind it up," he said. "Sometimes, we make tea out of it. But, we don't drink it like regular tea. You pray with it and take little sips, like you would take medicine."


Tosee echoes the belief that pervades the church: "If you take care of the peyote, it will take care of you."


"And if you believe in it, it will heal you," he said, adding that he has seen the medicine work, healing people with various ailments.


People treat the trip to harvest peyote as a pilgrimage, said Red Cloud. Typically, prayers and ceremonies take place before the pilgrimage to seek blessings for a good journey. Once they get to the peyote gardens, they would touch the ground and thank the Creator before harvesting the medicine. The partaking of peyote is also accompanied by prayer and ceremony. The mescaline in the peyote plant is viewed as God's spirit, Red Cloud said.


"Once we eat it, the sacredness of the medicine is inside of us and it opens the spiritual eye," he said. "From there, we start to see where the medicine is growing. It shows itself to us. Once we complete the harvest, we bring it back home and have another ceremony to the medicine and give thanks to the Creator."

## Virginia zoo welcomes newborn pygmy hippopotamus as year ends

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

richmond, virginia — A female pygmy hippopotamus delivered a healthy calf at the Metro Richmond Zoo earlier this month, officials said — the third baby hippo born at the zoo within the past five years. 


The mother, Iris, gave birth to the female calf on December 9 following a seven-month gestation, zoo officials said. The newborn, who has yet to be named, is the third calf for Iris and the father, Corwin.


One of the calves born previously was also a December baby, the zoo said.


"Most people don't get a hippopotamus for Christmas at all, so we feel lucky to have received two over the years," zoo officials said in a news release Tuesday. 


Five days after her birth, the baby had a neonatal exam and weighed 6.8 kilograms. Officials said that fully grown pygmy hippos can weigh up to 270 kilograms. 


According to the Richmond-area zoo, pygmy hippos are an endangered West African species, and only 2,500 mature hippos remain in the wild. Officials said pygmy hippos are distinctive from regular hippos because they do not live in groups and are usually solitary or in pairs. 


"For this reason, once Iris' two previous calves grew up, they were moved to other zoological facilities to live with future mates and continue contributing to the conservation of their species," the news release said.

## Elaborate holiday light displays are making spirits bright in a big way

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

CONCORD, New Hampshire — Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow might be enough to brighten some homes this holiday season. But others are adorned with thousands of blinking lights synched to blasting music, drawing crowds and bolstering both holiday and community spirit. 


In a cul-de-sac in Mesa, Arizona, 14 homeowners have been going all out on holiday lights for the last 30 years in a tradition that hasn't been diminished by real estate turnover. 


Those buying homes in the neighborhood often find the attics full of decor left behind as a gift from the previous owners, and despite cultural and religious differences, residents come together to create a festival of lights, Stephanie Castillo Price said. 




"Everybody has been able to take their interpretation of the holidays and put it into a full circle," she said. "There's not somebody that's going to walk down the street and not feel included." 


In Santa Clarita, California, residents of Wakefield Court decided to coordinate their holiday light displays as a way to bring some joy to their community after an earthquake. Now in its 30th year, the Wakefield Winter Wonderland includes inflatable figures and wooden cutouts of a variety of characters, from Mickey Mouse to Homer Simpson. 


Bryan Cobb admits he initially was against buying a home in the neighborhood when he and his wife first viewed it. 


"She started crying and said, 'But this is the Christmas street! I want to live there!' " he said. "She got her way. We live here, we love it. All the neighbors bond together." 


In Edmond, Oklahoma, those looking to the western sky will easily spot the Miranda family's elaborate holiday light display featuring images and music from the movie "Wicked." Spotlights reminiscent of movie studio lights shoot up from the roof, while a singing witch's face takes shape across a towering tree. 


"It just seemed like the perfect fit with a light show because you can really do the drama with the lights," said Elisabeth Miranda, who handles the programming while her husband, Mark, tackles installation. "It takes a very long time to set up. Every single bulb has a spot, a place, a number, so that when we program it, it does exactly what it needs to do at the right time." 




The family started putting up holiday lights in 2015 and saw a surge in traffic after being featured on ABC's "The Great Christmas Light Fight." While most neighbors have been supportive, a few complaints prompted the couple to take a few years off before returning with a better plan to limit viewing hours and control traffic. 


This year, they are collecting donations for the Oklahoma Fraternal Order of Police. 


"They give so much back to our community, so that's our little way of saying thank you to them for everything they do for us," Miranda said. 


Charity also is a component in Las Vegas, where Laura Walters and Lenny Standish are closing in on a four-year goal of collecting 10,000 pairs of socks and underwear for organizations that help homeless people. 


Their display started during the COVID-19 pandemic with a single Christmas tree for community members to add ornaments. This year, they have three snow machines in addition to the lights and music. 


"People are looking for joy," Walters said. "Our world is a tough place. So to be able to just come and feel just an incredible amount of love and happiness — it's peaceful. We've never had one problem here at all. Everyone's been highly respectful of our home and full of gratitude." 


Richard Taylor of Kennesaw, Georgia, estimates that more than 40,000 people visit his display of 1.2 million lights each year. 


"We bring joy to a lot of people," he said. "They walk around and they forget all their problems, and they just enjoy themselves."

## Abortions more common in US, as women turn to pills, travel

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Abortion has become more common despite bans or deep restrictions in most Republican-controlled states, and the legal and political fights over its future are not over yet.


It's now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement bans.


The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.


Here's a look at data on where things stand:


Abortions are more common than before Dobbs 


Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman obtain abortions in the United States.


One thing it hasn't done is put a dent in the number of abortions being obtained.


There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022 ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero.


"Abortion bans don’t actually prevent abortions from happening," said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of California San Francisco.


For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting abortions — and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant women are least likely to be able to get them when they want.


For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are through travel or abortion pills.


Pills become bigger part of equation — and legal questions 


As the bans happened, abortion pills became a bigger part of the equation.


They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More recently, it’s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute.


The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination of two drugs, was underway before the ruling.




But now, it's become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions were via pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.


As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion access.


This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine. There's also an effort by Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as "controlled dangerous substances," and a push for the federal government to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them.




Travel for abortion has increased 


Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans.


A network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where they're legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now common.


The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas residents obtained abortions in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as Kansans.


Abortion funds, which benefitted from "rage giving" in 2022, helped pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap how much they can give.


The ban that took effect in Florida this year has been a game-changer


Florida, the nation’s third most-populous state, began on May 1 enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy.


That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for other Southerners seeking abortions to an exporter of people looking for them.


There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were 35% fewer.


While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor.


Clinics have opened or expanded in some places 


The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states.


But some states where abortion remains legal until viability – generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy — have seen clinics open and expand.


Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics.


There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers.


Myers said some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So, they’re now in the count of clinics – even though they might provide few of them.


Lack of access to abortions during emergencies threatens patients' lives 


How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned.


President Joe Biden's administration said hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration’s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho.


More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records.


Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died.


"It is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department," Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.

## North Korea launches 'toughest' US strategy during key party meeting

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a key policy-setting meeting of the country's ruling party last week ahead of the new year, state media KCNA reported on Sunday. 


The meeting of party and government officials decided that North Korea would launch the "toughest" strategy to counteract the United States for its security and national interests, the report said, without elaborating. 


The alliance between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan has expanded to a "nuclear military bloc" and South Korea has become an "anti-communist outpost" for the U.S., the KCNA report added. 


"This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how," it said. 


The December 23-27 meeting also reviewed the handling of floods earlier this year, including the plan that brought those affected to Pyongyang, the capital, according to the report. 


The reclusive state also vowed to promote relations with "friendly" countries during the meeting. 


Kim also called for progress in defense, science and technology to bolster the country's war deterrence.  


Such meetings often last a few days and have been used in recent years to make key policy announcements. 


In a reshuffle, Pyongyang named Pak Thae Song, a party secretary, as a new premier to replace Kim Tok Hun. 


Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was named a member of the powerful Politburo of the party's Central Committee. 


The 11th plenary session of the eighth central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea wraps up a year in which Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit with Kim and signed a deal that included a mutual defense pledge. 


Washington and Seoul have criticized the two countries' military cooperation, including what they say is a dispatch of North Korean troops to fight for Russia in its war against Ukraine.

## Storms delay, cancel thousands of flights across US

date: 2024-12-29, from: VOA News USA

Severe weather disrupted holiday travel on Saturday across the United States with deadly tornadoes in the Southeast and heavy snow and wind on the West Coast delaying or canceling thousands of flights across the country. 


More than 7,000 flights in the U.S. were delayed on Saturday, according to the tracking site FlightAware, and more than 200 were canceled. 


About a third of the flights were delayed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, according to FlightAware, and nearly half of the flights originating from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, were delayed. 


At least 10 tornadoes touched down in the U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi on Saturday, leaving one person dead near Houston, the National Weather Service and local law enforcement said. 


"Those numbers will probably go up," said forecaster Aaron Gleason, with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center. 


The one death and four injuries were reported Saturday in Brazoria County, Texas, about 45 miles south of Houston, according to the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. 


Officials say that many homes and schools were severely damaged or destroyed. Images on social media show scattered ruins of homes and snapped trees and utility poles strewn across streets and lawns. 


Out west, high winds, with gusts up to 241 kilometers per hour in the high elevations of the Tahoe Basin in California and 80 kph at lower elevations hit the area this weekend and with heavy rainfall expected from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, forecasters said. 


Forecasters said to expect between 10 and 15 centimeters of rain before New Year's Eve and up to 3 meters of snow in Lake Tahoe, located on the border of California and Nevada. 


“Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines,” the Weather Service warned. “Widespread power outages are possible.”
