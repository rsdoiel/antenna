## Genome-wide sRNA and mRNA transcriptomic profiling insights into carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii

date: 2024-07-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAcinetobacter baumannii (AB) is rising as a human pathogen of critical priority worldwide as it is the leading cause of opportunistic infections in healthcare settings and carbapenem-resistant AB is listed as a “super bacterium” or “priority pathogen for drug resistance” by the World Health Organization.MethodsClinical isolates of A. baumannii were collected and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Among them, carbapenem-resistant and carbapenem-sensitive A. baumannii were subjected to prokaryotic transcriptome sequencing. The change of sRNA and mRNA expression was analyzed by bioinformatics and validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.ResultsA total of 687 clinical isolates were collected, of which 336 strains of A. baumannii were resistant to carbapenem. Five hundred and six differentially expressed genes and nineteen differentially expressed sRNA candidates were discovered through transcriptomic profile analysis between carbapenem-resistant isolates and carbapenem-sensitive isolates. Possible binding sites were predicted through software for sRNA21 and adeK, sRNA27 and pgaC, sRNA29 and adeB, sRNA36 and katG, indicating a possible targeting relationship. A negative correlation was shown between sRNA21 and adeK (r = -0.581, P = 0.007), sRNA27 and pgaC (r = -0.612, P = 0.004), sRNA29 and adeB (r = -0.516, P = 0.020).DiscussionThis study preliminarily screened differentially expressed mRNA and sRNA in carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, and explored possible targeting relationships, which will help further reveal the resistance mechanism and provide a theoretical basis for the development of drugs targeting sRNA for the prevention and treatment of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infection.

## APH(3’)-Ie, an aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme discovered in a rabbit-derived Citrobacter gillenii isolate

date: 2024-07-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) play an essential role in bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antimicrobials. With the development of sequencing techniques, more bacterial genomes have been sequenced, which has aided in the discovery of an increasing number of novel resistance mechanisms.MethodsThe bacterial species was identified by 16S rRNA gene homology and average nucleotide identity (ANI) analyses. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each antimicrobial was determined by the agar dilution method. The protein was expressed with the pCold I vector in E. coli BL21, and enzyme kinetic parameters were examined. The whole-genome sequence of the bacterium was obtained via the Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms. Reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree, identification of conserved functional residues, and gene context analysis were performed using the corresponding bioinformatic techniques.ResultsA novel aminoglycoside resistance gene, designated aph(3’)-Ie, which confers resistance to ribostamycin, kanamycin, sisomicin and paromomycin, was identified in the chromosome of the animal bacterium Citrobacter gillenii DW61, which exhibited a multidrug resistance phenotype. APH(3’)-Ie showed the highest amino acid identity of 74.90% with the functionally characterized enzyme APH(3’)-Ia. Enzyme kinetics analysis demonstrated that it had phosphorylation activity toward four aminoglycoside substrates, exhibiting the highest affinity (Km, 4.22 ± 0.88 µM) and the highest catalytic efficiency [kcat/Km, (32.27 ± 8.14) × 104] for ribomycin. Similar to the other APH(3’) proteins, APH(3’)-Ie contained all the conserved functional sites of the APH family. The aph(3’)-Ie homologous genes were present in C. gillenii isolates from different sources, including some of clinical significance.ConclusionIn this work, a novel chromosomal aminoglycoside resistance gene, designated aph(3’)-Ie, conferring resistance to aminoglycoside antimicrobials, was identified in a rabbit isolate C. gillenii DW61. The elucidation of the novel resistance mechanism will aid in the effective treatment of infections caused by pathogens carrying such resistance genes.

## Investigating the association between gut microbiome and aortic aneurysm diseases: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis

date: 2024-07-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the associations between specific bacterial taxa of the gut microbiome and the development of aortic aneurysm diseases, utilizing Mendelian Randomization (MR) to explore these associations and overcome the confounding factors commonly present in observational studies.MethodsEmploying the largest available gut microbiome and aortic aneurysm Genome-Wide Association Study databases, including MiBioGen, Dutch Microbiome Project, FinnGen, UK Biobank, and Michigan Genomics Initiative, this study performs two-sample bidirectional MR analyses. Instrumental variables, linked to microbiome taxa at significant levels, were selected for identifying relationships with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA), and aortic dissection (AD). Methods like inverse variance weighted, MR-PRESSO, MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and mode-based estimate were used for MR analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q test. MR-Egger regression and MR-PRESSO addressed potential unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy.ResultsThe analysis did not find any evidence of statistically significant associations between the gut microbiome and aortic aneurysm diseases after adjusting for the false discovery rate (FDR). Specifically, while initial results suggested correlations between 19 taxa and AAA, 25 taxa and TAA, and 13 taxa with AD, these suggested associations did not hold statistical significance post-FDR correction. Therefore, the role of individual gut microbial taxa as independent factors in the development and progression of aortic aneurysm diseases remains inconclusive. This finding underscores the necessity for larger sample sizes and more comprehensive studies to further investigate these potential links.ConclusionThe study emphasizes the complex relationship between the gut microbiome and aortic aneurysm diseases. Although no statistically significant associations were found after FDR correction, the findings provide valuable insights and highlight the importance of considering gut microbiota in aortic aneurysm diseases research. Understanding these interactions may eventually contribute to identifying new therapeutic and preventive strategies for aortic aneurysm diseases.

## Gut microbiome: a novel preventive and therapeutic target for prostatic disease

date: 2024-07-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The human gut microbiome (GM) impacts various physiological processes and can lead to pathological conditions and even carcinogenesis if homeostasis is disrupted. Recent studies have indicated a connection between the GM and prostatic disease. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. This review aims to provide a summary of the existing information regarding the connection between the GM and various prostatic conditions such as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer (PCa). Furthermore, the review aims to identify possible pathogenic mechanisms and suggest potential ways of targeting GM to prevent and treat prostatic disease. Due to the complexity of the mechanism between GM and prostatic diseases, additional research is required to comprehend the association between the two. This will lead to more effective treatment options for prostatic disease.

## Pseudomonas aeruginosa mucinous phenotypes and algUmucABD operon mutant characteristics obtained from inpatients with bronchiectasis and their correlation with acute aggravation

date: 2024-07-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveAlthough the mechanism is unclear, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection directly affects the frequency of acute exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. The aims of this article are to analyze the genetic mutation characteristics of the algUmucABD operon in PA, isolated from hospitalized patients with bronchiectasis, and to explore independent risk factors for frequent acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis.MethodsBased on the number of acute exacerbations that occurred in the past year, these patients with bronchiectasis were divided into those with frequent acute exacerbations (Group A) and those with non-frequent acute exacerbations (Group B). We identified the distribution of mucoid phenotypes (MPs) and alginate morphotypes (AMs) in PA, and classified them into I–IV categories based on their different AMs; otherwise, the gene mutation types (GMTs) of the algUmucABD operon were tested. Subsequently, the relationship between GMT, MP, and AM and the independent risk factors for frequent acute exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis were explored.ResultsA total of 93 patients and 75 PA strains, from January 2019 to August 2023, were included in this study. The MP and AM distributions of PA were as follows: 64 strains (85.33%) of mucoid (the AMs were 38 strains of type I, 3 strains of type II, and 23 strains of type IV) and 11 strains of non-mucoid (the AM was type III only). Mucoid PA with algU, mucA, mucB, and mucD mutations accounted for 19.61%, 74.51%, 31.37%, and 50.98%, respectively. GMT was divided into the following: mucA mutations only, mucA combined with other gene mutations, other gene mutations without mucA mutations, and without gene mutations. In 91.7% of PA with type I of AM, only mucA mutations occurred, and in both separate MP and AM, the GMT differences were statistically significant. Lastly, the number of lung lobes with bronchiectasis and the number of PA with mucA mutations only were the independent risk factors for frequent acute exacerbations.ConclusionThe mucA mutation was primarily responsible for the mucoid of MP and type I of AM in PA, and it was also an independent risk factor for frequent exacerbations of bronchiectasis.

## The value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing with different nucleic acid extracting methods of cell-free DNA or whole-cell DNA in the diagnosis of non-neutropenic pulmonary aspergillosis

date: 2024-07-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

PurposeMetagenomic next-generation sequencing(mNGS) is a novel molecular diagnostic technique. For nucleic acid extraction methods, both whole-cell DNA (wcDNA) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are widely applied with the sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We aim to evaluate the clinical value of mNGS with cfDNA and mNGS with wcDNA for the detection of BALF pathogens in non-neutropenic pulmonary aspergillosis.MethodsmNGS with BALF-cfDNA, BALF-wcDNA and conventional microbiological tests (CMTs) were performed in suspected non-neutropenic pulmonary aspergillosis. The diagnostic value of different assays for pulmonary aspergillosis was compared.ResultsBALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA) outperformed CMTs in terms of microorganisms detection. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated BALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA) was superior to culture and BALF-GM. Combination diagnosis of either positive for BALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA) or CMTs is more sensitive than CMTs alone in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis (BALF-cfDNA+CMTs/BALF-wcDNA+CMTs vs. CMTs: ROC analysis: 0.813 vs.0.66, P=0.0142/0.796 vs.0.66, P=0.0244; Sensitivity: 89.47% vs. 47.37%, P=0.008/84.21% vs. 47.37%, P=0.016). BALF-cfDNA showed a significantly greater reads per million (RPM) than BALF-wcDNA. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for RPM of Aspergillus detected by BALF-cfDNA, used to predict “True positive” pulmonary aspergillosis patients, was 0.779, with a cut-off value greater than 4.5.ConclusionWe propose that the incorporation of BALF-mNGS (cfDNA, wcDNA) with CMTs improves diagnostic precision in the identification of non-neutropenic pulmonary aspergillosis when compared to CMTs alone. BALF-cfDNA outperforms BALF-wcDNA in clinical value.

## The intratumoral microbiota: a new horizon in cancer immunology

date: 2024-07-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Over the past decade, advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to a qualitative leap in our understanding of the role of the microbiota in human diseases, particularly in oncology. Despite the low biomass of the intratumoral microbiota, it remains a crucial component of the tumor immune microenvironment, displaying significant heterogeneity across different tumor tissues and individual patients. Although immunotherapy has emerged a major strategy for treating tumors, patient responses to these treatments vary widely. Increasing evidence suggests that interactions between the intratumoral microbiota and the immune system can modulate host tumor immune responses, thereby influencing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Therefore, it is critical to gain a deep understanding of how the intratumoral microbiota shapes and regulates the tumor immune microenvironment. Here, we summarize the latest advancements on the role of the intratumoral microbiota in cancer immunity, exploring the potential mechanisms through which immune functions are influenced by intratumoral microbiota within and outside the gut barrier. We also discuss the impact of the intratumoral microbiota on the response to cancer immunotherapy and its clinical applications, highlighting future research directions and challenges in this field. We anticipate that the valuable insights into the interactions between cancer immunity and the intratumoral microbiota provided in this review will foster the development of microbiota-based tumor therapies.

## Standardization of an antimicrobial resistance surveillance network through data management

date: 2024-07-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide within 2 months demonstrated the vulnerability of the world’s population to infectious diseases. In 2015, the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) was launched to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the decade-long global battle against AMR based on GLASS data.MethodsSouth Korea established Kor-GLASS (Korean-GLASS) to proactively monitor data quality and enable international collaborations. A unique feature of Kor-GLASS is the quality control center (QCC), which uses network hubs and ensures standardized, high-quality data through interlaboratory proficiency testing (IPT) and external quality assessment (EQA). In addition, the QCC multifaceted endeavors for integrated data quality management.ResultsSince 2020, high-quality AMR data have indicated fluctuating antibiotic resistance rates in South Korea. This trend does not align with the decrease in antibiotic usage seen in humans but coincides with non-human antibiotic sales, indicating a need for greater monitoring of non-human antibiotic resistance. Comprehensive and robust management taking account of the intricate interplay among humans, animals, and the environment is essential. Kor-GLASS has been expanded into a “One Health” multiagency collaborative initiative.DiscussionAlthough a standardized solution is not suitable for all countries, it must align with the local context and international standards. A centralized top-down management structure such as that of the QCC is essential to ensure continuous data quality coordination. Sustained efforts and surveillance systems are crucial for monitoring and managing AMR and safeguarding human health.
