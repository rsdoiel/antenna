<p>date: 2024-12-26, updated: 2024-12-26, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(BPT) - Every year, roughly 20-30% of older Americans head to warmer
climates for the colder winter months. Snowbirds are often retirees on
fixed incomes, though flexible work environments now provide more
opportunities for anyone to spend several months escaping the chill.
Whether on a fixed income or an empty nester with disposable income,
consumers are interested in saving money where they can. With this in
mind, snowbirds can look to their AARP membership to take advantage of
relevant discounts and offerings as they fluff their feathers and get
ready for takeoff.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-26, updated: 2024-12-26, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(BPT) - The new year is a good time to reset. From a fresh start on
lifestyle choices, hobbies or pursuits, to the less exciting — but no
less important — aspects of life, like memberships, contracts and even
health insurance. Health insurance deductibles reset in the new year, so
it’s a good idea to keep that in mind as you plan for healthcare
expenses. Any changes made to your health insurance plan during open
enrollment go into effect as well.</p>
