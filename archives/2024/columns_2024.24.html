like YouTube TV to let me block Fox News. It shows up on their home
screen as the default channel and it starts playing automatically. For
some reason they’ve decided I want or need to watch Fox News. Please
stop doing that. Not just for me, for everyone. If there has to be a
default make it something easy like Seinfeld perhaps. Or Law &amp;
Order. I haven’t switched from Spectrum, I’m trying YouTube TV while I
think about switching. This is a small thing, but might be a
deal-stopper. I don’t want my nose rubbed in how evil they are. I know.
I want to turn on TV to escape. A Julie Andrews movie perhaps.</p>

<p>Matt Terenzio, who has been a friend for many years,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@librenews/112615016271629839">threw a
fat pitch</a> about people like me who think the NY Times has a lot of
explaining to do. I don’t think anyone is listening, but my issue with
the Times is when they embrace and promote conspiracy theories that
damage our political system. Matt says we have many truths, and I think
that’s where we differ, there has to be one truth when it comes to
accusations of the kind that the Repubs throw at Democratic candidates
and minorities. When they take a side against the people, that’s when I
have a problem.</p>

<h2 id="morality-justice-and-the-law">2024-06-14 Morality, justice and

<p>date: 2024-06-14, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-06-14-morality-justice-and-the-law">
2024-06-14 Morality, justice and the law
</h1>
<p>
Some actions are legal and still reprehensible. People won’t get
punished by the state or the police but that doesn’t protect them from
scorn, disdain, harsh comments and insults. Actions have consequences.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps some people need to see it spelled out. I think when I was young
I also needed somebody to tell me because when I grew up, I thought that
the state is great, the law is great, and we’re all good people. But
morality, justice and the law are not the same. The law only concerns
the things were the state will come and impose fines and punishment.
Justice is the thing we aspire to (but which the state often cannot
deliver). And the moral good goes further than that.
</p>
<p>
To be morally good or bad is different from being just or unjust and
that is different from something being legal or illegal.
</p>
<p>
So please, when people say that something is reprehensible they usually
don’t care whether it was legal or not because they aren’t going to call
the cops. It’s an occasion to be happy for just being called names, for
only getting demeaned and ridiculed, for just getting inundated with
mails and complaints. It’s a learning opportunity because when the cops
show up and take your stuff, when you get invitations to show up in
court, when the bills start coming in, then it’s worse. Much worse.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen this a few times on fedi, now. Somebody thinks it’s OK to
index all the status messages for their search engine, ingest all the
status messages for their sentiment analysis or for their training data,
and then they’re surprised when people get angry. A discussion ensues,
and some people will say, hey, it was not illegal now, was it? Therefore
there’s no point in getting angry or acting surprised.
</p>
<p>
This misunderstands how humans manage to live together. When I was young
and learned about hackers breaking into computer systems cheered for
them because I didn’t like the corporations. And if it wasn’t illegal it
was good or something like that. I was confused. But now, as I look
around, I see defence in depth all around me. The garden fence has a
gate that is trivial to jump over and to open, but to do so invites
trouble. Whether jumping the fence is legal or illegal doesn’t matter at
first. Perhaps somebody runs away from bullies or creeps and they’re
welcome to jump that fence and escape. Things are negotiable. In a
civilized world, many things need to happen before the state needs to
get involved, and this is how it is supposed to be. Differences can be
resolved.
</p>
<p>
A recent example of what I’m talking about:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A recent investigation by Liaizon Wakest revealed that Maven, a new
social network founded by former OpenAI Team Lead Ken Stanley, has been
importing a vast amount of statuses from Mastodon without anyone’s
consent. –
<a href="https://wedistribute.org/2024/06/maven-mastodon-posts/">Maven
Imported 1.12 Million Fediverse Posts</a>, by
<a href="https://deadsuperhero.com/">Sean Tilley</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
People react harshly:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I can’t emphasize enough how much I would love if all the data centers
containing the code running these things, across every network, just
suddenly exploded. Take it all back to zero, and then put up a digital
wall, like in Cyberpunk 2077 when they built a whole new internet that
isn’t infested with garbage. –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
“Move fast and break things” is shit advice.
</p>
<p>
“Act now and ask for forgiveness later” is shit advice.
</p>
<p>
It breaks all the good will accumulated so far and it’ll take a lifetime
to rebuild.
</p>
<p>
The advice that has been true for generations is: “Ask politely and
respect the answers given”.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So there’s a difference in opinion in the fediverse on whether it’s
important to get consent to use somebody’s public posts for a purpose
they didn’t originally intend it for: adding them to a search engine,
using them as part of algorithmic recommendation systems, “bridging”
them to another social networks, using it to train artificial
intelligence systems, and so on. Some think this is just fine, or that
it’s enough to assume consent and give people the ability to “opt out”
and withdraw consent. Others think that these uses should require
informed, affirmative, “opt in” consent. –

<p>Friends, Don’t be fooled by the myth that people are paid what
they’re “worth” — that the rich deserve their ever-increasing incomes
and wealth because they’re worth far more to the economy now than years
ago (when the incomes and wealth of those at the top were more modest
relative to everyone else’s).</p>

<p>The Port of Baltimore reopened yesterday, fewer than 100 days after a
container ship hit the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26, collapsing
it into the channel. The port is a major shipping hub, especially for
imports and exports of cars and light trucks—about 750,000 vehicles went
through it in 2022. It is also the nation’s second-biggest exporter of
coal. In 2023 it moved a record-breaking $80 billion worth of foreign
cargo.</p>

<h2 id="anvil-editor-and-multiple-cursors">2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and
multiple cursors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-06-13-anvil-editor-and-multiple-cursors">
2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple cursors
</h1>
<p>
I like how the author of the <a href="https://anvil-editor.net/">Anvil
Editor</a> (an <a href="http://acme.cat-v.org/">Acme</a>-like editor)
explains how to use it and provides a small number of super-short videos
to show it. Here’s a good way to use video in documentation! This is
important because an “ACME-like editor” is pretty alien for people these
days. It relies on three buttons your mouse. The menus are small,
editable windows where you select a word with the mouse and the middle
mouse button to execute it. You can create your own menus by simply
writing them.
</p>
<p>
This is great, but alien.
</p>
<p>
I kept wondering how feasible it would be to add a few key bindings to
allow one to use it without a mouse. Window switching, selection
growing, executing, I keep thinking that it should be possible. That
mandatory three button mouse has kept me away from ACME-like editors.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been experimenting a bit with adding more keyboard bindings. Since
it doesn’t seem to have a git repository, I made
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/anvil.git">my own</a> so I can
keep track of the patches.
</p>
<p>
I plan to force-push with abandon.
</p>
<p>
I try to do a tiny snippet of programming in the mornings or evenings.
Currently I’m looking at my “extending the selection” code and how it
interacts (badly) with multiple cursors. I guess I don’t understand the
attraction of multiple cursors compared to “record a keyboard macro once
and then replay it for the rest of the file, for a fixed number of
times, or as long as I keep pressing a key” (the way standard Emacs
allows me to) compared to alt-clicking a number of times at just the
right spot (I guess my mousing is terrible) to place the cursors and
then do the necessary edits. Whenever something like this comes, I’m
editing data files or something like that so I would have to place
hundreds or thousands of cursors… Only one of these approaches scales. I
must be missing something about multiple cursors.
</p>
<p>
When I asked about it on fedi, people recommended I give
<code>multiple-cursors</code> for Emacs a try. I looked at the
<a href="https://emacsrocks.com/e13.html">Emacs Rocks video for mc</a>
and liked it. Again, this is video documentation well done, essentially
a <em>demo</em>, not a manual.
</p>
<p>
I started using for small things (a handful of lines) where it was
indeed easier to use than keyboard macros or regular expressions because
of the immediate feedback and the ability to undo any damage done and
still continue the operation. Nice!
</p>
<p>
I still ♥️ Emacs!

<p>date: 2024-06-13, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I did a search on my site for NakedJen.
</p>
<p>
Google thinks I meant “Naked Men.”
</p>
<p>
This is why Google should know I have a blog and it has it indexed, and
if it just looks it would know that question shows how <b>dumb</b> it
is.
</p>
<p>
When I type my mother’s name in, searching on my own blog (again) it
tries to correct the spelling of her name. My own mother’s name.
</p>
<p>
Google started out so smart then they must have lost all the smart
people. Or they got stupid? I don’t know. But there’s so much they could
do to improve their product, it would be sensible to, while they’re
shooting for the fences, do the small things that would give users an
idea that there’s <i>some</i> humanity to the product.

PS: ChatGPT should also know where my blog is, and it should be
constantly loading the updates. This is the freaking breakthrough. Do
it.

never been to a Dead concert with her, but I understand it’s like going

working on a server app to read blogroll source in OPML, and build a
database of other blogrolls that are linked to feeds in the original
blogroll, accessed via the <a href="https://opml.org/blogroll.opml">feed
or html source</a>. It was a lucky thing when I designed the format for
<a href="https://opml.org/spec2.opml#subscriptionLists">subscription
lists</a> back in the 00s that it included the <i>htmlUrl</i> attribute,
it makes the HTML easier to find (though the channel-level link element
in the feed could play the same role). Anyway, of course I’m using a SQL
database for all this, and when I was thinking about it initially I
thought “no big deal” it’s a variant of a SQL table I’ve now done a
dozen times. But it was a big deal, because I’ve yet to come up with a
way to factor this so that I have a library that knows how to make the
kind of table that keeps coming up all the time, to bury the complexity
and make creating a new one much simpler. Same thing with CSS and
JavaScript. I know the justification for CSS is that it makes scaling
from phones to desktops possible, but that would be equally possible if
you provided a good object with properties that can be configured at
runtime. That’s how we do it on servers with a config.json file. Then
you could do a much better job of factoring browser-based apps. Imagine
how much smoother everything would be if these structures could be
factored. This probably doesn’t make sense to too many people, maybe it
won’t even make sense to me in a couple of years, when hopefully I’ve
moved on to a better way of doing these things. I would love to have the
time to take a crack at doing the factoring anyway, I’m sure it’s
possible, just not obvious how to do it. In the meantime I think there
are now enough blogrolls out there to build something interesting out of
them, which is why I’m taking my break from <i>The Next Product</i> to
do this.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-13, updated: 2024-06-11, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
As India concluded the
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-hold-worlds-largest-elections-between-april-june-2024-03-16/">world’s
largest election</a> on June 5, 2024, with over
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/INDIA-ELECTION/zgponbzllvd/">640
million votes</a> counted, observers could assess how the various
parties and factions used artificial intelligence technologies—and what
lessons that holds for the rest of the world.
</p>
<p>
The campaigns made extensive use of AI, including deepfake
impersonations of candidates, celebrities and dead politicians. By some
estimates,
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/indian-elections-ai-deepfakes/">millions
of Indian voters</a> viewed deepfakes.
</p>
<p>
But, despite fears of widespread disinformation, for
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/06/india-election-deepfakes-generative-ai/678597/">the
most part</a> the campaigns, candidates and activists used AI
constructively in the election. They used AI for typical political
activities, including mudslinging, but primarily to better connect with
voters…

<p>On June 13, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive
Order 9182, consolidating a number of different government information
offices into the Office of War Information (OWI). The mission of the new
agency was to gather public information and to spread it across the U.S.
and abroad through the press, radio, motion pictures, and other media.
Its aim, in the middle of World War II, was to develop “an informed and
intelligent understanding, at home and abroad, of the status and
progress of the war effort and of the war policies, activities, and aims
of the Government.”</p>

<p>One virtue of eating bitter, I think, is that it helps you learn the
taste and sensation of helpful bitterness, and how to tell it apart from
the bitterness that breaks you down, or poisons you.</p>

watching Stan Krute doing all these weird and often beautifully bizarre
ChatGPT images, and realizing they are only being seen by people on
Facebook when there’s this huge world of creative people that don’t or
won’t use FB.
</p>
<p>
Then it occurred to me, I have the perfect place for these images,
outside the facebookiverse, that would showcase them, and be easy to
produce (I don’t want to take on responsibility for big production
overhead myself).
</p>
<p>
I have images I put in the right margin of blog posts on
<a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>. Small little bits of
creative color, that may or may not be connected to the story they are
next to. And sometimes connected in non-obvious ways, intended to make
you think.
</p>
<p>
Then NakedJen sent me a recent picture of herself that’s perfect for the
right margin. Seen in the right margin of this post.

<p>
Here’s a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/manyImages.html">page</a>

I’d love to add more creative stuff here. And I’d love to get some of
Stan Krute’s genius or Brad Pettit or whoever else might be so inspired.

No promises about when or if they’d be used. You can post them here, as

I have written fairly often about the problems of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search/label/games">preserving video
games</a>, most recently last year in in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/08/video-game-history.html"><i>Video
Game History</i></a>. It was based upon Phil Salvador’s
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996492"><i>Survey of the Video
Game Reissue Market in the United States</i></a>. Salvador’s main focus
was on classic console games but he noted a specific problem with
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996492">more recent
releases</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The largest major platform shutdown in recent memory is the closure of
the digital stores for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U platforms. Nintendo
shut down the 3DS and Wii U eShops on March 27, 2023, resulting in the
removal of 2,413 digital titles. Although many of these are likely
available on other platforms, Video Games Chronicle estimates that over
1,000 of those games were exclusive to those platforms’ digital stores
and are no longer available in any form, including first-party Nintendo
titles like Dr. Luigi, Dillon’s Rolling Western, Mario &amp; Donkey
Kong: Minis on the Move, and Pokémon Rumble U. The closures also
affected around 500 historical games reissued by Nintendo through their
Virtual Console storefronts, over 300 of which are believed not
available on any other platform or service.
</blockquote>
Below the fold I discuss recent developments in this area.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Salvador
<a a="" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996492">writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Games released during the digital game distribution era may have content
or features tied to online services, which may be (and regularly are)
deactivated. According to researcher James Newman, this is sometimes
employed by game publishers as a deliberate strategy to devalue used
games, shorten their distribution window, and encourage sales of new
titles, which has ominous implications for preservation.
</blockquote>
This post started with Timothy Geigner’s
<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/04/08/one-youtubers-quest-for-political-action-to-preserve-old-video-games/"><i>One
YouTuber’s Quest For Political Action To Preserve Old Video
Games</i></a>. He lays out the problem:<br />
<blockquote>
it’s probably long past time that there be some sort of political action
to address the real or potential disappearance of cultural output that
is occurring. The way this works far too often is that a publisher
releases a game that is either an entirely online game, or an offline
game that requires backend server calls or connections to make it work.
People by those games. Then, some time down the road, the publisher
decides supporting the game is no longer profitable and shuts the
servers down on its end, disappearing the purchased game either
completely, or else limiting what was previously available. Those that
bought or subscribed to the game are left with no options.
</blockquote>
The trigger for renewed attention to this problem was Ubisoft’s April
1<sup>st</sup>(!)
<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/04/08/one-youtubers-quest-for-political-action-to-preserve-old-video-games/">delisting
of <i>The Crew</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
With <i>The Crew</i>, millions of copies of the game were played around
the world. When Ubisoft delisted the game late last year, the game
became unplayable. On top of that, because of copyright law, it would be
illegal for fans to keep the game alive themselves by running their own
servers, even assuming they had the source code necessary to do so. So
fans of the game who still want to play it are stuck.
</blockquote>
Kenneth Shephard reported in
<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-the-crew-accursed-farms-stop-killing-games-1851385068"><i>A
Ubisoft Game Is At The Center Of A Fight To Stop Online Game
Shutdowns</i></a> that this triggered an effort to respond:<br />
<blockquote>
Ross Scott, who runs Accursed Farms, posted a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE">31-minute
video</a> on the channel, which outlines the problem and how he believes
drawing attention to <i>The Crew</i>’s April 1
<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-crew-delisted-ubisoft-servers-xbox-pc-ps4-1851101053">shutdown</a>
could cause governments to enact greater consumer protections for people
who purchase online games. As laid out in the video, consumer rights for
these situations vary in different countries. France, however, has some
pretty robust consumer laws, and Ubisoft is based there.
</blockquote>
Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE">Scott’s
video</a>:<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<iframe allowfullscreen class="BLOG_video_class" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w70Xc9CStoE" width="320" youtube-src-id="w70Xc9CStoE">
</iframe>
</div>
Scott surveyed countries around the world looking for the prospects of
two possible actions:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Lobbying the country’s consumer protection agency to take action on the
grounds that the company purported to sell the game but failed to make
it clear that the game could be rendered useless at any time without
warning or compensation.
</li>
<li>
Petitioning the government to take legal or legislative action against
this practice.
</li>
</ul>
These actions would be aimed at ensuring that after a vendor’s support
for a game it sold ended:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Games sold must be left in a functional state.
</li>
<li>
Games sold must require no further connection to the publisher or
affiliated parties to function.
</li>
<li>
The above also applies to games that have sold microtransactions to
customers.
</li>
<li>
The above cannot be superseded by end user license agreements.
</li>
</ul>
These appear to match Scott’s goal of a minimal set of consumer rights
that is hard to argue against. If the game publishers can’t live with
them they can always explicitly rent the game instead of selling it.
Renting makes it clear that the purchaser’s rights are
time-limited.<br /> <br /> More details of the campaign can be found at
Scott’s <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/"><i>Stop Killing
Games</i></a> website. Scott has so far posted three update videos to
his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Accursed_Farms"><i>Accursed
Farms</i></a> YouTube channel:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jezi1bE4xvc"><i>April updates
on campaign to stop game destruction</i></a>: The UK petition hit 10K
signatures almost immediately, enough to get an answer from the
government. The Australian petition’s wording got messed up so it
applies to ALL software, too big an ask. The German consumer protection
agency is aware of the shutdown of <i>The Crew</i>, and misbehavior by
other publishers.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVGZe-xXS68"><i>Dead Games
News: Response from UK Government</i></a>: The UK government responded,
but the Parliamentary Petitions Committee decided that the response
didn’t address the petition, and has asked for a revised response.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXts7rj4cSk"><i>May updates on
campaign to stop game destruction</i></a>: It looks as if in the UK if a
game you bought shuts down within three years you can complain to the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority">Competition
and Markets Authority</a> on the basis that at the time of purchase you
were not informed of the lifetime of the game.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea that purchasers are entitled to be told at least the minimum
lifetime of the gane is interesting. Ubisoft’s excuse for delisting
<i>The Crew</i> was that their licenses to music and other content
featured in the game had expired. But that implies that, at launch, they
knew that they would delist the game at the date when their licenses
were due to expire. To make an informed purchase decision customers
needed to know that date. Not providing it on the box was clearly
deceptive.<br /> <br /> Publishers would <i>hate</i> a requirement to
put a “playable until” date on the box; it would clearly reduce
purchases. They might find Scott’s requirements less onerous.<br />

permalink to each item is the date of the item.
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/blogrollScreenShot.png">Screen

timestamp doubles as a permalink. And I think this is more distracting,
and cluttered, but let’s give it a try. It’s possible that people missed
that they could go to the website from the blogroll. Now it should be
more obvious.</p>

Repubs are coming uncloaked. Their slogan might as well be Revenge. It’s
the one thing everyone who votes for Trump wants more than anything.
They hate their lives, and are looking for someone to release their rage
on. They don’t know how else to do it. It doesn’t have much to do with
inflation or unemployment, material wealth. It’s deeper than that. We’re
all living a lie, that if we had money we’d be happy. The sad truth is
no one is happy with this arrangement. Ask a billionaire if you don’t
believe me. They have huge grievances which you would have thought all
that wealth would have cured them of. The new Nazis have a selling
proposition that works every few generations, after the memory of the
previous societal explosion are gone. My parents, the last people I knew
who lived through the Nazis are gone. I just have the memory of the
aftermath, and it wasn’t pretty. “All of this has happened before, and
it will all happen again.” We’re at the beginning of the “happen again”
moment. My grandfather told me what to do, but I won’t do it, pretty
sure of that.</p>

<h2 id="llms-acting-deceptively">LLMs Acting Deceptively</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-11, updated: 2024-06-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
New research:
“<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2317967121">Deception
abilities emerged in large language models</a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Large language models (LLMs) are currently at the
forefront of intertwining AI systems with human communication and
everyday life. Thus, aligning them with human values is of great
importance. However, given the steady increase in reasoning abilities,
future LLMs are under suspicion of becoming able to deceive human
operators and utilizing this ability to bypass monitoring efforts. As a
prerequisite to this, LLMs need to possess a conceptual understanding of
deception strategies. This study reveals that such strategies emerged in
state-of-the-art LLMs, but were nonexistent in earlier LLMs. We conduct
a series of experiments showing that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to
understand and induce false beliefs in other agents, that their
performance in complex deception scenarios can be amplified utilizing
chain-of-thought reasoning, and that eliciting Machiavellianism in LLMs
can trigger misaligned deceptive behavior. GPT-4, for instance, exhibits
deceptive behavior in simple test scenarios 99.16% of the time (P &lt;
0.001). In complex second-order deception test scenarios where the aim
is to mislead someone who expects to be deceived, GPT-4 resorts to
deceptive behavior 71.46% of the time (P &lt; 0.001) when augmented with
chain-of-thought reasoning. In sum, revealing hitherto unknown machine
behavior in LLMs, our study contributes to the nascent field of machine
psychology…

<p>Former president Trump met with a New York City probation officer
today for a pre-sentencing interview. They met over video for a first
step in the sentencing process, in which an officer assesses the
convicted criminal’s living situation, finances, mental health,
addiction, and criminal record. Trump was expected to have his lawyer,
Todd Blanche, with him when he linked in from Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.
Judge Juan Merchan will take the information from the interview into
account when he sentences Trump. He will also consider that Trump was
held in contempt 10 times during the trial for violating the gag order
designed to stop him from attacking witnesses and court personnel and
their families.</p>

Interesting research:
“<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645510">Hyperlink
Hijacking: Exploiting Erroneous URL Links to Phantom Domains</a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Web users often follow hyperlinks hastily, expecting
them to be correctly programmed. However, it is possible those links
contain typos or other mistakes. By discovering active but erroneous
hyperlinks, a malicious actor can spoof a website or service,
impersonating the expected content and phishing private information. In
“typosquatting,” misspellings of common domains are registered to
exploit errors when users mistype a web address. Yet, no prior research
has been dedicated to situations where the linking errors of web
publishers (i.e. developers and content contributors) propagate to
users. We hypothesize that these “hijackable hyperlinks” exist in large
quantities with the potential to generate substantial traffic. Analyzing
large-scale crawls of the web using high-performance computing, we show
the web currently contains active links to more than 572,000 dot-com
domains that have never been registered, what we term ‘phantom domains.’
Registering 51 of these, we see 88% of phantom domains exceeding the
traffic of a control domain, with up to 10 times more visits. Our
analysis shows that these links exist due to 17 common publisher error
modes, with the phantom domains they point to free for anyone to
purchase and exploit for under $20, representing a low barrier to entry
for potential attackers…

<p>date: 2024-06-10, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>Yesterday the Washington Post published an article by Beth Reinhard
examining the philosophy and the power of Russell Vought, the hard-right
Christian nationalist who is drafting plans for a second Trump term.
Vought was the director of the Office of Management and Budget from July
2020 to January 2021 during the Trump administration. In January 2021 he
founded the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank, and he
was a key player in the construction of Project 2025, the plan to gut
the nonpartisan federal government and replace it with a dominant
president and a team of loyalists who will impose religious rule on the
United States.</p>

Had another crap night’s sleep BUT as I was lying there at 4:30am with
my hand on my belly, I felt definite movement 🥰 Like, a foot or
something running along the underside of the surface. Not the first time
I’ve thought I felt something, but the first time I’m sure I did. It was
wild the emotional reaction I had, too – just suddenly filled with love
for this defenceless little creature inside me. A very strong feeling!

<p>Sometimes, when you read something so perfect, you have to savor it,
share it, and save it! ….what could be easier than friendship? In
theory, nothing. It is a relationship that consists almost entirely in
shared history, loyalty, and an ongoing pleasure in each other’s
company. Friendship asks only that you be yourself.  In philosophical

<h2 id="wikipedia-vs-chatgpt">Wikipedia vs ChatGPT</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<i>I started replying to a
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746">post
by Tim Bray</a> in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character
limit, so I moved my act over here. </i>
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
It often only represents a story from one point of view.
</p>
<p>
So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.
</p>
<p>
Same with the story of RSS. I’m sure you know the story they tell, but
there’s a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got
together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and Motley Fool, and eventually
brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard
supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media
and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the
tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do
that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you’d get the idea that the
bigco’s heroically fought back against what exactly it’s not clear.
</p>
<p>
I can’t contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so
your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well
it’s not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it
on my blog (as I’m doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and
fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is.
(Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)
</p>
<p>
Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things
other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name
for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT
made a mistake like that people would be howling. I’m sure Wikipedia is
filled with junk like that. Why wouldn’t it be.
</p>
<p>
And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all
other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while
other sources don’t.
</p>
<p>
But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in
advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles.
</p>
<p>
ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the
open web. I don’t know why it’s better at finding stuff, and also
understanding my queries even though they’re not rigorously specified,
my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way
I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a
weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able
to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.
</p>
<p>
It’s also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would
work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out
prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which
of course they are being.
</p>
<p>
Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that’s a big difference
between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very
impatient with them and move on.
</p>
<p>
Also, I’m not here to debate. I don’t like online debates. <span

have a Mac Mini that keeps running out of space on its internal drive.
It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me
find the big stuff. I don’t know when this app came to be, but it’s very
helpful. In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for
all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device
that’s ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems).
I’m sure there’s a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on
the 16TB external drive, but I sure don’t know how to do it nor do I
want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript,
CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a
lot longer than this Mac’s has. I desperately want to move my act to
Linux and reclaim all the memory I’m using to store stuff about the Mac,
which isn’t really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a
Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that’s my revenge,
and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with
what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would
make <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups">beaucoups</a>
money, so I hedged. I figured at least they’d make me rich while
completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My
inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen
Apple keep <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> running
and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as
usual I ramble. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<p>I bet you could do a nice AI that would create a graph of people who
are connected to other people through far more criteria than networks
like LinkedIn or Facebook could. It could take into account all of those
connections and others. Kind of like a current-day geneology of
relationships.</p>

This morning I had to cook my French toast in canola oil instead of
butter because I forgot we were out of the latter until I was already
too far in to back out. It actually came out better than I expected but
I’m still disappointed 😢
