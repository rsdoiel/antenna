cepacia in cystic fibrosis children and adolescents: overall survival
and immune alterations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundIn current literature there are only scarce data on the
host inflammatory response during Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc)
persistence. The primary objective of the present research was to carry
out cross-sectional analyses of biomarkers and evaluate disease
progression in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with chronic Bcc infection
and pathogen-free ones. The secondary aim was to assess prospectively
overall survival of the study participants during up to 8 years of
follow-up.MethodsThe study included 116 paediatric patients with CF; 47
CF patients were chronically infected with Bcc, and 69 individuals were
Bcc free. Plasma and sputum biomarkers (neutrophil elastase, MMP-8,
MMP-9, MMP-12, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, IL-22, IL-23,
IL-17, IFN-γ, TGFβ1, TNF-α) were analysed using commercially available
kits. Besides, inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on proliferative
response of PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes had been
assessed.ResultsBcc infected patients did not differ from Bcc free ones
in demographic and clinical parameters, but demonstrated an increased
rate of glucose metabolism disturbances and survival disadvantage during
prolong follow-up period. Biomarkers analyses revealed elevated TNF-α
and reduced IL-17F levels in sputum samples of Bcc infected patients.
These patients also demonstrated improvement of peripheral blood
lymphocyte sensitivity to steroid treatment and reduction in plasma
pro-inflammatory (IL-17F and IL-18) and anti-inflammatory (TGFβ1 and
IL-10) cytokine concentrations.ConclusionsReduction in IL-17F levels may
have several important consequences including increase in steroid
sensitivity and glycemic control disturbances. Further investigations
are needed to clarify the role of IL-17 cytokines in CF complication
development. Low plasma TGFβ1 and IL-10 levels in Bcc infected group may
be a sign of subverted activity of regulatory T cells. Such immune
alterations may be one of the factors contributing to the development of
the cepacia syndrome.</p>

of metagenomic next-generation sequencing for rapid molecular
identification in spinal infection diagnosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the sensitivity and
specificity of metagenomic next−generation sequencing (mNGS) for
detecting pathogens in spinal infections and to identify the differences
in the diagnostic performance between mNGS and targeted next−generation
sequencing (tNGS).MethodsA total of 76 consecutive patients with
suspected spinal infections who underwent mNGS, culture, and
histopathological examinations were retrospectively studied. The final
diagnosis of the patient was determined by combining the clinical
treatment results, pathological examinations, imaging changes and
laboratory indicators. The sensitivity and specificity of mNGS and
culture were determined.ResultsThe difference between the two detection
rates was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001), with mNGS exhibiting
a significantly higher detection rate (77.6% versus 18.4%). The average
diagnosis time of mNGS was significantly shorter than that of bacterial
culture (p &lt; 0.001, 1.65 versus 3.07 days). The sensitivity and
accuracy of mNGS were significantly higher than that of the culture
group (p &lt; 0.001, 82.3% versus 17.5%; 75% versus 27.6%), whereas the
specificity of mNGS (42.9%) was lower than that of the culture group (p
&gt; 0.05, 42.9% versus 76.9%). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
and positive predictive value (PPV) of pus were higher than those of
tissue samples for mNGS, whereas for culture, the sensitivity,
specificity, accuracy, and PPV of tissue samples were higher than those
of pus. tNGS demonstrated higher sensitivity and accuracy in diagnosing
tuberculosis (TB) than mNGS (80% versus 50%; 87.5% versus
68.8%).ConclusionmNGS for spinal infection demonstrated better
diagnostic value in developing an antibiotic regimen earlier, and it is
recommended to prioritize pus samples for testing through mNGS.
Moreover, tNGS outperformed other methods for diagnosing spinal TB and
identifying antibiotic-resistance genes in drug-resistant TB.</p>
