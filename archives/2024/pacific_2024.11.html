interest in TikTok and distressed NY bank echoes his pre-Trump
investment playbook</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK &amp;#8212; It seems like a bizarre mishmash: A former Trump cabinet official is saying he wants to buy TikTok just days after leading a group that pumped $1 billion into a beaten-down bank. But it all actually fits in with the complicated career of Steven Mnuchin.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;On the Island of Hawaii, frequent eruptions foster a close relationship between the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency. HVO monitors the active volcanoes and their associated hazards; HCCDA alerts and protects communities from impacts of volcanic events. This relationship, between volcano observatories and their emergency managers, was highlighted at the recent &amp;#8220;Cities on Volcanoes&amp;#8221; meeting in Antigua, Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;

This acute shortage of housing drives both the houselessness and outmigration crises. The state Legislature has a pivotal opportunity to address this situation by reevaluating conveyance tax rates on the sale of multimillion dollar investment properties.&lt;/p&gt;
