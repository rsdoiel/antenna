California’s local news agreement with Google is a win</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-30, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>If you’ve been following the great debate over how the state of
California should step in to aid its dwindling local news force — down
68% since 2005 — you’ve heard many voices. The debate, which began in
early 2023, now seems settled — by an actual legislation-avoiding
settlement agreed to by Google and Governor Gavin Newsom…</p>

Overviews</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, AI Overviews made headlines across the U.S. —
mostly for the wrong reasons. The new Google search feature offers up
AI-generated answers to queries, synthesizing sources on the web and
filtering them through Google’s own large language model, Gemini. In the
days after its U.S. roll out, journalists quickly took to social…</p>

<p>Is news literacy hot? Washington, D.C. residents are about to find
out. Part news aggregator, part dating app, InPress is launching for
Washington, D.C. residents Thursday. It aims to help people find and
build connections (both romantic and friendly) through journalism,

<p>In March, newspaper chains Gannett and McClatchy stopped using
Associated Press wire reports and photos to cut costs. Just a few days
after the chains’ decisions were reported, the nonprofit Texas Tribune
announced a move in the opposite direction; through a new content
sharing partnership, it would gain access to the AP’s Texas stories
and…</p>

<p>At the Institute for Nonprofit News’ first full-day topical
conference at CUNY’s Craig Newmark School of Journalism last week, INN
members came together for a shared exploration of the challenges facing
newsrooms in an era of dramatic changes in audience behavior and social
media platforms’ relationship with news. As participants wrestled with
the many ways…</p>

<p>Imagine you’re walking down the street and a random guy asks you to
solve a math problem. A complicated one, but one you know how to solve —
it’d just take several minutes of some fairly serious thinking on your
part. Would you do it? Maybe you love math and want nothing more than
random…</p>

<p>In an era when people trust news less than ever, how can journalists
break through and attract the attention of average people to provide
information about their communities, the nation and the world? By not
complicating things. Our research, published in Science Advances, shows
that simple headlines significantly increase article engagement and
clicks compared with…</p>
