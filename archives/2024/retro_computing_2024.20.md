## Riven

date: 2024-05-17, from: Digital Antiquarian

Sometimes success smacks you right in the face. More often, it sneaks up on you from behind. In September of 1993, the brothers Rand and Robyn Miller and the few other employees of Cyan, Inc., were prototypical starving artists, living on &#8220;rice and beans and government cheese.&#8221; That month they saw Brøderbund publish their esoteric [&#8230;]

## FreeDOS Edlin 2.24

date: 2024-05-16, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>Edlin is an awesome line-oriented editor. That means you edit one line at a time, not full-screen. Gregory Pietsch has released Edlin version 2.24 that moves the copyright and program info to the '?' help screen. It also changes the "Abort edit?" prompt when you exit to "Really quit?" I love these changes; I use Edlin to write quick batch files, like to capture some commands I just ran as a BAT file, and moving the copyright info to the '?' page means the commands don't scroll off the screen. Thanks Gregory! You can find the new version at <a class="" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freedos-edlin/">FreeDOS Edlin at SF</a> or mirrored at the FreeDOS Files Archive at Ibiblio under <a class="" href="https://ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/dos/edlin/2.24/" rel="nofollow">/files/dos/edlin</a>. We've also mirrored an EXE you can run.</p></div>

## Make your Pi4 and Pinebook Pro Quake

date: 2024-05-16, from: RiscOS Story

If you&#8217;re a fan of video games in general, and first person shooters in particular, another title in that genre has been given a little attention by R-Comp &#8211; this time it&#8217;s Quake. The update builds on the 2018 release of the game, which brought boosted performance to the game when run on more modern CPUs, adding support for floating point abilities of the processors, and profiles to take advantage of the higher resolution screens, and so on. The new version builds on that, with updated profiles for higher resolutions&#8230;

## StreetFix poll on linguistic nomenclature

date: 2024-05-16, from: RiscOS Story

Kevin Wells is adding multi-language support to his StreetFix application, which can be used to report and check up on local issues, such as potholes, broken bollards, street lights not working, and so on. To that end, he&#8217;s running a poll on whether the choice for the language name should be in English, or specified in the language in question &#8211; for example, should Swedish be identified as that, making it obvious for English speakers, or should it be Svenska, to make it clearer to Swedish speakers? The poll was&#8230;
