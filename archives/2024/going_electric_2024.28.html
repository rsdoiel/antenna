I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of

front to back. That dedication to real-world e-bike testing has helped
me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any
budget.

<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of July 2024. Summer is here in full force and it’s
time to make the most of the warm weather! Just like
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/">
ultra-competitive e-bike selling year</a> last year, 2024 has become the
year of the e-bike sales. So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any
one of which could become your next electric bike.
