After topping Hyundai in European sales last year, Kia expects a “bumpy

launched in Korea last month for just over $30,000. Once it lands in
Europe, <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/kia/">Kia</a> expects the
low-cost EV3 to boost its market share in the region.

design</a> and engineering studio iYacht GmbH unveiled a 55-foot
solar-electric sailing catamaran called the Hu’chu 55. Its makers

compelling challenges undertaken so far.” Built from over 90% scrap
metal, this vessel offers an admirable design lesson in circularity.
