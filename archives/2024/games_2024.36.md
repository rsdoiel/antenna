date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website

Ditto is an elusive Pokémon in Pokémon Go, as it disguises itself and you can’t actually just catch one straight-up. In order to find Ditto, you’ll want to find the Pokémon that it currently disguises itself as. For example, you may see a Diglett, and it’ll stay a Diglett once you tap on it, but [&#8230;]

The raid targets swap out every 10 days approximately, so you’ll definitely want to keep track on who is coming next. If you’re unfamiliar with raids, they spawn in gyms from 10 a.m. [&#8230;]

## Mass Effect: The Board Game prioritizes tactical action over space opera

date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-08-30, from: Polygon Website

Board games based on popular video game licenses, much like the recently released Borderlands, are — more often than not — a bit shit. The worst offenders are those that seek to directly port the gameplay experience note-for-note from a PC or console over to an analog format. That’s why I find Mass Effect: The [&#8230;]

## Best XM4 loadout, class build in the Black Ops 6 beta

date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website

The best XM4 loadout is likely to be the first gun you’ll kit out in the Black Ops 6 beta, because as with the case with almost every Call of Duty game, the jack-of-all-trades assault rifle is one of the first — and best — you unlock. Despite only a faction of what’s in the [&#8230;]

## Rings of Power is introducing moral grayness to a series that doesn’t need it

date: 2024-09-01, updated: 2024-09-01, from: Polygon Website

The universe of The Lord of the Rings is extremely complicated. There are Valar and Maiar, magic trees everywhere, ambiguously powerful rings, and at least two Dark Lords who want to throw the world into chaos. One thing that J.R.R. Tolkien always made plain in his universe, however, is the difference between the right side [&#8230;]

Thriller fans know by now to keep an eye out for new Jeremy Saulnier movies.

Even with Netflix’s recommendation algorithm serving you new movies, new TV shows, and original programming tailored to your viewing habits, the streaming service’s fire hose of content makes what’s coming difficult to parse.
