## Mass Effect: The Board Game prioritizes tactical action over space opera

date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-08-30, from: Polygon Website

Board games based on popular video game licenses, much like the recently released Borderlands, are — more often than not — a bit shit. The worst offenders are those that seek to directly port the gameplay experience note-for-note from a PC or console over to an analog format. That’s why I find Mass Effect: The [&#8230;]

date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website

The best XM4 loadout is likely to be the first gun you’ll kit out in the Black Ops 6 beta, because as with the case with almost every Call of Duty game, the jack-of-all-trades assault rifle is one of the first — and best — you unlock. Despite only a faction of what’s in the [&#8230;]

In 2024, you can’t throw a stone without hitting an anime fan — not literally, of course. But what once felt like an exclusive club has become a mainstream, global phenomenon, appearing on everything from major streaming services to giant movie screens. And millions of today’s anime fans have the same place to thank for [&#8230;]

## Rings of Power is introducing moral grayness to a series that doesn’t need it

date: 2024-09-01, updated: 2024-09-01, from: Polygon Website

The universe of The Lord of the Rings is extremely complicated. There are Valar and Maiar, magic trees everywhere, ambiguously powerful rings, and at least two Dark Lords who want to throw the world into chaos. One thing that J.R.R. Tolkien always made plain in his universe, however, is the difference between the right side [&#8230;]

## How Netflix’s Rebel Ridge navigated America’s two biggest taboos

Thriller fans know by now to keep an eye out for new Jeremy Saulnier movies. From his over-the-top horror debut Murder Party to the deceptively low-key one-two punch confrontation dramas of Blue Ruin and Green Room to the viciously chilly William Giraldi adaptation Hold the Dark, Saulnier specializes in moody films punctuated by shockingly graphic [&#8230;]

## Ok, but why do certain languages spoken with American intonations sound exactly like Simlish?

In the early hours of the morning, a TikTok video titled “Does Japanese with a California valley girl accent = Simlish?” popped up on my For You page. The algorithm knows me too well. In the video, creator oyasumisushi tests the hypothesis by quickly studying up on the California valley girl accent (think Cher in [&#8230;]

## Every movie and show coming to Netflix in September

date: 2024-09-01, updated: 2024-08-30, from: Polygon Website

Even with Netflix’s recommendation algorithm serving you new movies, new TV shows, and original programming tailored to your viewing habits, the streaming service’s fire hose of content makes what’s coming difficult to parse. This month brings the movie adaptation of 2005 YA dystopian novel Uglies. Better late than never! There’s also new seasons of Emily [&#8230;]
