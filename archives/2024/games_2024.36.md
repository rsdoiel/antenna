## Watching video games can be just as fun as playing them

date: 2024-09-03, updated: 2024-09-03, from: Polygon Website

What do you call a person who likes video games but doesn’t play video games? It might seem silly, but let’s talk. In sports, it’s normal to like a thing without doing a thing. Take basketball. We’ve got: So it follows that with video games, there are: Except that last one sounds off. I’ve never [&#8230;]

## Best C9 loadout, class build in the Black Ops 6 beta

date: 2024-09-03, updated: 2024-09-03, from: Polygon Website

The best C9 loadout in the Black Ops 6 beta is one of two SMGs you can get your hands on, and while it may not impress immediately out of the gate, as soon as it’s leveled up and given some solid attachments, it becomes a force to be reckoned with. It fires slower than [&#8230;]

## Prosecutor’s Gambit is the best Ace Attorney story since the original trilogy

date: 2024-09-03, updated: 2024-09-03, from: Polygon Website

The Ace Attorney Investigations Collection is closing a loop that’s been open a long time. The first Investigations game, a spinoff of the popular lawyer-based, detective-adjacent adventure games starring Phoenix Wright, was released in 2009 (or 2010 in English). Despite following fan-favorite prosecutorial rival Miles Edgeworth, it didn’t sell well, particularly in the West. And [&#8230;]

date: 2024-09-03, updated: 2024-08-30, from: Polygon Website

Wooloo, the sheep Pokémon from Galar, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Wooloo can be shiny in Pokémon Go! The adorable sheep orb, Wooloo, is a great shiny with its color scheme inverting.

## Rethinking Lara Croft was a ‘unique pressure,’ says Tomb Raider showrunner

date: 2024-09-03, updated: 2024-08-31, from: Polygon Website

Lara Croft is “adventurous.” She “hits hard.” She&#8217;s “slick,” “sleek,” “sexy,” and “proficient in dual-wielding pistols.” And the definition of all those qualities is something different to every player that has stepped into her boots over the last 30 years. So what does Lara Croft need to be to be Lara Croft?&#160; It’s a question [&#8230;]

## Pokémon Go Ditto disguises list for September 2024

date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-09-02, from: Polygon Website

Ditto is an elusive Pokémon in Pokémon Go, as it disguises itself and you can’t actually just catch one straight-up. In order to find Ditto, you’ll want to find the Pokémon that it currently disguises itself as. For example, you may see a Diglett, and it’ll stay a Diglett once you tap on it, but [&#8230;]

## Mass Effect: The Board Game prioritizes tactical action over space opera

date: 2024-09-02, updated: 2024-08-30, from: Polygon Website

Board games based on popular video game licenses, much like the recently released Borderlands, are — more often than not — a bit shit. The worst offenders are those that seek to directly port the gameplay experience note-for-note from a PC or console over to an analog format. That’s why I find Mass Effect: The [&#8230;]

## Rings of Power is introducing moral grayness to a series that doesn’t need it

date: 2024-09-01, updated: 2024-09-01, from: Polygon Website

The universe of The Lord of the Rings is extremely complicated. There are Valar and Maiar, magic trees everywhere, ambiguously powerful rings, and at least two Dark Lords who want to throw the world into chaos. One thing that J.R.R. Tolkien always made plain in his universe, however, is the difference between the right side [&#8230;]

Thriller fans know by now to keep an eye out for new Jeremy Saulnier movies.
