Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0617 AM CST Thu Dec 12 2024

Valid 121300Z - 131200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms appear unlikely through tonight.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
A mid/upper-level cyclone -- initially over northern ON -- will
break down as another develops across central QC today, within the
same larger-scale troughing regime.  As the resulting low ejects
northeastward over northern QC, and synoptic ridging moves from the
Rockies to the Plains States, heights will rise over most of the
central/eastern CONUS.  The air mass east of the Rockies mostly will
remain too dry and/or stable for thunderstorms, behind the cold
frontal passage related to the departing eastern trough.  One
exception may be in the lake-effect regimes east of the lower Great
Lakes, where steep low/middle-level lapse rates will support plumes
of heavy convective snow.  However, shallowness of buoyancy/ELs
precludes more than very brief/isolated lightning potential at most,
and the threat appears too conditional and limited for outlook
areas.

A cyclone now located off the coast of OR and northwestern CA will
move inland and devolve slightly to a strong shortwave trough,
reaching northern CA and western/southern NV by 00Z.  By 12Z, the
trough will reach southern ID, UT and AZ.  Strong DCVA/cooling aloft
is expected immediately to its east today and tonight, from the
Great Basin to the Colorado Plateau and UT/southwestern WY. 
However, with dry air in low levels over most of the region,
midlevel moisture/buoyancy should remain too weak and isolated for
enough lightning to justify an outlook area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0108 AM CST Thu Dec 12 2024

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to emerge across the southern
High Plains on Friday afternoon as a progressive upper wave
traverses the southern Rockies. Recent water-vapor imagery depicts
an upper wave off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. This feature
is expected to reach central NM by around peak heating on Friday. In
response to the arrival of the wave, an antecedent lee cyclone
across east/southeast CO will intensify with an attendant low-level
wind response. Recent ensemble guidance shows a strong signal for
sustained 20 mph winds across eastern NM into parts of the
northwestern TX Panhandle. The typically drier/windier deterministic
solutions hint that sustained winds up to 25 mph (gusting to 35-40
mph) are possible, and this appears reasonable given the favorable
timing of peak heating with the passage of a 40-50 knot 700 mb jet.
The downslope flow regime should promote RH reductions well into the
low teens, and possible into the single digits for some locations.
As such, widespread elevated to critical fire weather conditions
appear likely. The primary modulating factor is fuel status, which
appears unfavorable for fire spread based on recent ERC/fuel
guidance. However, finer 1-hour grasses may see sufficient drying to
support a fire concern for some areas.

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance is in good agreement that a deep upper trough
will be over much of the central and eastern CONUS early
D4/Wednesday morning. At the same time, a surface low is forecast to
be over eastern PA, with an attendant cold front extending
southwestward from this low across the central Carolinas,
southeastern GA, and northern FL.

A shortwave trough is forecast to move within the larger upper
troughing, moving from the TN Valley/Southeast through the
Mid-Atlantic on D4/Wednesday. This evolution will help induce a more
negative tilt to the parent troughing while encouraging an eastward
shift and deamplification as well. The cold front will also quickly
shift eastward off the East Coast. A fairly narrow warm sector may
precede this front, but poor lapse rates will limit instability.
This low buoyancy will counter the strong shear expected, resulting
in mostly weak updrafts and tempering any severe potential.

Stable conditions are expected across the CONUS on D5/Thursday as
high pressure shifts from the northern Plains into the OH Valley.
Some modest moisture return may potentially begin across TX on
D6/Friday ahead of a low-amplitude, southern-stream shortwave trough
expected to move across the southern Plains late D6/Friday and early
D7/Saturday. Guidance varies on the strength and speed of this wave,
limiting predictability, but some thunderstorms are possible across
central/east TX and LA late D6/Friday and early D7/Saturday as this
wave interacts with the return moisture.
