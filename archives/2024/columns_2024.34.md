## 2024-08-19 Something new: intrigue

date: 2024-08-23, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-19-something-new-intrigue">2024-08-19 Something new: intrigue</h1>

<p>A while ago, <a class="account" href="https://ttrpg-hangout.social/@enfors" title="@enfors@ttrpg-hangout.social">@enfors</a> said he wanted his sandbox generator supplement to have something special.
I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure what he was thinking of, but I started thinking about the things that I feel are under-explored.</p>

<p>A while ago, for example, I wondered: What would be the simplest game that emphasises how many friends you make, that rewards the size of the community you build?
Back in 2016 I wrote a game called <a href="2016-08-19_Romantic_Fantasy">Best Friends</a> that I never used.
It was <a href="2019-10-10_Non-adventure_games%3F">still an adventure game</a>.
Basically, replace your &ldquo;level&rdquo; with the number of friends you have.
Something like that.</p>

<p>But that still doesn&rsquo;t get into really new territory.
Something I would like to see is a system for how to run an intrigue as a party – including everybody at the table, for all the classes and skill profiles.
I feel that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> attempted to do this but the result wasn’t great, at least at my table.</p>

<p>Quoting my past self:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m also not too happy with A Song of Ice and Fire. We’ve only played three times, so I’m willing to give it more time. When I ran one of the sessions I basically split the party to the max since since all characters are so diverse. There is no D&amp;D like party and that also requires me to rethink my adventure design. – <a href="2010-04-08_Spring">2010-04-08 Spring</a></p>

<p>I can always switch into a movie director stance, go around the table, point at players, “now you!” and after a bit when the exchange happened and a die was maybe cast, “as we wait for that, we cut to…” and soon enough “in the mean time…” – and I do this aggressively, in small time slots. This results in a somewhat military style of pointing at people to let them know that now is their turn, while simultaneously waving at others to hold their thoughts, or maybe cutting talkative players off when they’re running too long. It’s weird, but when there’s a lot of players, or when there’s no party play to return to, it works well enough. We’ve made these kinds of mistakes in games where there are characters that are well suited for fighting and others that are not, with their players trying to solve problems by fighting, and players do not. This happened to me when I ran a one-shot of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>. It worked for a session, but it was exhausting and I don’t want to claim that it’s a good solution. It was simply a short term solution that worked, for me. Next time, however, make sure players create characters that will adventure together. – <a href="2021-02-27_Cohesion">2021-02-27 Cohesion</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the split into combat and intrigue that the game introduced wasn&rsquo;t good game design because it made sense from the perspective of emulating the books but it didn&rsquo;t make sense from the perspective of some people wanting to play a game together. Or maybe it just didn&rsquo;t fit my expectations of what it means to play together. Or maybe we just missed the implied recommendation to focus on either combat or intrigue and everybody having two characters, one for each domain. Or maybe just run either a combat campaign or an intrigue campaign.</p>

<p>So what I&rsquo;m looking for is a way to get intrigue results, using procedures like we do for combat or exploration, for dungeons or the wilderness. The goal is to bring about a change in leadership of a town, a gang, a castle, an army unit, or to succeed in an act of sabotage, to incite a rebellion – things that are either hand-waved or the party is hired for the dirty work while the non-player characters are the politicians and rabble-rousers. I know this can work. It&rsquo;s OK for the party to do the dirty work, to assassinate a tyrant and the non-player characters then taking the throne and similar things, but I want to go further. I want to involve all the players at the table. I want the players to think about the logistics of war, the organising and preparations of revolutions, the intricacies of marriage politics.</p>

<p>What if B/X D&amp;D went levels 1–3 is for dungeons, 4–6 is for the wilderness and 7–9 is <em>for politics</em>. Doesn&rsquo;t that sound fantastic? What sort of rules would you find in that third book? You would not get to name level by being a colonizer and clearing the land but by taking over an existing position of power – through intrigue. Oust the abbot, kick out the bishop, marry into the baron&rsquo;s family, take over the guild. With the help of your friends. Without resorting to combat, but with dice rolling.</p>

<p>The dice rolling and the procedures are important to me because otherwise it all goes in a direction I don’t like: <a href="2014-08-21_No_Dice">the referee decides everything and that is exhausting</a>.</p>

<p>Not something like Burning Wheel&rsquo;s Duel of Wits but something like social combat for Fate games, like the <a href="social-combat">social combat system in Diaspora</a>, for example. Note <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@bradjmurray" title="@bradjmurray@dice.camp">@bradjmurray</a>&rsquo;s most recent take on those rules: <a href="https://vscadotblog.wordpress.com/2020/02/20/social-combat-in-diaspora/">social combat in diaspora</a>.</p>

<p>This space deserves more attention.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23RPG">#RPG</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-20</strong>. I find that urban adventures suffer from the same problem. If it&rsquo;s just two or three buildings and those act like dungeons, my games work. If it&rsquo;s just social encounters that can be resolved with reaction rolls, my games work. But everything else in an urban environment seems to be politics, to me. And I have no good procedures to resolve those. So if anybody reading this is thinking about writing a blog post on the topic, I&rsquo;d love to read it.</p>

<p><strong>2024-08-23</strong>. I had forgotten about <a href="2023-11-19-building-blocks">2023-11-19 Campaign building blocks</a> but I’d love starting with a list like that. Lists of dangers, lists of means, lists of procedures, lists of goals.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-08-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

This is how I explained what sidebar art is: There's a certain kind of art I need to create with you. I call it "sidebar art" -- they are images between 75 and 135 pixels wide. The content is on a transparent background. They are designed to fit in the right margin of my blog at scripting.com. Please remember this definition, so you can help me create new sidebar art.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-08-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I'm trying to teach ChatGPT how to do sidebar art. So far, it's not a great student. But I have hope. My instructions for the image in the post in the sidebar for the previous post: "e pluribus unum" is the motto of the United States. Out of many one. I would like a simple picture of an eagle with this motto over its head, in the same style it is in on the back of a quarter coin.

What made me realize it is how natural the idea of <i>President Kamala</i> feels. Men and women are different, just like blacks and whites are different (it couldn't be otherwise) but we are all Americans, and further, taken together we all <i>are</i> America. All of this sprung from that <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/2012-05-24-how-red-and-blue-states-split-on-green-we-spend-differently.html">Obama quote</a> in his 2004 convention speech (which I was lucky to be present for, that was the year they welcomed bloggers). It's the one country that's the Union of all of us and we are United.

## Miscellany № 103: calculators!

## She is perfect

date: 2024-08-23, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>VP Harris gave the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtbUlKy1D7k">best speech</a> I've ever heard. </p>
<p>There were some great speeches at the DNC. Michelle Obama stood out. Bill Clinton, of course. But it was her show, President Kamala's, and she stole it. </p>
<p>She's perfect for our time. </p>
<p>A prosecutor running against a convicted felon.</p>
<p>A first generation American running against candidate who vilifies immigrants.</p>
<p>A woman running against a candidate who tried to enslave women. </p>
<p>A brilliant orator running against an incomprehensible bully.</p>
<p>Why wasn't she so impressive when she ran in 2019? Near as I can tell it wasn't the right time or circumstances. She needed the focus to be on her. Whatever it was, she is <i>perfect</i> for our time. </p>
<p>I was blown away by AOC's speech on Monday, and thought she's going to be a great president someday. And then on the last day, here's exactly what I was dreaming of. A grown-up version of AOC. Every bit as inspiring, as wonderful, as perfect. </p>
<p>She could be a combination of FDR and Lincoln. </p>
<p>She must be the next president. </p>
<p>And she's <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2024/08/19/kamala-harris-berkeley-homes">from</a> Berkeley! </p>

## 2024-08-22 One Page Dungeon Reviews

date: 2024-08-22, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-22-one-page-dungeon-reviews">2024-08-22 One Page Dungeon Reviews</h1>

<p>People are linking their <a href="https://www.dungeoncontest.com/">One Page Dungeon Contest</a> submissions in the Spiele Knights Discord.
For the moment, if somebody does that and explicitly asks for feedback or a review, I&rsquo;m happy to write a few words. I expect to be adding to this page over time.</p>

<p><a href="https://malachijs.itch.io/sundial-siphon">Sundial Siphon</a>: I love the myconid picture and map; I had to read the part about the rotating map multiple times and I&rsquo;m still not sure it really contributes to the game. Sometimes doors cannot be opened, sometimes some rooms cannot be reached, but I&rsquo;d have to see it at the table. I liked the colour coding of monsters and connections. It says twice &ldquo;Takes some time to clear&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s unclear what the drawback is since there are no random encounters? Is it a quarter rotation? Reading the Siphon makes me think that after 4 phases all player characters are trapped in constructs? That seems rather harsh. The dungeon says that that players are racing against the clock but I think players wouldn&rsquo;t know that, so some sort of warning might be apt? There&rsquo;s a warning in room 4 but I feel a better warning is required, or the siphon should only affect room 5? In any case, the dungeon seems promising! 😄</p>

<p><a href="https://peninsulancestral.itch.io/epona-temple">Epona&rsquo;s Temple</a>: I love the idea of achieving a permanent blessing of Epona. The map is beautiful. I feel that the map doesn&rsquo;t make clear which of the obstacles are easy to sidestep. Can people go from 3 to 5 without crossing 4 or 8? In 4 there&rsquo;s a presence of insects but it wasn&rsquo;t clear to mean what that entails since there are no insect stats. From a logic perspective the abandoned camp is puzzling. In any case, the rewards at the end are my favourite thing. They match the premise at the entrance and the theme of the temple itself. Love that. <em>E gostei muito de ver um versão que não seja Inglesa. Muito bem feito!</em> 😄</p>

## Ignore the NYT, part 2

date: 2024-08-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I have a feeling this thread is going to go a long way, maybe all the way. Maybe the last Ignore the NYT note will be "The NYT has been put out of its misery" in which case "Ignore the NYT" will be what everyone does, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Or maybe the last one will be when the owners of the NYT remember that the function of news is to simply report on what happened, and stop trying to control events. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Anyway -- today's ITNYT story goes like this. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure Trump has a negative net worth. That's what the trial in NY was about, the one which he was convicted on 34 counts of fraud which included lying to creditors about the value of collateral for loans.</p>
<p>Trump borrows money to pay off creditors he borrowed money from to pay off other creditors. This has been going on for many years. It's probably why he's such close friends with Putin (or wishes he was) because a daddy like Putin can play the role of Trump's actual daddy used to play, ie bailing him out from his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump:_The_Art_of_the_Deal">bullshit deals</a>. </p>
<p>It's a Ponzi type pyramid. He's probably been filing fraudulent statements about the value of various real estate he owns for a lot longer than we know. But he got caught and now hopefully he will go to jail for what he's been doing because it's quite illegal. </p>
<p>The NYT in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/20/us/dnc-fact-check/take-it-from-an-actual-billionaire-trump-is-rich-in-only-one-thing-stupidity?smid=url-share">this fact-check</a>, relies on Forbes' opinion of Trump's net worth -- which is based on the value of his Truth Social stock (good for them for not falling for the same bullshit the banks did). But that's a pretty weak foundation, too, btw -- given that Trump probably couldn't squeeze a billion dollars out of that stock without crashing the value of the stock, in other words, come on -- that's <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/08/11/bullshit2.m4a">bullshit</a>. </p>
<p>In any case, there's a good argument to be made that Trump's negative net worth in everything but Truth Social stock on a balance sheet would negate even the full value of his stock. </p>

## 2024-08-22 Life offline

date: 2024-08-22, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-22-life-offline">2024-08-22 Life offline</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been having a conversation about life offline on the <a href="2024-08-20-offline-bbs">offline bulleting board system</a>.</p>

<p>I wonder: what do we do, offline?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get into the flow of writing blog posts offline, but I
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s working.</p>

<p>I think what I&rsquo;d like to be doing more of (what tense does one use
when you think you should be wanting to do a thing but looking back
over the years it turns out you never do them): making music.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m but a dabbler. I try to practice the alto recorder every now and
then, and I have a handful of electronic instruments that I used to
make super-short <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/podcast/jingles/">jingles for my podcast</a>.
The goal was to never use a
jingle twice. As you can see, the fragments got more interesting over
the years, but I also stopped making new podcast episodes. Too bad!</p>

<p>What I actually managed to do more of: running. I recently managed to
run 22km. Yay me! It wasn&rsquo;t a race. I don&rsquo;t like racing and competitions. My wife
loves the associated rituals, the people, the masses, the
anticipation, but I like it best when I just lose myself in thoughts,
low on oxygen, step step step step step and on and on.</p>

<p>I think I was most influenced by the book &ldquo;Born to Run&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re new to jogging, I think there are a few principles that help:</p>

<ol>
<li>better to go often for short runs than to go rarely for long runs</li>
<li>better to go so slow so that you can talk to the person jogging next to you</li>
<li>get used to run in every weather except thunderstorms and the like</li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure to smile while you&rsquo;re jogging!</p>

<p>After a while, the benefits of running assert themselves. When I&rsquo;m
troubled, I wish I could go for a run. I look forward to putting on my
running sandals and just go go go and lose myself.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m trying to do less of: endlessly refreshing my fediverse
feeds. I have three accounts, one using a self-hosted GoToSocial
instance, one for English role-playing games on a Mastodon instance,
and one for German role-playing games on a different Mastodon
instance. There&rsquo;s something about social media and talking to people
that fascinates my monkey brain.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="2024-08-06-pocket-reform">new laptop</a> that I felt was going to be my &ldquo;offline&rdquo; laptop
but it&rsquo;s not working out that way, sadly. In terms of getting ideas, the
fediverse is still the medium where I get into conversations with
people and that then has me writing longer blog posts. I don&rsquo;t mind
this so much. <a href="2021-09-17_Writing_to_learn">Writing is learning</a>, I guess. But it means I can&rsquo;t just
write without some conversation preceding it.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are some solitary big thoughts thinkers out there. Or
perhaps I&rsquo;ve been raised in the expectation that only solitary
thinkers have big thoughts. I find myself flourishing in the dialogue,
in the back and forth.</p>

## Why I feel bad about Biden

date: 2024-08-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Podcast: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/22/whyIFeelBadAboutWhatHappenedToPresidentBidenInAPersonalWay.m4a">17 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>Note: You can skip the first five minutes, it's a long preamble on a different subject. I left it in because it's interesting imho. </p>
<p>It's possible that what happened to Joe Biden in the debate is like something that happened to me almost ten years ago when I was turning 60. I tell the story in this podcast. It's still possible he was the best choice to go against Trump. We'll know soon enough. But there's something to learn here. No one wants their life to be over. No one wants to be thanked. They want you to let them keep going. The thing is that all through life people say you can't do what you then go on to do. It happens over and over. One day, after a life of accomplishment, you realize everyone refers to you in the past tense, but you're still here, you want to keep doing the stuff you do so well. But they won't let you. That's why I feel bad about what happened with President Biden, because I've had the experience myself. Anyway what's done is done, we all have to get behind soon-to-be President Harris. And stand behind her as she is attacked, and they try to get rid of her. </p>
<p>Anyway, the substance of this podcast, which I recorded yesterday, doesn't start until 5:25. Up until then it's a rambling story about Fox News and how a little truth slipped out when they covered the assassination attempt on Trump a few weeks ago. You can skip over that part if you don't find it interesting, but I hope you do listen to the part when I had an experience that may have been like Biden's at the debate, and how it was probably just a panic attack -- these things happen -- our candidates are people, and they have bodies that do strange things sometimes. No matter what I feel for Biden and that's the story I wanted to tell here. </p>
<p>Thanks for listening. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

## Andorra

date: 2024-08-22, from: mrusme blog

"Andorra, officially the Principality of Andorra, is a sovereign landlocked
country on the Iberian Peninsula, in the eastern Pyrenees, bordered by France
to the north and Spain to the south. Believed to have been created by
Charlemagne, Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988, when it was
transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell. The present principality
was formed by a charter in 1278. It is currently headed by two co-princes: the
bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain and the president of France. Its capital
and largest city is Andorra la Vella."

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-08-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Speaking of Michelle Obama, she made the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-whos-going-to-tell-trump-that-hes-campaigning-for-a-black-job-michelle-obama-asks">most powerful political statement</a> I've ever heard. "Who's going to tell Trump the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs." The way she said it made you think. Here we are, and one way or another, we <i>have</i> changed. America in 2024 is vastly different from the American of 2008. America is moving both toward self-acceptance and away from it at the same time. But here in the half of America my feet are planted in, we realize that there isn't a black America and a white America, there's just one America. We finally have come to accept ourselves as we have been all along.

Thinking about what <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3l2alzdfd2w2j">Michelle Obama said</a> last night in her fantastic DNC speech. “We don’t get to change the rules so we always win.” She was talking about Trump, but it also <a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/">applies to Google</a>. There should be opportunities for independent developers to create for the web without having big tech companies be our gatekeepers. The web is a public resource. Of course big companies will take whatever isn't nailed down. It's way past time to protect the open web.

I would love to hook up my <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/dwPocketcastSubscriptions.opml">subscriptions</a> from PocketCasts to dave.podcatch.com, so that I could add to the website from my freaking phone. Make it really easy for me to pitch a great podcast feed to my friends. But I can only export my feeds, I can't create a dynamic link between the two. If I ran a popular podcatch app like Pocketcasts, I would open up my outbound subscription list, and vie to be the default place people come to subscribe to podcasts. If a few of my users were geeks and visionaries, they could start telling other vendors they should hook up to my source lists, so they can use Pocketcasts to subscribe. One place to subscribe is way better than many. If you think things like that can't happen, think again. How did you all come to use <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> for your subscription lists? It's because someone volunteered to go first, and the users of that product demanded that other products support the format. It still amazes me that there's an interchange format there, but we've barely begun to tap into the power there.

## For photos collages & crops, try Series

date: 2024-08-21, from: Om Malik blog

When I was looking to crop a landscape photo into a panorama, I discovered an app called Series. It’s a collage application that divides images for posting on Threads, Instagram’s microblogging platform. You can also use it to produce photos in sizes suitable for Twitter, Instagram, or other social media sites.  On Threads, users can create a photo carousel. However, when images are precisely divided, users can reconstruct a complete wide-angle view that fills the screen. The panoramic effect becomes apparent as users move through the photos, producing &#8230;

A new kind of programming is possible, and it's better. </p>

## Astroturfing

date: 2024-08-20, from: David Rosenthal's blog

I seem to be stuck on the theme of cryptocurrency gaslighting with two weeks ago <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/08/more-cryptocurrency-gaslighting.html"><i>More Cryptocurrency Gaslighting </i></a> and one week ago <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/08/greenwashing.html"><i>Greenwashing</i></a>. Now I look at cryptocurrency gaslighting in the political arena, where it is termed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
it is defined as the process of seeking electoral victory or legislative relief for grievances by helping political actors find and mobilize a sympathetic public, and is designed to create the image of public consensus where there is none. Astroturfing is the use of fake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots">grassroots</a> efforts that primarily focus on influencing public opinion and typically are funded by corporations and political entities to form opinions.

Currently, the crypto-bros have poured money into primaries, defeated several incumbents deemed to be insufficiently crypto-friendly, and have accumulated an immense war-chest for November's general election. This pot of gold was enough to turn Trump from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57392734">crypto-skeptic</a> to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-proposes-bitcoin-solution-35-061830288.html">telling Maria Bartiromo</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Who knows, maybe we’ll pay off our $35 trillion dollar [national debt], hand them a little crypto check, right? We’ll hand them a little Bitcoin and wipe away our $35 trillion
</blockquote>
Below the fold I discuss the gaslighting the cryptosphere is using in their massive attempt to purchase "regulatory clarity", and what the scale of this investment suggests about the profits they expect to garner if it succeeds.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Why does astroturfing exist? Lobbyists going to politicians and saying "I know your constituents don't want you to vote X, but if you do I'll give you a boiat-load of money" make the politicians uncomfortable. The lobbyists need to cover this unpleasant reality with a fig-leaf.  So on 10<sup>th</sup> May <a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DCG_HarrisPoll-Research-Report.pdf"><i>Crypto Attitudes in Swing States</i></a>, a poll by Harris for the Digital Currency Group appeared. It polled 1201 registered voters in April. Jasper Goodman's <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/10/trump-crypto-biden-00157051"><i>Crypto is Trump’s new weapon against Biden</i></a> reported that:<br />
<blockquote>
A <a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/swingstatevoter/">poll released by crypto industry groups</a> this week showed that more than 20 percent of voters in six key swing states identify crypto as a major issue. <a href="https://policy.paradigm.xyz/writing/March-2024-Polling">A separate nationwide survey</a> of registered voters commissioned by the crypto firm Paradigm found that crypto ownership is higher among communities of color and young people — key constituencies that helped boost Biden in 2020 but are now proving to be challenging for him to win over.<br />
<br />
Crypto has gained support from politicians on the right who tout it as an alternative to the mainstream financial system. The Paradigm poll found earlier this year that crypto owners favor Trump over Biden, 48 percent to 39 percent, with 13 percent undecided.

Three weeks later Molly White had had time to analyze the poll and in <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/2024-cryptocurrency-election-spending/"><i>Cryptocurrency companies have raised over $135 million to influence US elections this cycle, and they’re just getting started</i></a> she wrote:<br />
<blockquote>
In reality, their poll of 1,201 American voters in six swing states is a masterclass in spin. 69% of the people surveyed had “very” or “somewhat” negative opinions towards crypto, but DCG is crowing that “Among a sizeable contingent of voters, crypto attracts a level of interest that translates into pro-crypto sentiments across the board” and advising political candidates to adopt pro-crypto stances to attract voters. Many of the questions were framed ambiguously — such as the “Crypto is a major issue I’m considering during the next election” one — which allowed DCG to put “21% agree” in big letters while obfuscating the fact that those who agreed were not necessarily crypto supporters. In fact, if you do the math, more than 100 of the 252 people (~40%) who said they felt crypto was a major issue in upcoming elections do not feel positively towards crypto — in other words, there's a contingent of fellow skeptics among that 21%, who are likely hoping for candidates who might support more aggressive approaches against the industry.<br />
</blockquote>
White extracted the agree/disagree data from the Harris poll and generated a useful chart. From it I extracted the questions that two out of three respondents somewhat or strongly disagreed with in this table.<br />
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="5" cols="2" rules="groups">
<thead>
<tr><th>Disagreement</th><th>Question</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>80%</td><td><small>Crypto is a major issue I'm considering in the next election</small></td></tr>
<tr><td>74%</td><td><small>Crypto is more equitable than the traditional financial system</small></td></tr>
<tr><td>73%</td><td><small>Crypto is meant for people like me</small></td></tr>
<tr><td>73%</td><td><small>I pay attention to political candidates positions on crypto</small></td></tr>
<tr><td>71%</td><td>I<small>t is easier for people to be financially successful with crypto ...</small></td></tr>
<tr><td>65%</td><td><small>Crypto is the future of transacting</small></td></tr>
<tr><td>65%</td><td><small>I'm concerned about legislation that would interfere with crypto</small></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
This is not a pro-crypto sample. I have to agree with White that DGC is gaslighting the results. She <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/2024-cryptocurrency-election-spending/">concluded</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Frankly, it just doesn't seem likely to me that a substantial number of people are single-issue crypto voters and would be swayed to vote for a candidate they might not otherwise support because of it. Many of the people celebrating Trump's recent crypto U-turn were probably already planning to vote for him, and I doubt there were many crypto-skeptical people out there previously who didn't otherwise support Trump, but who intended to vote for him because of his former position on the industry.
</blockquote>
The most worrying answer is that 73% of the sample are not paying attention to candidates' positions on cryptocurrencies; this gives the candidates license to ignore their constituents' anti-crypto views.<br />

Covered by this bogus fig-leaf, the tsunami of money started flowing. May 30<sup>th</sup> saw some of the first reports of money with Hannah Miller and Olga Kharif's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-30/andreessen-horowitz-a16z-donates-25-million-to-crypto-pac-fairshake"><i>Andreessen Horowitz Donates $25 Million to Fairshake PAC</i></a> and Molly White's <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/2024-cryptocurrency-election-spending/"><i>Cryptocurrency companies have raised over $135 million to influence US elections this cycle, and they’re just getting started</i></a>.
White went on to start <a href="https://www.followthecrypto.org/"><i>Follow the crypto</i></a>, a site devoted to tracking the cryptosphere's political fundraising and donations. Much of this post is based on White's research.<br />
<br />
Initially, the crypto-bros had consideable success by pouring money into defeating crypto-skeptics in primaries, as the Emily Wilkins' <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/crypto-pac-house-senate-elections.html"><i>Crypto industry super PAC is 33-2 in primaries, with $100 million for House, Senate races</i></a> reported on 26<sup>th</sup> June:<br />
<blockquote>
A super PAC bankrolled by a small group of crypto companies has backed the winning candidate in 33 of the 35 House and Senate primary races it entered.<br />
<br />
Fairshake PAC kicks off the general election season with a strong track record and at least $100 million to spend on crypto-friendly candidates for Congress.
</blockquote>
Wilkins made two important <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/crypto-pac-house-senate-elections.html">observations</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The PAC has spent tens of millions already on ads that rarely mention crypto. Instead, the messages they deliver are about “fairness” and “integrity.”
</blockquote>
Note that the crypto-bros aren't fooled by their gaslighting; they know that the vast majority of the voters are anti-crypto.
Molly White's <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-64/"><i>Pointing its arsenal at our friends</i></a> makes the point:<br />
<blockquote>
I’ve noted before that, despite the industry’s attempts to convince incumbent politicians, candidates, campaign managers, and anyone else who will listen that there is a major bloc of single-issue voters who will vote for people with pro-crypto policy stances, the people in charge of actually running strategy don’t seem to truly believe it. Ads run by the Fairshake PAC and related crypto-focused super PACs make no mention of cryptocurrency, for example, suggesting that those behind them understand that it’s not an issue that’s likely to sway voters.
</blockquote>
Wilkins' second <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/crypto-pac-house-senate-elections.html">observation is</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Of the $160 million in total contributions Fairshake has raised since it was founded, around $155 million — or 94% — can be traced back to just four companies: Ripple, Andreesen Horowitz, Coinbase and Jump Crypto.
</blockquote>
And note the classic astroturfing; a PAC funded by a few huge companies claiming to represent the "<a href="https://www.security.org/digital-security/cryptocurrency-annual-consumer-report/">40% of American adults now own crypto</a>". This is more gaslighting. Other crypto-friendly sites claim "<a href="https://coinweb.com/trends/how-many-americans-own-crypto/">14% of US adults own cryptocurrencies</a>".<br />
<br />
Grifters like Trump know which side their bread is buttered. Already by 7<sup>th</sup> June Alexandra Ulmer was writing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-pitches-himself-crypto-president-san-francisco-tech-fundraiser-2024-06-07/"><i>Trump pitches himself as 'crypto president' at San Francisco tech fundraiser</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump presented himself as a champion for cryptocurrency and slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector during a San Francisco fundraiser on Thursday, three sources present told Reuters.<br />
<br />
Trump raised $12 million from the fundraiser hosted by tech venture capitalists David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya at Sacks' home in the swanky Pacific Heights neighborhood.
</blockquote>
Four days later David Pan reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/trump-meets-bitcoin-btc-miners-in-his-latest-pro-crypto-overture"><i>Trump Meets Bitcoin Miners in His Latest Pro-Crypto Overture</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Several Bitcoin miners met with former president Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night, according to Matthew Schultz, executive chairman at crypto mining company CleanSpark Inc.<br />
<br />
Trump told attendees that he loves and understands cryptocurrency, adding that Bitcoin miners help to stabilize energy supply from the grid, according to Schultz. Trump said he’d be an advocate for miners in the White House, Schultz added.
</blockquote>
This culminated on 27<sup>th</sup> July at the recent <a href="https://bitcoin2024.b.tc/">Bitcoin2024</a> gathering of the faithful with a bizarre <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiEIfBatnH8">48-minute rambling monologue</a> that was mostly a rehash of his stump speech.<br />
<br />
Six days earlier, Joe Biden had dropped out of the race, disrupting the crypto-bros plans.
Molly White <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-64/">observes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But it does seem that some of the more gullible executives and figureheads within the crypto world have themselves been bamboozled by the <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/2024-cryptocurrency-election-spending/">questionable numbers and creatively interpreted polls</a>. The feeling among that group is not that they need to pursue a positive relationship with a possible future Harris administration, but rather that this supposed crypto vote will decide the election, and that they are its gatekeepers.
</blockquote>
Like me, Cory Doctorow leverages White's research in <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/31/greater-fools/#coinbased"><i>The largest campaign finance violation in US history</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<tt>
But the real whale that's backstopping the crypto campaign spending is Coinbase, through its Fairshake crypto PAC. Coinbase has donated $45,500,000 to Fairshake, which is a lot:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/how-to-get-regulatory-clarity-for-crypto&lt;">https://www.coinbase.com/blog/how-to-get-regulatory-clarity-for-crypto</a><br />
<br />
But $45.5m isn't merely a large campaign contribution: it appears that $25m of that is the largest illegal campaign contribution by a federal contractor in history, "by far," a fact that was sleuthed out by Molly White:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/coinbase-campaign-finance-violation/">https://www.citationneeded.news/coinbase-campaign-finance-violation/</a><br />
<br />
At issue is the fact that Coinbase is bidding to be a US federal contractor: specifically, they want to manage the crypto wallets that US federal cops keep seizing from crime kingpins. Once Coinbase threw its hat into the federal contracting ring, it disqualified itself from donating to politicians or funding PACs:
</tt>
</blockquote>
How wonderful is it that this great country enjoys the blessings of democracy? Just imagine how much money the companies donating to these PACs stand to make from obtaining "regulatory clarity" if they are "investing" close to $200M in a <i>chance</i> to get it.<br />
<br />
<b>Update 23<sup>rd</sup> August</b><br />
<br />
I posted this too soon. Enough has happened in the last few days to justify an update:<br />
<ul>
<li>Will a Harris administration provide "regulatory clarity"? I commented on
Hadriana Lowenkron's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-21/harris-supports-policies-to-expand-crypto-industry-aide-says"><i>Harris Supports Policies to Expand Crypto Industry, Aide Says</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
"Vice President Kamala Harris will back measures to help grow digital assets, a policy adviser to her campaign said, highlighting efforts to court an emerging cryptocurrency industry expanding its political influence.
</blockquote>
But Protos had a skeptical take in <a href="ttps://protos.com/kamala-harris-pro-crypto-policy-is-yet-more-fake-news/"><i>Kamala Harris ‘pro-crypto policy’ is yet more fake news</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Another day, another fake Kamala Harris headline. Already <a href="https://x.com/i/trending/1826630020162273675">this week</a>, we’ve heard all about her <a href="https://protos.com/crypto-runs-with-fake-kamala-harris-gary-gensler-news/">non-appointment of Gary Gensler</a> and her non-existent <a href="https://protos.com/fake-news-again-this-time-its-kamala-harris-and-unrealized-crypto-gains/">unrealized crypto gains tax</a>, and today we have to point out that the 2024 White House hopeful hasn’t adopted a ‘pro-crypto policy.’<br />
...<br />
Well, rather than Harris suddenly adopting a pro-crypto platform to boost her presidential campaign, Bloomberg published an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-21/harris-supports-policies-to-expand-crypto-industry-aide-says">article</a>.<br />
<br />
Specifically, behind its paywall, it ran the quote, “She’s going to support policies that ensure that emerging technologies and that sort of industry can continue to grow.”<br />
<br />
That quote related only broadly to the ‘crypto community’ and didn’t come from Harris or her spokesperson. It was actually said by Brian Nelson, <b>a mere campaign advisor</b>.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
Exercising traditional bothsiderism, Bloomberg's Editorial Board weighed in with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-08-23/kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-shouldn-t-pander-to-crypto-people"><i>Harris and Trump Shouldn't Pander to the Crypto Crowd</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Just <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2023-supplement-economic-well-being-us-households-202405.pdf">1% of Americans</a> say they used them for a payment or money transfer last year. More often crypto is used to move money outside of government oversight. That’s helpful for criminals, terrorists and anyone under sanctions. But these are hardly the constituencies that a presidential candidate should be soliciting. Nor should policymakers be encouraging people to park their savings in digital wallets instead of stocks, bonds and other assets that support the real economy.<br />
<br />
Instead, candidates should promise to work with Congress and regulators to ensure that the rules applied to cryptocurrencies are consistent with existing laws on fraud, money laundering and sanctions enforcement.
</blockquote>
What is the chance that this would happen in a Trump administration?</li>
<li>
The answer had come the day before the Editorial Board's vain hand-waving.
MacKenzie Sigalos' <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/trump-crypto-defi-protocol-launch.html"><i>Trump promotes family’s new crypto platform, ‘The Defiant Ones’</i></a> made it crystal clear:<br />
<blockquote>
Former President Donald Trump on Thursday promoted a soon-to-launch, Trump Organization crypto platform, “The DeFiant Ones” to his 7.5 million followers on Truth Social<br />
...<br />
“For too long, the average American has been squeezed by the big banks and financial elites,” Trump wrote. “It’s time we take a stand — together.”<br />
<br />
The post marks the first time the Republican nominee for president has used his personal platform to promote the as yet unactivated digital bank. Within minutes, his son Donald Trump Jr., shared the post with his 12 million X followers.
</blockquote>
Trump's floundering Truth Social posted a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-earnings-results-revenue-4f6701cbebcbc5c9ed5079ab096cb346">$16.4M loss</a> on revenue of $837K (down 30% year-on-year). The stock is currently down 75% from the peak and Trump is widely expected to pull the rug out from holders by dumping his stock in the next few weeks. Thus he needs to find a new grift to replace DJT, and this is clearly it.  The probability that "The Defiant Ones" will be rug-pulled is close to 100%.
</li>
</ul>
I should expand on the last point in the original post. Corporations making large political contributions are making a similar calculation to VCs investing in startups. The return on investment each time is likely to be negative, but the return on the occasional winner is enough to wipe out the losses and leave a healthy profit. This leaves two questions that are rarely asked:<br />
<ul>
<li>How much profit will the contributors garner if their wishes are granted?</li>
<li>Where will this profit come from? In other words, if the contributors are the winners, who are the losers?</li>
</ul>
The history of cryptocurrencies suggests that the profit will be large and the losers will be the retail "investors".<br />

## The Daily Kitten

date: 2024-08-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I do a daily episode of the adventures of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Wordle+Kitty">Wordle Kitty</a> as art I do with ChatGPT, on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2314356502105075&set=a.113966572144090&notif_id=1724164406352558&notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&ref=notif">Facebook</a>. There often is a NY Times headline in the image, saying something silly like how prisons are dealing with an influx of convicted house pets (like the kitten). </p>
<p>In this <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/20/kittyInPrison.png">drawing</a> the NYT is reporting on how the kitten loves lasagna, and of course how cute she is (it's important to emphasize that in the AI prompt because otherwise you get less cute kittens in the drawing). </p>
<p>This is therapeutic. Finally I can see the NYT doing something useful! Keeping me entertained while we try to get through this election.

## Ignore the NY Times

date: 2024-08-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>When President Biden took the stage last night at the DNC, I had a moment of buyer's remorse. He looked so good in his black suit, and the pictures of the new candidates, and their spouses, looked comical in comparison to the <i>president</i> who was about to speak. </p>
<p>Why did Walz have a permanent frown on his face. I find his presence next to Harris is almost always awkward. He's taller, and moves a lot. I noticed this with Sanders when he was debating Clinton in 2016. She stood still and Sanders waved his hands a lot. She spoke quietly, he shouted. </p>
<p>Biden shouted last night, and he was mostly unplugged. On the team, but you have to wonder, how did the journos get so much power that they could force this change. He gave a fine speech. I'm not sure that pushing him aside, net-net, was a win for us. Maybe Harris will be a sugar high.</p>
<p>One thing I know for sure, the new Democratic Party must not make the mistake that Biden did, must not subjugate itself to the press. When they go on the attack, you must respond. Break their wall of objectivity, these people are political players, and so far not subject to rebuttal. That must end. If they want to be in the middle, then don't pretend they aren't. </p>
<p>They will yell about the First Amendment, which also applies to elected leaders and candidates for office, and there is no special right for publications like the NYT, they have no immunity to First Amendment speech about them. </p>
<p>To the extent we can, it's time to push them aside. </p>
<p>When someone quotes the NYT in frustration, I have a mantra I repeat over and over, "Ignore the NY Times." I'm going to paste it in 25 times now so you get the idea. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. </p>

Today would have been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22eve+winer%22">my mother's</a> 92nd birthday. She died in 2018, and I still haven't, deep inside, fully gotten the message that she's gone. Probably the most significant person in my life. I find most of my adult relationships can be traced back to my relationship with her.

Note: I had a quote here that <a href="https://www.threads.net/@actor_keanureeves_59/post/C-2Xy0mtOk4">appeared</a> to be from actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keanu_Reeves">Keanu Reeves</a>. It was a good sentiment, but it apparently was not from Reeves. Thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@andypiper@macaw.social/112995751255063774">Andy Piper</a> for catching this. Here's the quote. "If you see someone falling behind, walk beside them. If you see someone being ignored, find a way to include them. Always remind people of their worth. One small act could mean the world to them."

## Elon bought the airport

date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Elon Musk bought the biggest airport on the social web. A major world hub like Atlanta, <a href="https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-london-heathrow-lhr">London</a> or Dubai. </p>
<p>Bluesky is a regional airport in a cool place, maybe Austin. </p>
<p>Mastodon is a network of airports, like the ones served by <a href="https://www.ryanair.com/us/en/cheap-flight-destinations">Ryanair</a> in Europe. </p>
<p>Threads is potentially one of the big airports like the one Musk bought, but it's not as much of a hub yet. <a href="https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-orlando-mco">Orlando</a>? <a href="https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-from-frankfurt-fra">Frankfurt</a>? </p>
<p>There are lots of scheduled flights in and out of X because it's where most of the traffic already goes. It's quite possibly not running that smoothly, like perhaps JFK in NYC, always a mess, under construction, huge traffic, broken systems. </p>
<p>But it does actually work pretty reliably most of the time. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/11/14/weTryHarder.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">When I was first getting started in tech, when we got the initial angel funding for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext">LVT</a>, I asked the lead investor, Bill Jordan, if Apple was going to go out of business. At the time, 1983, a lot of people said it would. He asked what their sales were. $1 billion, I said. He said they're not going away. Companies that large don't disappear. After 40 years of experience in tech since then, Bill was right. Companies that lead markets very rarely disappear. It <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Computer_Corporation">does</a> happen. But not often. More likely is Musk will right the ship, and it will grow to dominate the market. Threads will possibly be Pepsi or Avis. Mastodon will be Home Depot. Bluesky will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Canyon,_Los_Angeles#Counterculture_of_the_1960s_and_1970s">Laurel Canyon</a>. Or who knows? </p>
<p>But there's a high probability that Musk's company will be the market leader for the forseeable future. </p>

The Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext">page</a> for Living Videotext begins with one of our slogans. It was a joke, and meant to keep us humble, so we listen to users. It was one of many such slogans. LVT made some important contributions to the networks we use today. Wikipedia should talk about that first, show some respect, for crying out loud. Otherwise, except for that snipe up front, the account is actually pretty accurate.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

It's nice to see the DNC <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/the-democratic-national-convention-is-giving-influencers-media-credentials-for-the-first-time-why-both-campaigns-are-pivoting-to-social-first-strategies-110059052.html">including influencers</a> this year. I hear them say this is the first time, but I beg to disagree. A few dozen bloggers were <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/07/07.html">at the DNC in 2004</a>, and were treated well, in many ways. I think the word influencer and blogger have fairly similar meanings. Blogger is a broader term, because it's possible to have a very small readership for a blog, thus not be influencing very much, but still have a lot of value. And you always can influence your mom and little sister, right? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

This isn't exactly a new <a href="https://this.how/rulesForJournalism/">rule for journalism</a>, but it's worth mentioning anyway. If you wouldn't want to read the piece yourself, don't let them put your name on it. Example. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/18/us/politics/kamala-harris-2010-debate.html?unlocked_article_code=1.EE4.7g6L.aTYQ0sm2Xwz6&smid=url-share">story</a> promises to tell you about 47 seconds that saved Kamala Harris's career. They do eventually tell you the words, but you have to wade through a lot of pointless bullshit to get to it. If I were writing it, the first words of the piece would have to be the words, and then explain it. You've seen this over and over and it gets worse all the time. I still don't understand why they do it, if I'm reading the piece, I'm a paying subscriber, right? Another example of disrespect, quit trying to upsell paying customers. Once a month maybe, but not every 8th time I visit your site. Most businesses have no regard for their customers' time, but the ones that do, really make an impression.

## Reliable app storage over time is not here yet

date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I'm working on a project which may or may not ship, but it presents an interesting design challenge either way.</p>
<p>The idea is I want to write lots of little bits, less than 5000 characters each, they have titles, use styling, links, include images, etc. </p>
<p>Or it could also be as small as a single emoji.</p>
<p>This is what we've settled on in 2024 as the basic unit of writing. From a tweet to a long blog post. </p>
<p>I want to make an editor and storage system that fits this model perfectly based on all we know about this stuff, and the latest server and network technologies. </p>
<p>It should have the best simplest API we know how to make in 2024.</p>
<p>In every way it'll be the nicest, fastest and most flexible way to create structures of writing over time.</p>
<p>In that last sentence is the gotcha -- <i>over time. </i>It's the frontier, the leading edge. Because in 2024 there's no way for me, as an individual developer to create a structure that lasts over time.  </p>
<p>I can create a structure that has a high probability of lasting a month. A pretty good chance of lasting a few years, but beyond that, it gets less likely probably at a pretty good clip and eventually goes over a cliff. </p>
<p>The way I have answered that in the past was with GitHub.</p>
<p>In 2017, I started an <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog">archive</a> of my <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> writing on GitHub. It's still just a fraction of my writing, I'm not doing anything like that for all my other sites and services. But at least I've managed to set up a system that only requires me to do something once a month, which is something I like to do because it gives me some assurance the other mechanisms are still working. Archive systems have bugs too.</p>
<p>So I guess for the project I'm doing I will again use GitHub to mirror the content in the database until and unless GitHub proves unusable for this purpose, or something much better comes along.  </p>
<p>Note that GitHub has made no promise about the continued availability of their service, all we have to go on is that they have been reliable for enough time to present the <i>illusion</i> of persistence. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

## Feeds for Threads

date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I was <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kvell">kvelling</a> the other day <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C-wOWuDJUU6">about rss.app</a> and how they have feeds for <a href="https://www.threads.net/">Threads</a> accounts. They do. But there are two caveats.</p>
<ol>
<li>It <a href="https://rss.app/pricing">costs</a> $9.99 per month for 15 feeds. Could be a bit expensive for some people's budgets.</li>
<li><img class="imgRightMargin" src="http://scripting.com/images/2023/07/02/validRss.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The second concern is more serious. It doesn't handle titleless items properly. It repeats the contents of the tweet in the title and description of the feeds it generates. An <a href="https://feeder.scripting.com/returnjson?feedurl=https://rss.app/feeds/3A2qGRnWMHFk5DvE.xml">example</a>. This is not right, and it's not the way Mastodon and Bluesky do it. There's nothing wrong with items that have no titles. When an item has no title you do the common sense thing -- omit the title. I'm happy to help with this. I wrote the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0 spec</a>, and am something of an authority on this. It's important to get this right.</li>

## The State of Ransomware

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-15, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Palo Alto Networks published its <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-ransomware-leak-site-data-analysis/">semi-annual report</a> on ransomware. From the Executive Summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unit 42 monitors ransomware and extortion leak sites closely to keep tabs on threat activity. We reviewed compromise announcements from 53 dedicated leak sites in the first half of 2024 and found 1,762 new posts. This averages to approximately 294 posts a month and almost 68 posts a week. Of the 53 ransomware groups whose leak sites we monitored, six of the groups accounted for more than half of the compromises observed.</p>
<p>In February, we reported a 49% increase year-over-year in alleged victims posted on ransomware leak sites. So far, in 2024, comparing the first half of 2023 to the first half of 2024, we see an even further increase of 4.3%. The higher level of activity observed in 2023 was no fluke...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-08-18 Indie search for Oddmu

date: 2024-08-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-18-indie-search-for-oddmu">2024-08-18 Indie search for Oddmu</h1>

<p>This is a follow-up for <a href="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexes">2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing</a> where I linked to <a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch, byJP</a>. I want to see what&rsquo;s required for this to work.</p>

<p>First, I need to install Pagefind. Lucky me, I already have a Rust build environment installed.</p>

<pre><code>cargo install pagefind
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I need a static HTML copy of my site:</p>

<pre><code>env ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en  oddmu static -jobs 3 /tmp/alex
</code></pre>

<p>Create the index:</p>

<pre><code>pagefind --site /tmp/alex
</code></pre>

<p>Upload:</p>

<pre><code>mv /tmp/alex/pagefind .
make upload
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s now available at <code>https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind</code>.</p>

<p>Adding the info to the page header:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;application/pagefind&quot; href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind&quot; title=&quot;Alex Schroeder’s Diary&quot;&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) =&gt; {
  new PagefindUI({ element: &quot;#pagefind&quot;, showSubResults: true });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And a div to the page body:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;pagefind&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And I had to add <code>'unsafe-eval'</code> to the <code>script-src</code> Content-Security-Policy header.</p>

<p>Too bad the search result links all end in <code>.html</code> … that requires an extra rewrite rule, to get rid of. On the other hand, it also allowed me to get rid of <code>baseUrl: &quot;/view/&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Since there are still rough edges, this search is only available via <a href="pagefind.html">Pagefind</a>. I&rsquo;m also not promising any updates to the index.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-19</strong>. While I was experimenting with this all, I asked <a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io">@byjp</a> some questions.</p>

<p><em>Sites provide local indexes in the Pagefind format, as a static file?</em></p>

<p>Correct — except it’s many files, organised so as to allow minimal transfer for a single search query — but all can be retrieved to have a full local index</p>

<p><em>Clients register one or more of these files and allow searching them?</em></p>

<p>Correct — they can be retrieved/cached to query locally, or queried efficiently remotely.</p>

<p><em>Users can install a large number of them, locally? Like I have 23 local dictionaries installed for my dictd and I can query them, locally.</em></p>

<p>Yes. Many can be kept locally or remotely. The sites you “register”/add become your search index.</p>

<p><em>Is it possible for a website to offer just a Pagefind installation with a number of URLs to Pagefind indexes without hosting pages and indexes? Clients visiting this Pagefind installation would download all the indexes pointed to in the list and search them locally?</em></p>

<p>Yes (with minor hackery). Each Pagefind instance <em>is</em> the index, a small bootstrapping JS/WASM blob, and ~5 lines of init JS. Those 5 lines can include locations of multiple indexes for the (exclusively client-side) JS to query when searching; by default the only one configured is the “local” index that created with the Pagefind JS/WASM blob, but you could strip away an empty index and have what you describe — in fact, that’s what my <a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch</a> demo does!</p>

<p><em>If instead of visiting a site with a Pagefind installation one installs a Pagefind browser extensions, is it possible to point it to a URL that hosts a list of indexes?</em></p>

<p>I haven’t built that (yet), but yeah — I’d want to build an mf2/IndieWeb compatible “new user experience” that’d guide folks to finding a good-for-them set of defaults. My demo automatically (provisionally) adds any site you visit that supports IndieSearch, so you’d get better coverage fast. I’d also consider default-importing from blogrolls and the like. (Management &amp; performance gets tricky with 1000s of indexes. Probs an “if we get there” problem. 😅)</p>

<p><em>Is it possible to &ldquo;merge&rdquo; Pagefind indexes and pass those aggregates on? I&rsquo;m afraid that having local copies of the indexes means that clients will have to at least query thousands of sites for updates to their page indexes.</em></p>

<p>Not yet, but I asked exactly this question of the Pagefind devs and they offered that it’s currently too hard, but that there is a potential route they&rsquo;d consider, see <a href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/discussions/564#discussioncomment-8702059">#564</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you so much for answering the questions!</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still thinking about the situation where I&rsquo;m part of a community and we want to all share search, like using <a href="https://lieu.cblgh.org/">Lieu</a> for a webring – except I&rsquo;d like a solution where I don&rsquo;t have to do the crawling.</p>

<p>Sadly, the communities I&rsquo;m part of are planets such as <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/">RPG Planet</a> or <a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>, each with hundreds of blogs. I suppose most of them don&rsquo;t offer a Pagefind index, being hosted on Blogspot and Wordpress, but what I&rsquo;m considering is ingesting their feed and indexing it. This could be a service I could perform for people. Luckily, it&rsquo;s often possible to get all the blog pages via the feed. This is how I&rsquo;ve made <a href="2010-05-31_Blognapping">local backups of other people&rsquo;s blogs</a>. I guess that each site would be a separate index, however?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to find a way that doesn&rsquo;t require me to always download all the pages. I&rsquo;d like to find a way to update the index as it&rsquo;s being used.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d need a way to figure out how to configure it such that the results link back to the original pages, of course.</p>

<p>Another thing I&rsquo;m considering is that my own site is rendered live, from Markdown files… it&rsquo;s not a static site. So ideally I&rsquo;d be able to ingest Markdown files directly. Or I can go the route of exporting it all into a big feed and ingesting that, once I&rsquo;ve solved the problem above, I guess. But the problem above might also be easier to solve by extracting HTML pages from the feed. It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done in the past. Create something that works, first, then improve it later?</p>

<p>Anyway, ideas are swirling around.</p>

<p><strong>2024-08-19</strong>. I notice more things that aren&rsquo;t quite working the way I like them to work.</p>

<p>The sort order of the results is less than ideal, for example. I like to emphasize more recent blog posts.
Pagefind, however, returns them in some sort of scoring order so that I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few results with pages around 20 years old.</p>

<p>Image previews seem to rarely work. I suspect the problem is pages in subfolders linking to images in that same subfolder. Such relative links don&rsquo;t need a path – but they do if Pagefind is not in the same directory.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another thing to consider: The index takes up more space than the full HTML of the entire site, compressed!</p>

<pre><code>alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; du -sh alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz 
 43M	alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind
9.7M	alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz
</code></pre>

<p>So the Pagefind index takes about 4× more space than the full HTML, for this site. This matches my experience with better indexing for my own site where I experimented with full text indexes and trigram indexes. Back then:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the 15 MiB of markdown files seem to have generated an index of 70 MiB – <a href="2023-09-11-oddmu">2023-09-11 Oddµ memory consumption</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, in terms of copyright incentives, handing off the entire site like that is tricky. Doing it with a feed feels OK. Doing it for a search engine seems like handing the keys to Google. This provides an incentive to use a pre-computed index.</p>

<p>It also reminds me that the idea I had of building a search engine out of feed slurping without consent is probably a bad idea – like all ideas based on non-consensual acts.</p>

<p>Whether self-indexing is a good thing in terms of avoiding an English-first focus I don&rsquo;t know. I suspect that most people will be using free software and therefore there&rsquo;s no reason to suspect that a search engine doesn&rsquo;t have the means to process the languages. Then again, that&rsquo;s a lock-in where in order to support a new language, you have to support the software your favourite search-engine supports. So people indexing our own pages might have long term benefits.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still wondering about the comparison of Pagefind and Lunr, to be honest. How many such static search solutions are there? Is there a benefit of one implementation over another?</p>

<p>I guess now I should look into Pagefind some more? Indexing non-HTML pages, handling image previews for pages not in the root directory and relative image source URLs, the sort order of results, the use of the .html extension in results… there are still rough edges as far as I am concerned – and per discussion above the onus is on me to fix my indexing. 😭</p>

## 2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing

date: 2024-08-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexing">2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing</h1>

<p>Recently, <a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@dredmorbius" title="@dredmorbius@toot.cat">@dredmorbius</a> wrote about Google and search and posed the question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if websites indexed their own content, and published a permuted index in a standard format, in a cache-and-forward model similar to how DNS works?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A while ago I wondered about <a href="2023-03-07_A_vision_for_search">self-published indexes</a>. We have software to generate feeds. Why not software to generate indexes? Back then I proposed a JSON format. Today I finally took a look at <a href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/version/1.1/">JSON Feed</a>. I think it has everything we need.</p>

<p>Take a look at the example for this site: <a href="/.well-known/search-feed.json.gz">.well-known/search-feed.json.gz</a>.
This file has about 9.7MiB. The source material is 6740 Markdown pages, a total of about 21.5MiB, or 8.4MiB compressed.</p>

<p>Using the <code>next_url</code> attribute, it would be possible to split this file up into chunks of 100 pages each, or a chunk per year, if the platform promises that older pages never change. This wouldn&rsquo;t work for my wiki, but perhaps it would for certain platforms.</p>

<p>Somebody will have write up a best-practice on how to use HTTP headers to avoid downloading the whole file when nothing has changed. Sadly, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13">section 13 of RFC 2616</a> is pretty convoluted. Basically something about the use of If-Modified-Since and ETags headers.</p>

<p>We also need to agree on how to use some of the JSON Feed attributes.</p>

<p><code>content_text</code>: If used, all markup should be ignored by the server (no guessing whether the text is Markdown or not). It would be fine if this contained just the text nodes of the HTML, separated by spaces. This can be useful to see whether words occur in the text, how frequent they are, etc.</p>

<p><code>content_html</code>: This is the preferred way to include pages in the index. It is up to the search engine provider to extract useful information from the HTML, including summaries, extracts, scoring, etc. It is up to index providers to provide the kind of HTML they think serves search engines best. This includes using the semantic HTML tags and dropping style, scripts, footers and other elements that might be used by search engines to reduce the relevance of the item.</p>

<p>I also find <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5005">RFC 5005</a> to be very instructive in how to think about feeds for archiving.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social">@jonny</a> commented, saying that it was important to think about how search indexes were going to be used:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so given that no single machine would or should store a whole index of the internet or even all your local internet, you can go a few ways with that, take the global quorum sensing path and you get a bigass global dht-like thing like ipfs. if instead you think there should be some structure, then you need proximity. is that social proximity where we swap indexes between people we know? or webring like proximity dependent on pages linking to each other and mutually indexing their neighborhood?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting question but I think I want incremental improvements to the current situation. So if a person has a website right now, on server, what&rsquo;s the simplest thing they can do so that they aren&rsquo;t drowned in crawlers and can still be found via search? That would be publishing an index, analogous to publishing a feed. Having more search engines (even if using legacy centralized architecture) would be better than what we have now. Not depending on crawlers would be better what we have now.</p>

<p>In terms of decentralisation, I think I like community search engines like lieu. The idea is great: a community lists a bunch of sites. Lieu generates a web ring and crawls them to build an index of all the member sites. Instead of crawling, it could fetch the indexes. This would be much better than what it does right now, because right now, lieu uses colly for crawling and colly ignores robots.txt. This means that <a href="2024-06-22-lieu">lieu instantly bans itself when it visits my site</a> because it&rsquo;s not rate limited. It&rsquo;s just an implementation detail, but sadly I am biased. I&rsquo;ve been on a Butlerian Jihad since 2009 when I discover that <a href="2009-10-15_Network_Traffic">over 30% of all requests I serve from my sites are for machines, not humans</a>.</p>

<p>It makes me want to raise my keyboard and scream &ldquo;CO₂ for the CO₂ god!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somebody should draw a Hacker Elric doing that, standing on a mountain of electro-trash with the burnt and dead landscape of the post-apocalypse in the background.</p>

<p>But back to the problem of indexing. Right now, search engine operators and their parasites, the search engine optimisation enterprises, crawl every single page including page histories, page diffs, and more, on my wikis. If every wanna-be search engine downloaded my index once a day, I would be saving resources. Whether that&rsquo;s a step in the right direction, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social">@jonny</a> also said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i just think that the ability to fundamentally depart from the commercial structure of the web and all its brokenness doesn&rsquo;t happen gradually and esp. not with the server/client stack we have now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, there must be another way. I just don&rsquo;t see it, right now. It&rsquo;s always hard to imagine a new world while you&rsquo;re still living in the old one. I&rsquo;m sure the solution will seem obvious to the next generation, looking back.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Feeds">#Feeds</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-17</strong>. <a class="account" href="https://octodon.social/@splitbrain" title="@splitbrain@octodon.social">@splitbrain</a> suggested that this was the same as the sitemaps.org concept, but I think the sitemap lists the URLs available and you still have to crawl the site. At least now you never miss a page.</p>

<p>Would having such an index generate too much traffic? I think it would worm if all other crawling would stop. That’s the necessary trade-off, of course. No stupid crawlers lost in my wiki admin links (history pages, diffs) wasting resources – that is my goal. Also, since I ask for a crawl delay, crawling has to reconnect all the time, negotiate TLS all the time, start up CGI scripts all the time… having basically a static snapshot for download would obviate that (in a world where crawlers are smart enough to understand that the don’t need to crawl).</p>

<p><strong>2024-08-18</strong>. <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@zens" title="@zens@merveilles.town">@zens</a> mentioned Lunr but then suggested that <a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io">@byjp</a>&rsquo;s solution to the problem is even better: the server provides indexes that are used client-side and a browser extension allows querying multiple such indexes, locally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lunr.js is a small, full-text search library for use in the browser. It indexes JSON documents and provides a simple search interface for retrieving documents that best match text queries.</p>

<p>After indexing, Pagefind adds a static search bundle to your built files, which exposes a JavaScript search API that can be used anywhere on your site. Pagefind also provides a prebuilt UI that can be used with no configuration. – <a href="https://pagefind.app/">Pagefind</a></p>

<p>Any time they visit the IndieSearch homepage (a page served from their browser extension) they can now search all the sites supporting IndieSearch they&rsquo;ve visited and/or included. – <a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch, byJP</a></p>

## Twitter isn't over

date: 2024-08-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I was surprised that Donald Trump was so famous because I didn't watch reality TV. I come from NY and he was a pretty small thing in NY, even though I guess the rest of the world thinks he's big in NY.</p>
<ul>
<li>I come from Queens, actually, so I know the Trump character pretty well too. Self-important narcissists who inside feel worthless, lashing out at everything they come in contact with. Not the ordinary Scotch/German in Queens, but not that rare either.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same thing is probably happening now with Elon Musk, because attention of people like me has wandered away from Twitter, but the audience is huge, and probably every bit as movable as it was for Trump in 2016, and Musk owns it? Seems so.</p>
<p>People who think this is over are fooled, imho.</p>
<p>Read this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/18/inciting-rioters-in-britain-was-a-test-run-for-elon-musk-just-see-what-he-plans-for-america">piece</a> in today's Guardian for another perspective. </p>

Employ non-journalist op-ed writers. Appointed to a two-year residence, columns published alongside other op-eds. They expose flaws in stories that have appeared in the publication, either news or editorial. They have expertise in areas the publication covers. They have never been employed as a journalist. They are not part of your organization, never meet with other writers, have no personal relationships to preserve. They write from the perspective of a reader. By giving them equal weight as news or op-ed pieces, it's more likely the professional journalists and opinion writers will pay attention. Maybe they'll even respond. This is the beginning of accountability. The "public editors" the news orgs employed briefly were jokes. They never addressed the serious issues, likely because they lacked the perspective of a reader, or they had relationships to preserve, or just saw it from the perspective of an insider. There is an obvious and real problem with news, and it can never be solved until the people whose work is the problem see it. Is there a more important area of power that gets so little outside scrutiny? They say democracy dies in darkness, so does journalism.

Journalism is very important part of how our country works yet there is no accountability, no checks and balances, no requirement of transparency. There isn’t even a mechanism to disagree with them. most of the time they have the only voice. We don’t even know what they’re trying to do, what their goals are.
