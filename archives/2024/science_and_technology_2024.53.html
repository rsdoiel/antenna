<h2 id="running-netbsd-10.1-on-a-1998-toshiba-laptop">Running NetBSD
10.1 on a 1998 Toshiba laptop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Here are my notes on running NetBSD 10.1 on my first personal laptop
that I still keep, a 1998 i586 Toshiba Satellite Pro with 81Mb of RAM
and a 1Gb IBM 2.5″ IDE HD. In summary, the latest NetBSD runs well on
this old hardware using an IDE to CF adapter and several changes to the
i386 GENERIC kernel. ↫ Joel P. I don’t think the BSD world – and NetBSD
in particular – gets enough recognition for supporting both weird
architectures and old hardware as well as it does. This here is a 26
year old laptop running the latest version of NetBSD, working X11 server
and all, while other operating systems drop support for devices only a
few years old. So many devices could be saved from toxic landfills if
only more people looked beyond Windows and macOS.</p>

Safety Reforms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: Smithsonian Magazine</p>
<p>Officials thought the brand-new Iroquois Theater was fireproof and
designed for maximum safety. The scope of the tragedy and the ensuing
panic quickly proved them wrong</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: The Register (UK I.T.
News)</p>
<h4>
'The greatest concern is with spear phishing and social engineering'
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Interview</strong>  Now that criminals have realized there's no
need to train their own LLMs for any nefarious purposes - it's much
cheaper and easier to steal credentials and then jailbreak existing ones
- the threat of a large-scale supply chain attack using generative AI
becomes more real.…
