**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

One of the flaws in the design of Teslas is they are really difficult to operate safely for people who are farsighted, such as myself. A lot of the status messages are too small for me to read without reading glasses, and in the time it takes to put them on the message is gone. Esp frustrating for the messages that tell you to do this or that to keep using FSD. And when I'm flipping the glasses down, my eyes are not on the road Mr or Ms Tesla. This is a design problem. Maybe you should use voice prompts for this kind of stuff. Or use a camera to see if my hands are on the wheel.

And the librarian has read and digested all of it, and can give you useful and usually exactly right summaries (despite what the critics say) in an instant. I've been using libraries my whole life, going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on that timeline and you'll see its significance. You didn't write it, I didn't. Each of us may have contributed a little, and <i>isn't that what we want?</i> To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn't get more meaningful than this.

Another great application for ChatGPT. Try to find a blog post or article about the design of a language that gets to what you want to know without wading through a lot of stuff you don't care about. I got it to explain Swift, Go and Rust quickly. Okay now I know what they're doing. It would have taken me days before to assemble this, and I never have that kind of time for such execursions.

## AMD unveils Ryzen 9000 CPUs for desktop, Zen 5 takes center stage at Computex 2024

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

In regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop Ryzen chips&#8217; turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance expectations for the new chips. The AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD&#8217;s Ryzen 7000 series and marks AMD&#8217;s commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than previous generations. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech I absolutely love that AMD maintains compatibility with its chipset and socket generations as well as it does. I&#8217;m currently running a Ryzen 9 7900X, and I see no reason to upgrade any time soon, but it&#8217;s good to know I&#8217;ll at least have otions once the time comes. Compare this to Intel, which broke compatibility pretty much intentionally almost every generation for years now, and this is a huge win for consumers. Of course, as AMD regains more and more of its foothold across the market, it will eventually also resort to the kind of tactics Intel has been using while it pretty much had the market to itself. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before we&#8217;ll see the first new Ryzen generation that mysteriously requires a new socket or chipset out of the blue.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

We should apply mathematics to language design. The goal of the language should be maximum simplicity for the human developer. As much of the complexity as possible should be handled by software, either at compiletime or runtime. It should read like pseudocode. I want to write about this. We should study languages for the real reason we use them. We started out writing code by toggling switches on the front panel of the computer, and for a few decades we were factoring but then we turned around in the other direction. I am from the church of factoring. I do it in my designs of products at all levels, and I treat languages with the same care. It turns out all the rules of working on open systems also apply to language design. I plan to write more about this.

## Tock: a secure embedded operating system for microcontrollers

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

Tock is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms. Tock&#8217;s design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to protect different components of the operating system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety and type safety. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (e.g. the scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and the kernel. ↫ Tock GitHub page We&#8217;ve never featured Tock on OSNews before, as far as I can tell, which seems odd considering it&#8217;s been around for a while. The most recent release stems from January 2023, so a short while ago, but that&#8217;s not too surprising considering the target audience of this embedded operating system. It&#8217;s licensed under either Apache or MIT.

<h1 id="2024-06-02-slow-worm">2024-06-02 Slow worm</h1>

<p>The name is great. In German we call slow worms <em>Blindschleiche</em>, a blind sneak. Saw one today on the forest road as I was jogging after the rain.</p>

<p>The sandals you see in the picture above are my running sandals.
See <a href="2015-08-27_Luna_Sandals_Review_by_Benjamin_Baugh">a review by Benjamin Baugh</a> from nearly 10 years ago.</p>

<p>I was running through the forest on the hill behind us:</p>

If I wanted my calculator to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other words, ChatGPT is a very new tool. It can be hard to control, you have to check what it says, and try different questions. But the result, if you pay attention and don't drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that you can do things you never could do before.

## Saying a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Saying a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few days ago, the post <a href="https://www.ansible.com/blog/upcoming-changes-to-the-awx-project/">Upcoming Changes to the AWX Project</a> came across my feed. An innocuous title, but sometimes community-impacting changes are buried in posts like this. So, as an interested Ansible user, I read through the post.</p>

<p>In 1,610 words, almost nothing of substance was written.</p>

<p>A lot about how it's not 2014 anymore, so 2014-era architecture doesn't suit AWX. Then a big bold disclaimer at the bottom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we conclude, we should be clear about what will not happen.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>We are not changing the Ansible project</li>
  <li>We are not adjusting our OSS license structure</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Ultimately, we need to make some changes to the way our systems work and our projects are structured. Not a rewrite but a refactoring and restructuring of how some of the core components connect and communicate with each other.</p></blockquote></div>

Ken Smith pointed out the story in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/31/123255.html#a125308">very last postscript</a>. Before that, I hadn't put it together that podcasting worked because for a while Adam did my job, and for a while I did his. That guaranteed two things -- that the technology would be maximally simple, and that anyone with a computer could do the whole recording and production job without help from an expensive studio. In both cases the result was nowhere near commercial standards, but that didn't matter, in fact it helped that there were so many glitches in my early podcasts, that said that hey if this guy can do it, so can I.

## This message does not exist

date: 2024-06-02, from: OS News

The act of discarding a message that does not exist must therefore do one of two things. It may cause the message contents to also cease to exist. Alternately, it might not affect the existence but only the accessibility of message contents. Perhaps they continue to exist, but discarding the message (which already did not exist) causes the copy operation to cease being invokable on the message contents (even though they do continue to exist). The story of existence has many mysteries. ↫ Mark J. Nelson The one question that can really break my brain in a way that is feels like it&#8217;s physically hurting &#8211; which it can&#8217;t, because, fun fact, there&#8217;s no pain receptors in the brain &#8211; is the question what exists outside of the universe? Any answer you can come up with just leads to more questions which just lead to more questions, in an infinite loop of possible answers and questions that the human mind is not equipped to grasp. Anyway, it turns out using Outook can lead to the same existential crises.
