ǀ Truth 48: Governor &amp; the Reality of One People — Ghosts!!!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-30, updated: 2024-05-30, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is the Governor is right about “us working
together,” which is what I’ve been saying for over two decades with “One
People One Direction” to improve our Economic Base while pivoting away
from so much dependency upon China. If you watch CNN &amp; other REAL
Balanced Reporting Networks, not FOX, and know what is happening with
China, then you know the that it would not be wise for the CNMI to put
most of our eggs in China’s basket. Taiwan is also an “ally of America,”
and China is doing everything possible to turn up the heat on Taiwan,
which can easily bring America &amp; the CNMI into a conflict with
China. The world is a very “tenuous place,” just look at what Putin
decided to do against the approval of the U N and the world. This is a
very dangerous game WE (the CNMI) are playing with China, as it not only
about economics but world dominance &amp; power of China. If readers
have been paying attention to the national news and the informative
articles by Mr. BC Cook, and what I have been writing about China then
“you-know-better” than to be “chasing-a-Chinese-Rainbow.”</p>
