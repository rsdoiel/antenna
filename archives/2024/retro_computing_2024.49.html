Plotkin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: Digital Antiquarian</p>
<p>For some of you, Andrew Plotkin will need no introduction. The rest
of you ought to know that he’s quite an amazing guy, easily one of the
half-dozen most important figures in the history of post-Infocom
interactive fiction. By my best reckoning, he’s written an even dozen
fully realized, polished text adventures in all, from […]</p>

<h2 id="ringbind-reaches-version-0.20">RingBind reaches version
0.20</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>And there’s now a beta version of the Impression User Manual in Bound
format Chris Hall has made available a new version of RingBind. The
application offers an alternative way to view user manuals and other
publications on screen, making them look like ring-bound manuals, as
though open on your desk – provided they have first been converted to
the Bound format (and file-type). With version 0.20, a few bugs have
been corrected, and the software now correctly implements page-to-page
links – so rather than thumb (in a virtual manner)…</p>

may be 100 mega-reasons to grab Elesar’s new NIC for your RiscPC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-30, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Well, okay, that’s a 100mbps connection – so just the one reason,
then. Elesar Ltd launched a new product at the London Show last month1,
a 100baseT NIC (with patch lead) for the RiscPC and A7000/A7000+
machines. The new NICs feature an optimised design, using an ASIX
AX88796 fast Ethernet controller with a built-in 16kB buffer memory,
which allows network packets to be handled locally inside the chip.
There’s also 128kB of flash memory containing the driver software –
which is both 26 and 32-bit compatible, so it’s as suitable…</p>
