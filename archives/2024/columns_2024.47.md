## 2024-11-19 Suicide rates in Switzerland

date: 2024-11-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-19-suicide-rates-in-switzerland">2024-11-19 Suicide rates in Switzerland</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@mekkaokereke" title="@mekkaokereke@hachyderm.io">@mekkaokereke</a> was posting about black men and suicides, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Black men have one of the lowest age adjusted suicide rates.üëçüèø White men? One of the highest. ‚Ä¶ Self imposed masculinity pressure isn&rsquo;t the only reason so many men are depressed. But it&rsquo;s a big one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It reminded me of some numbers for Switzerland I seen a long time ago. I decided to go looking.</p>

<p>Here the suicide rate by gender in Switzerland. I knew it was bad, of course. Men here are often lonely, the emotional labour of maintaining relationships often falls on the shoulders of women so when men are alone, they don&rsquo;t manage to build the kind of network required to stay well. And thus, where as the suicide rates are going down, men are still doing very badly.</p>

<p>And this is without assisted suicides.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-19-suicide-1.jpg" alt="A graph showing the peak in 1980 with suicides of about 14 women and 37 men per 100000 inhabitants and a new low in 2020 with about 5 women and 14 men per 100000 inhabitants." /><br>
Source: <a href="https://www.bfs.admin.ch/asset/de/23567541">Suizidrate nach Geschlecht - Todesf√§lle durch Suizid pro 100 000 Einwohner/innen</a></p>

<p>More specifically, the suicide rates go up, dramatically. The graph below is again without assisted suicides (which are legal in Switzerland).</p>

<p>Making friends and maintaining relationships requires emotional labour, trust, openness, vulnerability, and it can be hard. I know it&rsquo;s hard for me and unfortunately I see myself in these statistics. We must learn to do better.</p>

<p>Patriarchy is not helping.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-19-suicide-2.jpg" alt="Suicide rate for women starts at around 5 per 100000 inhabitants in teenage years and goes up to around 10 per 100000. For men, however, it starts at around 10 per 100000 and goes up to 60 per 100000 when they are about 80 years old." /><br>

In the aftermath of the 737 MAX crashes, I wrote <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/04/first-we-change-how-people-behave.html"><i>First We Change How People Behave</i></a>.:<br />
<blockquote>
The fundamental problem of autonomous vehicles sharing roads is that until you get to Level 5, you have a hand-off problem. The closer you get to Level 5, the worse the hand-off problem.
</blockquote>
Three years earlier, Paul Vixie was more specific in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/disciplining-unoccupied-mind-paul-vixie/"><i>Disciplining the Unoccupied Mind</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Simply put, if you give a human brain the option to perform other tasks than the one at hand, it will do so. No law, no amount of training, and no insistence by the manufacturer of an automobile will alter this fact. It's human nature, immalleable. So until and unless Tesla can robustly and credibly promise an autopilot that will imagine every threat a human could imagine, and can use the same level of caution as the best human driver would use, then the world will be better off without this feature.
</blockquote>
Follow me below the fold for an update on the hand-off problem.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
The 737 MAX crashes were a specific, especially difficult, case of the hand-off problem. It wasn't that the automation recognized a situation it couldn't cope with and initiated a hand-off to the humans. It was that the automation was wrong about the situation and the pilots had to decide to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/03/simulations-show-lion-air-737-crew-had-little-time-to-prevent-disaster/">override it</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  In testing performed in a simulator, Boeing test pilots recreated the conditions aboard Lion Air Flight 610 when it went down in the Java Sea in October, killing 189 people. The tests showed that the crew of the 737 MAX 8 would have only had 40 seconds to respond to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System‚Äôs (MCAS‚Äôs) attempts to correct a stall that wasn‚Äôt happening before the aircraft went into an unrecoverable dive, according to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/business/boeing-simulation-error.html">report by The New York Times</a>.<br />
<br />
While the test pilots were able to correct the issue with the flip of three switches, their training on the systems far exceeded that of the Lion Air crew‚Äîand that of the similarly doomed Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which crashed earlier this month. The Lion Air crew was heard on cockpit voice recorders checking flight manuals in an attempt to diagnose what was going on moments before they died.
</blockquote>
Christine Negroni's <a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/4/22/18511069/boeing-737-max-crash-plane"><i>What people don‚Äôt get about why planes crash</i></a> stresses the hand-off problem:
<blockquote>
"In the crash of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 landing in San Francisco in 2013, investigators determined that a contributing factor was the pilots‚Äô over-reliance on automated systems which led to an erosion in their flying skills. The investigation of the fatal flight of an Air France Airbus A330 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in 2009 led to the conclusion that the complexity of the fly-by-wire airplane befuddled the pilots.<br />
<br />
The 737 Max probes suggest another variation on the conundrum: Technology intended to protect against pilot error trapped the pilots. Helpless in the cockpit, they were unable to do as Captain Sully did and save the day."

Now, <i>Road and Track</i>'s Joe Kucinski reports that <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a62919131/tesla-has-highest-fatal-accident-rate-of-all-auto-brands-study/"><i>Tesla Has the Highest Fatal Accident Rate of All Auto Brands, Study Finds</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The study was conducted on model year 2018‚Äì2022 vehicles, and focused on crashes between 2017 and 2022 that resulted in occupant fatalities. Tesla vehicles have a fatal crash rate of 5.6 per billion miles driven, according to the study; Kia is second with a rate of 5.5, and Buick rounds out the top three with a 4.8 rate. The average fatal crash rate for all cars in the United States is 2.8 per billion vehicle miles driven.
</blockquote>
How is this possible when "Autopilot" is standard on Teslas? The analyst behind the study <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a62919131/tesla-has-highest-fatal-accident-rate-of-all-auto-brands-study/">explains</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
So, why are Teslas ‚Äî and many other ostensibly safe cars on the list ‚Äî involved in so many fatal crashes? ‚ÄúThe models on this list likely reflect a combination of driver behavior and driving conditions, leading to increased crashes and fatalities,‚Äù iSeeCars executive analyst Karl Brauer said in the report. ‚ÄúA focused, alert driver, traveling at a legal or prudent speed, without being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, is the most likely to arrive safely regardless of the vehicle they‚Äôre driving.‚Äù
</blockquote>
Precisely. It seems very likely that, lulled by the experience of being cocooned in high-tech safety systems, the drivers were not focused or alert, ready to take over from the automation in a split second when danger threatened.<br />

## 2024-11-18 Being on small fediverse instances

date: 2024-11-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-18-being-on-small-fediverse-instances">2024-11-18 Being on small fediverse instances</h1>

<p>The fediverse is the network of social media instances that communicate via ActivityPub, mostly Mastodon but others exist as well. My own instance runs GoToSocial. The benefit is that nobody can force you to look at ads or sell your data.</p>

<p>Running such an instance means that you need the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a server and the admin skills to run it</li>
<li>space to store all the media files (my media folder currently uses about 19 GiB)</li>
<li>space to store all the messages (my database currently uses about 9 GiB)</li>
</ul>

<p>But if you have a friend who runs one, or you&rsquo;re a member of an association that runs one, and you trust their admins, you can hop on. Some friendly souls even run servers out of their own pockets, for free, relying on donations to keep their servers up and running.</p>

<p>What I want to say: it&rsquo;s possible to be part of the independent web.</p>

<p>There are, unfortunately, also problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>on larger instances, moderator burnout sometimes happens</li>
<li>on growing instances, budgets sometimes grow out of control</li>
<li>many people are harassed out of sight of the public</li>
</ul>

<p>I think some people might prefer the bigger corporate players:</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter/X</li>
<li>Bluesky</li>
<li>Threads</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a lot more people on those networks, that&rsquo;s for sure.
Personally, I follow about 700 people with three accounts and I have about the same number of people following me, I think.
This is plenty!
I think it would be an illusion for me to think that in network with millions more people my reach and influence would reach new heights.
On the contrary, the algorithm would probably bury my posts and even the people who do want to see my posts would have to dig for them, past ads, sponsored posts and posts with higher engagement metric.</p>

<p>My guess is that we often imagine our alternatives selectively.
We imagine the grass to be greener and our prospects to be better, elsewhere.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to get started, I&rsquo;d be happy to help.</p>

<p>Some more notes: The Mastodon Client protocol is wholly separate from the typical ActivityPub server-to-server protocol and not the same as the rarely implemented ActivityPub server-to-client protocol.
It&rsquo;s limited, but good enough for a large number of applications.</p>

<p>The two main uses I have seen:</p>

<ul>
<li>separate user interface implementations, be it new front-ends on the web or apps on phones and desktops</li>
<li>bots</li>
</ul>

<p>The ability to do all that without a corporation forcing you to only use official apps so that they can spy on you or monetize you (forcing you to watch the ads) is a great boon.
In addition to that, some servers have very different web front-ends and some servers (like the one I use, GoToSocial), have no web front-end for reading and posting.
This has reduced the burden on developers considerably.</p>

## Why Italy Sells So Much Spyware

## Most of 2023‚Äôs Top Exploited Vulnerabilities Were Zero-Days

date: 2024-11-18, updated: 2024-11-18, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Zero-day vulnerabilities are <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-317a">more commonly used</a>, according to the Five Eyes:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<p>In 2023, malicious cyber actors exploited more zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise enterprise networks compared to 2022, allowing them to conduct cyber operations against higher-priority targets. In 2023, the majority of the most frequently exploited vulnerabilities were initially exploited as a zero-day, which is an increase from 2022, when less than half of the top exploited vulnerabilities were exploited as a zero-day.</p>
<p>Malicious cyber actors continue to have the most success exploiting vulnerabilities within two years after public disclosure of the vulnerability. The utility of these vulnerabilities declines over time as more systems are patched or replaced. Malicious cyber actors find less utility from zero-day exploits when international cybersecurity efforts reduce the lifespan of zero-day vulnerabilities...</p></blockquote>

## Bluesky feature request

date: 2024-11-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I posted a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lb46hc76n22p">feature request</a> on Bluesky that has gotten a lot of flow. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bluesky devs.. How about a compromise. Support inbound RSS. Let me enter the URL of an RSS feed in settings. I'll ping a fixed location when the feed updates. Would allow the same flow to go to other systems. This would help a lot. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Discussion</b></p>
<ul>
<li><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/11/nakedJenToday.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Imagine a Bluesky-like network that you could post to through any blogging tool that can create an RSS feed. Imagine the new tools that could be created. All of a sudden a whole world of writing tools opens up.</li>
<li>It should happen faster than the proprietary format that Bluesky defined, because RSS is so well understood in the developer world. Lots of software out there for reading and writing. I have a couple of toolkits of my own, for JavaScript, MIT licensed. In use in deployed software so they work pretty well. (Knock wood.) </li>
<li>Also it would create an incentive for competitors to follow suit, and if they do we suddenly have a strong and simple and broadly understood basis for interop. It's a brilliant competitive move, if they really intend to give users choice, to not lock them in. It challenges their competitors to follow suit. I don't doubt that Mastodon would do it. And Threads might even do it if they're feeling competitive with Bluesky. They've already chosen ActivityPub as a basis for interop, but that's been slow to develop. RSS is so simple and well understood it should take a small fraction of the time to adapt.</li>
<li>Bluesky has already pioneered in providing excellent outbound RSS support. I helped them do it, a while back, before the huge onslaught of users. </li>
<li>The fact that so many users loved the idea is enough to have made it worthwhile to suggest it. But I wouldn't be tremendously surprised if they actually did it. </li>
</ul>

## Feedback on sez.us sign up

date: 2024-11-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Why I haven't created an account on <a href="https://sez.us/">sez.us</a> yet. </p>
<ul>
<li>They ask for my first and last name before I sign up. Ask for that info later, after I've created an account. I gave it a fake name to get to the next screen.</li>
<li>Then they ask for my phone number. That's when I hit the back button. I already get too much spam on my phone, and the filters aren't good there. I am happy to provide an email address as my identifier as I do on all other systems. Later, if I become a regular user, I don't mind providing the phone number as part of 2-factor identity, but not up front.</li>
<li>Also I don't like white on black letters. It's hard for me to read. All the competitive systems use black on white background. Offer it as an option if it's important to you, but please default to black on white.</li>
</ul>

## 2024-11-17 Everything is slow and I don't know why

date: 2024-11-18, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-17-everything-is-slow-and-i-don-t-know-why">2024-11-17 Everything is slow and I don&rsquo;t know why</h1>

<p>When I try to log into the server using SSH it takes a long time. Why is that?
<code>iotop</code> doesn&rsquo;t show anything suspicious. And yet, since Saturday 18:00, <code>munin</code>
shows that something is up.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-1.jpg" alt="System CPU goes up. Everything goes up!" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-2.jpg" alt="Disk IO goes up." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-3.jpg" alt="Throughput per device starts to be weird." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-4.jpg" alt="Utilisation per device goes up to 50%." /></p>

<p>I rebooted the server. &ldquo;Have you tried turning it off and on again?&rdquo; ü§∑</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p>And that seems to have worked.
I wonder what I did back then.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-5.jpg" alt="Saturday 18:00 shows users connecting (me). Doing something. Who knows what." /></p>

<p>I was clearly doing something!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I noticed: I uploaded a new version of the Norn bot, which had an error. I replaced it.
Was systemd spawning it again and again, spamming the journal? Is that what caused the problem?</p>

<p>This is very strange.</p>

<p>But‚Ä¶ rebooting helped!</p>

<p><strong>2024-11-18</strong>. Or did it? The initial connect to the web server still seems to take a second or five. Once the initial handshake is done, the site serves quickly. So what could it be? The problem seen above really is gone.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-6.jpg" alt="CPU is back to normal, lots of idle time." />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-7.jpg" alt="Disk utilization is back to normal, nearly 0." /></p>

<p><strong>2024-11-18</strong>. Around midnight, I was exchanging emails with <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town">@akkartik</a> and everything seemed slow again. Nearly eight hours later, the problem seems to be gone. And the graph supports that.
The question is: What does this mean? If I&rsquo;m assuming that I installed a faulty bot on Saturday 18:00 and fixed it Sunday 18:00 (plus a reboot), what happened from midnight to 2:00?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-8.jpg" alt="Another spike from 0:00 to 2:00." /></p>

<p>Strangely enough, this spike in CPU usage was not accompanied in a spike in disk usage.</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed this morning: Not only is my SSH extremely sluggish ‚Äì sometimes the command line takes half a minute or longer to update ‚Äì but my IPv4 banlist also wasn&rsquo;t around. I had to run <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> again to reconstruct it. I&rsquo;ve been banning some more networks, too (mostly Contabo and Hetzner in Germany). It doesn&rsquo;t seem to be helping right now.</p>

<p>And while I&rsquo;m snooping around: This hourly beat in Apache requests seems like a clear sign of bot activity, too. Fuckers.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-17-slow-9.jpg" alt="Every hour there is a dip. it looks like an inverse heartbeat." /></p>

I see it that way too. When <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/bob-woodward-on-ukraine-the-middle-east--the-election/">Brian Lehrer asked</a> a few weeks ago how the US got so divided of his guest Bob Woodward (a fascinating time capsule, recorded before the election) they both missed it. We were divided by an enemy that is on the cusp of destroying the US without launching a single nuke. Putin didn't have to invade Ukraine. I guess even he didn't think his plan would succeed so spectacularly. BTW, I don't think Trippi's network is the answer, but maybe it is. I wish I had had a chance to create the system he was using, we would make a good team. Anyway we need to be further along than his offering is. The right system would allow me to control my presence with only <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, in and out. Maybe not for everyone, to start, but it would allow us to start building. It's why I have been lobbying for inbound and outbound RSS as a back-end for all these networks. With the rise of Bluesky in the last couple of weeks (things are happening that fast now) we may have a new shot at it because Masto and Threads are certainly feeling it, and when people feel competed-with they are more open to new thinking.
