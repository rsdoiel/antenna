## Gut microbiota influence acute pancreatitis through inflammatory proteins: a Mendelian randomization analysis

date: 2024-05-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Background/AimWe employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between the gut microbiota, acute pancreatitis, and potential inflammatory proteins.MethodsThe data for gut microbiota, acute pancreatitis, and inflammatory proteins are sourced from public databases. We conducted a bidirectional MR analysis to explore the causal relationship between gut microbiota and acute pancreatitis, and employed a two-step MR analysis to identify potential mediating inflammatory proteins. IVW is the primary analysis method, heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and sensitivity analyses were also conducted simultaneously.ResultsWe identified five bacterial genera associated with the risk of acute pancreatitis, namely genus.Coprococcus3, genus.Eubacterium fissicatena group, genus.Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003, genus.Fusicatenibacter, and genus.Ruminiclostridium6. Additionally, we have discovered three inflammatory proteins that are also associated with the occurrence of acute pancreatitis, namely interleukin-15 receptor subunit alpha (IL-15RA), monocyte chemoattractant protein-4 (CCL13), and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9 (TNFRSF9). Following a two-step MR analysis, we ultimately identified IL-15RA as a potential intermediate factor, with a mediated effect of 0.018 (95% CI: 0.005 - 0.032).ConclusionOur results support the idea that genus.Coprococcus3 promotes the occurrence of acute pancreatitis through IL-15RA. Furthermore, there is a potential causal relationship between the gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins, and acute pancreatitis. These findings provide new insights for subsequent acute pancreatitis prevention.

## Salivary biomarkers as pioneering indicators for diagnosis and severity stratification of pediatric long COVID

date: 2024-05-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionLong COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), manifests as persistent and often debilitating symptoms enduring well beyond the initial COVID-19 infection. This disease is especially worrying in children since it can seriously alter their development. Presently, a specific diagnostic test or definitive biomarker set for confirming long COVID is lacking, relying instead on the protracted presence of symptoms post-acute infection.MethodsWe measured the levels of 13 biomarkers in 105 saliva samples (49 from children with long COVID and 56 controls), and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyse the correlations between the levels of the different salivary biomarkers. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine which of the 13 analysed salivary biomarkers were useful to discriminate between children with long COVID and controls, as well as between children with mild and severe long COVID symptoms.ResultsPediatric long COVID exhibited increased oxidant biomarkers and decreased antioxidant, immune response, and stress-related biomarkers. Correlation analyses unveiled distinct patterns between biomarkers in long COVID and controls. Notably, a multivariate logistic regression pinpointed TOS, ADA2, total proteins, and AOPP as pivotal variables, culminating in a remarkably accurate predictive model distinguishing long COVID from controls. Furthermore, total proteins and ADA1 were instrumental in discerning between mild and severe long COVID symptoms.DiscussionThis research sheds light on the potential clinical utility of salivary biomarkers in diagnosing and categorizing the severity of pediatric long COVID. It also lays the groundwork for future investigations aimed at unravelling the prognostic value of these biomarkers in predicting the trajectory of long COVID in affected individuals.

## The role of CD4+ T cells in visceral leishmaniasis; new and emerging roles for NKG7 and TGFβ

date: 2024-05-31, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Visceral leishmaniasis is a potentially devastating neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasites Leishmania donovani and L. infantum (chagasi). These parasites reside in tissue macrophages and survive by deploying a number of mechanisms aimed at subverting the host immune response. CD4+ T cells play an important role in controlling Leishmania parasites by providing help in the form of pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate microbiocidal pathways in infected macrophages. However, because these cytokines can also cause tissue damage if over-produced, regulatory immune responses develop, and the balance between pro-inflammatory and regulatory CD4+ T cells responses determines the outcomes of infection. Past studies have identified important roles for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ and TNF, as well as regulatory co-inhibitory receptors and the potent anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. More recently, other immunoregulatory molecules have been identified that play important roles in CD4+ T cell responses during VL. In this review, we will discuss recent findings about two of these molecules; the NK cell granule protein Nkg7 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGFβ, and describe how they impact CD4+ T cell functions and immune responses during visceral leishmaniasis.

## A novel diagnostic approach to Paratuberculosis in dairy cattle using near-infrared spectroscopy and aquaphotomics

date: 2024-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAs a contagious and chronic disease in the livestock industry, Paratuberculosis is a significant threat to dairy herds’ genetic and economic resources. Due to intensive breeding and high production of dairy cattle, the incidence and prevalence are higher. Developing non-destructive diagnostic methods for the early detection and identification of healthy animals is paramount for breeding programs. Conventional methods are almost entirely destructive, have low accuracy, lack precision, and are time-consuming. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and aquaphotomics can detect changes in biofluids and thus have the potential to diagnose disease. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic ability of NIRS and aquaphotomics for Paratuberculosis in dairy cattle. MethodsBlood plasma from dairy cattle was collected in the NIR range (1,300 nm to 1,600 nm) 60 days before and 100 days to 200 days after calving in two groups, positive and negative, using the same consecutive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test results three times as a reference test.ResultsNIRS and aquaphotomics methods invite 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to detect Paratuberculosis using data mining by unsupervised method, Principal Component Analysis, and supervised methods: Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogiest, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Partial Least Square–Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine models.DiscussionThe current study found that monitoring blood plasma with NIR spectra provides an opportunity to analyze antibody levels indirectly via changes in water spectral patterns caused by complex physiological changes, such as the amount of antibodies related to Paratuberculosis by aquagram.

## A rare case of successful treatment of peritoneal dialysis patient with Serratia marcescens peritonitis without catheter removal: case report and literature review

date: 2024-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Serratia marcescens, as a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, is a rare cause of peritonitis and has worse clinical outcomes than Gram-positive peritonitis. In this case report, we describe a case of Serratia marcescens associated peritonitis that was successfully cured without catheter removal. A 40-year-old male patient with peritoneal dialysis who worked in the catering industry was admitted to the hospital for 16 hours after the discovery of cloudy peritoneal dialysate and abdominal pain. Ceftazidime and cefazolin sodium were immediately given intravenously as an empirical antibiotic regimen. After detecting Serratia marcescens in the peritoneal diasate culture, the treatment was switched to ceftazidime and levofloxacin. The routine examination of peritoneal dialysate showed a significant decrease in white blood cells, the peritoneal dialysate became clear, and the peritoneal dialysis catheter was retained. The patient was treated for 2 weeks and treated with oral antibiotics for 1 week. It is necessary to further strengthen the hygiene of work environment to prevent Serratia marcescens infection in peritoneal dialysis patients. We recommend that patients with Serratia marcescens associated peritonitis should be treated with a combination of antibiotics as early as possible empirically, and at the same time, the peritoneal dialysis fluid culture should be improved, and the antibiotic regimen should be timely adjusted according to the drug sensitivity results. For patients with clinical symptoms for more than 3 days, considering the strong virulence of Serratia marcescens, whether to use meropenem directly or not can provide a reference for clinical decision-making. Further clinical studies are needed to achieve more precise anti-infective treatment.

## Detection of Hanseniaspora opuntiae in anovaginal samples of pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil—a case report

date: 2024-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

In this study, we report the first isolation of Hanseniaspora opuntiae obtained from four pregnant women in Brazil. Clinical isolates were obtained from four samples taken between 35 and 37 gestational weeks, as part of the routine antenatal care for maternal colonization screening for Streptococcus agalactiae group B. The patients were immunocompetent, with two of them diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus. Species identification was performed by MALDI-TOF MS and rDNA sequencing. While Hanseniaspora species have not traditionally been considered a typical opportunist pathogen, our findings emphasize the importance of investigating and screening for Hanseniaspora in pregnant populations, highlighting H. opuntiae as a potential agent of human infections.

## Influences of bacterial extracellular vesicles on macrophage immune functions

date: 2024-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) are crucial mediators of information transfer between bacteria and host cells. Macrophages, as key effector cells in the innate immune system, have garnered widespread attention for their interactions with bacterial EVs. Increasing evidence indicates that bacterial EVs can be internalized by macrophages through multiple pathways, thereby influencing their immune functions. These functions include inflammatory responses, antimicrobial activity, antigen presentation, and programmed cell death. Therefore, this review summarizes current research on the interactions between bacterial EVs and macrophages. This will aid in the deeper understanding of immune modulation mediated by pathogenic microorganisms and provide a basis for developing novel antibacterial therapeutic strategies.

## Extracellular components in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli biofilm and impact of treatment with proteinase K, DNase or sodium metaperiodate

date: 2024-05-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is a major cause of diarrhea worldwide. EAEC are highly adherent to cultured epithelial cells and make biofilms. Both adherence and biofilm formation rely on the presence of aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF). We compared biofilm formation from two EAEC strains of each of the five AAF types. We found that AAF type did not correlate with the level of biofilm produced. Because the composition of the EAEC biofilm has not been fully described, we stained EAEC biofilms to determine if they contained protein, carbohydrate glycoproteins, and/or eDNA and found that EAEC biofilms contained all three extracellular components. Next, we assessed the changes to the growing or mature EAEC biofilm mediated by treatment with proteinase K, DNase, or a carbohydrate cleavage agent to target the different components of the matrix. Growing biofilms treated with proteinase K had decreased biofilm staining for more than half of the strains tested. In contrast, although sodium metaperiodate only altered the biofilm in a quantitative way for two strains, images of biofilms treated with sodium metaperiodate showed that the EAEC were more spread out. Overall, we found variability in the response of the EAEC strains to the treatments, with no one treatment producing a biofilm change for all strains. Finally, once formed, mature EAEC biofilms were more resistant to treatment than biofilms grown in the presence of those same treatments.

## Progress of research and application of Heyndrickxia coagulans (Bacillus coagulans) as probiotic bacteria

date: 2024-05-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Probiotics are defined as living or dead bacteria and their byproducts that maintain the balance of the intestinal microbiome. They are non-toxic, non-pathogenic, and do not release any toxins either within or outside the body. Adequate consumption of probiotics can enhance metabolite production, increase immunity, maintain a balanced intestinal flora, and stimulate growth. Probiotics do not have negative antibiotic effects and help maintain the natural flora in animals in a balanced state or prevent dysbacteriosis. Heyndrickxia coagulans (H. coagulans) is a novel probiotic species that is gradually being used for the improvement of human health. Compared to commonly used probiotic lactic acid bacteria, H. coagulans can produce spores, which provide the species with high resistance to adverse conditions. Even though they are transient residents of the gut, beneficial bacteria can have a significant impact on the microbiota because they can outnumber harmful germs, and vice versa. This article discusses the probiotic mechanisms of H. coagulans and outlines the requirements for a substance to be classified as a probiotic. It also addresses how to assess strains that have recently been discovered to possess probiotic properties.

## Systems approach to design multi-epitopic peptide vaccine candidate against fowl adenovirus structural proteins for Gallus gallus domesticus

date: 2024-05-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionFowl adenovirus (FAdV) is a significant pathogen in poultry, causing various diseases such as hepatitis-hydropericardium, inclusion body hepatitis, and gizzard erosion. Different serotypes of FAdV are associated with specific conditions, highlighting the need for targeted prevention strategies. Given the rising prevalence of FAdV-related diseases globally, effective vaccination and biosecurity measures are crucial. In this study, we explore the potential of structural proteins to design a multi-epitope vaccine targeting FAdV.MethodsWe employed an in silico approach to design the multi-epitope vaccine. Essential viral structural proteins, including hexon, penton, and fiber protein, were selected as vaccine targets. T-cell and B-cell epitopes binding to MHC-I and MHC-II molecules were predicted using computational methods. Molecular docking studies were conducted to validate the interaction of the multi-epitope vaccine candidate with chicken Toll-like receptors 2 and 5.ResultsOur in silico methodology successfully identified potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes within the selected viral structural proteins. Molecular docking studies revealed strong interactions between the multi-epitope vaccine candidate and chicken Toll-like receptors 2 and 5, indicating the structural integrity and immunogenic potential of the designed vaccine.DiscussionThe designed multi-epitope vaccine presents a promising approach for combating FAdV infections in chickens. By targeting essential viral structural proteins, the vaccine is expected to induce a robust immunological response. The in silico methodology utilized in this study provides a rapid and cost-effective means of vaccine design, offering insights into potential vaccine candidates before experimental validation. Future studies should focus on in vitro and in vivo evaluations to further assess the efficacy and safety of the proposed vaccine.

## COVID-19 influenced gut dysbiosis, post-acute sequelae, immune regulation, and therapeutic regimens

date: 2024-05-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has garnered unprecedented global attention. It caused over 2.47 million deaths through various syndromes such as acute respiratory distress, hypercoagulability, and multiple organ failure. The viral invasion proceeds through the ACE2 receptor, expressed in multiple cell types, and in some patients caused serious damage to tissues, organs, immune cells, and the microbes that colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Some patients who survived the SARS-CoV-2 infection have developed months of persistent long-COVID-19 symptoms or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Diagnosis of these patients has revealed multiple biological effects, none of which are mutually exclusive. However, the severity of COVID-19 also depends on numerous comorbidities such as obesity, age, diabetes, and hypertension and care must be taken with respect to other multiple morbidities, such as host immunity. Gut microbiota in relation to SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology is considered to evolve COVID-19 progression via mechanisms of biochemical metabolism, exacerbation of inflammation, intestinal mucosal secretion, cytokine storm, and immunity regulation. Therefore, modulation of gut microbiome equilibrium through food supplements and probiotics remains a hot topic of current research and debate. In this review, we discuss the biological complications of the physio-pathological effects of COVID-19 infection, GIT immune response, and therapeutic pharmacological strategies. We also summarize the therapeutic targets of probiotics, their limitations, and the efficacy of preclinical and clinical drugs to effectively inhibit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

## Novel anti-Acanthamoeba effects elicited by a repurposed poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor AZ9482

date: 2024-05-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionAcanthamoeba infection is a serious public health concern, necessitating the development of effective and safe anti-Acanthamoeba chemotherapies. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) govern a colossal amount of biological processes, such as DNA damage repair, protein degradation and apoptosis. Multiple PARP-targeted compounds have been approved for cancer treatment. However, repurposing of PARP inhibitors to treat Acanthamoeba is poorly understood.MethodsIn the present study, we attempted to fill these knowledge gaps by performing anti-Acanthamoeba efficacy assays, cell biology experiments, bioinformatics, and transcriptomic analyses.ResultsUsing a homology model of Acanthamoeba poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), molecular docking of approved drugs revealed three potential inhibitory compounds: olaparib, venadaparib and AZ9482. In particular, venadaparib exhibited superior docking scores (−13.71) and favorable predicted binding free energy (−89.28 kcal/mol), followed by AZ9482, which showed a docking score of −13.20 and a binding free energy of −92.13 kcal/mol. Notably, the positively charged cyclopropylamine in venadaparib established a salt bridge (through E535) and a hydrogen bond (via N531) within the binding pocket. For comparison, AZ9482 was well stacked by the surrounding aromatic residues including H625, Y652, Y659 and Y670. In an assessment of trophozoites viability, AZ9482 exhibited a dose-and time-dependent anti-trophozoite effect by suppressing Acanthamoeba PARP activity, unlike olaparib and venadaparib. An Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide apoptosis assay revealed AZ9482 induced trophozoite necrotic cell death rather than apoptosis. Transcriptomics analyses conducted on Acanthamoeba trophozoites treated with AZ9482 demonstrated an atlas of differentially regulated proteins and genes, and found that AZ9482 rapidly upregulates a multitude of DNA damage repair pathways in trophozoites, and intriguingly downregulates several virulent genes. Analyzing gene expression related to DNA damage repair pathway and the rate of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites indicated DNA damage efficacy and repair modulation in Acanthamoeba trophozoites following AZ9482 treatment.DiscussionCollectively, these findings highlight AZ9482, as a structurally unique PARP inhibitor, provides a promising prototype for advancing anti-Acanthamoeba drug research.

## Metagenomic next-generation sequencing-assisted diagnosis of a rare case of primary cutaneous acanthamoebiasis in an HIV patient: a case report

date: 2024-05-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Pathogenic and free-living Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in the environment and have been reported to cause keratitis and universally fatal encephalitis. Primary cutaneous acanthamoebiasis caused by Acanthamoeba is exceedingly rare and presents as isolated necrotic cutaneous lesions without involvement of the cornea or central nervous system. Cutaneous acanthamoebiasis often occurs in immunocompromised patients and is likely overlooked or even misdiagnosed only by cutaneous biopsy tissue histopathological analysis. Here, we report a HIV-infected 63-year-old female with oral leukoplakia for 4 months and scattered large skin ulcers all over the body for 2 months. The cause of the cutaneous lesions was unclear through cutaneous specimens histopathological analysis, and subsequently Acanthamoeba were detected by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), which may be the cause of cutaneous lesions. Based on the mNGS results, a pathologist subsequently reviewed the previous pathological slides and found trophozoites of Acanthamoeba so that the cause was identified, and the skin ulcers improved significantly after treatment with multi-drug combination therapy. Acanthamoeba is also a host of pathogenic microorganisms. The presence of endosymbionts enhances the pathogenicity of Acanthamoeba, and no other pathogens were reported in this case. mNGS is helpful for rapidly diagnosing the etiology of rare skin diseases and can indicate the presence or absence of commensal microorganisms.

## Manuka honey as a non-antibiotic alternative against Staphylococcus spp. and their small colony variant (SCVs) phenotypes

date: 2024-05-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The antibiotic resistance (ABR) crisis is an urgent global health priority. Staphylococci are among the problematic bacteria contributing to this emergency owing to their recalcitrance to many clinically important antibiotics. Staphylococcal pathogenesis is further complicated by the presence of small colony variants (SCVs), a bacterial subpopulation displaying atypical characteristics including retarded growth, prolific biofilm formation, heightened antibiotic tolerance, and enhanced intracellular persistence. These capabilities severely impede current chemotherapeutics, resulting in chronic infections, poor patient outcomes, and significant economic burden. Tackling ABR requires alternative measures beyond the conventional options that have dominated treatment regimens over the past 8 decades. Non-antibiotic therapies are gaining interest in this arena, including the use of honey, which despite having ancient therapeutic roots has now been reimagined as an alternative treatment beyond just traditional topical use, to include the treatment of an array of difficult-to-treat staphylococcal infections. This literature review focused on Manuka honey (MH) and its efficacy as an anti-staphylococcal treatment. We summarized the studies that have used this product and the technologies employed to study the antibacterial mechanisms that render MH a suitable agent for the management of problematic staphylococcal infections, including those involving staphylococcal SCVs. We also discussed the status of staphylococcal resistance development to MH and other factors that may impact its efficacy as an alternative therapy to help combat ABR.

## Oral microbiome sequencing revealed the enrichment of Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas sp., Campylobacter sp., and Neisseria sp. on the oral malignant fibroma surface of giant panda

date: 2024-05-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMicrobial community composition is closely associated with host disease onset and progression, underscoring the importance of understanding host–microbiota dynamics in various health contexts.MethodsIn this study, we utilized full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to conduct species-level identification of the microorganisms in the oral cavity of a giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) with oral malignant fibroma.ResultsWe observed a significant difference between the microbial community of the tumor side and non-tumor side of the oral cavity of the giant panda, with the latter exhibiting higher microbial diversity. The tumor side was dominated by specific microorganisms, such as Fusobacterium simiae, Porphyromonas sp. feline oral taxon 110, Campylobacter sp. feline oral taxon 100, and Neisseria sp. feline oral taxon 078, that have been reported to be associated with tumorigenic processes and periodontal diseases in other organisms. According to the linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis, more than 9 distinct biomarkers were obtained between the tumor side and non-tumor side samples. Furthermore, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that the oral microbiota of the giant panda was significantly associated with genetic information processing and metabolism, particularly cofactor and vitamin, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, a significant bacterial invasion of epithelial cells was predicted in the tumor side.DiscussionThis study provides crucial insights into the association between oral microbiota and oral tumors in giant pandas and offers potential biomarkers that may guide future health assessments and preventive strategies for captive and aging giant pandas.

## Relationship between gut microbiota and the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review

date: 2024-05-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of gestational diabetes mellitus characterized by insulin resistance and abnormal function of pancreatic beta cells. In recent years, genomic association studies have revealed risk and susceptibility genes associated with genetic susceptibility to GDM. However, genetic predisposition cannot explain the rising global incidence of GDM, which may be related to the increased influence of environmental factors, especially the gut microbiome. Studies have shown that gut microbiota is closely related to the occurrence and development of GDM. This paper reviews the relationship between gut microbiota and the pathological mechanism of GDM, in order to better understand the role of gut microbiota in GDM, and to provide a theoretical basis for clinical application of gut microbiota in the treatment of related diseases.MethodsThe current research results on the interaction between GDM and gut microbiota were collected and analyzed through literature review. Keywords such as "GDM", "gut microbiota" and "insulin resistance" were used for literature search, and the methodology, findings and potential impact on the pathophysiology of GDM were systematically evaluated.ResultsIt was found that the composition and diversity of gut microbiota were significantly associated with the occurrence and development of GDM. Specifically, the abundance of certain gut bacteria is associated with an increased risk of GDM, while other changes in the microbiome may be associated with improved insulin sensitivity. In addition, alterations in the gut microbiota may affect blood glucose control through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of short-chain fatty acids, activation of inflammatory pathways, and metabolism of the B vitamin group.DiscussionThe results of this paper highlight the importance of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of GDM. The regulation of the gut microbiota may provide new directions for the treatment of GDM, including improving insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control through the use of probiotics and prebiotics. However, more research is needed to confirm the generality and exact mechanisms of these findings and to explore potential clinical applications of the gut microbiota in the management of gestational diabetes. In addition, future studies should consider the interaction between environmental and genetic factors and how together they affect the risk of GDM.
