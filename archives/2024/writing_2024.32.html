<strong>The Underhistory</strong>, Kaaron Warren (Viper
978-1-80081-202-4, £16.99, 383pp, hc) April 2024.
</p>
<p>
The publication of a new novel from Kaaron Warren is an event worthy of
fanfare. She’s one of the rare few – Kirstyn McDermott is another – who
can blend literary and horror fiction without undermining the strengths
of either. It makes for a reading experience that’s both deep and
textured, but also taut and brutal. <strong>The Underhistory </strong>

<p>date: 2024-08-06, from: John August blog</p>
<p>John welcomes writer-director Betsy Thomas (Superior Donuts,
Superstore) to finally discuss writing multi-camera sitcoms. Using
famous sitcom scripts as guides, they look at how multi-cam sets itself
apart through its unique formatting and production, how it utilizes
blocking, its surprising limitations in post, and the live studio
audience. But Betsy is more than just a […] The post

The film <em>Ghos</em>t (1990) is one of the most iconic love stories
ever put on film. Who can forget Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore sensually
touching fingers through soft, buttery clay as the song “Unchained
Melody” is soulfully crooned by The Righteous Brothers? The film’s
exploration of love’s ability to transcend physical boundaries struck a
nerve with audiences.

<h2 id="the-2024-colossal-fundraiser-has-begun">The 2024 Colossal
Fundraiser has begun!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: IF Competition Blog</p>
<p>
Hello, friends. We are just under a month out from this year’s IFComp
games being released. SO EXCITING!! (Unless you’re an author who is
furiously testing and revising and recompiling and testing and revising
and recompiling and… yeah. Good luck, authors!)
</p>
<p>
<b>While we eagerly await the new games to come, we’d like to ask for
your help with the Colossal Fund.</b><br/><br/>If you already know about
the fund and are able to contribute, please go
to <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">ifcomp.org</a> and hit the blue “Donate
with PayPal” button.
</p>
<p>
If you’d like more information first, keep on reading…
</p>
<p>
The Colossal Fund raises money for the cash prizes that are awarded to
the top two-thirds of IFComp entries. We use 80% of the funds for that,
and the remaining funds are used to provide support for the programs and
projects of the <a href="https://iftechfoundation.org/">Interactive
Fiction Technology Foundation</a>, including
the <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">Interactive Fiction Competition</a>,
the <a href="https://ifarchive.org/">IF Archive</a>,
the <a href="https://ifdb.org/">IFDB</a>, the forums
at <a href="https://intfiction.org/">intfiction.org</a>, and other
projects.
</p>
<p>
This year, as in prior years, we are shooting for $10K.
</p>
<p>
<b>We’re now accepting donations for 2024!</b><br/>The donation button
is live at <a href="https://ifcomp.org/">IFComp.org</a>. See your name
listed on our donor page (or listed as “anonymous” if you prefer)! Our
fundraising deadline is October 15th - the last day of competition
voting. 80% of the proceeds ($8K+ if we hit our goal) will be
distributed among the top two-thirds of IFComp finishers. 
</p>
<p>
<b>What does this mean for authors?</b><br/>Because we’re dividing the
money among the top two-thirds of games, the exact numbers depend on how
many entries there are. If we have 75 entries, then we will divide the
money among the top 50. If we have $10K, that would mean that the winner
of the competition will be offered a prize of $451, second place will be
offered $433, third prize $416… and so on and so forth until 50th place,
which will be offered $10.  Our goal is to distribute prizes across a
broad range of IF styles and ideas. Any game which does even moderately
well is offered a decent prize.
</p>
<p>
<b>How do I donate?</b><br/>Please go to https://ifcomp.org and push the
big blue Donate button.
</p>
<p>
<b>Is my donation tax-deductible?</b><br/>Yes, to the extent allowed by
law. (Consult a tax professional.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Does the Colossal Fund replace the usual IFComp prize
list?</b><br/>Nope! These cash prizes will be in addition to the usual
IFComp prize list. We do need more of those non-cash prizes as well!
Please visit our prize page to see what objects and services others have
donated, get ideas from donations given in previous years, and see how
you can contribute.
</p>
<p>
<b>How will the cash prizes be distributed?</b><br/>Via PayPal or Venmo.
(The IFComp entry form has a field for your Paypal address.) If you
can’t accept PayPal or Venmo, we can mail a US check to a US address. If
that doesn’t work for you, or if you wish to decline the cash prize, we
will roll the money into next year’s prize fund, which means it will
continue to support authors and IFTF programs.

<p>
There has been no shortage of good haunted-house tales in the past year
or so, with contri­butions from Elizabeth Hand, Alix E. Harrow, T.
Kingfisher, and others. Christopher Barzak’s <strong>A Voice Calling
</strong>(his first novella, he tells us in an afterword) might seem to
be hopping on the bandwagon, but in fact it’s an expansion of a
