##  Appalling vs. a Whole Other Level of Appalling

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If you've lived much at all you know what Joni says is true. I got there when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I'd never see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn't even take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It's why we're playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden's presidency, because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about Biden's flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The problem isn't that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were to win, we'll be right back here in another four years, and at that time we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever happens this year, what's waiting for us is for most of us to wake up from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It's all falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start working together, intelligently, or else it's over.

## It's that time

date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the corruption of American journalism. Most of the time we can turn our attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House, and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the journalists, get away with it again.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the press on our democratic process that I'm pretty depressed about the future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said he'd never do it. If they tried to force him, he'd get a gun and shoot them. This isn't the first time I've heard that, and I called bullshit. You're never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won't do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally -- and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn't believe you are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can't get back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone number). I've been through all these miserable processes. And none of them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where we're headed, again.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an incredible <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a> to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news sites. It's more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the full story. Maybe it was a  mistake calling this a blogroll. I'm trying to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for themselves. In any case I'm thinking about what to do next with FeedLand, which is what's behind the blogroll software. It hasn't lived up to my hopes, and I don't think it's likely to. I may be done writing software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years, between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of writing for others was not a success. So I'm thinking about how to wind down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a bit. It's that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

## 2024-07-08 Neufch√¢tel

date: 2024-07-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-08-neufch√¢tel">2024-07-08 Neufch√¢tel</h1>

<p>We met a friend and went for a walk in the late afternoon: from La Neuveville up the Combe du Pulouvi. I took some flower pictures.</p>

<p>At the new Jeunes Rives. It looked very nice but we did see a big dead fish, belly up. That dampened our enthusiasm somewhat.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We began our walk around four.</p>

<p>AÃàstige Graslilie<br>
Anthericum ramosum</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

Helianthemum nummularium</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There were some nice waterfalls to see on the way up.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And a view of the Lac de Bienne.</p>

<p>Wildes Alpenveilchen<br>
Cyclamen purpurascens</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>More pools‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And waterfalls‚Ä¶</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But was cool and full of moss.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>NesselblaÃàttrige Glockenblume<br>

<p>Alpen-Ziest<br>

<p>Sometimes you see plants that you feel you have never seen in your whole life.</p>

<p>Wiesen-Wachtelweizen<br>
Melampyrum pratense</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-14.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>An even better view of the lake.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-15.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>BreitblaÃàttrige Lichtnelke<br>

## July 7, 2024 

date: 2024-07-08, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

I have spent the weekend struggling mightily with a new manuscript and have had little time to study the news. The most notable event from the day is that in a stunning upset, French voters have rejected members of Marine Le Pen&#8217;s far-right National Rally party in legislative elections. After the first round of votes, National Rally candidates appeared to be comfortably ahead, but left-wing and centrist candidates combined forces to prevent splitting the vote, and voters then flooded the polls to elect the candidates that coalition fielded.

## Seymour and Brownie

My family, on my dad&#8217;s side, were Jews from Poland and Ukraine. His parents came to America before the shit hit the fan, but I grew up knowing two people who weren&#8217;t so lucky. Seymour Mayer lived across the street during my teens.

## Dear journalism

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn't lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.</p>
<p>What you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>We all knew this would happen.</li>
<li>We all saw it happen, we don't need you to tell us.</li>
<li>We're going with him anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>The plan is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election -- VP Harris steps up.</li>
<li>Now everyone can relax.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak">decloaked</a>, an even bigger story.</p>
<p>BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that they all want Trump to lose? It's logical that they would, but I thought they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous <a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">View From Nowhere</a>. Has that pretense accidentally been dropped?</p>

## Democratic superstars of 2024

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>On Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sarajw@front-end.social/112746718207413752">Sara Joy writes</a>: "Let Biden run. Let Kamala and lots of other younger Dems take on lots of events. Support him from underneath. If and when he falters, the party is there to prop him up, take up the slack, or step in."</p>
<p>I had a similar idea.</p>
<p>Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.</p>
<p>Let all the great next generation democrats shine. </p>
<p>Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.</p>
<p>Joe Biden dials in via satellite.</p>
<p>"Listen, I'm an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren't they wonderful!"</p>
<p>He puts on his robe and slippers, sits in a rocking chair with a dog at his feet and his grandchildren playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">yahtzee</a> and checkers...</p>
<p>And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn't spill his beer, so you know they have his back.</p>
<p>Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Collect them all!</p>
<p>You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.</p>
<p>Some would be very rare.</p>
<p>Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack, Michelle and Bill would have a concert. </p>
<p>Hosted by Mayor Pete!</p>
<p>Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.</p>
<p>Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit. </p>
<p>And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers. </p>
<p>Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and the freedom fighters. </p>
<p>All the heroes of America, standing up for America. </p>
<p>The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course Lynne Cheney.</p>
<p>We don't need no freaking monarch, they all sing.</p>
<p>No we don't! shouts the people. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJBaIUZwmTs&t=43s">On video</a>, the Dead sing "I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do!"</p>
<p>Shake the hand that shook the hand of PT Barnum and Charlie Chan.</p>
<p>We all march together to victory.</p>

## Hot take: social platforms should disallow special character growth hacking

date: 2024-07-07, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

Over the last few years something magical has happened without much fanfare: social media platforms and operating systems automatically translate text content for us.

If I had his influence I'd be saying the same things, though I wouldn't be as kind. It's time to put the journalists back where they belong, covering news, not trying to run the country.
