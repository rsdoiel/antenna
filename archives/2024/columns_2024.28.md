            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Recently an Igalia engineer posted a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240625125803.38038-1-tursulin@igalia.com/">NUMA Emulation patch</a> for the Pi 5 to the Linux Kernel mailing list. He said it could improve performance of Geekbench 6 scores up to 6% for single-core, and 18% for multicore.</p>

<p>My testing didn't quite match those numbers, but I did see a significant and consistent performance increase across both Geekbench 6:</p>

## Route around journalism

date: 2024-07-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Why journalists don’t bother trying to take Trump down, but do with the Democrat.</p>
<p>Simple. Trump has routed around journalism as we have begged the Dems to by going direct to the people.</p>
<p>The journos have no power over Trump and they know it.</p>
<p>They have total power over the Dems, and they know that too.</p>
<p>If by some miracle the journos let us (voters) determine the president, we must <i>never</i> let them have this power again.</p>

## 2024-07-12 From Vallorbe to Orbe

date: 2024-07-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-12-from-vallorbe-to-orbe">2024-07-12 From Vallorbe to Orbe</h1>

<p>We walked and ran from Vallorbe to Orbe, through the <a href="https://yverdonlesbainsregion.ch/en/itineraire/the-gorge-of-orbe/">Gorge of Orbe</a>, nearly 17km. Both my wife and I took some pictures along the way.</p>

<p>When we left Vallorbe, the river was calm and slow. There were a lot of flowers.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The yellow flowers in the foreground:</p>

<p>Tüpfel-Hartheu<br>
Hypericum perforatum</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-18.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In the other direction, the railway bridge can be seen.</p>

<p>Schmalblättriges Weidenröschen<br>
Epilobium angustifolium</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-17.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As it turns out, there is a pedestrian passage beneath the railway.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here we&rsquo;re underneath one of these arches, looking back at Vallorbe.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Later, the gorge got a lot narrower. We crossed over the river just for bit because there was a nice lookout on the other side. Two friendly teenagers took pictures of us.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The water was pretty turbulent up here. We&rsquo;re just above the falls of the Day, though: Le Saut du Day.
The small lookout is built right there, overlooking the falls.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-19.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We walked down along the falls and noticed some weird constructions on the other side.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-23.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And on our side, there was this foreboding entrance. As it turns out, however, it leads into a passage underneath the waterfall!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-21.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The sign had an explanation of how there used to be a hydro power plant here.
The electricity was used to create explosives.
When the canton gave itself the electricity monopoly, the chemical plant was forced to buy the electricity at regular prices and since those were 4–5 times as much, the chemical plant was forced to close down.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-22.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We continued on our way, with one last look back.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-30.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Down below the river was calm again.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-24.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The occasional steps are there to break the speed of the flow, I guess?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The trail started climbing up and down along the river.
When the cliffs were to risky to navigate, they had drilled small tunnels.
Using explosives, I presume.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We saw many nice flowers along the way.</p>

<p>Further up, along some meadows:</p>

<p>Dornige Hauhechel (Artengruppe)<br>
Ononis spinosa agg.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-27.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fuchsschwanz-Klee<br>
Trifolium rubens</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-28.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Deeper in the shade of the trees:</p>

<p>Nesselblättrige Glockenblume<br>
Campanula trachelium</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-29.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>At one point there was a very cool draft coming out of the bushes above us and we found an entrance to a big tunnel! It had warning signs for speleologists, particularly regarding heat and noise – because of the bats that like to sleep and hibernate in here. We didn&rsquo;t see any bats in our 4–5m delve, however. The floor was very wet.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-25.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-26.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Later, we came upon the pressurized water pipes that still feed a hydro power plant. These pipes are huge!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-10.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before arriving at Orbe, there was another lake and more dams.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And finally, Orbe. An old town with houses and small gardens.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-13.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The main road of Orbe.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-16.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And tiny back-alleys with occasional connections for the upper floors.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-14.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A great view over the flat lands. Incidentally, the remaining distance to Yverdon-les-bains where our hotel is, doesn&rsquo;t make for great running in the summer heat. Also we were dead tired! 😅</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-15.jpg" alt="" /></p>

## The NSA Has a Long-Lost Lecture by Adm. Grace Hopper

date: 2024-07-12, updated: 2024-07-11, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The NSA has a video recording of a 1982 lecture by Adm. Grace Hopper titled &#8220;Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People.&#8221; The agency is (so far) <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/jul/10/grace-hopper-lost-lecture-found-nsa/">refusing</a> to release it.</p>
<p>Basically, the recording is in an obscure video format. People at the NSA can&#8217;t easily watch it, so they can&#8217;t redact it. So they won&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<blockquote><p>With digital obsolescence threatening many early technological formats, the dilemma surrounding Admiral Hopper&#8217;s lecture underscores the critical need for and challenge of digital preservation. This challenge transcends the confines of NSA&#8217;s operational scope. It is our shared obligation to safeguard such pivotal elements of our nation&#8217;s history, ensuring they remain within reach of future generations. While the stewardship of these recordings may extend beyond the NSA&#8217;s typical purview, they are undeniably a part of America&#8217;s national heritage...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-07-11 Exim config for UUCP, NNCP and MSMTP

date: 2024-07-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-11-exim-config-for-uucp-nncp-and-msmtp">2024-07-11 Exim config for UUCP, NNCP and MSMTP</h1>

<p>My laptop doesn&rsquo;t have a static IP number. My mail service provider is not a smart host for my laptop.
That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been using <code>msmtp</code> to send email from the command line.</p>

<p>My <code>~/.mailrc</code> used to contain the following:</p>

<pre><code>set sendmail=&quot;/usr/bin/msmtp&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I removed this line because I want to send mails by UUCP or NNCP, depending on the domain used.
It is only when none of these work that I want to fall back to <code>msmtp</code>.</p>

<p>Clearly, I need to add something to my <code>exim</code> configuration. When reading the <code>exim</code> config, it&rsquo;s important
to understand that all the additions come in pairs: a router and a transport.</p>

<p>I use Debian.</p>

<h2 id="mail-and-ed">mail and ed</h2>

<p>I use <code>mail</code> to read mail and <code>ed</code> to write mail. At least when I&rsquo;m doing this particular admin hobby project. 😂</p>

<p>As people will use a variety of domain names to send mail to me, I have to decide which ones <code>mail</code> should recognize as being &ldquo;me&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s why <code>~/.mailrc</code> contains the following:</p>

<pre><code>alternates alex@sibirocobombus,alex@campaignwiki.org,alex@campaignwiki
</code></pre>

<p>To read MIME-encoded mail, I use <code>munpack -t</code> which comes with the <code>mpack</code> package.</p>

<h2 id="etc-exim4-update-exim4-conf-conf">/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf</h2>

<p>This is the file generated by <code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config</code>.</p>

<p>Importantly, it specifies that my laptop only delivers local mail.
UUCP, NNCP and <code>msmtp</code> are all exceptions to that.</p>

<p>This config file also specifies that the <code>exim</code> configuration is split into many small files.
This makes it easy for me to add new files.</p>

<p>When I make changes, I must always run <code>sudo update-exim4.conf</code>.</p>

<p>The config files are concatenated in sort order, which is why the file names start with numbers.
All of the routers must sort before <code>200_exim4-config_primary</code> because it stops all processing.
It does that because this config file says that my laptop only delivers local mail.</p>

<pre><code>dc_eximconfig_configtype='local'
dc_other_hostnames='melanobombus'
dc_local_interfaces='127.0.0.1 ; ::1'
dc_readhost='alexschroeder.ch'
dc_relay_domains=''
dc_minimaldns='false'
dc_relay_nets=''
dc_smarthost=''
CFILEMODE='644'
dc_use_split_config='true'
dc_hide_mailname='false'
dc_mailname_in_oh='true'
dc_localdelivery='mail_spool'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-110-exim4-config-uucp">/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/110_exim4-config_uucp</h2>

<p>The domains that get mail via UUCP are listed in <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>.</p>

<pre><code>uucp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: uucp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver = accept
    require_files = +/usr/bin/uux
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/uucp
    transport = rsmtp
</code></pre>

<p>Example <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>dwalin	sibirocobombus!dwalin
campaignwiki	sibirocobombus
</code></pre>

<p>That is, <code>dwalin</code> can only be reached via <code>sibirocobombus</code> and <code>campaignwiki</code> is the same as <code>sibirocobombus</code>.</p>

<p><code>sibirocobombus</code> is defined in <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code>.</p>

<p>Note that mail to the <code>sibirocobombus</code> domain itself doesn&rsquo;t get sent via UUCP!</p>

<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-111-exim4-config-nncp">/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/111_exim4-config_nncp</h2>

<p>The domains that get mail via NNCP are listed in <code>/etc/exim4/nncp</code>.</p>

<pre><code>nncp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: nncp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver=accept
    require_files = +/usr/bin/nncp-exec
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/nncp
    transport = nncp
</code></pre>

<p>Example <code>/etc/exim4/nncp</code>:</p>

<pre><code>sibirocobombus          sibirocobombus
erebor                  erebor
</code></pre>

<p>Compare this to the previous entry. Mail to the <code>sibirocobombus</code> domain is sent via NNCP!</p>

<p>Both <code>sibirocobombus</code> and <code>erebor</code> must be defined in <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>.</p>

<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-112-exim4-config-msmtp">/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/112_exim4-config_msmtp</h2>

<p>This relies on the fact that the sender is a local user.</p>

<pre><code>msmtp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: msmtp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver=accept
    user = ${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}
    domains = ! +local_domains
    require_files = +/usr/bin/msmtp
    transport = msmtp
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-transport-40-exim4-config-uucp">/etc/exim4/conf.d/transport/40_exim4-config_uucp</h2>

<pre><code>rsmtp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: rsmtp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver=pipe
    command = /usr/bin/uux - -r -a${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}} -gC $domain_data!rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 100
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-transport-41-exim4-config-nncp">/etc/exim4/conf.d/transport/41_exim4-config_nncp</h2>

<pre><code>nncp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: nncp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver=pipe
    user=nncp
    command = /usr/bin/nncp-exec -noprogress -quiet $domain_data rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-transport-42-exim4-config-msmtp">/etc/exim4/conf.d/transport/42_exim4-config_msmtp</h2>

<pre><code>msmtp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: msmtp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver = pipe
    command = /usr/bin/msmtp --read-recipients --file=/home/${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}/.config/msmtp/config
    return_fail_output
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this ensures that <code>msmtp</code> is run for each user, using their own config files.</p>

<p>My config is stored in <code>~/.config/msmtp/config</code> and it must necessarily be non-interactive.</p>

Yesterday, Raw Story reported that Ivan Raiklin, Trump&#8217;s self-declared &#8220;Secretary of Retribution&#8221; has compiled a &#8220;Deep State target list&#8221; of 350 people he wants to see arrested and punished for &#8220;treason&#8221; if Trump is reelected. The list includes Democratic and Republican elected officials, journalists he considers to be Trump&#8217;s enemies, U.S. Capitol Police officers, and witnesses against Trump in his impeachment trials and the hearings concerning the events of January 6, 2021.

I had a post here about the inevitability of Biden stepping aside, then I turned on the news and saw how the press was humiliating the President at a meeting with the president of Ukraine. We can't give into this. How dare they insult the president as he represents the US in NATO. I can't get behind this. We're in a bad bad place.

## The importance of anecdotal evidence

date: 2024-07-11, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

When it comes to environmental harm, where should the burden of proof stand? How much evidence do we need before we pursue regulation, or pull back on usage? In America, we like the idea of &#8220;innocent until proven guilty,&#8221; but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily make sense to apply this logic beyond humans to novel chemicals (e.g. [&#8230;]

OK, I&#8217;m going to say it: interaction bait is killing social media. You know what I&#8217;m talking about. Those posts that are designed to get you to comment, like, or share.

## More On The Halvening

date: 2024-07-11, from: David Rosenthal's blog

At the end of May I wrote <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/one-heck-of-halvening.html"><i>One Heck Of A Halvening</i></a> about the aftermath of the halving of Bitcoin's block reward on April 19<sup>th</sup>. Six weeks later it is time for a quick update, so follow me below the fold.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>

All the graphs in this post are 7-day moving averages, to filter out some of the noise. The first shows what the halvening did to the hash rate. Before the halvening it was around 620EH/s. Except for a spike up to 657EH/s on 26<sup>th</sup> May, after the BTC "price" hit nearly $71.5K, it has hovered around 580EH/s. Since power is the biggest cost, the miners' costs have dropped up to 6.5% since the halvening.<br />

The second graph is much more dramatic. It shows miners' revenue dropping from around $70M/day before the the halvening to around $30M/day after, a drop of 57%. So with costs down 6.5% and revenue down 57% their margins have taken a huge hit.<br />
<br />
Back in May I <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/one-heck-of-halvening.html">wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Lets start back in October when the Bitcoin "price" was in the high $20Ks. This was a problem, because only the most efficient miners could make a profit at that "price".
</blockquote>
Mysteriously, that was when Tether's money printer started running at full speed, and the "price" got pumped up to around $70K. If I'm right that only the most efficient miners could make money with the "price" in the high $20Ks, and if their (income - costs) has dropped 50%, the most efficient miners need the "price" to be in the mid-$50Ks. Mysteriously, the mid-$50Ks is where the "price" has dropped to, down 21% since its last peak on June 5<sup>th</sup>.<br />

That the hash rate was broadly flat after the halvening is interesting. Before the pre-halvening pump started, with the BTC "price" roughly flat, there was a slow but steady increase in the hash rate reflecting Bitmain's shipments of new, efficient chips displacing a smaller contribution from older chips being turned off. Bitmain's shipments continued, but once the block reward was halved many more of the less efficient chips should have been turned off, and the hash rate reduced. This didn't happen, and I can see two possible explanations:<br />
<ul>
<li>It may be that mining power is highly skewed, with the vast majority coming from the latest chips running on low-cost power which are still profitable after the halvening. Then the shutdown of a huge number of older chips sucked in by the pre-halvening pump would have had only a small reduction in the total hash rate.</li>
<li>It may be that miners are burning their excess profit from the pre-halvening pump by staying in the market rather than <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/">pivoting to AI</a>, each hoping to be among the survivors from the eventual cull.</li>
</ul>

Another feature of the halvening was a massive spike in transaction fees to over $40/transaction. The third graph shows this spike, and a smaller one around the peak in the BTIC "price". But it also shows that right now no-one wants to transact, because the average fee is now $1.72. So the miners are once again almost entirely dependent upon inflating the currency with block rewards.<br />

The last graph shows the total cost of a transaction. It shows that the fee spike around the "price" peak made little difference, The current average cost per transaction is $48.57, of which $1.72 is the fee. So the system is 96.5% supported by inflation; there is currently no risk of the dangers associated with <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/fee-only-bitcoin.html"><i>Fee-Only Bitcoin</i></a>.<br />

<p>About a week ago, my home Internet (AT&amp;T Fiber) went from the ~1 Gbps I pay for down to about 100 Mbps (<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/monitor-your-internet-raspberry-pi">see how I monitor my home Internet with a Pi</a>). It wasn't too inconvenient, and I considered waiting it out to see if the speed recovered at some point, because latency was fine.</p>

<p>But as you can see around 7/7 on that graph, the 100 Mbps went down to about <em>eight</em>, and that's the point where my wife starts noticing how slow the Internet is. Action level.</p>

<p>So I fired up AT&amp;T's support chat. I'm a programmer, I can usually find ways around the wily ways of chatbots.</p>

<p>Except AT&amp;T's AI-powered chatbot seems to have a fiendish tendency to equate 'WiFi' with 'Internet', no doubt due to so many people thinking they are one and the same.</p></div>

I agree with <a href="https://www.manton.org/2024/07/10/looking-at-my.html">Manton</a>. The way the twitter-alikes do discourse is not the only possible way, and imho, and, as I've said <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/17/howSpamWillLikelyEnterTheT.html">before</a> (in 2007!), most of what passes for discourse on twitter is actually spam, and that goes for Masto, Threads, Bluesky and Facebook (aka FriendFeed).

## 2024-07-09 Murten

date: 2024-07-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-09-murten">2024-07-09 Murten</h1>

<p>We&rsquo;re spending two nights in Murten or Morat. The lake is small with a circumference of about 25km. <a href="2018-murten/index">A few years ago</a> we ran around it – but today we ran about six or seven kilometres before turning back. 13km is enough, these days. We&rsquo;re both out of shape, sadly.</p>

<p>Just after sunset, looking out over the lake.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Working on a half-enclosed patio until late into the night. There was drunken shouting to be heard until midnight, on a Monday. I did not know that this sleepy town was so rowdy!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The town itself looks unchanged from our last visit in 2018.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We ran over to the eastern side of the lake, a protected wetland.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Our destination was this village at the foot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Vully">Mont Vully</a>.
A rather small mountain.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It got rather hot so by the time we arrived in Sugiez, I was so very tired. My wife took this picture.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Canals connect the lake of Murten, the lake of Neuchâtel and the lake of Bienne. So many motorboats with proud men and underdressed women going up and down the channel. 🙄</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first sunflowers are out! My wife took this picture.</p>

<p><strong>2024-07-10</strong> I was interested in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Morat">Battle of Morat</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 22 June 1476, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, laid siege to the place in an action known as the Battle of Morat. The town hung on for 13 days but finally was saved by the Bernese army. The enemy&rsquo;s army was destroyed completely — some 10,000 Burgundians were killed. Since then, Murten celebrates the victory every year on June 22. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murten">Murten</a>, Wikipedia</p>

<p>I was impressed with a black and white image of the battle on the Wikipedia page but felt it didn&rsquo;t have enough resolution. I started looking for a better scan. e-rara, &ldquo;the platform for digitized rare books from Swiss institutions&rdquo; has <a href="https://doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-5076">the book</a>!</p>

<p>In the common room of our place in Murten, I found a very nice reproduction of an image from the Lucerne Chronicle and took a photo using my phone.</p>

<p>All these cruelties of war. The guy that climbed a tree and gets stabbed. The decapitated corpses, some of them stripped naked. The people hanging from the tree. The soldiers drowning. Ooof!</p>

<p>Apparently the <a href="https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/de/list/one/kol/S0023-2">Lucerne Chronicles</a> can be found in e-codices, Virtual Manuscript Library of Switzerland.
&ldquo;The goal of e-codices is to provide free access to all medieval and a selection of modern manuscripts of Switzerland by means of a virtual library.&rdquo;
The book is in the public domain and yet the site says <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY NC 4.0</a>.</p>

<p>When I looked at page 107, I didn&rsquo;t see the image above, however. Some more investigation is required.</p>

<p>Actually, I did find it! Pages 218–219 are the ones I was looking for. I downloaded the &ldquo;large&rdquo; pages, stitched them together in Gimp, saved them using 80% quality (😥) and uploaded them.</p>

## Nancy Pelosi

date: 2024-07-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I kind of like what Nancy Pelosi is doing.</p>
<p>She's got a unique role to play, as a master of Washington and national politics.</p>
<p>She stepped down as Democratic leader in the House to let a new generation lead, yet maintained here position as sort of overseeing and giving her blessings to how they go forward.</p>
<p>She also helped organize the Jan 6 committee, which in the end was the only real official judgement of Trump on the insurrection before the election. </p>
<p>I don't know how she and Biden get along.</p>
<p>It's much better to have her leading this discussion than the children who write the NYT these days. Playing with powerful tools/weapons they don't understand, at best, being manipulated by vicious fascists at worst.</p>
<p>I trust Pelosi in this situation, we're lucky to have her.</p>

## Resuming the Podcast0 feed

date: 2024-07-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A new episode for the <a href="https://this.how/podcast0/">Podcast0 feed</a>.</p>
<p>After a break since June 20, we now resume my original "audio blog" from the summer of 2004, twenty years ago.</p>
<p>I was just beginning to figure out how this new medium worked, and rather than record my own thoughts, as with the previous two episodes, I published audio from another source, my meditation teacher, Jeru Kabbal. </p>
<p>Starting with the next episode, tomorrow, an interview with Steve Gillmor, one of the earliest podcast pioneers -- we'll have an original audio blog post. That's when the pulse really starts. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/10/upcomingEpisodes.png">screen shot</a> of upcoming episodes from <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">morningcoffeenotes</a>.</p>

<p>I've been making mistakes in 2024 on almost every episode. This time I got the title wrong, it's Sunrise of the Soul. Rather than change it, and take a chance of the episode showing up twice in some podcast clients, I'm just leaving it as-is. Trying to get a feel for how most of the clients work. Do they refresh posts, if the descriptions change (as this one is)? I don't know. </p>
<p>Do the clients strip out the HTML or do they support some of it? I wonder if links make it through to most clients?</p>

That’s the real problem. The press can point out a problem, and it is a problem, but no one has the ability to build a consensus among voters. I think it’s possible to put together an online version of the Democratic Party, something that never goes away, is available to rally the electorate at any moment. That’s the way to neutralize the power of the media moguls who have us wrapped around their fingers.

## Engineering For The Long Term

<div style="text-align: center;"><b>Content Warning</b>: this post contains blatant self-promotion.<br /></div>
<br />
Contributions to engineering fields can only reasonably be assessed in hindsight, by looking at how they survived exposure to the real world over the long term.
Four of my contributions to various systems have stood the test of time.
Below the fold, I blow my own horn four times.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
<h3>Four Decades</h3>

Wikipedia has a pretty good history of the early days of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System#Origin_and_early_development">X Window System</a>.
In <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/x-window-system-at-40.html"><i>The X Window System At 40</i></a> I detailed my contributions to the early development of X.  To my amazement 40 years after Bob Scheifler's initial release it is still valiantly resisting obsolescence. I contributed to the design, implementation, testing, release engineering and documentation of X11 starting a bit over 39 years ago. At least my design for how X handles keyboards is still the way it works.<br />
<br />
All this while I was also working on a competitor, Sun's NeWS — which didn't survive the test of time.<br />
<h3>Nearly Three-and-a-Half Decades</h3>
One of the things I really enjoyed about working on NeWS was that the PostScript environment it implemented was object-oriented, a legacy of PostScript's origins at Xerox PARC. Owen Densmore and I developed <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.1987.tb00537.x"><i>A User‐Interface Toolkit in Object‐Oriented PostScript</i></a> that made developing NeWS applications very easy, provided you were comfortable with an object-oriented programming paradigm.<br />
<br />
I think it was sometime in 1988 while working on the SunOS 4.0 kernel that I realized that the BSD Vnode interface was in a loose sense object-oriented. It defines the interface between the file system and the rest of the kernel.
An instance of BSD's type <tt>vnode</tt> consisted of some instance data and a pointer to an "ops vector" that defined its class via an array of methods (function pointers). But it wasn't object-oriented enough to, for example, implement inheritance properly.<br />
<br />
This flaw had led to some inelegancies as the interface had evolved through time, but what interested me more was the potential applications that would be unleashed if the interface could be made properly object-oriented. Instead of being implemented from scratch, file systems could be implemented by sub-classing other file systems. For example, a read-only file system such as a CD-ROM could be made writable by "stacking" a cache file system on top, as shown in Figure 11. I immediately saw the possibility of significant improvements in system administration that could flow from stacking file systems.<br />

I started building a prototype by performing major surgery on a copy of the code that would become SunOS 4.1. By late 1989 it worked well enough to demonstrate the potential of the idea, so I published 1990's <a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/StackingVnodes.pdf"><i>Evolving the Vnode Interface</i></a>. The paper describes a number of Vnode modules that can be stacked together to implement interesting functions. Among them was cache-fs, which layered a writable local file system above a local or remote read-only file system:<br />
<blockquote>
This simple module can use any file system as a file-level cache for any other (read-only) file system. It has no knowledge of the file systems it is using; it sees them only via their opaque vnodes. Figure 11 shows it using a local writable ufs file system to cache a remote read-only NFS file system, thereby reducing the load on the server. Another possible configuration would be to use a local writable ufs file system to cache a CD-ROM, obscuring the speed penalty of CD.
</blockquote>
Over the next quarter-century the idea of stacking vnodes and the related idea of "union mounts" from <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/compsystems/1995/sum_pike.pdf">Rob Pike and Plan 9</a> churned around until, in October 2014, <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e9be9d5e76e34872f0c37d72e25bc27fe9e2c54c">Linus Torvalds added overlayfs to the 3.18 kernel</a>. I covered the details of this history in 2015's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/02/it-takes-longer-than-it-takes.html"><i>It takes longer than it takes</i></a>. In it I quoted from Valerie Aurora's <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324291/">excellent</a> <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/325369/">series</a> of <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327738/">articles</a> about the architectural and implementation difficulties involved in adding union mounts to the Linux kernel. I concurred with her statement that:<br />
<blockquote>
The consensus at the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327601/">2009 Linux file systems workshop</a> was that stackable file systems are conceptually elegant, but difficult or impossible to implement in a maintainable manner with the current VFS structure. My own experience writing a stacked file system (an in-kernel chunkfs prototype) leads me to agree with these criticisms.
</blockquote>
I <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/02/it-takes-longer-than-it-takes.html">wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Note that my original paper was only incidentally about union mounts, it was a critique of the then-current VFS structure, and a suggestion that stackable vnodes might be a better way to go. It was such a seductive suggestion that it took nearly two decades to refute it!
</blockquote>
Nevertheless, the example I used in <a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/StackingVnodes.pdf"><i>Evolving the Vnode Interface</i></a> of a use for stacking vnodes was what persisted. It took a while for the fact that overlayfs was an official part of the Linux kernel to percolate through the ecosystem, but after six years I was able to write <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/12/blatant-self-promotion.html#more"><i>Blatant Self-Promotion</i></a> about the transformation it wrought on Linux's packaging and software distribution, inspired by Liam Proven's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/03/nixos_linux_os_design/"><i>NixOS and the changing face of Linux operating systems</i></a>. He writes about less radical ideas than NixOS:<br />
<blockquote>
So, instead of re-architecting the way distros are built, vendors are reimplementing similar functionality using simpler tools inherited from the server world: containers, squashfs filesystems inside single files, and, for distros that have them, copy-on-write filesystems to provide rollback functionality.<br />
<br />
The goal is to build operating systems as robust as mobile OSes: periodically, the vendor ships a thoroughly tested and integrated image which end users can't change and don't need to. In normal use, the root filesystem is mounted read-only, and there's no package manager. 
</blockquote>
Since then this model has become universal. Distros ship as a bootable ISO image, which uses overlayfs to mount a writable temporary file system on top. This is precisely how my 1989 prototype was intended to ship SunOS 4.1. The technology has spread to individual applications with systems such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)">Snaps</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpak">Flatpak</a>.<br />
<h3>Three Decades</h3>
The opportunity we saw when we started Nvidia was that the PC was transitioning from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Standard_Architecture">ISA bus</a> to version 1 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect">PCI bus</a>. The ISA bus' bandwidth was completely inadequate for 3D games, but the PCI bus had considerably more. Whether it was enough was an open question. We clearly needed to make the best possible use of the limited bandwidth we could get.<br />
<br />
Nvidia's first chip had three key innovations:<br />
<ol>
<li>Rendering objects with quadric patches not triangles. A realistic model using quadric patches needed perehaps a fifth of the data for an equivalent triangle model.</li>
<li>I/O virtualization with applications using a write-mostly, object-oriented interface. Read operations are neccessarily synchronous, whereas write operations are asynchronous. Thus the more writes per read across sthe bus, the better the utilization of the available bus bandwidth.</li>
<li>A modular internal architecture based on an on-chip token-ring network. Thie goal was that each functional unit be simple enough to be designed and tested by a three-person team.</li>
</ol>

The first two of these enabled us to get Sega's arcade games running at full frame rate on a PC.  Curtis Priem and I designed the second of these, and it is the one that has lasted:<br />
<ul>
<li>I/O virtualization allowed multiple processes direct access to the graphics hardware, with no need to pass operations through the operating system. I explained the importance of this a decade ago in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/hardware-io-virtualization.html"><i>Hardware I/O Virtualization</i></a>, using the example of Amazon building their own network interface cards. Tne first chip appeared on the bus as having 128 wide FIFOs. The operating system could map one of them into each process wanting access to the chip, allowing applications direct access to the hardware but under the control of the operating system.</li>
<li>The interface was write-mostly because the application could read from the FIFO the number of free slots, that is the number of writes before the bus would stall.</li>
<li>The interface was object-oriented because the data and the offset in the FIFO formed an invocation of a method on an instance of a (virtual) class. Some classes were implemented in hardware, others trapped into the kernel and were implemented by the driver, but the application just created and used instances of the available classes without knowing which was which. The classes were arranged in a hierarchy starting with class CLASS. Enumerating the instances of class CLASS told the application which classes it could use. Enumerating the instances of each of those classes told the application how many of each type of resource it could use.</li>
</ul> 
The importance of the last of these was that it decoupled the hardware and software release schedules. Drivers could emulate classes that had yet to appear in hardware, the applications would use the hardware once it was available. Old software would run on newer hardware, it would just see some classes it didn't know how to use. One of our frustrations with Sun was the way software and hardware release schedules were inextricably interlinked.<br />

Last October I celebrated the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/lockss-program-turns-25.html"><i>LOCKSS Program Turns 25</i></a>. Vicky Reich explained to me how libraries preserved paper academic journals and how their move to the Web was changing libraries role from purchasing a copy of the journal to renting access to the publisher's copy, and I came up with the overall peer-to-peer archtecture (and the acronym). With help from Mark Seiden I built the prototype, and after using it to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, also used it to show vulnerabilities in the initial protocol. In 2003 I was part of the team that solved these problems, for which we were awarded the Best Paper award at the Symposium on Operating System Principles for <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/945445.945451"><i>Preserving peer replicas by rate-limited sampled voting</i></a>.<br />

## Jon Stewart, yes you should STFU

date: 2024-07-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>The problem is elites grabbing the wheel with no clue about what comes next.</i></p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/14/bidenActionFigure.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Every Tuesday I look for Jon Stewart's opening for the Daily Show on YouTube. It's always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice. </p>
<p>If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There's never been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff. </p>
<p>I've been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren't any smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that's been the real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we've gotten the tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And now we're at the last moment before it's all flushed away and the NYT et al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less. </p>
<p>Be warned I get really angry at the end and raise my voice. I don't think I've ever done that in a podcast, and I'm not sure I like it. But the rage is real. </p>

## 2024-07-08 Neuchâtel

date: 2024-07-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-08-neuchâtel">2024-07-08 Neuchâtel</h1>

<p>We spent two nights in Neuenburg or Neuchâtel. They came under Prussian control in 1707 because the locals were looking for a government that was far away and wouldn&rsquo;t meddle in their affairs. It became a republic and a canton of Switzerland in 1848.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the death in 1707 of Marie d&rsquo;Orleans-Longueville, duchess de Nemours and Princess of Neuchâtel, the people had to choose her successor from among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince first and foremost to be a Protestant, and also to be strong enough to protect their territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices. Louis XIV actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but the Neuchâtelois people passed them over in favour of King Frederick I of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion through the Houses of Orange and Nassau. With the requisite stability assured, Neuchâtel entered its golden age, with commerce and industry (including watchmaking and lace) and banking undergoing steady expansion. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We met a friend and went for a walk in the late afternoon: from La Neuveville up the Combe du Pulouvi. I took some flower pictures.</p>

<p>At the new Jeunes Rives. It looked very nice but we did see a big dead fish, belly up. That dampened our enthusiasm somewhat.</p>

## July 8, 2024

date: 2024-07-09, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

On July 9, 1868, Americans changed the U.S. Constitution for the fourteenth time, adapting our foundational document to construct a new nation without systematic Black enslavement. In 1865 the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution had prohibited slavery on the basis of race, but it did not prevent the establishment of a system in which Black Americans continued to be unequal. Backed by President Andrew Johnson, who had taken over the presidency after actor John Wilkes Booth had murdered President Abraham Lincoln, white southern Democrats had done their best to push their Black neighbors back into subservience. So long as southern states had abolished enslavement, repudiated Confederate debts, and nullified the ordinances of secession, Johnson was happy to readmit them to full standing in the Union, still led by the very men who had organized the Confederacy and made war on the United States.

## 2024-06-28 Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP

date: 2024-07-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-28-connecting-the-laptop-to-the-server-via-nncp">2024-06-28 Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP</h1>

<p>First, install the <code>nncp</code> package on both systems.
In addition to that, install the <code>openbsd-inetd</code> package on the server.
(In the following passages, I&rsquo;m connected as <code>root</code> to the server.)</p>

<p>Generate new configs on the systems that are missing <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>.</p>

<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>

<p>Examine the file using a text editor.
Each system needs to know the public keys of the other.</p>

<p>So, on the laptop, I need to add to add the public keys of the server.
I also want to specify that I&rsquo;m going to call the node on a regular basis
and that files sent to me from that node should be saved in my &ldquo;incoming&rdquo;
directory. I also want to accept mail.</p>

<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/sibirocobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;12 * * * *&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And on the server, I need to add the public keys of the laptop.
I also want to save incoming files from the laptop.
And I want to accept mail.</p>

<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the laptop calls the server but the server does not call the laptop!</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make sure those directories exist:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir ~/incoming
ssh sibirocobombus mkdir incoming
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s create a file and send it from the laptop to the server using <code>nncp-file</code>:</p>

<pre><code>echo Hello &gt; hello.txt
sudo -u nncp nncp-file hello.txt sibirocobombus:
</code></pre>

<p>Check the log using <code>nncp-log</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nncp-log | tail -n 1
2024-06-28T21:36:02Z File hello.txt (282 B) is sent to sibirocobombus:hello.txt

I got there when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I'd never see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn't even take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It's why we're playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden's presidency, because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about Biden's flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The problem isn't that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were to win, we'll be right back here in another four years, and at that time we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever happens this year, what's waiting for us is for most of us to wake up from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It's all falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start working together, intelligently, or else it's over.

## It's that time

date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the corruption of American journalism. Most of the time we can turn our attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House, and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the journalists, get away with it again.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the press on our democratic process that I'm pretty depressed about the future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said he'd never do it. If they tried to force him, he'd get a gun and shoot them. This isn't the first time I've heard that, and I called bullshit. You're never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won't do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally -- and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn't believe you are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can't get back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone number). I've been through all these miserable processes. And none of them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where we're headed, again.

I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an incredible <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a> to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news sites. It's more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the full story. Maybe it was a  mistake calling this a blogroll. I'm trying to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for themselves. In any case I'm thinking about what to do next with FeedLand, which is what's behind the blogroll software. It hasn't lived up to my hopes, and I don't think it's likely to. I may be done writing software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years, between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of writing for others was not a success. So I'm thinking about how to wind down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a bit. It's that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## July 7, 2024 

date: 2024-07-08, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

I have spent the weekend struggling mightily with a new manuscript and have had little time to study the news. The most notable event from the day is that in a stunning upset, French voters have rejected members of Marine Le Pen&#8217;s far-right National Rally party in legislative elections. After the first round of votes, National Rally candidates appeared to be comfortably ahead, but left-wing and centrist candidates combined forces to prevent splitting the vote, and voters then flooded the polls to elect the candidates that coalition fielded.

## Dear journalism

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn't lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.</p>
<p>What you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>We all knew this would happen.</li>
<li>We all saw it happen, we don't need you to tell us.</li>
<li>We're going with him anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>The plan is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election -- VP Harris steps up.</li>
<li>Now everyone can relax.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak">decloaked</a>, an even bigger story.</p>
<p>BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that they all want Trump to lose? It's logical that they would, but I thought they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous <a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">View From Nowhere</a>. Has that pretense accidentally been dropped?</p>

## Democratic superstars of 2024

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>On Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sarajw@front-end.social/112746718207413752">Sara Joy writes</a>: "Let Biden run. Let Kamala and lots of other younger Dems take on lots of events. Support him from underneath. If and when he falters, the party is there to prop him up, take up the slack, or step in."</p>
<p>I had a similar idea.</p>
<p>Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.</p>
<p>Let all the great next generation democrats shine. </p>
<p>Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.</p>
<p>Joe Biden dials in via satellite.</p>
<p>"Listen, I'm an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren't they wonderful!"</p>
<p>He puts on his robe and slippers, sits in a rocking chair with a dog at his feet and his grandchildren playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">yahtzee</a> and checkers...</p>
<p>And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn't spill his beer, so you know they have his back.</p>
<p>Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Collect them all!</p>
<p>You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.</p>
<p>Some would be very rare.</p>
<p>Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack, Michelle and Bill would have a concert. </p>
<p>Hosted by Mayor Pete!</p>
<p>Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.</p>
<p>Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit. </p>
<p>And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers. </p>
<p>Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and the freedom fighters. </p>
<p>All the heroes of America, standing up for America. </p>
<p>The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course Lynne Cheney.</p>
<p>We don't need no freaking monarch, they all sing.</p>
<p>No we don't! shouts the people. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJBaIUZwmTs&t=43s">On video</a>, the Dead sing "I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do!"</p>
<p>Shake the hand that shook the hand of PT Barnum and Charlie Chan.</p>
<p>We all march together to victory.</p>

## Hot take: social platforms should disallow special character growth hacking

<p>In the second of this mini-series of post-deadline catch-ups (<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2024/06/miscellany-101/">the first dealt with punctuation</a>), I’ve collected some links on the subject of books.</p>
