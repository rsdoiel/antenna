101: What Exactly Are Literary Fiction, Upmarket Fiction, and Book Club
Fiction?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-28, from: Literature &amp; a Latte blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;If you look at fiction on a continuum, pulp fiction (a term no longer used) is at one end and literary fiction is at the other. Pulp fiction, named for the cheap magazines it was published in during the early and mid&amp;ndash;20th century, was often hastily written and offered readers a quick thrill. However, many well-known writers came from the pulps: Dashiell Hammett, Robert Heinlein, and Zane Grey were all pulp writers who have come to be respected for their work.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
One could even consider classic authors such as Charles Dickens or
Alexandre Dumas to be pulp writers. Their writings were published in
serial form, weekly or monthly, and sold in cheap publications that
allowed everyday people to follow their stories. Some were even
serialized in newspapers, such as Dumas’ <em>The Count of Monte
Cristo</em>. While these authors, and many others who published in
serial form, are considered to be among the greats, the majority of
serial authors are forgotten. These older authors, whose books have
stood the test of time, are considered to be <em>classic</em> authors,
and their works are today often called literary fiction.
</p>
<p>What is literary fiction?</p>
<p>
Literary fiction exists in opposition to commercial fiction or genre
fiction. It suggests books that are better written, with deeper themes
and more developed characters, and often less dependent on plot. This
term was developed near the end of the 19th century as a way of
distinguishing <em>artistic</em> fiction from serial fiction. It stood
apart from genre fiction, which was considered to be for “the people,”
and created an elite group of writers who belonged to academies, whose
work was analyzed by critics and professors, and who were awarded prizes
for their work.
</p>
<p>
Literary fiction is a broad church and can include many works that were
published in serial form, such as works by Charles Dickens and Fyodor
Dostoyevsky, as well as more demanding fiction by authors like James
Joyce, Franz Kafka, William Faulkner, and Marcel Proust. Today, it is
often used to separate authors from genre fiction, which, to some, can
seem reductive.
</p>
<p>
Authors of literary fiction can write in genres, as Margaret Atwood and
Kazuo Ishiguro have done with their speculative fiction, or John
Banville with his series of mysteries written under the name Benjamin
Black, or William Boyd, who has written James Bond novels. Some genre
authors are considered to be literary authors, often after their deaths:
Raymond Chandler and Isaac Asimov are often cited in that respect. More
recently, Stephen King received the Medal of Distinguished Contribution
to American Letters in 2003, from the National Book Awards, highlighting
that, even as a genre author, his writing is of a quality that
transcends much genre fiction.
</p>
<p>What is upmarket fiction?</p>
<p>
Upmarket fiction tries to straddle the gap between commercial fiction
and literary fiction. Upmarket fiction may have plot structures similar
to commercial or genre fiction, but focuses more on carefully crafted
writing style rather than fast pacing or plot-driver stories. It can
have deeper characters and themes and may feature techniques such as
multiple points of view or multiple timelines. Upmarket fiction is a
term generally used in the publishing trade, and not often by readers.
It is a way of saying that a novel is well-written but has broad appeal.
</p>
<p>
Literary fiction used to be the space where authors would focus on
character development, examine the human condition, analyze social and
political issues, and experiment with language. But these are elements
of many genres these days. Crime fiction often deals with social issues,
science fiction delves into politics, and many genres feature more
experimentation with language in recent decades than in the past.
Upmarket fiction can be genre fiction that goes beyond the tropes of the
genre to touch on issues previously the province of literary fiction.
</p>
<p>What is book club fiction?</p>
<p>
Book club fiction is a recent concept, which began early in this
century, to describe high-quality, thought-provoking fiction. These are
not book clubs that send readers books each month, like the Book of the
Month Club in the United States, but rather a type of fiction that can
be discussed in a book club setting. Book club fiction is generally
upmarket fiction, and is often marketed specifically to book clubs,
small gatherings of people who read and discuss books. Many such books
contain questions at the back of the books that can be used to stimulate
discussion in book clubs.
</p>
<p>
This concept has also grown as celebrities have created their own book
clubs. People such as Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and The Today
Show’s Jenna Bush Hager select books, discuss them, and often provide
interviews with authors. These book clubs are extremely influential in
the publishing industry, often driving sales and helping to launch the
careers of new authors, or creating huge best-sellers for books by
established authors.
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reesesbookclub/" target="_blank">Reese
Witherspoon</a> “picks books she loves with a woman at the center of the
story,” and model
<a href="https://libraryscience.net" target="_blank">Kaia Gerber’s book
club</a> chooses “books that aren’t on the typical bestseller lists in
order to better highlight new voices, writers to watch, overlooked, or
underrepresented stories.”
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, almost all these celebrity book clubs are run by women.
One notable exception is former president Barack Obama, who, while not
calling it a book club, releases
<a href="https://www.obama.org/stories/president-obamas-favorite-books-and-music-summer-2024/" target="_blank">a
list of his favorite reads each summer</a>. His choices cover a wide
range of books, both fiction and non-fiction.
</p>
<p>
Readers may be aware of the term literary fiction; most retailers use
this term, and it’s where non-genre fiction books are generally shelved
in bookstores. But writers need to be aware of the differences between
these three types of books, so when they query agents, they can situate
their novels in the appropriate category.
