Self-Enforcing Protocol to Solve Gerrymandering</h2>

In 2009,
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/08/self-enforcing.html">I
wrote</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are several ways two people can divide a piece of cake in half.
One way is to find someone impartial to do it for them. This works, but
it requires another person. Another way is for one person to divide the
piece, and the other person to complain (to the police, a judge, or his
parents) if he doesn’t think it’s fair. This also works, but still
requires another person—­at least to resolve disputes. A third way is for
one person to do the dividing, and for the other person to choose the
half he wants.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The point is that unlike protocols that require a neutral third party to
complete (arbitrated), or protocols that require that neutral third
party to resolve disputes (adjudicated), self-enforcing protocols just
work. Cut-and-choose works because neither side can cheat. And while the
math can get really complicated, the idea …

to
<a href="https://youtu.be/GjR7sRASjdo?feature=shared&amp;t=3215">[53:35]</a>.
Andy speaks:<br /> <br /> The true story is that I met the founders of
Google before the company existed because they were, like I was, a
student at Stanford. I’m not sure Larry was really ready to abandon the
PhD program and jump into this. So I was in this same position once
myself and I used the same line “you’ll always finish your PhD later”.
Now the concern I had is that if they didn’t get going this great idea
may be not happening. <br /><br /> Of course I was involved in the
company itself but it was really really a very good idea, one of the
best ideas I’ve ever seen. This notion of relevant search and relevant
ads and this business model that solved it Put it this way, I was very
familiar with scientific publishing where what matters is not how many
papers you write but how many people cite your papers. So if you apply
the same thing to the Web clearly what is relevant is what other people
link to and notice. You could automatically build a graph, a structure
that said what’s more important than others. <br /><br /> At the time
people didn’t think automatic search was actually possible because Alta
Vista which was popular at the time just looked at keywords. What people
would do is they would add the whole dictionary as a dark page behind
the document. Since every word you are looking for is in the dictionary
you couldn’t find anything any more because every document had every
word. That wasn’t a path to success; you couldn’t actually look at the
document because it could just be spam. <br /><br /> Yahoo believed
fairly strongly, they actually had at one point talked to Larry and
Sergey and maybe even Larry was offering them to sell them the idea but
Yahoo passed on the belief that you just couldn’t do it. They really
thought you could hire people, like newspaper editors, they would make
the sports section and the garden section like a newspaper; select
content from the Web that then they would present to the front page.
Clearly that was not going to scale if there were millions of Web pages
you just couldn’t keep it up. <br /><br /> So Larry and Sergey believed
very strongly that it had to be automatic and that if that wasn’t
possible — it was the only way to do it basically. That first demo which
they had on a laptop was actually quite compelling it looked the same as
before — here’s the lucky button. The only worry was they wanted to sort
of demo they could scale the search engine to like a couple of racks of
computers before they would raise the real venture and there was some
question whether it was scalable. For that they just wanted to raise a
small amount of money to build the first couple of racks with
motherboards. <br /><br /> The money that I put in there on day one was
actually before the company started helped to demonstrate that. So I
bought them this check. They had the name of the company but the check
was to the name of the company that didn’t exist. At the time some of
the law firms were so busy they didn’t want to take on new clients that
didn’t have some funding behind them. I figured if I write them a check
it would help them to get the right firm. But I can’t claim any credit
for what they’ve done its all due to the insight they had and the team
they built. <br /><br /> Let me back up here. I couldn’t find stuff on
Alta Vista so I was desperate for better search. A lot of my time was
looking for data sheets and information I was looking for and if I
couldn’t find anything on the Web the Web wouldn’t be very useful. Like,
how do you find stuff? Its the most important thing. So for me it was a
personal goal to have something that would actually work. <br /><br />
But in any new company the first question is “what’s your business
model?” Even at the time they had this model of sponsored links that
would take your search query and link it to this ad inventory. I asked
them “how much is it per click?” and they said 5 cents per click which
is still their bottom price today - this is before they got into the
competitive bidding - and I did this math in the back of my mind “a
million clicks a day and 5 cents a click is $50K a day” — they can’t go
broke. <br /><br /> I had no idea how this would scale, in effect I
don’t think anybody understood this but it was clear that there was
enough interest in finding the people who were looking for stuff. Lets
say you search for a tennis racket. That means you’re probably a tennis
player and most likely there will be an ad that shows you tennis rackets
or tennis balls or something that relates to your interest. And the key
was you have an unlimited ad inventory, instead of having these banner
ads that I have never clicked on in my life, maybe once. <br /><br />
Banner ads are a waste of bandwidth essentially. These ads were highly
more relevant and even today except for spam mail its the most
cost-effective way of advertising or finding customers. It took
advantage of the fact that the Internet is a full-duplex communication
path whereas banner ads were more like TV — here’s your ad break and
here’s what you have to consume before you get to the next page.
<br /><br /> Google was an absolutely brilliant idea but funnily enough
their business really took off after the dot-com implosion in 2001. If
you look at their historical revenue what happened at that point I
believe was that people realized that they spent on banner ads was
basically wasted and they got back to an ROI calculation of where do we
apply money more cost-effectively and, yeah, so Google. Once people
started bidding for the keywords of course the price per click went up
but it still provides very very good value for advertisers.</p>

many have fled their country and are coming to ours. In 2023, more than
260,000 Venezuelan migrants crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. Venezuela’s
migrants represent the largest displacement crisis in the world.</p>

<h2 id="cfpbs-proposed-data-rules">CFPB’s Proposed Data Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, updated: 2024-01-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
In October, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)
<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb-1033-nprm-fr-notice_2023-10.pdf">proposed
a set of rules</a> that if implemented would transform how financial
institutions handle personal data about their customers. The rules put
control of that data back in the hands of ordinary Americans, while at
the same time undermining the data broker economy and increasing
customer choice and competition. Beyond these economic effects, the
rules have important data security benefits.
</p>
<p>
The CFPB’s rules align with a key security idea: the
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-privacy">decoupling
principle</a>. By separating which companies see what parts of our data,
and in what contexts, we can gain control over data about ourselves
(improving privacy) and harden cloud infrastructure against hacks
(improving security). Officials at the CFPB have described the new rules
as an attempt to accelerate a shift toward “open banking,” and after an
initial comment period on the new rules closed late last year, Rohit
Chopra, the CFPB’s director, …

<h2 id="criming-on-the-blockchain">Criming On The Blockchain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
I apologize for the delay in posting but, as you will see, the post I
was working on grew rather long.<br /> <br /> It seems obvious that
doing crimes and writing the receipts to an immutable public ledger is
risky, but many criminals have been convinced that there is no risk
because cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are anonymous. Although there
are cryptocurrencies with anonymous transactions, such as Monero and
zCash, they are much more difficult to use and much less liquid than
pseudonymous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As many criminals have
discovered, without an unrealistically intense focus on
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/02/inadequate-opsec.html">operational
security (opsec)</a>, the identity behind the pseudonym can be revealed.
An entire industry has evolved to do these revelations, tracing the flow
of coins through their blockchains.<br /> <br /> Below the fold I
discuss the techniques and results of blockchain tracing, based on four
main sources:<br />

Greenberg’s book lays out the history of blockchain tracing technology,
starting from Sarah Meiklejohn <i>et al</i>’s 2013 paper entitled
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2504730.2504747"><i>A Fistful of
Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men with No Names</i></a>. Their
abstract reads:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin is a purely online virtual currency, unbacked by either physical
commodities or sovereign obligation; instead, it relies on a combination
of cryptographic protection and a peer-to-peer protocol for witnessing
settlements. Consequently, Bitcoin has the unintuitive property that
while the ownership of money is implicitly anonymous, its flow is
globally visible. In this paper we explore this unique characteristic
further, using heuristic clustering to group Bitcoin wallets based on
evidence of shared authority, and then using re-identification attacks
(i.e., empirical purchasing of goods and services) to classify the
operators of those clusters. From this analysis, we characterize
longitudinal changes in the Bitcoin market, the stresses these changes
are placing on the system, and the challenges for those seeking to use
Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent purposes at scale.
</blockquote>
Meiklejohn started from an observation by Satoshi Nakamoto.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">Greenberg
quotes Nakamoto</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which
necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner,”
Satoshi wrote. “The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed,
linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same
owner.”
</blockquote>
Linking the inputs of multi-input transactions roughly halved the then
number of Bitcoin users. Meiklejohn then developed the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">“change
address” technique</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
When you pay someone 6 bitcoins from a 10-coin address, 6 coins go to
their address. Your change, 4 coins, is stored at a new address, which
your wallet software creates for you. The challenge, when looking at
that transaction on the blockchain as a sleuthing observer, is that the
recipient’s address and the change address are both simply listed as
outputs, with no label to tell them apart.<br /> <br /> But sometimes,
Meiklejohn realized, spotting the difference between the change address
and the recipient address was easy: If one address had been used before
and the other hadn’t, the second, totally fresh address could only be
the change address
</blockquote>
Meiklejohn’s first criminal case started when “Flycracker” raised funds
to mail Brian Krebs a baker’s dozen bags of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">heroin
from Silk Road</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Flycracker had made it easy. By posting a Bitcoin address to the
cybercriminal forum, he’d given Meiklejohn a starting point. She simply
copied the thirty-four-character string into her blockchain software and
looked at the transactions at that address. After collecting 2 bitcoins
in donations at the address he’d posted, worth around $200 at the time,
a little over three-quarters of the money had been sent to another
address, with a third collecting the change. At a glance, Meiklejohn
immediately identified the change address and checked the money’s
destination against her database. Sure enough, the address was one of
the nearly 300,000 she had already tagged as belonging to the Silk Road.
Meiklejohn had just connected Flycracker’s address directly to the
source of the heroin he’d tried to use to frame Krebs.
</blockquote>
The first major cryptocurrency bust Greenberg recounts was the arrest of
Silk Road’s Dread Pirate Roberts in a San Francisco library. It
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">did
not depend upon these tracing techniques</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The FBI has described that cybersurveillance coup as the result of a
misconfiguration in the site’s use of the Tor anonymity software but has
been reluctant to ever officially explain that error in a courtroom.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">In
fact</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
it had been the IRS’s Gary Alford, sitting in his New Jersey home four
months earlier, who’d done the meticulous, unglamorous work that had led
to the case’s first real breakthrough. Alford had been using Google to
dig up the earliest online posts about the Silk Road on drug forums when
he’d found a curious artifact: Someone going by the name “altoid” had
posted to a site called the Shroomery in January 2011 recommending the
Silk Road’s just-launched dark web market as a source for drugs. Around
the same time, a user with the same handle had also asked for
programming help on a coding forum. On that page, altoid had listed his
email address: rossulbricht@gmail.com.
</blockquote>
Another IRS agent, Tigran Gambaryan, received a tip that Carl Force, one
of the DEA agents working on Silk Road, had used a fake ID to set up an
account at Bitstamp, a cryptocurrency exchange, and deposited a lot of
BTC He had cashed out $200K and, as Gambaryan
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">examined
his financial records</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He found that Force had, in late 2013, paid off his home’s entire
mortgage, an outstanding loan of $130,000. He’d repaid, too, a $22,000
loan he’d taken out against his federal retirement account. He’d even
made a gift of tens of thousands of dollars to his local church, the
sort of largesse that, Gambaryan knew all too well, was tough to afford
on a federal agent’s salary. The numbers only got shadier from there:
Gambaryan found records of real estate investments in which Force had
listed his net worth as more than 1 million. That wealth was almost
entirely due, it became clear, to a massive influx of liquidated
bitcoins from cryptocurrency exchanges like Bitstamp and CampBX that had
flowed into Force’s bank accounts. The payments totaled $776,000 beyond
his $150,000 annual DEA salary over the two prior years that he’d worked
on the Silk Road case. With that ample financial padding, Force had then
retired from the DEA, just days before Gambaryan began to look into his
records.
</blockquote>
Gambaryan could get Force’s wallet addresses from the exchanges he used,
and he found an unencrypted message from DPR referencing a 525 BTC
payment to Force’s investigative alias, but he needed proof, So,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">Greenberg
writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite having read Meiklejohn’s paper, he possessed none of the data
that she’d assembled over months of clustering Bitcoin addresses and
identifying them with test transactions. So he simply started copying
Bitcoin addresses from Carl Force’s account records—the ones he’d gotten
from exchanges such as CampBX and Bitstamp—and pasting them into the
search field on Blockchain.info, which displayed the entire blockchain
on the web. At first, the collections of garbled character strings
seemed meaningless to Gambaryan. But almost immediately, he could see he
was onto something. On September 27, 2013, just a few days before Ross
Ulbricht’s arrest, Gambaryan saw with a jolt of recognition that one of
Force’s CampBX addresses had received a 525-bitcoin payment—the magic
number that DPR had mentioned in his conveniently unencrypted message.
</blockquote>
Gambaryan manually followed the chains backward, from their inputs to
the outputs that caused them,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">until
finally</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Following the money at each of the remaining addresses back one more
step, he now saw the coins had originally come from just four sources.
Each of those addresses had received their funds on the same day: August
4, 2013—the exact date when the Dread Pirate Roberts had told Nob he’d
paid him. Gambaryan mentally recorded the payments: They were for 127,
61, 134, and 203 bitcoins. He added the numbers in his head. They summed
up to 525 bitcoins.<br /> …<br /> The next morning, after a few hours’
sleep, Gambaryan began texting his DHS contact Jared Der-Yeghiayan, the
Armenian American agent in Chicago whom he’d befriended. He needed to
check the four addresses he’d found with someone who had access to the
Dread Pirate Roberts’s Bitcoin wallet. As a member of the Silk Road
investigation team, Der-Yeghiayan still had access to all the site’s
server data, including its Bitcoin addresses. Der-Yeghiayan called
Gambaryan back a few hours later and confirmed what Gambaryan already
knew: Each of the four addresses belonged to DPR.
</blockquote>
He thus became apparently the first law enforcer to use blockchain
tracing as evidence in an investigation. Its first use in a trial
appears to be when, with help from Nick Weaver, the prosecution of Ross
Ulbricht introduced a trace of his payment for
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">
a murder-for-hire attempt</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But the day when the prosecution found the incontrovertible, public, and
unerasable proof of Ulbricht’s Silk Road millions, argues Nick Weaver,
remains a milestone in the history of cryptocurrency and crime. “That is
the date,” Weaver says, “that you can state unequivocally that law
enforcement learned that the blockchain is forever.”
</blockquote>
The blockchain tracing industry’s pioneer, Chainalysis, spun out of the
Kraken exchange as a result of the next big crime Greenberg covers, the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">collapse
of the Mt. Gox exchange</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Kraken’s management, in a pro bono attempt to help rescue the
cryptocurrency ecosystem from the rippling shock of Mt. Gox’s
failure—and the collapse in Bitcoin’s price that followed—had agreed to
help distribute any remaining bitcoins that could be found to Mt. Gox’s
thousands upon thousands of angry creditors.<br /> <br /> Michael
Gronager, for his part, had taken on a far more uncertain task. He’d
agreed to find the missing coins. By all appearances, this was not a
rational decision. The Danish entrepreneur had left his relatively
comfortable position as the COO of Kraken to found a new start-up whose
sole client, for the moment, was this roomful of Japanese bankruptcy
lawyers asking him to track down Mt. Gox’s gigantic, wayward fortune.

The co-evolution of Bitcoin’s and tracing technology started with the
revelation that Chainalysis, by running a node in the Bitcoin network,
could discover the IP address associated with many wallets, which
garnered both hostility and customers. With a head-start, Chainalysis
rapidly became the leader in their emerging market, as
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Increasing-Returns-Dependence-Economics-Cognition/dp/0472064967">Brian
Arthur</a> would have predicted.<br /> <br /> The next investigation
Greenberg covers was into the BTC-e exchange,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">whose</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
computers where the exchange was hosted weren’t on the dark web,
protected by Tor. They ought to be discoverable with a simple
“traceroute” command, an operation that anyone with a computer and an
internet connection can run to find a site’s IP address—no harder than
looking up a commercial service’s number in a phone book. Gambaryan
checked, and it turned out the only layer of misdirection that had
prevented curious observers from learning the location of BTC-e’s
servers in the first place was a company called Cloudflare, a web
infrastructure provider and security service that shielded the
exchange’s IPs from prying eyes like Gambaryan’s.
</blockquote>
Subpoenas to Cloudflare revealed they were hosted in the US, which
allowed them to be
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">imaged</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Gambaryan dug into the data his team had copied from the BTC-e server.
What he found was a revelation: The IP address for the account trading
in stolen Mt. Gox coins on BTC-e matched one of the few IP addresses on
the BTC-e server’s allow list for the administrators’ connections. In
other words, the person who had siphoned hundreds of thousands of
bitcoins from Mt. Gox into BTC-e wasn’t just any BTC-e user. They were a
BTC-e administrator. Specifically, an admin with the username WME. “The
gears started turning in my head,” Gambaryan remembers. “What better way
to launder hundreds of thousands of bitcoins than to launch your own
Bitcoin exchange?”
</blockquote>
WME was Alexander Vinnik but, alas, he was in Russia.<br /> <br />
Greenberg goes on to describe the takedown of Alexandre Cazes, who ran
the Alphabay dark-web market and the related takeover of the Hansa
dark-web market, and then of the Welcome to Video child sexual abuse
site. This led to the arrest and indictment of a Texas-based
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tracers-Dark-Global-Crime-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B09SKW8WRV/">Border
Patrol agent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Texas man had taken a rare approach to his legal defense: He’d
pleaded guilty to possession of child sexual abuse materials, but he
also appealed his conviction. He argued that his case should be thrown
out because IRS agents had identified him by tracking his Bitcoin
payments—without a warrant—which he claimed violated his Fourth
Amendment right to privacy and represented an unconstitutional
“search.”<br /> <br /> A panel of appellate judges considered the
argument—and rejected it. In a nine-page opinion, they explained their
ruling, setting down a precedent that spelled out in glaring terms
exactly how far from private they determined Bitcoin’s transactions to
be.<br /> <br /> “Every Bitcoin user has access to the public Bitcoin
blockchain and can see every Bitcoin address and its respective
transfers. Due to this publicity, it is possible to determine the
identities of Bitcoin address owners by analyzing the blockchain,” the
ruling read. “There is no intrusion into a constitutionally protected
area because there is no constitutional privacy interest in the
information on the blockchain.”<br /> <br /> A search requires a
warrant, the American judicial system has long held, only if that search
enters into a domain where the defendant has a “reasonable expectation
of privacy.” The judges’ ruling argued that no such expectation should
have existed here: The HSI agent wasn’t caught in the Welcome to Video
dragnet because IRS agents had violated his privacy. He was caught, the
judges concluded, because he had mistakenly believed his Bitcoin
transactions to have ever been private in the first place.
</blockquote>
This firmly established blockchain tracing as a legitimate form of
evidence.<br /> <br />

BTC from Bitfinex, to which

this case. The two VCE4 accounts used Russian e-mail addresses, but the
VCE7 and VCE8 accounts were in the name of companies controlled by

Deanonymizing individual wallets and flows is valuable to Chainalysis’
clients; law enforcement for evidence and financial institutions for
risk-assessment. But their vast collection of tagged wallet addresses
and transactions is also valuable in aggregate. It enables statistical
analysis of the cryptosphere, such as Chainalysis’ annual report on
cryptocurrency crime. This year’s is introduced in
<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/"><i>2024
Crypto Crime Trends: Illicit Activity Down as Scamming and Stolen Funds
Fall, But Ransomware and Darknet Markets See Growth</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
2023 saw a significant drop in value received by illicit cryptocurrency
addresses, to a total of $24.2 billion. As always, we have to caveat by
saying that these figures are lower bound estimates based on inflows to
the illicit addresses we’ve identified today. One year from now, these
totals will almost certainly be higher, as we identify more illicit
addresses and incorporate their historic activity into our estimates.
For instance, when we published our Crypto Crime Report last year, we
estimated $20.6 billion worth of illicit transaction volume for 2022.
One year later, our updated estimate for 2022 is $39.6 billion. Much of
that growth came from the identification of previously unknown, highly
active addresses hosted by sanctioned services, as well as our addition
of transaction volume associated with services in sanctioned
jurisdictions to our illicit totals.<br /> <br /> Another key reason the
new total is so much higher, besides the identification of new illicit
addresses: We’re now counting the $8.7 billion in creditor claims
against FTX in our 2022 figures. In last year’s report,
</blockquote>
Although these arae large sums, Chainalysys estimate they represent a
fairly small proportion of the total cryptocurrency volume, falling from
0.42% in 2022 to 0.34% in 2023. Of course, it is unlikely that they have
identified <i>all</i> the illicit transactions.<br /> <br />

The report has a
<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">big
surprise</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Through 2021, Bitcoin reigned supreme as the cryptocurrency of choice
among cybercriminals, likely due to its high liquidity. But that’s
changed over the last two years, with stablecoins now accounting for the
majority of all illicit transaction volume. This change also comes
alongside recent growth in stablecoins’ share of all crypto activity
overall, including legitimate activity.
</blockquote>
Bitcoin’s volatility is great for speculation, but when it fails to
proceed moonwards it is a big problem for criminals, and
<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">especially
for sanctions-busters</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Some forms of illicit cryptocurrency activity, such as darknet market
sales and ransomware extortion, still take place predominantly in
Bitcoin. Others, like scamming and transactions associated with
sanctioned entities, have shifted to stablecoins. Those also happen to
be the biggest forms of crypto crime by transaction volume, thereby
driving the larger trend. Sanctioned entities, as well as those
operating in sanctioned jurisdictions or involved with terrorism
financing, also have a greater incentive to use stablecoins, as they may
face more challenges accessing the U.S. dollar through traditional
means, but still want to benefit from the stability it provides.
</blockquote>
The report notes that stablecoin users,criminal or not, run the risk of
having their wallets and thus their funds “frozen”, as Tether has been
doing recently. Patrick Tan covered the case of an Indian user (The
Victim) in detail in
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508"><i>What

into the deliberately confusing details and ends up agreeing with
<a href="https://datafinnovation.medium.com/3249639e677a">Jonathan
Reiter</a> about the The Victim’s problem:<br />
<blockquote>
On a basic level this user was relying on an unlicensed money
transmitter where they have 0 access to any authority that feels
accountable to them.<br /> <br /> Tether isn’t an Indian money services
business. Nor is it regulated in the victim’s country. Or anywhere with
a real process.<br /> …<br /> This — precisely this — is the cost of
living outside the law. You may end up with no recourse. Or not.<br />
<br /> But you don’t even have someone to complain to that feels
accountable for your problems (i.e. your local police or elected
representative, or an employee of a business accountable to a regulator
you can contact).

It turns out that evading sanctions is the
<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">major
criminal use case</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Perhaps the most obvious trend that emerges when looking at illicit
transaction volume is the prominence of sanctions-related transactions.
Sanctioned entities and jurisdictions together accounted for a combined
$14.9 billion worth of transaction volume in 2023, which represents
61.5% of all illicit transaction volume we measured on the year. Most of
this total is driven by cryptocurrency services that were sanctioned by
the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC), or are located in sanctioned jurisdictions, and can continue to
operate because they’re in jurisdictions where U.S. sanctions are not
enforced. <br /> <br /> While those services can and have been used for
nefarious purposes, it also means that some of that $14.9 billion in
sanctions-related transaction volume includes activity from average
crypto users who happen to reside in those jurisdictions. For example,
Russia-based exchange Garantex, which was sanctioned by OFAC and OFSI in
the U.K. for its facilitation of money laundering on behalf of
ransomware attackers and other cybercriminals, was one of the biggest
drivers of transaction volume associated with sanctioned entities in
2023. Garantex continues to operate because Russia does not enforce U.S.
sanctions. So, does that mean all of Garantex’s transaction volume is
associated with ransomware and money laundering? No. Nevertheless,
exposure to Garantex introduces serious sanctions risk for crypto
platforms subject to U.S. or U.K. jurisdiction, which means those
platforms must remain ever-more vigilant and screen for exposure to
Garantex in order to be compliant.
</blockquote>
Translation: platforms need to subscribe to Chainalysis to be safe. Andy
Greenberg’s
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/stablecoin-sanctions-violations-crypto-crime/"><i>‘Stablecoins’
Enabled $40 Billion in Crypto Crime Since 2022</i></a> quotes
Chainalysis’ Andrew Fierman:<br />
<blockquote>
As examples, Fierman points to Nobitex, the largest cryptocurrency
exchange operating in the sanctioned country of Iran, as well as
Garantex, a notorious exchange based in Russia that has been
specifically sanctioned for its widespread criminal use. Stablecoin
usage on Nobitex outstrips bitcoin by a 9:1 ratio, and on Garantex by a
5:1 ratio, Chainalysis found. That’s a stark difference from the roughly
1:1 ratio between stablecoins and bitcoins on a few nonsanctioned
mainstream exchanges that Chainalysis checked for comparison.
</blockquote>
Of course, when Chainalysis says “stablecoin” they essentially mean
Tether. Three years ago, this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">interview of
Charles Yang</a>, head trader of Genesis Block based in Hong Kong, by
John Riggins descibed how Tether was the basis for trade flows in
South-East Asia because it evaded governments’ currency controls.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">Yang
noted</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
bank acccounts are the absolute most valuable thing — you have to set up
a bunch of different companies, a lot of different bank accounts just to
facilitate trades that aren’t that big, maybe $50K. The moment you tell
them this is for a USDT trade, you’re basically asking them to shut your
bank account down.

The report details techniques such as
<a href="https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2024/Casino_Underground_Banking_Report_2024.pdf">points-running
and motorcades</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As third- and fourth-party payments have become better understood by
authorities and more widely reported following ‘Operation Chain Break’
and other measures in China, organized crime groups have responded by
accelerating the integration of cryptocurrencies into their illegal
betting operations, creating significant challenges for investigators.
In recent years, law enforcement and financial intelligence authorities
have reported the growing use of sophisticated, high-speed money
laundering ‘motorcade’ teams specializing in underground USDT – fiat
currency exchanges (卡接回U) across East and Southeast Asia. This has
also included the mass recruitment of mule bank accounts across
virtually all jurisdictions in the Asia Pacific region which can be
purchased for as little as US $30.<br /> <br /> Due to the rise of
cryptocurrency-integrated motorcades, points running syndicates, and
other challenges, in 2021 the Government of China banned cryptocurrency
transactions, trading, and mining. The industry subsequently migrated to
various jurisdictions, particularly driving up already rising
cryptocurrency adoption in several countries in Southeast Asia, together
with the establishment of high-risk and underground cryptocurrency
exchanges. At the same time, it is worth noting that cryptocurrency
flows connected to organized crime have been cited as being vastly
underestimated by industry experts as well as law enforcement and
regulatory authorities in the region. Experts have pointed to a number
of shortcomings related to existing analyses including massive gaps in
crime attribution on the blockchain, fabricated reporting by crypto
exchanges, and the prevalence of wash trading which inflates crypto
transaction volumes, thereby shrinking the portion of illicit
transactions identified.

sanctions system, but countries like China with strict controls on
cross-boarder currency flows are also worried about similar undermining.

<h2 id="the-last-woman-standing">The Last Woman Standing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>There’s an old expression in boxing, a “slugger’s chance.” It means
an underdog is given an outside chance to win if the fighter has a
reputation for being an especially heavy puncher. I’ve been saying since
Nikki Haley first got into the race for the Republican presidential
nomination that she had a slugger’s chance. With Haley’s bid for an
upset fading but not yet finished, let’s take a look at whether she
still has even that chance. The so-called smart money has said from the
start that there is no way she can defeat Donald Trump.</p>

Microsoft is

that a Russian intelligence agency—the same one responsible for
SolarWinds—accessed the email system of the company’s executives.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Beginning in late November 2023, the threat actor used a password spray
attack to compromise a legacy non-production test tenant account and
gain a foothold, and then used the account’s permissions to access a
very small percentage of Microsoft corporate email accounts, including
members of our senior leadership team and employees in our
cybersecurity, legal, and other functions, and exfiltrated some emails
and attached documents. The investigation indicates they were initially
targeting email accounts for information related to Midnight Blizzard
itself. …

Spotify</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>As a way to play music, it was better in nearly every way. Spotify
then became my favorite way to listen to music. Recently though, I’ve
found myself hating Spotify. The app loads slowly. Music no longer plays
instantly. The interface is riddled with recommendations, podcasts,
audiobooks, and other junk that I don’t care for. …</p>

<h2 id="willie-on-my-mind">Willie On My Mind</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>I was reminiscing recently about songs that are close to my heart. So
many country songs from my younger years pop into my head at the oddest
times these days, but I heard one recently from my friend Willie Nelson
that reminded me of another time in Texas, a gentler time, and it’s
certainly a reason to smile. Back in 1982, Willie recorded “Always On My
Mind.”</p>
