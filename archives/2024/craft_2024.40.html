Nov. 23</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>I’ve never shown my work in a gallery. I’ve been asked a few times,
but my problem is this: I don’t want to give up 50 percent of the sales
price to the gallery. I’d rather skip the glory of cheese and boxed wine
in plastic cups and sell my work direct. But gallery shows…</p>

<h2 id="sharp-angles-end-grain">Sharp Angles &amp; End Grain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>This is an excerpt from “Euclid’s Door” by Geo. R Walker and Jim
Toplin. The book teaches how to make the tools from “By Hand and Eye.”

<h2 id="another-dang-drilling-trick">Another Dang Drilling Trick</h2>
