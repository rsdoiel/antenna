## Huffy upgrades Green Machine for electric age as $600 adult drift trike

If you wanted to spin out (and what else would you want to do?), you’d simply push one stick forward and the other stick back and hold on!</p>



<p>Well, a lot has changed in the almost 50 years since the Green Machine debuted, and Huffy knows it has many adults, like myself, nostalgic for that drift experience without having to do all of that pedaling.</p>



<p>Enter the Huffy Electric Green Machine…</p>
