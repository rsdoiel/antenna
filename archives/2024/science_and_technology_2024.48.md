## The OSNews extra special discount bonanza extravaganza Black Friday super coverage

date: 2024-11-29, from: OS News

Today is &#8220;Black Friday&#8221;, which is the day where a lot of retailers, both online and offline, pretend to have massive discounts on things they either raised the prices for a few weeks ago, or for useless garbage they bought in bulk that&#8217;ll end up in a landfill within a year. Technology media happily partakes in this event, going full-mask off posting an endless stream of &#8220;stories&#8221; promoting these discounts. They&#8217;re writing ads for fake discounts, often for products from the very companies they&#8217;re supposed to report on, and dress them up as normal articles. It&#8217;s sad and revealing, highlighting just how much of the technology media landscape is owned by giant media conglomerates. OSNews does not partake. We&#8217;re independent, answer to nobody, and are mostly funded directly by you, our readers. If you want to keep it this way, and keep OSNews free from the tripe you see on every other technology site around this time, consider supporting us through Patreon, making a one-time donation through Ko-Fi, or buying some merch. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s our extra special discount bonanza extravaganza Black Friday super coverage.

## Cinnamon Desktop 6.4 released

date: 2024-11-28, from: OS News

The Cinnamon Desktop, the GTK desktop environment developed by the Linux Mint project, has just released version 6.4. The focus of this release is on nips and tucks in the default theme, dialogs, menus, and other user interface elements. They seem to have taken a few pages out of GNOME&#8217;s book, especially when it comes to dialogs and the OSD, which honestly makes sense considering Cinnamon is also GTK and most Cinnamon users will be running a ton of GNOME/Libadwaita applications. There&#8217;s also a new night light feature to reduce eyestrain, vastly improved options for power profiles and management, and more. Cinnamon 6.4 will be part of Linux Mint&#8217;s next major release, coming in late December, but is most likely already making its way to various other distributions&#8217; repositories.

## So you want to write a KMail plugin?

date: 2024-11-27, from: OS News

Recently, I&#8217;ve been moving away from macOS to Linux, and have settled on using KDE Plasma as my desktop environment. For the most part I&#8217;ve been comfortable with the change, but it&#8217;s always the small things that get me. For example, the Mail app built into macOS provides an &#8220;Unsubscribe&#8221; button for emails.  Apparently this is also supported in some webmail clients, but I&#8217;m not interested in accessing my email that way. Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t found an X11 or Wayland email client that supports this sort of functionality, so I decided to implement it myself. And anyway, I&#8217;m trying out Kontact for my mail at the moment, which supports plugins. So why not use this as an opportunity to build one? ↫ datagirl.xyz Writing a Kmail plugin like this feels a bit like an arcane art, because the process is not documented as well as it could be, and I doubt that other than KDE developers themselves, very few people are interested in writing these kinds of plugins. In fact, I can&#8217;t find a single one listed on the KDE Store, and searching around I can&#8217;t find anything either, other than the ones that come with KDE. It seems like this particular plugin interface is designed more to make it easy for KDE developers to extend and alter Kmail than it is for third parties to do so &#8211; and that&#8217;s fine. Still, this means that if some third party does want to write such a plugin, there&#8217;s some sleuthing and hacking to be done, and that&#8217;s exactly the process this article details. In the end, we end up with a working unsubscribe plugin, with the code on git so others can learn from it. While this may not interest a large number of people, it&#8217;s vital to have information like this out on the web for those precious few to find &#8211; so excellent work.

## US Copyright Office strikes down proposed game preservation DMCA exception

date: 2024-11-27, from: OS News

A three-year fight to help support game preservation has come to a sad end today. The US copyright office has denied a request for a DMCA exemption that would allow libraries to remotely share digital access to preserved video games. ↫ Dustin Bailey at GamesRadar This was always going to end in favour of the massive gaming industry with effectively bottomless bank accounts and more lawyers than god. The gist is that Section 1201 of the DMCA prevents libraries from circumventing the copy protection to make games available remotely. Much like books, libraries loan out books not just for research purposes, but also for entertainment purposes, and that&#8217;s where the issue lies, according to the Copyright Office, who wrote &#8220;there would be a significant risk that preserved video games would be used for recreational purposes&#8221;. The games industry doesn&#8217;t care about old titles nobody wants to buy anymore and no consumer is interested in. There&#8217;s a long tail of games that have no monetary value whatsoever, and there&#8217;s a relatively small number of very popular older games that the industry wants to keep repackaging and reselling forever &#8211; I mean, we can&#8217;t have a new Nintendo console without the opportunity to buy Mario Bros. for the 67th time. That&#8217;d be ludicrous. In order to protect the continued free profits from those few popular retro titles, the endless list of other games only a few nerds are interested in are sacrificed.

## The capacitor that Apple soldered incorrectly at the factory

date: 2024-11-27, from: OS News

There have been some past rumblings on the internet about a capacitor being installed backwards in Apple’s Macintosh LC III. The LC III was a “pizza box” Mac model produced from early 1993 to early 1994, mainly targeted at the education market. It also manifested as various consumer Performa models: the 450, 460, 466, and 467. Clearly, Apple never initiated a huge recall of the LC III, so I think there is some skepticism in the community about this whole issue. Let’s look at the situation in more detail and understand the circuit. Did Apple actually make a mistake? ↫ Doug Brown Even I had heard of these claims, and I&#8217;m not particularly interested in Apple retrocomputing, other than whatever comes by on Adrian Black or whatever. As such, it surprises me that there hasn&#8217;t been any definitive answer to this question &#8211; with the amount of interest in classic Macs you&#8217;d think this would simply be a settled issue and everyone would know about it. This vintage of Macs pretty much require recaps by now, so I assumed if Apple indeed soldered on a capacitor backwards, it&#8217;d just be something listed in the various recapping guides. It took some very minor digging with the multimeter, but yes, one of the capacitors on this family of boards is soldered on the wrong way, with the positive terminal where the negative terminal should be. It seems the error does not lie with whomever soldered the capacitors on the boards &#8211; or whomever set the machine that did so &#8211; because the silkscreen is labeled incorrectly, too. The reason it doesn&#8217;t seem to be noticeable problem during the expected lifespan of the computer is because it was rated at 16V, but was only taking in -5V. So, if you plan on recapping one of these classic Macs &#8211; you might as well fix the error.

## Mozilla begs courts to allow Google search deal for Firefox to continue

date: 2024-11-26, from: OS News

The moment a lot of us has been fearing may be soon upon us. Among the various remedies proposed by the United States Department of Justice to address Google&#8217;s monopoly abuse, there&#8217;s also banning Google from spending money to become the default search engine on other devices, platforms, or applications. “We strongly urge the Court to consider remedies that improve search competition without harming independent browsers and browser engines,” a Mozilla spokesperson tells PCMag. Mozilla points to a key but less eye-catching proposal from the DOJ to regulate Google’s search business, which a judge ruled as a monopoly in August. In their recommendations, federal prosecutors urged the court to ban Google from offering &#8220;something of value&#8221; to third-party companies to make Google the default search engine over their software or devices. ↫ Michael Kan at PC Mag Obviously Mozilla is urging the courts to reconsider this remedy, because it would instantly cut more than 80% of Mozilla&#8217;s revenue. As I&#8217;ve been saying for years now, the reason Firefox seems to be getting worse is because of Mozilla is desperately trying to find other sources of revenue, and they seem to think advertising is their best bet &#8211; even going so far as working together with Facebook. Imagine how much more invasive and user-hostile these attempts are going to get if Mozilla suddenly loses 80% of its revenue? For so, so many years now I&#8217;ve been warning everyone about just how fragile the future of Firefox was, and every one of my worries and predictions have become reality. If Mozilla now loses 80% of its funding, which platform Firefox officially supports do you think will feel the sting of inevitable budget cuts, scope reductions, and even more layoffs first? The future of especially Firefox on Linux is hanging by a thread, and with everyone lulled into a false sense of complacency by Chrome and its many shady skins, nobody in the Linux community seems to have done anything to prepare for this near inevitability. With no proper, fully-featured replacements in the works, Linux distributions, especially ones with strict open source requirements, will most likely be forced to ship with de-Googled Chromium variants by default once Firefox becomes incompatible with such requirements. And no matter how much you take Google out of Chromium, it&#8217;s still effectively a Google product, leaving most Linux users entirely at the whim of big tech for the most important application they have. We&#8217;re about to enter a very, very messy time for browsing on Linux.

## Leaving big tech behind: Murena’s /e/OS on the Fairphone 5

date: 2024-11-25, from: OS News

There are so many ecological, environmental, and climate problems and disasters taking place all over the world that it&#8217;s sometimes hard to see the burning forests through the charred tree stumps. As at best middle-income individuals living in this corporate line-must-go-up hellscape, there&#8217;s only so much we can do turn the rising tides of fascism and leave at least a semblance of a livable world for our children and grandchildren. Of course, the most elementary thing we can do is not vote for science-denying death cults who believe everything is some non-existent entity&#8217;s grand plan, but other than that, what&#8217;s really our impact if we drive a little less or use paper straws, when some wealthy robber baron flying his private jet to Florida to kiss the gaudy gold ring to signal his obedience does more damage to our world in one flight than we do in a year of driving to our underpaid, expendable job? Income, financial, health, and other circumstances allowing, all we can do are the little things to make ourselves feel better, usually in areas in which we are knowledgeable. In technology, it might seem like there&#8217;s not a whole lot we can do, but actually there&#8217;s quite a few steps we can take. One of the biggest things you, as an individual knowledgeable about and interested in tech, can do to give the elite and ruling class the finger is to move away from big tech, their products, and their services &#8211; no more Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, or Amazon. This is often a long, tedious, and difficult process, as most of us will discover that we rely on a lot more big tech products than we initially thought. It&#8217;s like an onion that looks shiny and tasty on the outside, but is rotting from the inside &#8211; the more layers you peel away, the dirtier and nastier it gets. Also you start crying. I&#8217;ve been in the process of eradicating as much of big tech out of my life for a long time now. Since four or five years ago, all my desktop and laptop PCs run Linux, from my dual-Xeon workstation to my high-end gaming PC (ignore that spare parts PC that runs Windows just for League of Legends. That stupid game is my guilty pleasure and I will not give it up), from my XPS 13 laptop to my little Home Assistant thin client. I&#8217;ve never ordered a single thing from Amazon and have no Prime subscription or whatever it is, so that one was a freebie. Apple I banished from my life long ago, so that&#8217;s another freebie. Sadly, that other device most of us carry with us remained solidly in the big tech camp, as I&#8217;ve been using an Android phone for a long time, filled to the brim with Google products, applications, and services. There really isn&#8217;t a viable alternative to the Android and iOS duopoly. Or is there? Well, in a roundabout way, there is an alternative to iOS and Google&#8217;s Android. You can&#8217;t do much to take the Apple out of an iPhone, but there&#8217;s a lot you can do to take the Google out of an Android phone. Unless or until an independent third platform ever manages to take serious hold &#8211; godspeed, our saviour &#8211; de-Googled Android, as it&#8217;s called, is your best bet at having a fully functional, modern smartphone that&#8217;s as free from big tech as you want it to be, without leaving you with a barely usable, barebones experience. While you can install a de-Googled ROM yourself, as there&#8217;s countless to choose from, this is not an option for everyone, since not everyone has the skills, time, and/or supported devices to do so. Murena, Fairphone, and sustainable mining This is where Murena comes in. Murena is a French company &#8211; founded by Gaël Duval, of Mandrake Linux fame &#8211; that develops /e/OS, a de-Googled Android using microG (which Murena also supports financially), which it makes available for anyone to install on supported devices, while also selling various devices with /e/OS preinstalled. Murena goes one step further, however, by also offering something called Murena Workspace &#8211; a branded Nextcloud offering that works seamlessly with /e/OS. In other words, if you buy an /e/OS smartphone from Murena, you get the complete package of smartphone, mobile operating system, and cloud services that&#8217;s very similar to buying a regular Android phone or an iPhone. To help me test this complete package of smartphone, de-Googled Android, and cloud services, Murena loaned me a Fairphone 5 with /e/OS preinstalled, and while this article mostly focuses on the /e/OS experience, we should first talk a little bit about the relationship between Murena and Fairphone. Murena and Fairphone are partners, and Murena has been selling /e/OS Fairphones for a while now. Most of us will be familiar with Fairphone &#8211; it&#8217;s a Dutch company focused on designing and selling smartphones and related accessories that are are user-repairable and long-lasting, while also trying everything within their power to give full insight into their supply chain. This is important, because every smartphone contains quite a few materials that are unsustainably mined. Many mines are destructive to the environment, have horrible working conditions, or even sink as low as employing children. Even companies priding themselves on being environmentally responsible and sustainable, like Apple, are guilty of partaking in and propping up such mining endeavours. As consumers, there isn&#8217;t much we can do &#8211; the network of supply chains involved in making a smartphone is incredibly complex and opaque, and there&#8217;s basically nothing normal people can do to really fully know on whose underpaid or even underage shoulders their smartphone is built. This holiday season, Murena and Fairphone are collaborating on exactly this issue of the conditions in mines used to acquire the metals and minerals in our phones. Instead of offering big discounts (that barely eat into margins and often follow sharp price increases right before the holidays), Murena and Fairphone will donate

## Managing third-party packages in 9front

date: 2024-11-24, from: OS News

Every now and then, news from the club I&#8217;m too cool to join, the plan9/9front community, pierces the veil of coolness and enters our normal world. This time, someone accidentally made a package manager for 9front. I&#8217;ve been growing tired of manually handling random software, so I decided to find a simple way to automate the process and ended up making a sort of &#8220;package manager&#8221; for 9front¹. It&#8217;s really just a set of shell scripts that act as a frontend for&#160;git&#160;and keep a simple database of package names and URLs. Running the&#160;pkginit&#160;script will ask for a location to store the source files for installed packages (/sys/pkg&#160;by default) which will then be created if non-existent. And that&#8217;s it! No, really. Now you can provide a URL for a git repository to pkg/add. ↫ Kelly &#8220;bubstance&#8221; Glenn As I somehow expected from 9front, it&#8217;s quite a simple and elegant system. I&#8217;m not sure how well it would handle more complex package operations, but I doubt many 9front systems are complex to begin with, so this may just be enough to take some of the tedium out of managing software on 9front, as the author originally intended. One day I will be cool enough to use 9front. I just have to stay cool.

## Microsoft Word is using you to train “AI”

date: 2024-11-24, from: OS News

The author of this article, Dr. Casey Lawrence, mentions the opt-out checkbox is hard to find, and they aren&#8217;t kidding. On Windows, here&#8217;s the full snaking path you have to take through Word&#8217;s settings to get to the checkbox: File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Privacy Options > Privacy Settings > Optional Connected Experiences > Uncheck box: “Turn on optional connected experiences”. That is absolutely bananas. No normal person is ever going to find this checkbox. Anyway, remember how the &#8220;AI&#8221; believers kept saying &#8220;hey, it&#8217;s on the internet so scraping your stuff and violating your copyright is totally legal you guys!&#8221;? Well, what about when you&#8217;re using Word, installed on your own PC, to write private documents, containing, say, sensitive health information? Or detailed plans about your company&#8217;s competitor to Azure or Microsoft Office? Or correspondence with lawyers about an antirust lawsuit against Microsoft? Or a report on Microsoft&#8217;s illegal activity you&#8217;re trying to report as a whistleblower? Is that stuff fair game for the gobbledygook generators too?

## Using (only) a Linux terminal for my personal computing in 2024

date: 2024-11-24, from: OS News

A month and a bit ago, I wondered if I could cope with a terminal-only computer.  The only way to really find out was to give it a go. My goal was to see what it was like to use a terminal-only computer for my&#160;personal&#160;computing for two weeks, and more if I fancied it. ↫ Neil&#8217;s blog I tried to do this too, once. Once. Doing everything from the terminal just isn&#8217;t viable for me, mostly because I didn&#8217;t grow up with it. Our family&#8217;s first computer ran MS-DOS (with a Windows 3.1 installation we never used), and I&#8217;m pretty sure the experience of using MS-DOS as my first CLI ruined me for life. My mental model for computing didn&#8217;t start forming properly until Windows 95 came out, and as such, computing is inherently graphical for me, and no matter how many amazing CLI and TUI applications are out there &#8211; and there are many, many amazing ones &#8211; my brain just isn&#8217;t compatible with it. There are a few tasks I prefer doing with the command line, like updating my computers or editing system files using Nano, but for everything else I&#8217;m just faster and more comfortable with a graphical user interface. This comes down to not knowing most commands by heart, and often not even knowing the options and flags for the most basic of commands, meaning even very basic operations that people comfortable using the command line do without even thinking, take me ages. I&#8217;m glad any modern Linux distribution &#8211; I use Fedora KDE on all my computers &#8211; offers both paths for almost anything you could do on your computer, and unless I specifically opt to do so, I literally &#8211; literally literally &#8211; never have to touch the command line.

I had to dive into our archive all the way back to 2017 to find the last reference to the MaXX Interactive Desktop, and it seems this wasn&#8217;t exactly my fault &#8211; the project has been on hiatus since 2020, and is only now coming back to life, as MaXXdesktop v2.2.0 (nickname Octane) Alpha-1 has been released, alongside a promising and ambitious roadmap for the future of the project. For the uninitiated &#8211; MaXX is a Linux reimplementation of the IRIX Interactive Desktop with some modernisations and other niceties to make it work properly on modern Linux (and FreeBSD) machines. MaXX has a unique history in that its creator and lead developer, Eric Masson, managed to secure a special license agreement with SGI way back in 2005, under which he was allowed to recreate, from scratch, the IRIX Interactive Desktop on Linux, including the use of SGI&#8217;s trademarks and IRIX&#8217; unique look and feel. It&#8217;s important to note that he did not get access to any code &#8211; he was only allowed to reverse-engineer and recreate it, and because some of the code falls under this license agreement and some doesn&#8217;t, MaXX is not entirely open source; parts of it are, but not all of it. Any new code written that doesn&#8217;t fall under the license agreement is released as open source though, and the goal is to, over time, make everything open source. And as you can tell from this v2.2.0 screenshot, MaXX looks stunning even at 4K. This new alpha version contains the first changes to adopt the freedesktop.org application specifications, a new Exposé-like window overview, tweaks to the modernised version of the IRIX look and feel (the classic one is also included as an option), desktop notifications, performance improvements, various modernisations to the window manager, and so, so much more. For the final release of 2.2.0 and later releases, more changes are planned, like brand new configuration and system management panels, a quick search tool, a new file manager, and a ton more. MaXX runs on RHEL/Rocky and Ubuntu, and probably more Linux distributions, and FreeBSD, and is entirely free.
