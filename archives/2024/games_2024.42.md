## Meet the 27-inch OLED gaming monitor that is, dare I say, budget-friendly

date: 2024-10-15, updated: 2024-10-15, from: Polygon Website

If you’re in the market for a 27-inch 1440p OLED gaming monitor with fast refresh rates and near-instant response time, most models out there from big name brands like LG, Samsung, and MSI sell for $600 or more. Generally speaking, they cost way less than they used to, but it’s still pricey! However, enough time [&#8230;]

date: 2024-10-15, updated: 2024-10-15, from: Polygon Website

I’m a big fan of ambient lo-fi music, but sometimes I need something to wake me up — which is especially true following a three-day weekend, as many readers are probably feeling right now. And what better way to get hyped for the day/week/month ahead than with the bombastic and eclectic grooves of the Street [&#8230;]

The revised Dungeons &#38; Dragons Dungeon Master’s Guide (2024) will begin trickling out to fans around the world soon thanks to Wizards of the Coast’s aggressively tiered digital pre-release schedule.

## Tim Burton’s Batman has a new sequel, driven by one fan’s burning questions

date: 2024-10-15, updated: 2024-10-15, from: Polygon Website

Usually, a sequel to one of the biggest movies of all time would be carefully concocted in a Hollywood boardroom to maximize four-quadrant potential. John Jackson Miller wrote his continuation of Tim Burton’s mega-hit Batman over the last year in his memorabilia-filled office in central Wisconsin. Miller has been thinking about how to follow up [&#8230;]

## Neva, the follow-up to Gris, is devastatingly beautiful

date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website

I am not a woman with a sword, and I don’t live in a soft, watercolor world that’s quickly being overcome by dark, spindly shadows. But I feel like I do. Most days are a fight as I slash back at the abyss that threatens to overwhelm; I have a lot more in common, right [&#8230;]

## Metaphor: ReFantazio’s music is canonically all in the hero’s head — and now I’m in my head about it

date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website

Back in April, as part of a promotional video about Metaphor: ReFantazio, the game’s director Katsura Hashino quietly dropped a fact (via translator) that has haunted me ever since: “The music you hear in game is in the protagonist’s head.” On screen while he talks, there’s a scene depicted of the main character’s tiny fairy [&#8230;]

## Can Shroomish be shiny in Pokémon Go?

date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-14, from: Polygon Website

Shroomish, the Mushroom Pokémon from Hoenn, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Shroomish can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Shroomish and Breloom both turn a lovely clear orange and yellow when shiny. Breloom is both usable in some PvP leagues and as a fighting-type attacker in PvE. Not bad, mushroom with hands.

## With Penguin’s Hangman twist, it’s finally become a real Batman show

date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-11, from: Polygon Website

I’ve had a few friends ask me what I think of The Penguin, HBO’s spinoff miniseries based in the setting of Matt Reeves’ The Batman, and to all of them I’ve said: “I mean, it’s a good crime show, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but, like… what am I doing here?”&#160; That is, “What [&#8230;]

## All Exotics in Destiny 2: Revenant

date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-14, from: Polygon Website

A number of Exotics were introduced in Destiny 2, Revenant. As of act 1, there are at least three armor Exotics and two weapons.

date: 2024-10-14, updated: 2024-10-14, from: Polygon Website

Ice Breaker returns in Destiny 2 as part of Oct. 2024’s Revenant Act I. The exotic sniper rifle from the first Destiny has been one of the most glaring omissions when it comes to returning weapons, and while it doesn’t quite offer infinite ammo anymore, it has a new trait and perk in keeping with [&#8230;]

Vesper&#8217;s Host is a Destiny 2 dungeon arriving alongside Oct. 2024’s Revenant Act I. Much like the Deep Stone Crypt, it involves exploring a Braytech facility above Europa, and players familiar with that raid will feel right at home with that location and its shared mechanics. There are four encounters to tackle here, with two [&#8230;]
