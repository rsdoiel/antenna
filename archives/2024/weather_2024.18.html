Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0401 PM CDT Fri May 03 2024

Valid 051200Z - 111200Z

An active period of fire weather concerns remains likely beginning
late this weekend and lasting well into the upcoming work week. The
greatest fire weather risk will be focused across the central to
southern Rockies and into adjacent areas of the central/southern
High Plains where a dry air mass is already in place. Latest
ensemble guidance continues to show strong agreement in the
evolution of an upper-level trough (currently noted in water-vapor
imagery over the northeast Pacific) as it translates east across the
inter-mountain West and into the Plains Sunday and Monday, reaching
the Great Lakes/northern Plains by Tuesday/Wednesday. Strong low to
mid-level flow associated with this system will support multiple
days of dry, windy conditions with an accompanying fire weather
risk.
 
...D3/Sunday to D6/Wednesday - New Mexico and adjacent portions of
TX/CO...
Strong divergence aloft ahead of the approaching upper-level wave
will support broad surface pressure falls across the central Rockies
on Sunday afternoon. In response, southerly winds will increase
across much of the Four Corners region into central and eastern NM.
Latest mid-range ensemble guidance suggests sustained 20-25 mph
winds will be common by late afternoon when RH values should be
reaching their diurnal minimums between 10-20%. Although fuels
across western NM are not overly dry as of Friday afternoon,
dry/windy conditions on Saturday across this region should help cure
finer fuels by Sunday.  

Perhaps the most intense fire weather conditions are anticipated on
Monday afternoon across portions of east/northeast NM. The ejection
of the surface low into the Plains Monday afternoon will support
strong westerly downslope winds off the central/southern Rockies.
This will maintain dry conditions across the region with 10-20% RH
common. Elevated conditions are expected across a broad swath of the
High Plains with critical conditions likely across much of eastern
NM. Latest forecast guidance hints that 25-30 mph sustained winds
are probable across northeast NM in the lee of the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains. While this portion of northeast NM is currently receiving
rainfall, such dry/windy conditions should yield dried grasses after
a few hours. 

Persistent zonal flow will linger over the southern Rockies
D5/Tuesday into D6/Wednesday. This will maintain a downslope flow
regime with an attendant dry air mass (afternoon minimum RH values
in the teens) across the southern High Plains with potential both
days for elevated to critical fire weather conditions. The critical
risk areas have been adjusted in this outlook update to reflect
where medium to long-range ensemble guidance shows the strongest
signal for sustained 20+ mph winds. These areas will likely be
refined in subsequent outlooks as mesoscale details come into focus.
Elevated conditions may linger into D7/Thursday across southern NM,
but weakening gradient winds aloft should limit fire weather
potential compared to previous days.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0945 AM CDT Fri May 03 2024

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

An Elevated risk area has been introduced to portions of southeast
New Mexico. Morning surface observations and 12 UTC soundings from
ABQ and EPZ show very dry conditions at/near the surface with RH
values generally in the teens to low 20s across parts of far
southwest TX and south-central NM. This air mass should spread
northeast behind an eastward migrating dryline this afternoon. Weak
mid and upper-level winds will limit the overall magnitude of the
fire weather potential, but ensemble guidance shows reasonably high
confidence of 15-20 mph winds co-located with the driest conditions.
Furthermore, recent fuel guidance suggests ERCs generally reside in
the 80-90th percentile across this region after several days of
limited rainfall, which should support the fire weather concern.
Elevated conditions are also expected further north into
south-central CO, but will be more localized and driven by
terrain-induced winds.

..Moore.. 05/03/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1225 AM CDT Fri May 03 2024/

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude shortwave trough will move through northern Mexico
today and eject into West Texas by early tomorrow morning. A weak
surface trough is expected to develop in the southern High Plains as
a result. Portions of the Southwest will experience dry and breezy
conditions for period during the afternoon. Given the short duration
of these conditions, only locally elevated fire weather concerns are
expected.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NEAR THE
WEST TEXAS CAPROCK ONTO ADJOINING LOW ROLLING PLAINS...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SURROUNDING THE
ENHANCED AREA...AND OVER PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Large hail and damaging gusts are possible over parts of the
central/southern Great Plains from southern Nebraska to west Texas,
along with some tornado potential over parts of west Texas.

...Synopsis...
Today's transitional mid/upper-level synoptic pattern is a tale of
two cyclones -- one astride the Upper Midwest/Canadian border, and
another digging southeastward out of the Gulf of Alaska.  The broad,
complex leading cyclone will eject northeastward over MB and
northwestern ON through the period.  A trailing shortwave trough --
apparent in moisture-channel imagery over parts of southern ID and
northern NV -- will move east-northeastward to eastern SD and
central NE by 12Z tomorrow.  The strong, well-developed Pacific
cyclone will proceed southeastward to just off the coast of OR by
the end of the period.  Southwest flow aloft will be maintained with
weak synoptic-scale height rises over most of the central/southern
Plains.  Still, sufficient moisture, buoyancy, lift and shear are
apparent for a couple relative maxima in severe potential as
discussed below.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a low attached to a cold front
over south-central WY.  The front should proceed southeastward
through the day, extending from southeastern SD to western NE an
central CO by 00Z, with the low over northeastern CO.  By 12Z
tomorrow, the front should extend from a low over IA to south-
central KS, the northern TX Panhandle, and north-central NM.  This
front will overtake a developing dryline over the central High
Plains from north-south, with the dryline position at 00Z over
eastern CO, the western TX Panhandle, and Permian Basin.  A weak/
residual, nearly stationary front extended from a low near FST
northeastward across northwest TX, eastern OK and the Ozarks, and
should continue to lose definition amidst considerable convective
outflow.  The southern rim of that outflow was evident from
southeast TX (between GLS-BPT) across the HOU metro then west-
northwestward to near SJT.  The western part will shift northward
slowly through the day toward the front, which itself should drift
northward up the Caprock.

...West/southwest TX...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms are expected to form
this afternoon near the dryline and the residual outflow boundary
over the South Plains to Low Rolling Plains/Concho Valley regions. 
Isolated to widely scattered convection possible farther south off
the dryline past the Rio Grande, and into strongly heated/CINH-
minimized higher terrain of the Serranias del Burro range in
northern Coahuila.  This activity should move eastward across areas
below the Caprock and around the Big Country to Edwards Plateau,
with potential for some of the Mexican convection to cross the Rio
Grande this evening as well.  Supercells -- with large to very large
hail and at least isolated potential for tornadoes -- will be more
probable in and near the 30%/"enhanced" hail area.  Dryline and
orographic activity to the south will be an early hail/wind threat. 
Some of this activity may aggregate into clusters offering mainly
strong-severe gusts, with one or two small MCSs possible this
evening into the early overnight hours.

Despite multiple days of MCS and smaller-scale convective activity
to the east and southeast, a reservoir of rich low-level moisture
remains not far upstream across south-central TX and into the
southern Edwards Plateau, where upper 60s to low 70s F surface
dewpoints and PW commonly 1-1.5 inches.  When advected northwestward
amid diurnal heating and beneath steep midlevel lapse rates,
3000-4000 J/kg MLCAPE should become common.  Though low-level flow
should not be particularly strong, it will be backed, contributing
to elongated hodographs ad around 30-40 kt effective-shear
magnitudes.  Splitting storms may be common early, offering the
greatest hail potential (size and coverage).  The damaging-wind
threat will be maximized on the mesoscale where organized cold pools
can develop, and should extend farther east at greater density than
the hail potential this evening into tonight.  In the absence of
substantial large-scale support, tornado potential will be locally
maximized with any supercells that can interact favorably with
outflow boundaries or each other.

...Central Plains...
Large hail and severe gusts are possible from mid/late afternoon
into tonight, from thunderstorms shifting eastward across portions
of the central Plains.  Though nowhere nearly as moist as the TX
outlook area, a diurnally destabilized plume of moist advection
should support a secondary relative max in severe potential
along/ahead of the cold front and dryline from parts of eastern CO
to western/northern KS and southern NE.  Convection should develop
by mid/late afternoon in a regional convergence maximum near and
northeast of the surface low, with MLCINH weakened by favorable
diurnal heating.  Surface dewpoints in the 40s to low 50s F should
be common, with steep surface-500-mb lapse rates, 500-1000 J/kg
MLCAPE and well-mixed subcloud layers.  Effective-shear magnitudes
around 40-50 kt indicate potential for organized convection -- both
in quasi-linear form near the front and initially discrete (but
later merging upscale) off the dryline.  Though activity will
encounter a more-stable boundary layer with time and eastward extent
across KS/NE, at least marginal severe-gust potential may last
overnight as far eastward as parts of the Missouri Valley region.

Mesoscale Discussion 0592
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0607 PM CDT Wed May 01 2024

Areas affected...Eastern TX Panhandle...Far Northwestern TX...Far
Southwestern/Western OK

Concerning...Tornado Watch 171...

Valid 012307Z - 020030Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 171 continues.

SUMMARY...Threat for all severe hazards, including very large hail
from 2.5" to 3.5" in diameter, strong gusts up to 75 mph, and
tornadoes continues across the eastern TX Panhandle.

DISCUSSION...Several supercells are currently ongoing across the
eastern TX Panhandle, including a pair of tornadic storms, one over
Roberts Ochiltree Counties in the northeast TX Panhandle and the
other farther south in Briscoe and Hail Counties. Both of these
storms, as well as the other supercells developing southwestward
from the Panhandle into the Texas South Plains, are in a favorable
environment for persistence. Main factor influencing overall updraft
maintenance and storm persistence will be storm
mergers/interactions. Some secondary influence from anvil shading
and resulting boundary-layer cooling is possible, although this
could be offset by continuing low-level moisture advection. The
general expectation is for storms to persist, with perhaps one
substantial storm eventually emerging out of the cluster over
Briscoe and Hall Counties. Given the unimpeded inflow and
anticipated strengthening of low-level flow, this storm would likely
represent the best candidate for a significant severe weather,
including very large hail, strong gusts, and tornadoes, over the
next hour or two. 

Storm motion has been relatively slow thus far, generally 15 to 20
kt, with a few storm moving even slower. As such, this activity will
likely remain in the eastern TX Panhandle (i.e. within Tornado Watch
171) for the next few hours. Even so, trends will be monitored for
faster storm motion and the potential for activity to move into
western OK earlier.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 172
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
455 PM CDT Wed May 1 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Western and central Kansas

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon from 455 PM until Midnight
  CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 3.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...At least isolated severe storms including supercells are
expected to develop through early evening, initially near a surface
low and dryline and warm/nearly stationary front across western
Kansas. Even if storms remain relatively isolated, they will be
capable of very large hail, tornadoes, and very strong wind gusts.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
north and south of a line from 40 miles west of Garden City KS to 55
miles south southeast of Russell KS. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 170...WW 171...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 3.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24025.

Mesoscale Discussion 0593
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0658 PM CDT Wed May 01 2024

Areas affected...southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 170...

Valid 012358Z - 020100Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 170
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe threat continues within WW170. Instances of severe
hail and damaging wind will continue over the next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity continues in the northern and
southern portions of WW170. To the north, clustered cell activity
with transient supercell structures will continue to support risk of
instances of large hail and damaging wind. Recent reports of hail as
large as 1.5 in and gusts 50+ mph have been noted in this region.

Further south, storms have made attempts to grow upscale along
outflow, which will likely support a shift to increase in threat for
damaging wind (possibly as high as 70 mph) threat in the short term,
though instances of large hail will be possible.

Activity is largely supported dryline forcing and will likely wane
in coverage after sunset with the end of daytime heating. The
propensity for anvil spread downwind has also likely limited the
threat of further development with eastern extent, as witnessed by
meager development along a northward moving outflow boundary near
Upton and Reagan Counties.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0314 PM CDT Wed May 01 2024

Valid 012000Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING FROM SOUTH-CENTRAL KANSAS INTO WESTERN OKLAHOMA/WEST
TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
The greatest threat today for large to very large hail, severe
thunderstorm gusts and a few tornadoes will be in from south-central
Kansas into western Oklahoma, the eastern Texas Panhandle and
northwest/west-central Texas.

...20Z Update...
Severe probabilities have been expanded westward somewhat to account
for a farther west position of the dryline this afternoon.
Significant wind probabilities have also been added across parts of
west/northwest TX, where a mix of supercell clusters and eventual
MCS development will be possible. 

The influence of extensive antecedent convection remains quite
evident across parts of KS/OK, with the richest moisture currently
confined from far western OK into the eastern TX Panhandle and
northwest TX, and pockets of somewhat higher dewpoints from
southeast KS into northeast OK, and also across southwestern KS,
where somewhat stronger recovery is occurring this afternoon. 

Confidence remains rather low regarding storm coverage and evolution
along the dryline, though at least isolated supercell development
will be possible late this afternoon into the evening, with a threat
of all severe hazards. 

Upscale growth into one or more clusters still appears likely across
central and possibly north TX tonight, with some potential for an
organized MCS to move into southeast TX before the end of the
period. An elevated storm cluster and possible MCS is also expected
to develop near the KS/NE border later tonight. While this
convection will likely remain mostly elevated, rather strong MUCAPE
will support at least an isolated threat for both hail and severe
gusts. See the previous discussion below for more information, and
MCD 589 for more information regarding the short-term threat from
southwest KS into the TX Panhandle. .

..Dean.. 05/01/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1125 AM CDT Wed May 01 2024/

...Southern KS/Western OK/TX Panhandle...
Late morning surface analysis shows a low near Guymon OK, with a
remnant outflow boundary from overnight storms extending southward
through the eastern TX Panhandle and across southern OK.  It is
unclear whether this boundary will wash out through the afternoon,
or be maintained by shower/thunderstorm activity over southwest OK. 
Regardless, thunderstorms will form rapidly on the dryline from
southwest KS into the eastern TX Panhandle late this afternoon and
interact with the remnant boundary.  Supercells capable of very
large hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes are possible along this
corridor through the early evening.  There is a chance of a strong
tornado or two, but confidence in position is not high enough to
increase tornado probabilities at this time.

...West TX...
Strong heating will occur today west of the dryline over west TX,
leading to scattered intense storm development.  Initial discrete
supercells will pose a risk of very large hail and a few tornadoes,
but organized outflows appear likely given latest model guidance,
which will promote damaging wind gusts as storms spread eastward
through the evening.

...Central TX today and tonight...
A very moist low-level air mass is in place today over south-central
TX, with dewpoints well into the 70s.  Scattered afternoon
thunderstorms are expected to form in this environment, where
sufficient CAPE and deep-layer shear will promote
organized/supercell structures.  Given the abundant low-level
theta-e and veering low-level wind fields, a tornado or two is
possible, along with locally gusty/damaging winds.  

Tonight, storms that form over west TX may organize into an MCS and
track into central TX.  A strengthening sub-tropical mid-level wind
max will help to sustain the activity, with a continued risk of
damaging winds overnight.

...Southern NE/Northern KS tonight...
Relatively widespread thunderstorms are expected to form after dark
over southwest NE/northwest KS ahead of an approaching shortwave
trough.  This activity will spread eastward overnight, with
sufficient (mainly) elevated CAPE to support hail and gusty winds in
the stronger cores.

are necessary. See previous forecast discussion below.

..Bentley.. 05/01/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CDT Wed May 01 2024/

...Synopsis...
Northwesterly flow is expected to strengthen across New Mexico on
Thursday, as a lee cyclone develops in the southern High Plains.
Sustained winds of 15 to 20 mph are expected with relative humidity
in the single digits. Deterministic guidance varies on how
widespread any critical wind speeds will be. This leads to low
confidence in including a Critical area with this outlook, but will
be monitored for future outlook updates. For now, Elevated to
locally Critical fire weather conditions are expected on Thursday.

Areas affected...Northern/Western Missouri

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 166...

Valid 010144Z - 010315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 166
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong/severe storms will linger, mainly across
northern Missouri this evening.

DISCUSSION...Convective trends are down early this evening, partly
due to cooling boundary-layer conditions. Convection that developed
along/ahead of the cold front/dryline has advanced east-southeast
across the instability axis. This activity is encountering a less
buoyant environment and updrafts are gradually weakening. Latest
trends suggest convection near the IA border may linger a bit
longer, primarily due to the southern influence of the upper MS
Valley short-wave trough. Even so, marginally severe hail may become
the primary risk over the next hour or so.

Areas affected...Southeast IA...Northwest IL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 163...

Valid 010055Z - 010230Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 163 continues.

SUMMARY...Convection should gradually weaken as it spreads toward
the Mississippi River Valley. New watch is not anticipated
downstream.

DISCUSSION...A few supercells linger across southern IA, along the
southern fringe of large-scale support, in association with ejecting
short-wave trough. Most notable, longer-lived supercell is
propagating east across Appanoose County is approaching an air mass
that is increasingly hostile to surface-based updrafts. While
low-level lapse rates were steep at 00z/DVN, MLCAPE was only 40
J/kg, and nocturnal cooling will limit further destabilization.
While this lead storm may produce marginally severe hail, or perhaps
a brief tornado over the next hour or so, current thinking is
convection should gradually weaken as the evening progresses.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 166
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
550 PM CDT Tue Apr 30 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Kansas
  Western and Northern Missouri

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon from 550 PM until Midnight
  CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...An organized band of severe thunderstorms over eastern
Kansas and northwest Missouri will continue to move east this
evening into the Watch area.  Supercells with an attendant risk for
large to very large hail, perhaps a tornado, and severe gusts are
possible before some upscale growth into one or more linear bands of
storms later this evening.  As the linear upscale growth occurs,
wind damage will increasingly become the primary severe hazard.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles northwest of
Kirksville MO to 55 miles south southeast of Olathe KS. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 163...WW 164...WW 165...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0572
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1258 PM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Areas affected...the Michigan Thumb vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 291758Z - 292000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...The evolution of an isolated supercell accompanied by at
least some potential for a tornado, in addition severe hail and
wind, appears possible across the Michigan Thumb vicinity near Bad
Axe through 3-5 PM EDT.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of larger-scale mid-level troughing, with an
embedded low, migrating northeastward into/through the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes vicinity, a strong south-southwesterly mid-level
jet (40-70 kt in the 700-500 mb layer) is in the process of
propagating across lower Michigan.  In association with this
feature, an area of stronger surface pressure falls (2-3+ mb 2
hourly) has generally begun to shift across Lake Huron, but still
extends along an axis as far south as the Flint MI vicinity.  This
is near a weak surface frontal low which is forecast to migrate
across and northeast of the Bad Axe vicinity through 19-21Z.

South of the front, boundary-layer moistening (including surface dew
points around 60f) has been sufficient to contribute to weak
destabilization (including mixed-layer CAPE increasing up to 500
J/kg).  Although further heating and mixing may reduce this some to
the south of the front, this may be maintained along the front, just
ahead of the low, which may gradually provide a focus for
intensifying convection.  Given the strength of the vertical shear,
including sizable clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, and
localized forcing for ascent, the evolution of a supercell appears
possible, which may pose at least some risk for producing a tornado,
in addition to marginally severe hail and wind.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1231 PM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTHWEST
MN...WESTERN IA...FAR NORTHWEST MO...EASTERN KS...EASTERN NE AND FAR
SOUTHEAST SD...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible on Tuesday from parts of the
mid/upper Mississippi Valley into the central/southern Plains. The
greatest threat is expected from eastern Nebraska into parts of
western Iowa and southwest Minnesota, with a risk of very large
hail, severe wind gusts, and a few tornadoes.

...Synopsis...
An upper cyclone is forecast to be centered over southeastern
British Columbia/southwest Alberta early Tuesday morning. A series
of shortwave troughs are expected to traverse the moderate mid-level
flow is extended throughout the base of this cyclone. The lead wave
in this series will likely move from the central High Plains
northeastward across the northern/central Plains into the Upper
Midwest throughout the day, accompanied by gradually strengthening
mid-level flow. A weak cold front and associated surface troughing
will precede this shortwave, with consolidation into more prominent
low anticipated from the Mid MO Valley into the Upper Midwest during
the afternoon and evening. Northern portion of this front near the
surface low will remain progressive, continuing eastward through the
Upper Midwest overnight. However, southern portion of the front will
slow and eventually stall across KS, with additional surface
cyclogenesis possible along the western portion of this boundary
over western KS and the eastern TX/OK Panhandles.

Farther east, a shortwave trough is expected to gradually shift
eastward from the Lower OH Valley/Mid-South across the TN Valley and
Southeast states, reaching the Mid-Atlantic States by early
Wednesday morning. Some phasing between this wave and a separate
low-amplitude shortwave farther north over the Lower Great
Lakes/southwestern Ontario is possible. Isolated thunderstorms are
anticipated ahead of both of these waves across much of the eastern
CONUS (i.e. from the Upper OH Valley/Northeast States into the
Southeast). However, limited buoyancy and weak shear should temper
the overall severe potential across the majority of the area,
although a locally increased risk is possible from central NY
through eastern PA and from eastern GA through SC.

...Mid MO Valley into Eastern KS...
Low-level moisture is expected to advect quickly northward
throughout the day, ahead of the approaching shortwave trough and
associated surface trough/cold front. Consensus among the guidance
brings low 60s dewpoints into the northeastern KS/northwest
MO/southeastern NE border vicinity by the mid afternoon, with upper
50s  northward along the NE/IA border. This low-level moisture
combined with modest daytime heating and steep mid-level lapse rates
will support moderate buoyancy (i.e. 1500 to 2000 J/kg).
Thunderstorm development is anticipated along the front during the
afternoon, beginning across eastern SD/southwestern MN then
extending southwestward across eastern NE. Given the moderate
buoyancy, robust updrafts should develop quickly, and vertical shear
will be strong enough to support organized storm structures. Large
to very large hail is likely with initial development before the
storms undergo a relatively quick upscale growth, with the
transition to a more linear mode favoring strong gusts. Some gusts
to 75 mph are possible. The tornado threat is a bit more complex.
There is enough low-level curvature to support tornadogenesis, but
the overall potential may be limited by the quick upscale growth and
relatively short time duration storms will be in a discrete mode.
That being said, some tornado threat is possible within the line as
well, particularly across western IA during the early evening (i.e.
around 00Z) as the low-level jet increases. 

...Central KS southwestward across Western OK into Southwest TX...
Most of the stronger large-scale forcing for ascent is anticipated
farther north, but persistent low-level convergence along the
dryline could result in isolated to widely scattered thunderstorm
initiation. Any storms that mature could produce large to very large
hail and damaging downbursts. Guidance has trended towards a bit
more thunderstorm coverage from northwest into southwest TX, but the
lack of stronger large scale forcing limits forecast confidence,
precluding the introduction of higher probabilities with this
outlook.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1113 AM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Valid 291630Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH LATE
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE LOWER MS VALLEY...SOUTH TX...AND SOUTHEAST
LOWER MI...

...SUMMARY...
Marginally severe wind gusts and hail will be possible today across
south Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and southeast Lower
Michigan.

...LA/MS/AL...
A decaying linear MCS is moving slowly southeastward across southern
LA, with the most active part of the line well offshore.  The
leading outflow boundary extends northward across southeast LA into
central MS, with a warm/moist low-level air mass in place to the
east.  Some rejuvenation of thunderstorms along this line is
expected this afternoon, with storms tracking eastward toward
southwest AL this evening.  Mid-level lapse rates are weak in this
area, along with weak to moderately strong low to mid-level wind
fields.  This suggests some risk of gusty or possibly damaging winds
with these storms, but the threat is expected to remain rather
isolated.

...Southeast Lower MI...
Visible satellite imagery shows strong heating occurring over
southeast Lower MI today, but with a broad area of clouds and light
precipitation approaching from the southwest.  Several morning CAM
solutions show scattered afternoon thunderstorms developing along
the leading edge of this cloud deck.  Storms will sweep across the
area rather quickly, with steepening low-level lapse rates posing a
risk of locally gusty/damaging wind gusts in the strongest cells. 
An isolated tornado cannot be ruled out as well - especially along a
surface boundary that extends across the Thumb area.

...South TX...
A moist and moderately unstable air mass is present today across
south TX, ahead of a weak front.  The coverage of thunderstorms is
expected to be quite limited today in this region, but any storm
that forms could pose a risk of large hail for a few hours.
