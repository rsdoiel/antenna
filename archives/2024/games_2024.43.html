<p>Wizards of the Coast recently revealed its product lineup for Magic:

<p>Double XP tokens, a Call of Duty staple to help players level up

<p>M. Night Shyamalan’s public reputation has had its ups and downs in

<p>After critical and commercial success with a trio of smart,
entertaining, and impeccably crafted genre films, M. Night Shyamalan
seemed on top of the world. The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs
thrilled audiences and critics alike, setting the director up as a major

<p>After wasting a full decade reducing his greatness to memes about
twist endings, the world has rightly come back around on M. Night
Shyamalan. But while his critical and commercial reappraisal started in

<p>The world has never quite known what to do with M. Night Shyamalan.
He was called the next Steven Spielberg just three movies into his
career, but when critics and audiences realized he didn’t fit into that
box, he was relegated to a punchline for more than a decade before

<p>Nintendo’s Switch Online playtest hasn’t actually begun yet, but
details have already leaked online. Nintendo made a vague announcement
earlier in October inviting people to sign up for a Nintendo Switch
Online playtest; around 10,000 people were admitted into the test
program earlier this month. Nintendo shared very few details about the
mystery event, except […]</p>

<p>There are currently 2,679 playable (for free!) demos for upcoming
games on Steam as part of Steam Next Fest — a feast for players and a
horrifying statistic if you’re hoping to launch a game next year. Valve
knows that’s entirely too many game demos, so they’ve posted a live

<p>date: 2024-10-20, updated: 2024-10-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Japanese Rural Life Adventure is what it says on the tin — it’s a
16-bit-style farming sim that takes place in the countryside, and it’s
filled with hallmarks of the genre: You leave the city to arrive at a
broken-down farm that you revitalize as you meet the townsfolk and
become a part of their […]</p>

<p>Despite being one of only two movies Quentin Tarantino said he would
have paid to see in theaters during the pandemic, Unhinged feels like a
movie that’s perfectly concocted for a great night on Netflix. It’s a
thriller that’s equal parts terrifying and silly, it’s got a movie star
giving a terrific performance as a […]</p>

<p>The Electric State, the Netflix film starring Millie Bobby Brown and

<p>With his blood-soaked tales of violence and vengeance like The Night
Comes for Us and Headshot, Timo Tjahjanto earned a reputation as one of
the world’s goriest action directors. But he doesn’t see himself that
way. Tjahjanto began his filmmaking career making slasher movies as half
of the Mo brothers, teaming up with his longtime […]</p>

<p>It’s hard to remember what watching the first season of Stranger
Things was like. Years later, with a final season pending (and pending,
and pending—), the show has become a cultural juggernaut; the way it
brought D&amp;D terms to the foreground of culture seems like but a
glint in the eye of a thoroughly merchandised […]</p>

<p>I love driving. I love the physical act of it — controlling this big,
sophisticated machine like it’s an extension of me. But I also love the
poetry and adventure of long-distance drives — the freedom, the
self-reliance, the gradually changing landscape, the sense of limitless
possibilities. Video games are fantastic at capturing the first […]</p>
