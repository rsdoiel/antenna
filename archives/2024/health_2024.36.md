## Fusobacterium nucleatum induces invasive growth and angiogenic responses in malignant oral keratinocytes that are cell line- and bacterial strain-specific

date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic commensal of the oral cavity recently reported to be associated with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we investigate the impact on oral keratinocytes of infection with a genetically diverse set of strains of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum recovered from patients with oral dysplasia (n=6). We employed H357 oral keratinocytes derived from a stage 1 OSCC and H376 cells derived from a stage 3 OSCC. Adhesion phenotypes were strain specific, with 3/6 clinical isolates examined exhibiting higher adherence to the stage 3 H376 cell line. Conversely, intracellular invasion was greatest in the H357 cells and was associated with specific transcriptional responses including autophagy and keratinization. Infection of both H357 and H376 cell lines induced transcriptional and cytokine responses linked to cancer cell migration and angiogenesis. F. nucleatum infection induced greater levels of MMP9 secretion in the H376 cell line which was associated with enhanced motility and invasion phenotypes. Additionally, the degree of F. nucleatum induced invasive growth by H376 cells varied between different clinical isolates of F. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum. Blockage of CCL5 signalling using the inhibitor metCCL5 resulted in reduced keratinocyte invasion. F. nucleatum infection also induced expression of the pro-angiogenic chemokine MCP-1 and the angiogenic growth factor VEGF-A resulting in increased capillary-like tube formation in HUVEC cells, most significantly in H376 cells. Treatment of HUVEC cells with resveratrol, a VEGF-A signalling inhibitor, significantly attenuated F. nucleatum induced tube formation. Our data indicate that the outcomes of F. nucleatum-oral cell interactions can vary greatly depending on the bacterial genotype and the malignant phenotype of the host cell.

## Disseminated emergomyces orientalis infection in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus

date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

A case of Eimonosis orientalis was reported in a 52-year-old male farmer who presented with cough, phlegm, fever, headache, and nausea for more than 4 days. Haemophilic cells and fungal spores were identified in the bone marrow smear and confirmed as Aemon orientalis by culture. The same bacteria were also isolated from blood cultures

## Changes in the epidemiological patterns of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus infection among pediatric patients and their correlation with severe cases: a long-term retrospective study

date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesWe aim to investigate the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) among pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) in southern China both pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic, as well as identify associated risk factors for severe infections.MethodsThe study conducted a real-time PCR analysis on hospitalized children with ARTI from 2012 to 2023, specifically targeting RSV, hMPV, and other respiratory pathogens. Additionally, demographic data was collected during this analysis.ResultsThe prevalence of RSV occurs triennially, and likewise, the temporal pattern of hMPV outbreaks mirrors that of RSV. The peak infection rates of RSV and hMPV occurred during and following the implementation of COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control measures. The incidence of RSV infection exhibited bimodal peaks in 2022, while hMPV demonstrated seasonal peaks during the spring, fall, and winter periods post-COVID-19 pandemic. After the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an upward trend in the proportion of female patients and patients aged one year and older presenting with ARTI, RSV infections, and hMPV infections. Infant (OR = 4.767, 95%CI: [3.888–5.846], p < 0.0001), presence of co-infection (OR = 0.540, 95%CI: [0.404–0.722], p < 0.0001), and existence of comorbidities (OR = 1.582, 95%CI: [1.285–1.949], p < 0.0001) was the risk ratio for the severity of RSV infection. Children infected with hMPV under the age of 1 year (OR = 0.322, 95%CI: [0.180 – 0.575], p < 0.0001), as well as those with comorbidities (OR = 8.809, 95%CI: [4.493 – 17.272], p < 0.0001), have a higher risk of developing severe illness.ConclusionThe changing epidemiological patterns have the potential to lead to widespread severe outbreaks among children, particularly those with underlying medical conditions who may experience more severe symptoms. Conducting surveillance for pneumoviridae viruses in children is an imperative measure to establish a robust foundation for future epidemic prevention and treatment strategies.

## Unlocking the power of short-chain fatty acids in ameliorating intestinal mucosal immunity: a new porcine nutritional approach

date: 2024-09-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), a subset of organic fatty acids with carbon chains ranging from one to six atoms in length, encompass acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These compounds are the endproducts of dietary fiber fermentation, primarily catalyzed by the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways within the gut microbiota. SCFAs act as pivotal energy substrates and signaling molecules in the realm of animal nutrition, exerting a profound influence on the intestinal, immune system, and intestinal barrier functions. Specifically, they contibute to 60-70% of the total energy requirements in ruminants and 10-25% in monogastric animals. SCFAs have demonstrated the capability to effectively modulate intestinal pH, optimize the absorption of mineral elements, and impede pathogen invasion. Moreover, they enhance the expression of proteins associated with intestinal tight junctions and stimulate mucus production, thereby refining intestinal tissue morphology and preserving the integrity of the intestinal structure. Notably, SCFAs also exert anti-inflammatory properties, mitigating inflammation within the intestinal epithelium and strengthening the intestinal barrier’s defensive capabilities. The present review endeavors to synthesize recent findings regarding the role of SCFAs as crucial signaling intermediaries between the metabolic activities of gut microbiota and the status of porcine cells. It also provides a comprehensive overview of the current literature on SCFAs’ impact on immune responses within the porcine intestinal mucosa.
