The beginning of BLM: How 486 words created the nation’s largest land
manager
</h1>
</div>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;field contact-block -body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is an important one in the history of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). On May 16, 1946—78 years ago—the agency was conceived on paper, when President Harry S. Truman submitted to Congress “Reorganization Plan 3.” The plan included the proposal to merge the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service to create one agency. Fast forward 78 years and our day-to-day activities are quite busy addressing proposals to construct renewable energy projects, improving recreation sites, responding to wildfires, and conducting all of the other work required to care for 245 million surface acres. That’s about one in every ten acres of the United States, not to mention the 30 percent of the Nation’s minerals we manage on behalf of the American people.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
When President Truman issued this simple reorganization plan, it
consisted of only 486 words regarding the proposed merger. That merger
took effect three months later—on July 16, 1946—and set in motion the
process to create an agency that today manages more public land than any
other federal government agency in the U.S. This action dissolved the
General Land Office, which got its start more than 130 years earlier, in
1812. It also dissolved the U.S. Grazing Service, which had existed for
just 12 years, since 1934.
</p>
<p>
Here is what President Truman said in his
<a href="https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/public-papers/118/special-message-congress-transmitting-reorganization-plan-3-1946">“Special
Message to the Congress Transmitting Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946,”</a>
explaining the rationale for merging the two agencies:<br> <br> <em>The
General Land Office and the Grazing Service now divide responsibility
for major portion of the multiple-use Federally owned lands now held by
the Department of the Interior. The lands under jurisdiction of the two
agencies are comparable in character and in use. In some functions, the
two agencies employ the same type of personnel and use the same
techniques. Other functions are divided between the agencies so that
both are engaged in management of various aspects of the same land.
Consolidating these two agencies will permit the development of uniform
policies and the integration of two organizations whose responsibilities
now overlap. Integration of the activities of the two agencies will make
possible greater utilization and thus more economic use of expert
skills.</em>
</p>
<p>
In other words, the primary purpose of merging the agencies to form the
BLM was to increase efficiency. The same can be said for the
reorganizations of several other federal Departments and agencies
included in Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946.<strong>[1]  </strong>

Enhancing efficiency of management of federal lands was the main driver

<p>
The Special Message leaves a couple of impressions on this writer.
</p>
<p>
First, the fact that reorganizing the Federal government was on
President Truman’s radar in 1946 at all seems astonishing, given
domestic and international events. At the time the Special Message was
transmitted, he had only been President for about one year. Truman
became President, after serving for just 82 days as vice president, when
President Roosevelt died in office in April 1945. World War II
officially ended just eight months earlier, when Japan surrendered in
September 1945. Americans were still reeling from the loss of more than
400,000 U.S. civilians and soldiers during the war and facing the
reality of the “iron curtain” in Eastern Europe and the beginning of the
Cold War.

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Second, after experiencing several agency reorganizations, the fact that
the merger took effect just two months after Reorganization Plan 3 was
transmitted to Congress feels like lightning speed! However, as outlined
in “Opportunity and Challenge,”<strong>[2]</strong> while establishing
the BLM may have been relatively quick and easy, for the next two years
the agency struggled to simply survive, due to difficulties of
implementing an organizational structure and securing adequate funding.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the BLM was born of the modest goal of increasing efficiency.
Never in their wildest dreams could the developers of Reorganization
Plan 3 have imagined that the agency would become what is today – a
steward of some of the most spectacular places on the planet, a manager
of a dizzying array of natural and cultural resources, and an
organization that many public land stakeholders rely upon for commercial
opportunities, conservation of wild landscapes, and outdoor recreation
experiences. That is worthy of reflection, and celebration, 78 years
after the transmittal of Reorganization Plan 3!

When President Truman issued this simple reorganization plan, it
consisted of only 486 words regarding the proposed merger. That merger
took effect three months later—on July 16, 1946—and set in motion the
process to create an agency that today manages more public land than any
other federal government agency in the U.S. This action dissolved the
General Land Office, which got its start more than 130 years earlier, in
1812. It also dissolved the U.S. Grazing Service, which had existed for
just 12 years, since 1934.
</p>
<p>
Here is what President Truman said in his
<a href="https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/public-papers/118/special-message-congress-transmitting-reorganization-plan-3-1946">“Special
Message to the Congress Transmitting Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946,”</a>
explaining the rationale for merging the two agencies:<br> <br> <em>The
General Land Office and the Grazing Service now divide responsibility
for major portion of the multiple-use Federally owned lands now held by
the Department of the Interior. The lands under jurisdiction of the two
agencies are comparable in character and in use. In some functions, the
two agencies employ the same type of personnel and use the same
techniques. Other functions are divided between the agencies so that
both are engaged in management of various aspects of the same land.
Consolidating these two agencies will permit the development of uniform
policies and the integration of two organizations whose responsibilities
now overlap. Integration of the activities of the two agencies will make
possible greater utilization and thus more economic use of expert
skills.</em>
</p>
<p>
In other words, the primary purpose of merging the agencies to form the
BLM was to increase efficiency. The same can be said for the
reorganizations of several other federal Departments and agencies
included in Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946.<strong>[1]  </strong>

The beginning of BLM: How 486 words created the nation’s largest land
manager
</h1>
</div>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;field contact-block -body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is an important one in the history of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). On May 16, 1946—78 years ago—the agency was conceived on paper, when President Harry S. Truman submitted to Congress “Reorganization Plan 3.” The plan included the proposal to merge the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service to create one agency. Fast forward 78 years and our day-to-day activities are quite busy addressing proposals to construct renewable energy projects, improving recreation sites, responding to wildfires, and conducting all of the other work required to care for 245 million surface acres. That’s about one in every ten acres of the United States, not to mention the 30 percent of the Nation’s minerals we manage on behalf of the American people.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
When President Truman issued this simple reorganization plan, it
consisted of only 486 words regarding the proposed merger. That merger
took effect three months later—on July 16, 1946—and set in motion the
process to create an agency that today manages more public land than any
other federal government agency in the U.S. This action dissolved the
General Land Office, which got its start more than 130 years earlier, in
1812. It also dissolved the U.S. Grazing Service, which had existed for
just 12 years, since 1934.
</p>
<p>
Here is what President Truman said in his
<a href="https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/public-papers/118/special-message-congress-transmitting-reorganization-plan-3-1946">“Special
Message to the Congress Transmitting Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946,”</a>
explaining the rationale for merging the two agencies:<br> <br> <em>The
General Land Office and the Grazing Service now divide responsibility
for major portion of the multiple-use Federally owned lands now held by
the Department of the Interior. The lands under jurisdiction of the two
agencies are comparable in character and in use. In some functions, the
two agencies employ the same type of personnel and use the same
techniques. Other functions are divided between the agencies so that
both are engaged in management of various aspects of the same land.
Consolidating these two agencies will permit the development of uniform
policies and the integration of two organizations whose responsibilities
now overlap. Integration of the activities of the two agencies will make
possible greater utilization and thus more economic use of expert
skills.</em>
</p>
<p>
In other words, the primary purpose of merging the agencies to form the
BLM was to increase efficiency. The same can be said for the
reorganizations of several other federal Departments and agencies
included in Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946.<strong>[1]  </strong>

Enhancing efficiency of management of federal lands was the main driver
of merging the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service.

<p>
The Special Message leaves a couple of impressions on this writer.
</p>
<p>
First, the fact that reorganizing the Federal government was on
President Truman’s radar in 1946 at all seems astonishing, given
domestic and international events. At the time the Special Message was
transmitted, he had only been President for about one year. Truman
became President, after serving for just 82 days as vice president, when
President Roosevelt died in office in April 1945. World War II
officially ended just eight months earlier, when Japan surrendered in
September 1945. Americans were still reeling from the loss of more than
400,000 U.S. civilians and soldiers during the war and facing the
reality of the “iron curtain” in Eastern Europe and the beginning of the
Cold War.

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Second, after experiencing several agency reorganizations, the fact that
the merger took effect just two months after Reorganization Plan 3 was
transmitted to Congress feels like lightning speed! However, as outlined
in “Opportunity and Challenge,”<strong>[2]</strong> while establishing
the BLM may have been relatively quick and easy, for the next two years
the agency struggled to simply survive, due to difficulties of
implementing an organizational structure and securing adequate funding.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the BLM was born of the modest goal of increasing efficiency.
Never in their wildest dreams could the developers of Reorganization
Plan 3 have imagined that the agency would become what is today – a
steward of some of the most spectacular places on the planet, a manager
of a dizzying array of natural and cultural resources, and an
organization that many public land stakeholders rely upon for commercial
opportunities, conservation of wild landscapes, and outdoor recreation
experiences. That is worthy of reflection, and celebration, 78 years
after the transmittal of Reorganization Plan 3!

became President, after serving for just 82 days as vice president, when
President Roosevelt died in office in April 1945. World War II
officially ended just eight months earlier, when Japan surrendered in
September 1945. Americans were still reeling from the loss of more than
400,000 U.S. civilians and soldiers during the war and facing the
reality of the “iron curtain” in Eastern Europe and the beginning of the
Cold War.

Second, after experiencing several agency reorganizations, the fact that
the merger took effect just two months after Reorganization Plan 3 was
transmitted to Congress feels like lightning speed! However, as outlined
in “Opportunity and Challenge,”<strong>[2]</strong> while establishing
the BLM may have been relatively quick and easy, for the next two years
the agency struggled to simply survive, due to difficulties of
implementing an organizational structure and securing adequate funding.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the BLM was born of the modest goal of increasing efficiency.
Never in their wildest dreams could the developers of Reorganization
Plan 3 have imagined that the agency would become what is today – a
steward of some of the most spectacular places on the planet, a manager
of a dizzying array of natural and cultural resources, and an
organization that many public land stakeholders rely upon for commercial
opportunities, conservation of wild landscapes, and outdoor recreation
experiences. That is worthy of reflection, and celebration, 78 years
after the transmittal of Reorganization Plan 3!

The beginning of BLM: How 486 words created the nation’s largest land
manager
</h1>
</div>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;field contact-block -body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is an important one in the history of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). On May 16, 1946—78 years ago—the agency was conceived on paper, when President Harry S. Truman submitted to Congress “Reorganization Plan 3.” The plan included the proposal to merge the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service to create one agency. Fast forward 78 years and our day-to-day activities are quite busy addressing proposals to construct renewable energy projects, improving recreation sites, responding to wildfires, and conducting all of the other work required to care for 245 million surface acres. That’s about one in every ten acres of the United States, not to mention the 30 percent of the Nation’s minerals we manage on behalf of the American people.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
When President Truman issued this simple reorganization plan, it
consisted of only 486 words regarding the proposed merger. That merger
took effect three months later—on July 16, 1946—and set in motion the
process to create an agency that today manages more public land than any
other federal government agency in the U.S. This action dissolved the
General Land Office, which got its start more than 130 years earlier, in
1812. It also dissolved the U.S. Grazing Service, which had existed for
just 12 years, since 1934.
</p>
<p>
Here is what President Truman said in his
<a href="https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/public-papers/118/special-message-congress-transmitting-reorganization-plan-3-1946">“Special
Message to the Congress Transmitting Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946,”</a>
explaining the rationale for merging the two agencies:<br> <br> <em>The
General Land Office and the Grazing Service now divide responsibility
for major portion of the multiple-use Federally owned lands now held by
the Department of the Interior. The lands under jurisdiction of the two
agencies are comparable in character and in use. In some functions, the
two agencies employ the same type of personnel and use the same
techniques. Other functions are divided between the agencies so that
both are engaged in management of various aspects of the same land.
Consolidating these two agencies will permit the development of uniform
policies and the integration of two organizations whose responsibilities
now overlap. Integration of the activities of the two agencies will make
possible greater utilization and thus more economic use of expert
skills.</em>
</p>
<p>
In other words, the primary purpose of merging the agencies to form the
BLM was to increase efficiency. The same can be said for the
reorganizations of several other federal Departments and agencies
included in Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946.<strong>[1]  </strong>

Enhancing efficiency of management of federal lands was the main driver
of merging the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service.
President Truman’s special message to Congress transmitting
Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946 explained that “Further, records relating
to grazing lands can be concentrated in fewer field offices and hence
administered more effectively.” (Photo Credit: BLM)

<p>
The Special Message leaves a couple of impressions on this writer.
</p>
<p>
First, the fact that reorganizing the Federal government was on
President Truman’s radar in 1946 at all seems astonishing, given
domestic and international events. At the time the Special Message was
transmitted, he had only been President for about one year. Truman
became President, after serving for just 82 days as vice president, when
President Roosevelt died in office in April 1945. World War II
officially ended just eight months earlier, when Japan surrendered in
September 1945. Americans were still reeling from the loss of more than
400,000 U.S. civilians and soldiers during the war and facing the
reality of the “iron curtain” in Eastern Europe and the beginning of the
Cold War.

General Land Office, which got its start more than 130 years earlier, in
1812. It also dissolved the U.S. Grazing Service, which had existed for
just 12 years, since 1934.
</p>
<p>
Here is what President Truman said in his
<a href="https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/public-papers/118/special-message-congress-transmitting-reorganization-plan-3-1946">“Special
Message to the Congress Transmitting Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946,”</a>
explaining the rationale for merging the two agencies:<br> <br> <em>The
General Land Office and the Grazing Service now divide responsibility
for major portion of the multiple-use Federally owned lands now held by
the Department of the Interior. The lands under jurisdiction of the two
agencies are comparable in character and in use. In some functions, the
two agencies employ the same type of personnel and use the same
techniques. Other functions are divided between the agencies so that
both are engaged in management of various aspects of the same land.
Consolidating these two agencies will permit the development of uniform
policies and the integration of two organizations whose responsibilities
now overlap. Integration of the activities of the two agencies will make
possible greater utilization and thus more economic use of expert
skills.</em>
</p>
<p>
In other words, the primary purpose of merging the agencies to form the
BLM was to increase efficiency. The same can be said for the
reorganizations of several other federal Departments and agencies
included in Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946.<strong>[1]  </strong>

Enhancing efficiency of management of federal lands was the main driver
of merging the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service.
President Truman’s special message to Congress transmitting
Reorganization Plan 3 of 1946 explained that “Further, records relating
to grazing lands can be concentrated in fewer field offices and hence
administered more effectively.” (Photo Credit: BLM)

<p>
The Special Message leaves a couple of impressions on this writer.
</p>
<p>
First, the fact that reorganizing the Federal government was on
President Truman’s radar in 1946 at all seems astonishing, given
domestic and international events. At the time the Special Message was
transmitted, he had only been President for about one year. Truman
became President, after serving for just 82 days as vice president, when
President Roosevelt died in office in April 1945. World War II
officially ended just eight months earlier, when Japan surrendered in
September 1945. Americans were still reeling from the loss of more than
400,000 U.S. civilians and soldiers during the war and facing the
reality of the “iron curtain” in Eastern Europe and the beginning of the
Cold War.

<p>
Second, after experiencing several agency reorganizations, the fact that
the merger took effect just two months after Reorganization Plan 3 was
transmitted to Congress feels like lightning speed! However, as outlined
in “Opportunity and Challenge,”<strong>[2]</strong> while establishing
the BLM may have been relatively quick and easy, for the next two years
the agency struggled to simply survive, due to difficulties of
implementing an organizational structure and securing adequate funding.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the BLM was born of the modest goal of increasing efficiency.
Never in their wildest dreams could the developers of Reorganization
Plan 3 have imagined that the agency would become what is today – a
steward of some of the most spectacular places on the planet, a manager
of a dizzying array of natural and cultural resources, and an
organization that many public land stakeholders rely upon for commercial
opportunities, conservation of wild landscapes, and outdoor recreation
experiences. That is worthy of reflection, and celebration, 78 years
after the transmittal of Reorganization Plan 3!
