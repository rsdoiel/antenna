## Everybody wants to change the world in Paper Trail and Slider

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-16, from: Polygon Website

Mastery is one of those words that gets tossed around when we talk about games. As an interactive medium, games can imbue in you a sense of accomplishment that, while not impossible to convey in noninteractive genres, comes naturally in an art form with fail states. If you can fail, it stands to reason that [&#8230;]

## 10 YA novels adults should read

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-16, from: Polygon Website

There is a stereotype that books shelved under Young Adult literature are not for adults. That if a story is appropriate for children, then it must only be appropriate for children, or that if it contains elements kids are supposed to outgrow — fairy tales, magic, coming of age stories — there’s nothing there to [&#8230;]

## Silent Hill 2 (2024) is most successful when it&#8217;s doing its best Silent Hill 2 (2001) imitation

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-19, from: Polygon Website

Before sitting down to play three hours of the Silent Hill 2 remake at a recent Konami-led press event in London, we were shown a new trailer. Like the previous trailers, it left me skeptical. Although I’m not opposed to the project of remaking Silent Hill 2, I’m wary of any modernizing instinct that replaces [&#8230;]

The 2024 Paris Olympics were a consistent delight, with breathtaking feats of athleticism, compelling underdog stories, and, of course, plenty of video game and anime references from fans and athletes alike. But one of the most surprising parts of this year’s games for long-time watchers of the Olympics was how strong NBC’s coverage was, particularly [&#8230;]

Building a town from the ground up is no small feat — and in video games, it’s a task that usually requires vast screen real estate and a pair of readers to see all that tiny text. But with Outlanders 2 — the city builder/life sim developed by Pomelo Games available exclusively on Apple Arcade [&#8230;]

## The animated Watchmen replicates the comics to a T — but why?

date: 2024-08-18, updated: 2024-08-18, from: Polygon Website

The impulse to iterate on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#8217; Watchmen is, perhaps, a testament to its singularity. Published across 1986 and 1987, Watchmen deconstructed the traditions of cape comics, captivating the minds of superhero fans and normies alike. Hollywood spent years trying to crack an adaptation, while DC dreamed of expanding the story, but [&#8230;]

Shooting games have become undeniably cute these days.&#160; Your character can snipe people with a rainbow-wrapped gun while wearing a fuzzy shark onesie in Fortnite. In Valorant, you might cinch a close victory not by slicing an enemy with a sharpened blade but with a magical rod emanating glitter. In PlayerUnknown&#8217;s Battlegrounds, you can play [&#8230;]
