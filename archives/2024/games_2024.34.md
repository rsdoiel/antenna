## Can Mankey be shiny in Pokémon Go?

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-19, from: Polygon Website

Mankey, the pig monkey Pokémon from Kanto, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Mankey can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Mankey and Primeape can both be shiny. They’re probably worth grabbing with Annihilape potentially on the horizon, since that evolution was introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Early Paldean Pokémon have [&#8230;]

## 10 YA novels adults should read

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-16, from: Polygon Website

There is a stereotype that books shelved under Young Adult literature are not for adults. That if a story is appropriate for children, then it must only be appropriate for children, or that if it contains elements kids are supposed to outgrow — fairy tales, magic, coming of age stories — there’s nothing there to [&#8230;]

## Silent Hill 2 (2024) is most successful when it&#8217;s doing its best Silent Hill 2 (2001) imitation

date: 2024-08-19, updated: 2024-08-19, from: Polygon Website

Before sitting down to play three hours of the Silent Hill 2 remake at a recent Konami-led press event in London, we were shown a new trailer. Like the previous trailers, it left me skeptical. Although I’m not opposed to the project of remaking Silent Hill 2, I’m wary of any modernizing instinct that replaces [&#8230;]

## The animated Watchmen replicates the comics to a T — but why?

date: 2024-08-18, updated: 2024-08-18, from: Polygon Website

The impulse to iterate on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#8217; Watchmen is, perhaps, a testament to its singularity. Published across 1986 and 1987, Watchmen deconstructed the traditions of cape comics, captivating the minds of superhero fans and normies alike. Hollywood spent years trying to crack an adaptation, while DC dreamed of expanding the story, but [&#8230;]
