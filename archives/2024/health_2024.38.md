## Revealing the association between East Asian oral microbiome and colorectal cancer through Mendelian randomization and multi-omics analysis

date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) poses a global health threat, with the oral microbiome increasingly implicated in its pathogenesis. This study leverages Mendelian Randomization (MR) to explore causal links between oral microbiota and CRC using data from the China National GeneBank and Biobank Japan. By integrating multi-omics approaches, we aim to uncover mechanisms by which the microbiome influences cellular metabolism and cancer development.MethodsWe analyzed microbiome profiles from 2017 tongue and 1915 saliva samples, and GWAS data for 6692 CRC cases and 27178 controls. Significant bacterial taxa were identified via MR analysis. Single-cell RNA sequencing and enrichment analyses elucidated underlying pathways, and drug predictions identified potential therapeutics.ResultsMR identified 19 bacterial taxa significantly associated with CRC. Protective effects were observed in taxa like RUG343 and Streptococcus_umgs_2425, while HOT-345_umgs_976 and W5053_sp000467935_mgs_712 increased CRC risk. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed key pathways, including JAK-STAT signaling and tyrosine metabolism. Drug prediction highlighted potential therapeutics like Menadione Sodium Bisulfite and Raloxifene.ConclusionThis study establishes the critical role of the oral microbiome in colorectal cancer development, identifying specific microbial taxa linked to CRC risk. Single-cell RNA sequencing and drug prediction analyses further elucidate key pathways and potential therapeutics, providing novel insights and personalized treatment strategies for CRC.

## RfaH contributes to maximal colonization and full virulence of hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae

date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) have emerged as clinically important pathogens, posing a serious threat to human health. RfaH, a transcriptional elongation factor, has been regarded as implicated in facilitating the transcription of long virulence operons in certain bacterial species. In K. pneumoniae, RfaH plays a vital role in promoting CPS synthesis and hypermucoviscosity, as well as mediating bacterial fitness during lung infection. In this study, we aim to conduct a systematic investigation of the roles of rfaH in the survival, dissemination, and colonization of hvKp through in vitro and in vivo assays. We found that bacterial cells and colonies displayed capsule -deficient phenotypes subsequent to the deletion of rfaH in K. pneumoniae NTUH-K2044. We confirmed that rfaH is required for the synthesis of capsule and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by positively regulating the expression of CPS and LPS gene clusters. We found that the ΔrfaH mutant led to a significantly decreased mortality of K. pneumoniae in a mouse intraperitoneal infection model. We further demonstrated that the absence of rfaH was associated with slower bacterial growth under conditions of low nutrition or iron limitation. ΔrfaH displayed reduced survival rates in the presence of human serum. Besides, the engulfment of the ΔrfaH mutant was significantly higher than that of NTUH-K2044 by macrophages in vivo, indicating an indispensable role of RfaH in the phagocytosis resistance of hvKp in mice. Both mouse intranasal and intraperitoneal infection models revealed a higher bacterial clearance rate of ΔrfaH in lungs, livers, and spleens of mice compared to its wild type, suggesting an important role of RfaH in the bacterial survival, dissemination, and colonization of hvKp in vivo. Histopathological results supported that RfaH contributes to the pathogenicity of hvKp in mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrates crucial roles of RfaH in the survival, colonization and full virulence of hvKp, which provides several implications for the development of RfaH as an antibacterial target.

## Gut microbiota and metabolomic profile changes play critical roles in tacrolimus-induced diabetes in rats

date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

AimsHyperglycemia is one of the adverse effects of tacrolimus (TAC), but the underlying mechanism is not fully identified. We used multi-omics analysis to evaluate the changes in the gut microbiota and metabolic profile of rats with TAC-induced diabetes.MethodsTo establish a diabetic animal model, Sprague Dawley rats were divided randomly into two groups. Those in the TAC group received intraperitoneal injections of TAC (3 mg/kg) for 8 weeks, and those in the CON group served as the control. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze fecal microbiota. The metabolites of the two groups were detected and analyzed by nontargeted and targeted metabolomics, including amino acids (AAs), bile acids (BAs), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).ResultsThe rats treated with TAC exhibited hyperglycemia as well as changes in the gut microbiota and metabolites. Specifically, their gut microbiota had significantly higher abundances of Escherichia-Shigella, Enterococcus, and Allobaculum, and significantly lower abundances of Ruminococcus, Akkermansia, and Roseburia. In addition, they had significantly reduced serum levels of AAs including asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and methionine. With respect to BAs, they had significantly higher serum levels of taurocholic acid (TCA), and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), but significantly lower levels of taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). There were no differences in the levels of SCFAs between the two groups. Correlations existed among glucose metabolism indexes (fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin), gut microbiota (Ruminococcus and Akkermansia), and metabolites (glutamic acid, hydroxyproline, GCDCA, TDCA, and TUDCA).ConclusionsBoth AAs and BAs may play crucial roles as signaling molecules in the regulation of TAC-induced diabetes.

## Case report: Personalized triple phage-antibiotic combination therapy to rescue necrotizing fasciitis caused by Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing MRSA in a 12-year-old boy

date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Maximal standard-of-care (SOC) management could not stop the life-threatening progression of a necrotizing fasciitis induced by Panton-Valentine Leukocidin-producing Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a 12-year-old boy. Multi-route phage therapy was initiated along with antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, eventually leading to full recovery with no reported adverse events.

## Intratumoral and fecal microbiota reveals microbial markers associated with gastric carcinogenesis

date: 2024-09-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe relationship between dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal microbiota and gastric cancer (GC) has been extensively studied. However, microbiota alterations in GC patients vary widely across studies, and reproducible diagnostic biomarkers for early GC are still lacking in multiple populations. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the gastrointestinal microbial communities involved in gastric carcinogenesis through a meta-analysis of multiple published and open datasets.MethodsWe analyzed 16S rRNA sequencing data from 1,642 gastric biopsy samples and 394 stool samples across 11 independent studies. VSEARCH, QIIME and R packages such as vegan, phyloseq, cooccur, and random forest were used for data processing and analysis. PICRUSt software was employed to predict functions.ResultsThe α-diversity results indicated significant differences in the intratumoral microbiota of cancer patients compared to non-cancer patients, while no significant differences were observed in the fecal microbiota. Network analysis showed that the positive correlation with GC-enriched bacteria increased, and the positive correlation with GC-depleted bacteria decreased compared to healthy individuals. Functional analyses indicated that pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism were significantly enriched in GC, while biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids was diminished. Additionally, we investigated non-Helicobacter pylori (HP) commensals, which are crucial in both HP-negative and HP-positive GC. Random forest models, constructed using specific taxa associated with GC identified from the LEfSe analysis, revealed that the combination of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus included alone could effectively discriminate between GC patients and healthy individuals in fecal samples (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.7949). This finding was also validated in an independent cohort (AUC = 0.7712).ConclusionsThis study examined the intratumoral and fecal microbiota of GC patients from a dual microecological perspective and identified Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium and Phascolarctobacterium as intratumoral and intestinal-specific co-differential bacteria. Furthermore, it confirmed the validity of the combination of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus as GC-specific microbial markers across multiple populations, which may aid in the early non-invasive diagnosis of GC.
