ǀ Why aren’t business leaders promoting CNMI’s visa-free access?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>IN my previous opinion pieces, I have pointed out that the current
CNMI administration hasn’t made any changes to prevent the legal entry
of tourists from China. This really got me questioning why the narrative
by business groups and certain individuals has been to incorrectly blame
the administration for the lack of tourists from China. It has not made
much sense to me. I arrived at the conclusion that they were not truly
after tourists from China as much as they were after pro-PRC messaging
from the administration. I still believe that is the case. It did
however get me to wondering why the numbers are down.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;After a string of scorching days in June 2023, the body of an 88-year-old man was discovered in his home in Maricopa County, Arizona. His air-conditioner, set to 70, was blowing hot air. The temperature inside was nearly 110 degrees. Maybe he had heart problems. Maybe a different organ broke down. Maybe he was taking medications that did not work as they should. Did extreme heat cause or contribute to his death?&lt;/p&gt;
