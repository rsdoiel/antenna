<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;YREKA, Calif. &amp;#8212; The Klamath River was once so flush with fish that local tribes ate salmon at every meal: flame-roasted filets on redwood skewers, stews flavored with fish tails, strips of smoky, dried salmon. In the language of the Yurok, who live on the river among California&amp;#8217;s towering redwoods, the word for &amp;#8220;salmon&amp;#8221; translates to &amp;#8220;that which we eat.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

political affiliations can often blur. One such nuanced position is that
of the “independent Republican,” a stance that merits closer
examination.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>IN my previous opinion pieces, I have pointed out that the current
CNMI administration hasn’t made any changes to prevent the legal entry
of tourists from China. This really got me questioning why the narrative
by business groups and certain individuals has been to incorrectly blame
the administration for the lack of tourists from China. It has not made
much sense to me. I arrived at the conclusion that they were not truly
after tourists from China as much as they were after pro-PRC messaging
from the administration. I still believe that is the case. It did
however get me to wondering why the numbers are down.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Intriguing Dresden, Germany, winds up on far fewer American itineraries than it deserves to. Don&amp;#8217;t make that mistake. Since its horrific firebombing in World War II, the city has transitioned to a thriving cultural center that&amp;#8217;s well worth a visit. Even with only a day to spare, Dresden is a doable side trip from bigger attractions like Berlin or Prague.&lt;/p&gt;
