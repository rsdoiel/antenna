<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>IN my previous opinion pieces, I have pointed out that the current
CNMI administration hasn’t made any changes to prevent the legal entry
of tourists from China. This really got me questioning why the narrative
by business groups and certain individuals has been to incorrectly blame
the administration for the lack of tourists from China. It has not made
much sense to me. I arrived at the conclusion that they were not truly
after tourists from China as much as they were after pro-PRC messaging
from the administration. I still believe that is the case. It did
however get me to wondering why the numbers are down.</p>

Steves: Vibrant, historic Dresden is worth a detour</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-25, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Intriguing Dresden, Germany, winds up on far fewer American itineraries than it deserves to. Don&amp;#8217;t make that mistake. Since its horrific firebombing in World War II, the city has transitioned to a thriving cultural center that&amp;#8217;s well worth a visit. Even with only a day to spare, Dresden is a doable side trip from bigger attractions like Berlin or Prague.&lt;/p&gt;
