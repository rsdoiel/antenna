## ﻿  Grand Canyon National Park Eases Water Restrictions

date: 2024-09-12, from: Press Releases

Effective immediately, Grand Canyon National Park's South Rim will transition to Stage 2 water restrictions due to rising water levels in reservoir tanks.

Camper Services, operated by Delaware North, will reopen to the public. Water spigots in Mather Campground and Desert View Campground will be turned on. Fire restrictions throughout the South Rim will be lifted. However, the park will remain under Stage 1 fire restrictions, which require campfires to be contained within designated fire rings in maintained campgrounds. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/transition-to-stage-2-water-restrictions.htm
