Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024

Valid 162000Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND
MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms appear possible across parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley late this afternoon, with additional storms
likely tonight across the north-central Plains to upper Mississippi
Valley. Large hail and damaging winds are the primary risks. A small
bowing complex, with mainly a severe/damaging wind threat, will
continue across parts of northern Illinois and vicinity this
afternoon.

...20Z Update...

...Northern Illinois/Southern Wisconsin...
A well-defined, compact MCV continues to move northeastward along
the central/northern IA/IL border. Several strong to severe gusts
were measured along the outflow associated with thunderstorm
generated by this vorticity max over the past hour. Ample low-level
moisture and buoyancy exists downstream across northern IL and far
southern WI, which will likely support the development of additional
storms along the outflow. As a result, the potential for strong to
severe gusts is expected to extend into the area this afternoon, and
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #424 was recently issued to address this
threat.

...Northern/Central MN into northern WI/western Upper MI...
A cold front continues to push eastward across western MN this
afternoon. Downstream destabilization has been mitigated by abundant
cloud cover thus far, but continued low-level moisture advection is
still expected to help remove the remaining convective inhibition
over the next few hours. As such, development along the front as it
continues eastward still appears possible this afternoon. Large hail
and damaging gusts are the primary risks, but a tornado or two is
possible if more discrete, cellular activity is realized.

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest/Upper MS Valley...
Recent surface analysis places a low over northeast CO and another
low over west-central MN. Boundary between these two lows has
recently started pushing back northward/northeastward as a warm
front, particularly from southwest into south-central NE. Increasing
cumulus across eastern CO continues to suggest that some
surface-based development may occur later this afternoon, but the
higher coverage is still expected north of the warm front tonight
across northern NE and southern SD amid warm-air advection supported
by a strengthening low-level jet. Large hail remains the primary
severe risk with this elevated development, but isolated damaging
gusts are possible as well, particularly if storms occur in close
proximity to the warm front.

...Elsewhere...
Isolated thunderstorms are still possible along the lee trough
extending from the northeast CO low through the southern High
Plains. Moderate instability and a deeply mixed boundary layer
should support an isolated threat for strong to severe downbursts.
Numerous thunderstorms are also expected to continue across the
central Gulf Coast as tropical moisture continues to advect
northward into the region ahead of a tropical wave. Weak shear
should keep any severe potential very isolated, but a few strong
water-loaded downbursts are possible.

..Mosier.. 06/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024/

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest/Upper Mississippi
Valley...
A strong upper trough/low will continue advancing east-northeastward
across the northern Plains and Canadian Prairie provinces today.
While the primary surface low is expected to remain in central
Canada, a weak secondary low should develop generally eastward
across MN through this evening in tandem with a cold front. Warm
mid-level temperatures associated with a cap should tend to inhibit
robust convective development for at least a few more hours into the
early afternoon. But, most guidance now does show thunderstorm
initiation occurring along the front in northern MN by 20-22Z. There
are still concerns/uncertainty with how many intense thunderstorms
will be able to form given fairly prevalent cloudiness that should
temper daytime heating to some extent. Still, strong deep-layer
shear and steepening mid-level lapse rates atop a gradually
destabilizing low-level airmass should support a threat for
supercells and large hail. Some guidance suggests a fairly quick
progression to a MCS, which seems reasonable given the linear
forcing of the cold front. If this occurs, then a severe/damaging
wind threat may persist through the evening into parts of northern
WI and the U.P. of MI. Enough low-level shear is also forecast to
support low-level updraft rotation and a tornado or two across this
region.

A separate area of intense thunderstorm development is possible late
this afternoon and early evening along the trailing portion of the
cold front in NE/northwest KS and vicinity. If convection can
initiate along this boundary, strong instability and modest
deep-layer shear would support a threat for mainly multicells posing
a risk for severe winds given the well mixed boundary layer
forecast. Some hail could also occur with marginal supercell
structures. The Slight Risk has been expanded southward across the
central Plains to account for this scenario. Otherwise, scattered to
numerous elevated thunderstorms are still expected to develop this
evening and overnight generally north of the front from eastern WY
into NE/SD and southern MN. A strengthening low-level jet in this
time frame across these regions and ample deep-layer shear/MUCAPE
will easily support supercells and a hail threat with initial
development. But, convective mode may quickly become messy, with one
or more bows/clusters possible as thunderstorms move eastward across
the upper MS Valley overnight. Even though this activity should tend
to remain elevated, an isolated severe/damaging wind threat may
persist given the strong MUCAPE forecast. 

...Northern Illinois/Southern Wisconsin...
A well defined MCV remains evident on visible satellite and radar
imagery late this morning over northeast MO and southern IA. This
feature should continue to track northeastward this afternoon and
evening in the modest southwesterly mid-level flow regime across the
mid MS Valley/Midwest. Ample daytime heating of a moist low-level
airmass should support around 1500-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid
afternoon across northern IL and vicinity. Ascent associated with
the MCV and its associated mid-level vorticity maximum will likely
encourage the development of isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms by 20-22Z. Modest but sufficient deep-layer shear for
updraft organization is indicated in various RAP forecast soundings
across this region. Scattered severe/damaging winds, along with
isolated hail, could occur with a small bowing complex that may
develop and move east-northeastward across the Chicago metro area
late this afternoon and early evening. Enough low-level shear is
also forecast to support a low chance for a tornado or two. Given
recent guidance and observational trends, a small Slight Risk has
been added across northern IL/southern WI to account for this
scenario.

...Southern High Plains...
Isolated/widely spaced thunderstorms should form once again this
afternoon along the length of a surface lee trough/dryline extending
southward across the southern High Plains. Although deep-layer shear
is forecast to remain weak, moderate instability and a well-mixed
boundary layer should support an isolated threat for severe
downdraft winds. Occasional hail may also occur with the more robust
cores before convection weakens after sunset.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN
UTAH...NORTHERN ARIZONA...WESTERN NEW MEXICO...AND FAR SOUTHWEST
COLORADO...

The Elevated risk area in central California has been expanded
southward to cover most of the San Joaquin Valley along with
adjacent areas of the western Transverse Ranges and the southern
Sierra Nevada. Fuels in the area have rapidly dried. Additionally,
the ongoing Post Fire has been displaying rapid growth in the
presence of strong winds (gusts of 40-50 mph with higher gusts in
mountain gaps) despite somewhat marginal RH for the area (15-25%
minimums). All of this highlights the potential for further fire
activity in the region. Otherwise, the Critical area has been
expanded in southern Utah and northern Arizona with better
confidence in Critical fire weather conditions overlapping areas of
dry fuels. See the previous discussion for further details.

..Supinie.. 06/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024/

...Synopsis...
A secondary shortwave will rotate through the western US trough on
Monday, bringing continued strong southwesterly flow across much of
the desert southwest into the southern High Plains. 

Across northeastern Arizona, southeastern Utah, and portions of
western New Mexico, afternoon relative humidity reductions to 10-15
percent will overlap sustained winds around 20 mph. Fuels in this
region are critically dry, supporting maintaining a Critical
delineation across these regions on Monday. Broader Elevated fire
weather concerns are expected across much of Arizona into
southern/central Utah, eastern Nevada, and into western New Mexico
and southern Colorado. 

Elevated fire weather concerns are also expected as strong
northwesterly flow at 10-15 mph on the backside of the trough
overlaps relative humidity reductions to 15-20 percent (locally
around 10 percent) within the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin
Valley in northern/central California. Fuels within this region are
sufficiently dry to support Elevated fire weather concerns.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
NORTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms will be possible Monday over much
of the northern Plains toward the upper Mississippi Valley.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Upper pattern early Monday morning is forecast to feature expansive
ridging centered over the Carolinas that covers much of the eastern
CONUS and a cyclone over the Pacific Northwest with associated
troughing over the much of the western CONUS. Southwesterly flow
aloft will persist across the northern and central Plains between
these two features, with some strengthening of this flow anticipated
as the western CONUS cyclone progresses eastward across the northern
Rockies and northern High Plains, and the ridging over the eastern
CONUS remains in place. 

Scattered showers and thunderstorms will likely be ongoing from the
mid MO Valley into the Upper Midwest, to the north of a warm front
expected to extend from a surface low over the southwest
NE/northwest KS vicinity northeastward to another low near the WI/MI
border. These showers and thunderstorms are expected to gradually
shift northeastward throughout the day, remaining mostly north of
the warm front. There is some chance that this activity
restrengthens during the late afternoon/early evening over
east-central MN and central/northern WI, where the warm front is
expected to make gradual northward progress during the day. Ample
low-level moisture and strong buoyancy south of the warm front
suggests surface-based supercells capable of all severe hazards,
including tornadoes, are possible. However, the overall evolution of
this convective cluster still remains a bit uncertain, with some
guidance keeping it well north of the warm front. This uncertainty
precludes higher probabilities in this outlook.

Farther west, late afternoon thunderstorm development appears
possible along the lee trough arcing from southeast MT south into
far eastern CO/western KS. Highest probabilities for surface-based,
late afternoon/early evening storms appears to be across the central
High Plains. Any storms that do form could produce hail initially,
before quickly becoming more outflow dominant. There is some
potential storms develop close enough to one another for upscale
growth, with the resulting convective line progressing
east-northeastward across southern NE. Thunderstorm development also
appears probable across southeast MT amid moisture upslope flow and
strengthening large-scale ascent ahead of the approaching shortwave
trough. These storms will likely be elevated, with hail as the
primary hazard, but a few strong gusts could still reach the
surface. Isolated storms are possible farther south across the
southern High Plains, but warmer temperatures aloft and displacement
south of the better large-scale ascent should keep coverage
isolated. High-based character to any storms that do develop could
promote damaging gusts.

The low-level jet is expected to strengthen during the evening,
likely increasing to near 60 kt from the central Plains into the
Upper Midwest. Associated warm-air advection will likely result in
thunderstorm development north of the warm front across the northern
Plains and Upper Midwest. Enough vertical shear and elevated
buoyancy is in place for severe storms, with large hail as the
primary hazards. This activity is currently expected to stay north
of the warm front, but this front is forecast to move northward
through much of MN by early Tuesday. As a result, these is some
chance a storms may trend towards becoming surface-based early
Tuesday morning if they develop far enough south.

CORRECTED FOR HEADLINE

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN
UTAH...NORTHERN ARIZONA...AND FAR SOUTHEAST NEVADA...

An Elevated risk area has been added for portions of the southern
Sierra Nevada and western Transverse Ranges in southern California.
RH is somewhat marginal for the area, with a minimum of 15-25%
expected. However, strong winds (40-50 mph gusts with higher gusts
in mountain gaps), rapid drying of fuels, poor overnight RH
recovery, and observed rapid growth of the Post fire indicate the
threat for additional fire activity in the area. Otherwise, see the

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024/

...Synopsis...
A deepening western trough will bring an increase in southwesterly
flow across much of the desert Southwest this afternoon. Fuels in
this region have seen significant drying after several days of warm
and dry conditions. Guidance indicates fuels in this region are
critically dry, with recent ERCs data indicating 90th percentile for
dryness across much of northern and central Arizona. This is further
supported by active recent fire activity in this region. Relative
humidity reductions to 5-10 percent will overlap sustained winds
15-20 mph across central/northern Arizona, southern Utah, and far
southeastern Nevada where a Critical delineation was maintained with
this outlook. Outside of this region, a more broad area of Elevated
fire weather conditions will be possible across much of
central/southern Utah into southern Arizona, where there is less
confidence is sustained Critical wind speeds. 

Elevated conditions may also extend into portions of western Nevada
in the lee of the Sierras. In this region, afternoon relative
humidity reductions to 15-20 percent will overlap sustained winds
10-15 mph (locally higher) amid modestly receptive fuels.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024

Valid 161630Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND
MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms appear possible across parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley late this afternoon, with additional storms
likely tonight across the north-central Plains to upper Mississippi
Valley. Large hail and damaging winds are the primary risks. A small
bowing complex, with mainly a severe/damaging wind threat, may also
develop across parts of northern Illinois and vicinity this
afternoon.

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest/Upper Mississippi
Valley...
A strong upper trough/low will continue advancing east-northeastward
across the northern Plains and Canadian Prairie provinces today.
While the primary surface low is expected to remain in central
Canada, a weak secondary low should develop generally eastward
across MN through this evening in tandem with a cold front. Warm
mid-level temperatures associated with a cap should tend to inhibit
robust convective development for at least a few more hours into the
early afternoon. But, most guidance now does show thunderstorm
initiation occurring along the front in northern MN by 20-22Z. There
are still concerns/uncertainty with how many intense thunderstorms
will be able to form given fairly prevalent cloudiness that should
temper daytime heating to some extent. Still, strong deep-layer
shear and steepening mid-level lapse rates atop a gradually
destabilizing low-level airmass should support a threat for
supercells and large hail. Some guidance suggests a fairly quick
progression to a MCS, which seems reasonable given the linear
forcing of the cold front. If this occurs, then a severe/damaging
wind threat may persist through the evening into parts of northern
WI and the U.P. of MI. Enough low-level shear is also forecast to
support low-level updraft rotation and a tornado or two across this
region.

A separate area of intense thunderstorm development is possible late
this afternoon and early evening along the trailing portion of the
cold front in NE/northwest KS and vicinity. If convection can
initiate along this boundary, strong instability and modest
deep-layer shear would support a threat for mainly multicells posing
a risk for severe winds given the well mixed boundary layer
forecast. Some hail could also occur with marginal supercell
structures. The Slight Risk has been expanded southward across the
central Plains to account for this scenario. Otherwise, scattered to
numerous elevated thunderstorms are still expected to develop this
evening and overnight generally north of the front from eastern WY
into NE/SD and southern MN. A strengthening low-level jet in this
time frame across these regions and ample deep-layer shear/MUCAPE
will easily support supercells and a hail threat with initial
development. But, convective mode may quickly become messy, with one
or more bows/clusters possible as thunderstorms move eastward across
the upper MS Valley overnight. Even though this activity should tend
to remain elevated, an isolated severe/damaging wind threat may
persist given the strong MUCAPE forecast. 

...Northern Illinois/Southern Wisconsin...
A well defined MCV remains evident on visible satellite and radar
imagery late this morning over northeast MO and southern IA. This
feature should continue to track northeastward this afternoon and
evening in the modest southwesterly mid-level flow regime across the
mid MS Valley/Midwest. Ample daytime heating of a moist low-level
airmass should support around 1500-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid
afternoon across northern IL and vicinity. Ascent associated with
the MCV and its associated mid-level vorticity maximum will likely
encourage the development of isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms by 20-22Z. Modest but sufficient deep-layer shear for
updraft organization is indicated in various RAP forecast soundings
across this region. Scattered severe/damaging winds, along with
isolated hail, could occur with a small bowing complex that may
develop and move east-northeastward across the Chicago metro area
late this afternoon and early evening. Enough low-level shear is
also forecast to support a low chance for a tornado or two. Given
recent guidance and observational trends, a small Slight Risk has
been added across northern IL/southern WI to account for this
scenario.

...Southern High Plains...
Isolated/widely spaced thunderstorms should form once again this
afternoon along the length of a surface lee trough/dryline extending
southward across the southern High Plains. Although deep-layer shear
is forecast to remain weak, moderate instability and a well-mixed
boundary layer should support an isolated threat for severe
downdraft winds. Occasional hail may also occur with the more robust
cores before convection weakens after sunset.

Mesoscale Discussion 1278
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0658 PM CDT Sat Jun 15 2024

Areas affected...Northwest MO into western/central IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 152358Z - 160130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A threat for damaging wind, isolated hail, and possibly a
tornado or two will spread eastward this evening. Watch issuance is
likely.

DISCUSSION...A storm cluster is gradually increasing in size across
northeast KS into southeast NE, as the northern portion of a smaller
cluster that developed earlier over central KS begins to merge with
ongoing storms across southeast NE. Moderate downstream buoyancy and
marginally sufficient deep-layer shear will continue to support
organized convection through the evening, and the ongoing storm
cluster is expected to move into parts of northwest MO and
southwest/central IA with time. 

With a linear mode already established, damaging winds may be the
most likely hazard as storms progress east-northeastward this
evening. However, rather strong low-level shear/SRH (as noted on
regional VWPs) will also support potential for a tornado or two.
Downstream watch issuance is likely between 7-8 PM CDT if trends
continue to support a severe threat this evening into northwest MO
and southwest/central IA.

SUMMARY...An intensifying broken band of thunderstorms is forecast
to grow upscale into a squall line this afternoon and into the
evening across the Watch area.  Severe gusts (60-85 mph) will be the
primary hazard with the band of storms.  Large hail may accompany
any more discrete storm on the south flank of the evolving
thunderstorm activity during the evening, as well as perhaps a brief
risk for a tornado.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 95
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles north northeast
of Glasgow MT to 35 miles south southwest of Miles City MT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.
