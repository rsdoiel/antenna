<p>
The trajectory of <em>Educação em Revista</em> reflects its commitment
to quality scientific publishing. This editorial addresses its
transformations in scientific management, technological adaptation,
internationalization, and adherence to Open Science, discussing the need
to professionalize the editorial staff of Brazilian scientific journals
to guarantee financial and scientific sustainability nationally and
internationally. <span class="ellipsis">…</span> <span

<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: SciELO in Perspective</p>
<p>
The growth of distance education (<em>Educação a Distância, EaD</em>) in
Brazil, coupled with the high dropout rates in this modality, brings
with it the need to renew school management models, with the aim of
keeping students until they graduate. Based on an analysis of the
Pedagogy courses at the Open University of Brazil, researchers have
developed alternative guidelines to guarantee student retention. <span

<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: SciELO in Perspective</p>
<p>
In search of an alternative to the laborious process of correcting
essays, more specifically regarding identifying deviations from the
theme in essays, researchers have developed a text feedback platform
that simulates the National High School Examination (<em>Exame Nacional
do Ensino Médio, ENEM</em>) guidelines and grades, the Corrector of
Essays by Artificial Intelligence (<em>Corretor de Redações por
Inteligência Artificial, CRIA</em>). The tool is already being used by
students and education professionals. <span class="ellipsis">…</span>

<p>
Educational expansion, marked by the tension between meritocracy and
pragmatism in access to higher education, confronts the aspirations and
realities of young people, especially those from working class
backgrounds, amid the erosion of traditional notions of career and
stability. While some seek any degree as a means of social mobility,
others aim for specific careers, trying to adapt in the face of
obstacles. <span class="ellipsis">…</span> <span
