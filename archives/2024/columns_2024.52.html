<p>BTW, as a longtime speaker of English <i>and</i> programmer, I think
the term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a>
is re-dundant. The term comes from mathematics where you simplify a
statement without altering its truth. Factoring is a repetitive process.
You factor, and then factor some more if you can.</p>

<p>The problem with everyone who says you have to get off Twitter is
that we’re giving up the meeting place we had and spreading all the bits
into the wind. Are you going to leave the United States now that Trump
is going to be president again? Leaving Twitter is a lot like that. How
do you know Musk isn’t going to have to sell it? Might happen. How would
you feel then about having quit Twitter in a huff as if it would always
be the bastion of assholes. It’s a mistake. He isn’t making money with
it. The more you use it the more it costs him, btw. By leaving you might
actually be helping him survive. Nothing is so linear, first big point.
Second big point, no one cares about your gestures.</p>

Using Hidden Cameras for Cheating</h2>

<p>
The
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/miniature-camera-poker-cheating/">basic
strategy</a> is to place a device with a hidden camera in a position to
capture normally hidden card values, which are interpreted by an
accomplice off-site and fed back to the player via a hidden microphone.
Miniaturization is making these devices harder to detect. Presumably AI
will soon obviate the need for an accomplice.

<h2 id="my-little-games-workshop">My little games workshop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I always promised myself that if I was ever unemployed that I’d make a
video game. When life dealt me an unpaid work hiatus though, the last
thing I wanted to do was code in my spare
time<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. I
worried I would have to let that dream, that part of me, die on the
vine. But as interviews started going well the desire to try my hand at
making a game came back. And in true adult ADHD fashion I didn’t focus
on one game, but rather made a half-dozen different games in different
formats and three of those games have made it to the release stage.
Here’s an overview of those games and a little background on how I
manage to make them.
</p>
<h2>
Mundango, a bingo game about life’s small things
</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mundango-v1.png" alt="the bingo board ui for mundango" width="1200" height="719">
<p>
During my unpaid hiatus I found myself getting a lot of pleasure in the
small things; seeing a cool bird, staring at trees, or watching animals
be animal-like. To not lose sight of those moments and with a desire to
replace my social media addiction, I made
<a href="https://mundango.daverupert.com/">Mundango</a>, a bingo game
about noticing life’s small things.
</p>
<p>
The icon is a chill turtle because it invokes the feeling of going slow.
The font is a playful little handwritten sans. And there’s a
(Japan-inspired) minor pentatonic scale that plays as you check items
off. I hope you enjoy it but more importantly I hope it nudges you (and
myself) to stop doomscrolling on our phones so much and to start looking
outside the windows a bit more often.
</p>
<h2>
Hard Code &amp; Soft Skills, a workplace adventure
</h2>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/hcss.jpg" alt="A character creator tool for hard code soft skills" />
</p>
<p>
In January, the unemployment got to my head and I got inspired to make a
role playing game called
<a href="https://hardcodesoftskills.daverupert.com/">Hard Code &amp;
Soft Skills</a>. It’s a
workplace-themed<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
clone of <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/">Lasers
&amp; Feelings</a>, a one-pager by John Harper. The original game is
loosely based on Star Trek, where you can use lasers or diplomacy to
solve your problems. I wanted to flip that a bit and have the game world
be a startup because tech needs to realize that soft skills are as
valuable as code, so that’s my big social commentary.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t labor intensive to clone the original game, but I put a lot of
time into building a little one-page website with a character generator.
It’s Astro and web components, if you’re curious. I also put a lot of
mental energy in planning out the
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/646/">first episode of Hard Code &amp;
Soft Skills on Shop Talk</a>. It went better than I could have imagined
and what a thrill to get it out the door.
</p>
<h2>
Pentablaster, an instrument with no wrong notes
</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/pentablaster.png" alt="the UI for pentablaster" width="1200" height="719">
<p>
The pentatonic scale sound effects in Mundango were a hit with some
folks, so I dug in and built a whole instrument that only plays
pentatonic scales and called it
<a href="https://pentablaster.daverupert.com/">Pentablaster</a>! It took
about a week and I’m pleased with how it turned out. It’s jammy and a
little unique. I extended it to allow you to change the key and to
choose which pentatonic scale you want to play.
</p>
<p>
There’s some features I’d like to add, but worry it’ll enter the “so
complicated I don’t want to work on it anymore” paradox. I’ll park it
for now, but I learned a lot about
<a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> in the process.
</p>
<h2>
An unreleased solitaire game
</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/youdied.jpg" alt="a skull with the text you died beneath it and a button that says reset game" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;">
<p>
I went on a short bender learning about Solo RPGs (like
<a href="https://coisinhaverde.itch.io/ronin">Ronin</a>) and that
sparked an interest in trying my hand at making one. I challenged myself
to prototype the game on pen and paper first to prove the game
mechanics. After an evening of brainstorming, I devised a game system
based on a standard 52-card deck of playing cards as a prototype. I
play-tested it with my son and we both thought that I should make a
mobile app version. After some nights and weekends, I had a rough alpha
prototype.
</p>
<p>
I play-tested the game with friends in the ShopTalk Discord and I got
great, actionable feedback. They confirmed my suspicion that the RNG
(randomness) was too high, creating a lack of decision making agency and
thereby ruining the fun. I made some tweaks and the second round of
play-tests went much better. It’s feeling pretty good now, but I think
there’s one more ingredient needed to tie it all together before public
release.
</p>
<h2>
An unreleased Playdate game
</h2>
<p>
<video src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/newguy.mp4" muted autoplay loop playsinline alt="player walking around in office with npc boss in room, he exits and goes to a much larger room, black and white monochrome only">
</video>
</p>
<p>
Since acquiring a little yellow wind-up boi, it’s been a small dream to
write a game for <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a> and I picked
the idea that seemed like the easiest and most PlayDate’y and descoped
the hell out of it so that I’d have an achievable goal. It’s an
office-themed<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
RPG type game.
</p>
<p>
After playing with Playdate’s web-based game editor
<a href="https://play.date/pulp/">Pulp</a> and trying PulpScript, I felt
the chafing of limitations and wanted to get closer to the metal. I
watched every one of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPcfC98JogQ&amp;list=PLlMPQvEA0GZPOuKJyhSr3Ra0vrpCiBTnb">SquidGod’s
Development Tutorials</a> and decided to download the
<a href="https://play.date/dev/">Playdate SDK</a> and write the game in
Lua. This is my first time writing Lua and it’s been interesting because
everything in Lua is a table: Arrays are tables, Dictionaries are
tables, Objects are tables… tables all the way down. That takes some
“undoing” of prior programming best practices to feel comfortable but
after awhile you learn to embrace the chaos and for-loopedness.
</p>
<p>
To short cut some of the player controllers and level building I picked
<a href="https://github.com/unbelievableflavour/Cotton?tab=readme-ov-file">Cotton</a>,
a Lua-based framework for Playdate. Cotton uses the
<a href="https://ldtk.io/">LDtk map editor</a> for easier map making and
that was a feature I was looking forward to using. However, I
encountered a bug somewhere between the framework and LDtk. If I updated
the map, my player could no longer get to a different room. Insecurity
started to set in:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Is this bug because I don’t know Lua?
</li>
<li>
Is this bug because I don’t understand LDtk?
</li>
<li>
Or is this a bug somewhere in Cotton?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Feedback from the Playdate Dev Discord was “Last commit is 2 years ago,
project’s dead” and “Use [Framework X] instead”… 😮‍💨 Ugh. I thought only
JavaScript dorks did this but apparently Lua dorks do it too. I
understand they’re trying to be a version of helpful; but this is
terrible advice for someone who is learning. “You need to start over” or
in video game parlance “The Princess is in another castle” kills the
dopamine rush needed when learning something new.
</p>
<p>
But I didn’t give up. And after many shower thoughts, I mustered up the
energy to do some good ol’ fashioned debugging. The first step was
step-by-step isolation where I manually diff’d thousands of lines of
JSON line-by-line. That one step taught me there was a change in the
exported JSON somewhere between the version of LDtk that Cotton used
(v1.3) and the latest version of LDtk (v1.5.3). The primary key for
joining map tiles no longer exists in v1.5.3. Then I followed the
breadcrumb trail of how Cotton imports LDtk files and I fixed the bug by
creating a new table (because Lua) to act as a join table for the
neighboring map tiles.
</p>
<p>
I was able to finish my core game loop and I’m proud of that, but fixing
a framework level bug cut the wind out of my sails.
<a href="https://github.com/unbelievableflavour/Cotton/issues/36">I may
PR the bug fix</a>… but it’s more of a patch job than a holistic fix and
I’m unsure if the author of Cotton is even interested in supporting that
on their abandoned project.
</p>
<p>
Will this game ever come out? I hope so, but it’s emotionally hard to
pick up after fighting with it so much. If I buckled down, built some
assets, and wrote more NPC dialog I bet I could finish it in a couple
human weeks of work. Perhaps I could outsource the asset creation.
</p>
<h2>
How the sausage gets made
</h2>
<p>
I make my games after the kids and spouse go to bed or while the TV runs
mindlessly. In some ways I’m borrowing from my own mental health staying
up late tinkering with little apps that I’m going to give away for free.
But these ideas all occupy brain RAM, so it feels good to chip away at
ideas and get them out the door, to make room for more ideas, to chip
away at ideas, to get them out the door… it’s a vicious cycle, but I
think a net positive for my mental health.
</p>
<p>
To hedge against wasting my spare time, I get prototypes out for review
as soon as possible to gauge interest and invest accordingly. Shopping
prototypes curbs emotional over-investment in an idea. Time builds
attachment to bad ideas, making them seem good and grander in your head
than reality. If you build in secret too long, it ends in disappointment
when the public doesn’t understand your genius you spent all your time
on.
</p>
<p>
I default to web tech because it’s what I know best and staying in your
wheelhouse means you can move faster with less mystery roadblocks (like
the LDtk map issue above). But I’d like <em>NOT WORK</em> to not feel
like work and see value in that, so this may change going forward.
</p>
<p>
At times I create artificial limitations (e.g., limit myself to a single
asset pack) because if the scope is overly broad and infinite, that
guarantees failure. Having rules, even if arbitrary, allows for play.
</p>
<p>
The last tool in the toolbelt is scoping the hell out of my ideas. When
attention is your biggest limitation (e.g. ADHD) then keeping
checkpoints small and achievable are critical. Then once you have the
foundations established, do as much as time and ambition allow.
</p>
<h2>
Unsure of what’s next… or how to book all of your free time from now
until death with no promise of financial gain.
</h2>
<p>
I have dozens of ideas kicking around in my head at all times, so my
main issue is prioritization. Here’s the ideas that occupy a lot of
brain RAM:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Finishing <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/03/gamedev-journal-1/">my
son’s Zelda-like</a>
</li>
<li>
An ambitious battle royale that would take a hundred developers a
hundred years to finish
</li>
<li>
A platformer with a slime mechanic
</li>
<li>
A local multiplayer game that has a Mario Kart vibe, but isn’t a karting
game.
</li>
<li>
A Solid Snake stealth game but for escaping awkward social situations
</li>
<li>
A horror game parody
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01B4BqWxtKo">Tim McGraw’s
What-if? Trucks: Fates</a>
</li>
<li>
A space shooter / medical sim
</li>
<li>
A Contra-like with a dumb twist
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That’s a sampling of what’s going on up in the ol’ electric meatball.
Not to be too macabre, but I’m not sure I have the lifespan left to get
through even half of that short list. Hopefully there’s a banger billion
dollar idea in there that allows me to retire and work on all the
non-profitable dumb ideas.
</p>
<p>
While doing this for a living is far off and/or will never happen I am
at least pleased that I lived up to the promise to myself to make games
if I had spare time. I made games, smaller in scope than what I had
originally imagined, but I’m comfortable with that given the timelines.
No regrets there.
</p>
<p>
Risky as it may be, I may jump to a 3D engine because I’ve had a lot of
fun building in environments like Unity in the past. That balloons the
scope and raises the level of difficulty beyond my current expertise and
it has never worked in the past… but perhaps this time it’ll be
different! 😂

This essay is so good. You probably have seen it linked a few times on
social media. I certainly have. And yet, perhaps you have not. If you
have not, it’s a great read tying together our terrible computer
experiences, us being exploited by big tech, enshittification and rot
economy. The growth mindset that kills us all.

<blockquote>
<p>
Holding these people to a higher standard at scale is what brings about
change. Be the wrench in the machine. Be the person that explains to a
friend why Facebook sucks now, and who chose to make it suck. Be the
person to explain who Prabhakar Raghavan is and what his role was in
making Google Search worse. Be the person who tells people that Sam
Altman burns $5 billion a year on unsustainable software that destroys
the environment and is built upon the large-scale larceny of creative
works because he’s desperate for power. –

Now there is a mission statement for bloggers and people on social
media.

<p>
It also confirms my peculiar service offerings like Emacs Wiki or
Campaign Wiki. They are free for users. They are simpler and they don’t
change much. There are no ads and there is no “growth” to be had. In
fact, if more people set up similar sites that are similar in these
respects, it’ll be better for us. We’ll be more resilient, more adapted
to our local needs, it’ll be more like community tools for all of us
instead of slop for us and billions for them. This is where I want to
go.

doing something so new, futuristic and useful, but after a while it’s
not cute because we’re using the system for real work. The web is
programmable, our operating systems are, of course the AI-o-verse will
be programmable too. We are able to create entirely new development
environments, these platforms deserve a fresh new look at
<i>everything.</i> I’d also like to note that at the same time, the
platforms are breaking through in web user interfaces. Remarkable
progress. Far beyond what we were doing in the very stagnant Web 2.0
world. They’re still stuck on whether or not our writing can have
titles. So bizarre to exist in a world that is deliberately hobbled, and
another with infinite horizons. Anyway this is what I’m thinking about

<p>
The stories of the atrocities committed by the Israelis in Gaza are so
horrifying they make me want to puke. I can’t read this shit.
</p>
<p>
How will they ever dig themselves out of this again? Will they say that
they didn’t know?
</p>
<p>
And what happens when these soldiers come back home? Will their deeds be
forgotten or will these demons rear their ugly head in years to come?
How will they treat their partners, their children, their neighbours if
they have already shown this level of violence against fellow humans?

<p>I have a fairly large and old
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier">C application</a> that
was written to run on the Mac and Windows. I still use it today on a
relatively modern Macintosh. I wonder if it will soon be possible to
turn this project over to an AI like ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity or
some other, to convert it to run on Linux, where it should be able to
run in perpetuity, or at least a lot longer than on the Macintosh. I
would be willing to pay a few thousand dollars to do this work.</p>

<p>Another idea that we continued to push in 2024 is
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. It was what I needed
to build <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, it defines
its objective, to form an open social web with all the basic features
writers need. Titles, links, simple styling, ability to edit, no
character limit, these are basic features we will drive the adoption of.
Defining a new network where if you want to play you’ll need to start
thinking about writers, their power, and interop. You can’t be on the
open web and be a silo. And some of the most insidious silo-like
features seem innocuous, like character limits. Whatever forces you into
copying and pasting into
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
boxes</a>, that’s how you know you’re in a silo. If you can use any
writing tool to post to a network, then it <i>is</i> on the web. Pretty
simple. Right now – <i>none</i> of the popular ones qualify. None.</p>

possible for one company to control. All it will take is one popular
podcast client to get the

This is how it worked with podcasting. Steady mission broadcasting, keep
beating the drum, and if it’s the right idea and when it’s the right
time, eventually, it happens. It will be that way too for this layer of
the network, but at this time I don’t own a podcast client, and that’s
the most basic ingredient in this bootstrap, so we wait, and keep
beating the drum.</p>

<h2 id="css-wants-to-be-a-system">CSS wants to be a system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-23, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’ve realized something obvious again, this time about CSS; that CSS
wants to be a system. At the core of CSS is a series of cascading rules
and classes marrying and mingling in an elegant symphony of style
application. Dozens and dozens of declarative instructions for painting
pixels on the screen come together in under a millisecond. Sometimes it
creates magic, other times it creates memes.
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/cssisawesome.png" alt="CSS is aweso-me" height="436" width="600" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">
<p>
At its core, CSS wants to be a system and – besides its quirky selector
power ranking algorithm – it doesn’t come with one out of the box. CSS
wants you to build a system with it. It wants styles to build up, not
flatten down. It even has
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer">layers</a>
as a feature! You can start small with a
<a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/">minimalist
reset</a> or satisfy your inner typenerd with a
<a href="https://clagnut.com/blog/2433">typographic default</a> and
build up from there. You can make your own reset. You can establish your
own naming convention. You can decide to nest or not. You can use IDs.
You can use only-classes. You can even dip a toe into the Shadow DOM if
you crave the dark arts. Hell, I encourage you to use
<code>!important</code> just to feel something.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone wants to conduct that symphony and I understand that. A
nice thing about that CSS is that it’s sharable! Plenty of pre-built
systems exist to let you offload that skill. Through the magic of
copy-and-paste, you too can have high quality design! But don’t mistake
a shortcut as the only valid option. We as humans and technologists like
to compare objects and declare winners – to be kingmakers! – but it’s a
mistake to shop at only one store and only eat meatballs despite the
ubiquitous appeal of Scandinavian design.
</p>
<p>
CSS wants to be a system and it’s not an impossible task to make your
own. Will there be mistakes and bad assumptions? Yeah. Will there be a
<code>junk.css</code> file? Probably. Will you commit CSS crimes?
Indubitably. Is CSS just thousands of key-value pairs with random
collisions implemented in an uneven distribution among a handful of
different browsers? It sure is, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.
</p>
<p>
In all my years of programming I have never loved a language more than
CSS. There’s no other programming language that sparks my brain and
lights up my imagination like CSS. Even after thirty years, there’s a
rush of adrenaline when I see a complex design and I wonder “How am I
going to make that happen?” which leads me to “And how am I going to
make that happen on a phone and older browsers?” That’s the fun part of
the job. And it’s good to know that there are other people out there who
are great at CSS, people who can build up and tear down these systems
with ease, people I can siphon knowledge from and build up my own skills
when a new challenge arises.
</p>
<p>
So cheers to the CSS folks, the tinkerers. Your obsessive animations,
pixel pushing, and system building – both delicate and strong – are fun
to see and experience.

Cute, running the iPad version of Godot on the Mac works surprisingly
well.

Discovered by accident today, I made a mistake and it ran in my Mac

<p>BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not
staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for
software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook
was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users
are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end
while a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef">coral
reef</a> has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from.
Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in
the 60s,. You would have missed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles">all
that followed</a>. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the
2020s. That story is far from over.</p>

we need, now, is a system to compete with Twitter. A system as capable
as Twitter. It has to be privately held by a group that can be trusted
not to interfere with democratic use of the system. This can’t be
guaranteed, it has to be based on trust. It needs to scale very quickly.
Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and
quickly understood as parallel to Twitter. Bluesky has a lot of what’s
needed, but its ownership is not clear. But it more like Twitter than
Twitter is today and I expect that to continue.</p>

Godot on iPhone, I forgot to disable it from the TestFlight and it sort

My opinion was that we should block it, but people love it. And in the

least passable.

But perhaps the right thing is still to prevent from running on iPhone

like to share posts from Threads on Bluesky and Mastodon to illustrate
the incompatibility, the ignorance of one to the other. These guys
should all be using the same protocol. It’s a travesty that each of them
considers their product to define the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> – they don’t
understand the first thing about the web, what the miracle the web was.
Before the web, the tech world was as it is now, fragmented by huge
companies that didn’t care about anything but their own internal drama.
The last thing they would consider was reusing something that was
already running. While all that was going on Unix basically agreed on a
core set of functions that formed a basis for interop. They weren’t
perfect, there were differences in each of the Unixes, but you could
reuse most of what you knew on each of the platforms. But Apple,
Microsoft, Sun and IBM each ran their own ecosystems. And then one day
along came the web. Instead of bookshelves of docs, it wasn’t even a
booklet. You could be up and running with a “website” in ten minutes. I
speak from experience. My first website was authored with a freaking
email. Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon are the IBM, Microsoft and Apple of
2024. It’s ridiculous if they think this is a web. To paraphrase the
late great
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgtfEX2Pka0&t=65s">Lloyd
Bentsen</a>, I knew the web, the web was a friend of mine. You are not

monolithic 1970s Unix kernel. All the BSDs are BSD-licensed
implementations of a simple monolithic 1970s Unix
kernel.<br /><br />Taking a high-level view they are different
implementations of the same design.<br /><br />So it’s very easy to port
the same apps to all of them. All run Firefox and Thunderbird and
LibreOffice. They are slightly different flavours of a single
design.<br /><br />They are all just Unixes.<br /><br />Solaris and AIX
and HP/UX are the same design. All just Unixes.<br /><br />Now we get to
outliers. Some break up the kernel into different programs that work
together. This is called a microkernel design. Mac OS X/macOS, Minix 3,
QNX, CoyotOS, keyKOS. Still pretty much Unixes but weird
ones.<br /><br />The big names among them, like macOS, still run the
same apps. Firefox, LibreOffice,
etc.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/">Still
UNIX.<br /></a><br />9front is a distro of Plan 9. Plan 9 is NOT a
Unix.<br /><br />A small team – originally 2 guys, Dennis Ritchie and
Ken Thompson, designed Unix and C.<br /><br />It caught on. Lots of
people built versions of it. Some of them changed the design a bit.
Doesn’t really matter. It is all just Unix.<br /><br />It takes the core
design and adds a million layers of junk on top, implemented by
well-meaning people who just had jobs to do and get stuff working, so
now it’s huge and vastly complex… but it’s just Unix.<br /><br />It’s an
ancient tradition to compare computers to vehicles. Unix is a car. Lots
of people make cars. It’s surprisingly hard to define what a "car" is
but it’s a box on wheels, probably with a roof (but maybe not), probably
with windows (but maybe not), on wheels (probably 4, maybe 3, could be
6) with an engine.<br /><br />All Unixes are types of car. You can’t
take the gearbox of a Ford and just bolt it into a Honda. Won’t fit. But
you can take a Ford and take a Honda and put 4 people in it and drive it
on the same road to the same shop and buy stuff and carry it
home.<br /><br />Windows is… not a car, but it’s close. Let’s say it’s a
bus. Still a box on wheels, still carries people (but lots of them.) You
can buy a bus to yourself and drive to the shops, with 40 friends
instead of 4, but you wouldn’t want to. It’s big and slow and hard to
drive and expensive. But you could do.<br /><br />Plan 9 is not Unix.
Plan 9 is what the guys who invented Unix did next.<br /><br />Plan 9 is
not a car.<br /><br />You are only thinking of cars. We are not talking
about cars any more.<br /><br />Plan 9 is, say, a bicycle. (I know,
bicycles came before cars. Sue me, it’s a metaphor not a history
lecture.)<br /><br />It still has wheels. It still goes places. You can
sit on it, and ride it, and go hundreds of miles. You can go to the
shops and do your shopping and take it home, but no, 4 of you can’t. You
can’t put the shopping in the boot. It doesn’t have a boot. You need a
backpack or panniers.<br /><br />Stop thinking of cars. We have left
car-land behind. There are a hundred other types of "things that have
wheels and go" that aren’t cars. There are motorbikes and roller skates
and skateboards and go-karts and racing cars and unicycles and roller
blades and cross-country-skiing roller-trainers and wheely shoes and
loads more.<br /><br />You’re asking what kind of car a bicycle is. It
isn’t.<br /><br />&gt; I’m just wondering how easy it would be to load
this on a cheap laptop and get up and running.<br /><br />It’s doable. A
few hours work maybe.<br /><br />&gt; Does it require a lot of tweaking
to get simple things working?<br /><br />You do not define "simple
things". But downthread you do.<br /><br />You will never usefully
browse the web on 9front. It doesn’t really have a web browser. There
are some kinda sorta things that do 1% of what a mainstream web browser
does but you won’t like them.<br /><br />It doesn’t really have "apps".
Nobody ever wrote any. (With rounding errors. There is a tiny bit of 3rd
party software, but you won’t recognise anything.)<br /><br />Plan 9 is
a bicycle. It can take you places but you can’t drive it if you only
know how to drive cars. Never mind that it has a manual gear shift and
there are 27 gears in 2 different gearing systems and no clutch and you
need to memorise all the combinations you need to climb a hill and speed
along the flat.<br /><br />Also, you know, you need to
pedal.<br /><br />There’s no engine.<br /><br />"I want to write
Markdown text and print it to a laser printer."<br /><br />Right, well,
you’ll need to find a dozen separate tools, learn how to work them, and
learn how to link them together… Or, you’ll need to write your
own.<br /><br />Plan 9 is not the end point of the story,
either.<br /><br />Plan 9 was a step on the road to Inferno. Inferno is
not a car and it’s not a bicycle. It is, in extremely vague and general
terms, a cross between an operating system, and Java, and the JVM. All
in one.<br /><br />It’s… a pedal-powered aeroplane. You can’t ride it to
the shops but it is in its way even more amazing than a bicycle… it can
fly.<br /><br />What you call "simple stuff" is car stuff. You can’t do
it. It is not as "simple" as you think it
is.<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=93196" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<p>The ride is coming to an end. The experiment is done. We tried, but
we admit defeat. Four years ago we started adding support for an
alternative HTTP backend in curl. It would use a library written in
rust, called hyper. The idea was to introduce an alternative
implementation of HTTP internals that you could …

used crappy settings but Affinity Photo seems to be really bad […]</p>
