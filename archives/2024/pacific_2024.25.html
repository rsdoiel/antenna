Today, AI permeates nearly every aspect of our lives, from the algorithms that curate social media feeds to the autonomous systems that drive cars. This rapid advancement, while promising in many respects, also heralds a new era of uncertainty and potential peril.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;BOSTON &amp;#8212; At shootaround before Game 3 of the second round, Jaylen Brown shrugged off a question about the Celtics&amp;#8217; playoff struggles at home. They had dropped Game 2 at TD Garden for the second straight series, but Brown would not accept that they had a problem. In the past, sure, Boston had trouble protecting the parquet. Brown said the Celtics were focused on changing that narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>A JURY of twelve in New York City found Donald Trump guilty of 34
felony counts related to falsifying documents for a criminal purpose.
His sentencing will occur on July 11, 2024. Judge Merchan will make the
decision and he will make that decision only after he gets and considers
a pre-sentence report, and hears from both the prosecution and defense
about their positions on the sentence. We have to wait for the actual
decision.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, eruptions of Kilauea volcano on the Island of Hawaii have happened in remote regions and lava flows have not directly threatened communities. However, the approaching anniversary of a lava flow crisis a decade ago reminds us that eruptions on Kilauea have the potential to cause damage and island-wide disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Belfast, Northern Ireland&amp;#8217;s capital city, is perhaps best known for the sectarian strife that took place here during the era of the Troubles, and as the birthplace of the Titanic (and many other ships that didn&amp;#8217;t sink). While these two claims to fame aren&amp;#8217;t too uplifting, Belfast&amp;#8217;s story is hardly a downer. This unsinkable city, just two hours away from Dublin by train, makes for a fascinating day trip.&lt;/p&gt;
