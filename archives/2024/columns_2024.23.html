<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>I was recently invited to participate in the Trends with Friends
podcast, co-hosted by long time friend Howard Lindzon. The podcast
primarily focuses on ‚Äúmarkets‚Äù and less on ‚Äútechnology,‚Äù as I understand
it. Howie and his co-hosts were eager to discuss Apple, AI, and the
significant changes sweeping our industry. My overarching message for

<p>
The next step in online social media will be group blogs that support
the APIs needed to integrate with not only the Fediverse, but other
non-AP services that have their own APIs. Each one will have a theme, a
voice, not all writers in agreement of course, but sharing a similar
perspective, context, point of view.

2024-06-06 Learning to be a programmer
</h1>
<p>
I was talking with
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="akkartik">@akkartik</span></a> and
<a class="account" href="https://mas.to/@TodePond" title="@TodePond@mas.to"><span
class="citation" data-cites="TodePond">@TodePond</span></a> about
programming.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mas.to/@TodePond" title="@TodePond@mas.to"><span
class="citation" data-cites="TodePond">@TodePond</span></a> got me
thinking about communities around programming when they wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
the problem i see is that no one is talking to each other. everyone is
trying to build their solutions in isolation - as island communities. in
my opinion we shouldnt build anything new, we should try to make
compatible the mindsets and tools that we already have. its an extreme
viewpoint but i see no one else taking it, so im taking it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I can definitely see many people writing their own software and many
more people using existing software and never adapting it. I do it, too!
</p>
<p>
To put a really hurtful spin onto it: we rarely sit next to a newbie
using our software. I never do. Never. We should listen to them
muttering to themselves for the first four hours. The bugs they
attribute to their own incompetence; the confusing usability issues they
never report‚Ä¶ and now imagine sitting next to a newbie looking at our
code, trying to find their way. No comments. No helpful guides. The code
is the best documentation, some people say. I guess they haven‚Äôt seen my
code. All those readability refactors I didn‚Äôt do. All these questions
nobody ever asked me. People look at the code and don‚Äôt come back.
</p>
<p>
Those are my free software nightmares when I look at all the things I‚Äôve
written with a community of one. üò≥
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I guess what I want to say: if you feel like you write free
software for others but nobody joins your community, you are not alone.
We are all together in this, alone. üò•
</p>
<p>
I think the reason for this has to do with how hard it is to understand
code by just reading it instead of writing. It‚Äôs super hard to get into
another code base. And it is hard to write code such that it is a
welcoming ramp up. I‚Äôd say Emacs is one of the examples where it worked
but we don‚Äôt actually know whether the approach is ‚Äúgood‚Äù. I certainly
used Emacs for a year or two before writing my own init file way back
when.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm not sure which parts enable it and I‚Äôm not sure if having more of
the same would result in more programmers modifying the code and sharing
their modifications.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Good documentation of the programming language, Emacs Lisp
</li>
<li>
Good documentation of the software itself, Emacs
</li>
<li>
Good documentation of the code, with documentation strings and comments
throughout the code base
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Nearly every function is documented, nearly every global variable is
documented, the concepts are documented in the manual, the language is
documented in the manual ‚Äì it‚Äôs a gigantic group effort to build that
ramp.
</p>
<p>
I think this is how you get started modifying Emacs: with an init file
that customizes some part of it.
</p>
<p>
That reminds me of the post by Peter Seibel (2014) that I recently saw
linked in my feed:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It was sometime after that presentation that I finally realized the
obvious: code is not literature. We don‚Äôt read code, we decode it. We
examine it. A piece of code is not literature; it is a specimen. Knuth
said something that should have pointed me down this track when I asked
him about his own code reading: ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs not describing reading
literature; he‚Äôs describing a scientific investigation.‚Äù ‚Äì
<a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/">Code is not
literature</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I feel this is how I approach new code: find a tiny task and see whether
I can make that change. Usually this requires building the code,
searching the best location, learning about the code style,
investigating the libraries used, and so on. There are many strings
attached.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt know how else to do it.
</p>
<p>
The same is true at the office. Our code base is about four million
lines of code. Newbies get assigned small issues to fix and need to ask
a gazillion questions and that‚Äôs how they learn.
</p>
<p>
If only there were a better way. If there is, I don‚Äôt know it.

guest post on their blog (2018):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We all read code already; it‚Äôs just that we usually read when we want to
edit. And the <em>comprehension</em> that questions about reading are
really concerned with‚Äîit comes from both reading and writing,
interleaved in complex ways. That hacking produces better comprehension
than passive, linear reading fits with what we know about learning. ‚Äì

<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="akkartik">@akkartik</span></a> summary of
our little interchange gives me pause:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We live in a world where everybody is illiterate, unable to read
computer programs. Everybody. A tiny minority can <em>write</em>
programs, but even they can‚Äôt read programs written by others without
1000x effort. They/we oppress the rest.

Indeed, how not to be part of this, I wonder.

The Department of Justice indicted two brothers for exploiting
mechanisms supporting Ethereum‚Äôs ‚ÄúMaximal Extractable Value‚Äù (MEV).

<blockquote>
Anton, 24, and James Peraire-Bueno, 28, were arrested Tuesday, charged
with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to
commit money laundering. Each brother faces ‚Äúa maximum penalty of 20
years in prison for each count,‚Äù the DOJ said.<br /> <br /> The alleged
scheme was launched in December 2022 by the brothers, who studied at
MIT, after months of planning, the indictment said. The pair seemingly
relied on their ‚Äúspecialized skills‚Äù and expertise in crypto trading to
fraudulently gain access to ‚Äúpending private transactions‚Äù on the
blockchain, then ‚Äúused that access to alter certain transactions and
obtain their victims‚Äô cryptocurrency,‚Äù the DOJ said
</blockquote>
Below the fold I look into the details of the exploit as alleged in the
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">indictment</a>,
and what it suggests about the evolution of Ethereum.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<h3>
Background
</h3>
Lets start with some history. The key issue with MEV is that the
architecture of decentralized cryptocurrencies enables a form of
<i>front-running</i>, which
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_running">Wikipedia defines
thus</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Front running, also known as tailgating, is the prohibited practice of
entering into an equity (stock) trade, option, futures contract,
derivative, or security-based swap to capitalize on advance, nonpublic
knowledge of a large (‚Äúblock‚Äù) pending transaction that will influence
the price of the underlying security. ‚Ä¶ A front running firm either buys
for its own account before filling customer buy orders that drive up the
price, or sells for its own account before filling customer sell orders
that drive down the price. Front running is prohibited since the
front-runner profits from nonpublic information, at the expense of its
own customers, the block trade, or the public market.
</blockquote>
Note that the reason it is illegal in these markets is that, at the time
the front-runner enters their order, the customer‚Äôs order is known only
to them. It is thus ‚Äúmaterial non-public information‚Äù. Arguably,
high-frequency traders front-run by placing their computers so close to
the market‚Äôs computers that the information about orders on which they
trade has not in practice had time to ‚Äúbecome public‚Äù.<br /> <br /> I
wrote about front-running in cryptocurrencies, describing how it was
different, in 2020‚Äôs
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/11/the-order-flow.html"><i>The Order
Flow</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In order to be truly decentralized, each miner must choose for itself
which transactions to include in the next block. So there has to be a
pool of pending transactions visible to all miners, and thus to the
public. It is called the mempool. How do miners choose transactions to
include? Each transaction in the pool contains a fee, payable to the
miner who includes it. Miners are coin-operated, they choose the
transactions with the highest fees. <i>The mempool concept is essential
to the goal of a decentralized, trustless cryptocurrency</i>.

</table>
The pool of pending transactions is public, thus front-running is
arguably legal and anyone can do it by offering a larger fee. Ethereum‚Äôs
block time is 12 seconds, plenty of time for bots to find suitable
transactions in the mempool. It normally contains a <i>lot</i> of
pending transactions. Ethereum is currently processing about
<a href="https://etherscan.io/txs">1.12M transactions/day</a> (46.7K/hr)
and there are around
<a href="https://etherscan.io/dashboards/daily-pending-tx">166K pending
transactions</a>, or about 3.6 hours worth. Bitcoin is processing about
<a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/n-transactions">700K
transactions/day</a> and there are normally around
<a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/mempool-count">100K
transactions</a> in the mempool, or 3.5 hours worth.<br /> <br />
Arguably, this is analogous to high-frequency trading, not front-running
by brokers. In
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/11/the-order-flow.html"><i>The Order
Flow</i></a> I recount how the prevalence of high-frequency trading led
institutions to set up
<a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest">dark
pools</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
When conventional ‚Äúlit‚Äù markets became overrun with HFT bots, investment
banks offered large investors ‚Äúdark pools‚Äù where they could trade with
each other without the risk of being front-run by algos. But Barclays
allowed HFT bots into its dark pool, where they happily front-run
unsuspecting investors who thought they were safe. Eventually Barclays
was caught and forced to drain its dark pool. In 2016, it was
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/31/barclays-and-credit-suisse-to-pay-biggest-ever-fines-for-dark-pool-trading">fined
$70 million</a> for fraud. It was not the only large bank that accepted
money from large investors to protect them from HFT bots and money from
HFT traders to allow them access to the investors it was supposed to be
protecting.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2020/11/the-order-flow.html"><i>The Order
Flow</i></a> was in large part sparked by two accounts of attempts to
avoid being front-run:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest"><i>Ethereum
is a Dark Forest</i></a> by Dan Robinson and Georgios
Konstantopoulos:<br />
<blockquote>
In the Ethereum mempool, these apex predators take the form of
‚Äúarbitrage bots.‚Äù Arbitrage bots monitor pending transactions and
attempt to exploit profitable opportunities created by them. No white
hat knows more about these bots than Phil Daian, the smart contract
researcher who, along with his colleagues, wrote the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf">Flash Boys 2.0</a> paper
and coined the term ‚Äúminer extractable value‚Äù (MEV).<br /> <br /> Phil
once told me about a cosmic horror that he called a ‚Äúgeneralized
frontrunner.‚Äù Arbitrage bots typically look for specific types of
transactions in the mempool (such a DEX trade or an oracle update) and
try to frontrun them according to a predetermined algorithm. Generalized
frontrunners look for any transaction that they could profitably
frontrun by copying it and replacing addresses with their own.
</blockquote>
Their attempt to rescue about $12K failed because they didn‚Äôt know a
miner and thus couldn‚Äôt avoid the dark forest in the mempool, where a
front-runner bot found it.
</li>
<li>
And <a href="https://samczsun.com/escaping-the-dark-forest/"><i>Escaping
the Dark Forest</i></a>, Samczsun‚Äôs account of how:
<blockquote>
On September 15, 2020, a small group of people worked through the night
to rescue over 9.6MM USD from a vulnerable smart contract.
</blockquote>
The key point of Samczsun‚Äôs story is that, after the group spotted the
vulnerability and built a transaction to rescue the funds, they could
not put the rescue transaction in the mempool because it would have been
front-run by a bot. They had to find a miner who would put the
transaction in a block without it appearing in the mempool. In other
words, their transaction needed a dark pool. And they had to trust the
cooperative miner not to front-run it.<br /> <br /> Ths attempt
succeeded because they did know a miner.
</li>
</ul>
Reading both is essential to understand how adversarial the Ethereum
environment is.<br /> <br /> The 2019 paper that published the MEV
concept was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf"><i>Flash Boys
2.0: Frontrunning, Transaction Reordering, and Consensus Instability in
Decentralized Exchanges</i></a> by Philip Daian <i>et 7 al</i>:<br />
<blockquote>
In this work, we explain that DEX [decentralized exchanges] design flaws
threaten underlying blockchain security. We study a community of
<i>arbitrage bots</i> that has arisen to exploit DEX flaws. We show that
these bots exhibit many similar market-exploiting behaviors‚Äî
frontrunning, aggressive latency optimization, etc.‚Äîcommon on Wall
Street, as revealed in the popular Michael Lewis expose¬¥ Flash Boys. We
explore the DEX design flaws that spawned arbitrage bots, measure and
model these bots‚Äô behavior, and illuminate systemic smart-contract
ecosystem risks implied by our observations.
</blockquote>
Daian and co-authors describe five pathologies: Pure revenue
opportunities, Priority gas auctions (PGAs), Miner-extractable value
(MEV), Fee-based forking attacks, and Time-bandit attacks. Their results
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf">find two
surprises</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
First, they identify a concrete difference between the consensus-layer
security model required for blockchain protocols securing simple
payments and those securing smart contracts. In a payment system such as
Bitcoin, all independent transactions in a block can be seen as
executing atomically, making ordering generally unprofitable to
manipulate. Our work shows that analyses of Bitcoin miner economics fail
to extend to smart contract systems like Ethereum, and may even require
modification once second-layer smart contract systems that depend on
Bitcoin miners go live.<br /> <br /> Second, our analysis of PGA games
underscores that protocol details (such as miner selection criteria, P2P
network composition, and more) can directly impact application-layer
security and the fairness properties that smart contracts offer users.
Smart contract security is often studied purely at the application
layer, abstracting away low-level details like miner selection and P2P
relayers‚Äô behavior in order to make analysis tractable ‚Ä¶ Our work shows
that serious blind spots result. Low-level protocol behaviors pose
fundamental challenges to developing robust smart contracts that protect
users against exploitation by profit-maximizing miners and P2P relayers
that may game contracts to subsidize attacks
</blockquote>
Because it promised profits, MEV became the topic of a lot of research.
By 2022, in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/09/miners-extractable-value.html"><i>Miners‚Äô
Extractable Value</i></a> I was able to review 10 papers about it.<br />
<br /> Then came Ethereum‚Äôs transition to
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/10/the-power-of-ethereums-merge.html">Proof-of-Stake</a>.
As usual, Matt Levine provides a
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-16/crypto-brothers-front-ran-the-front-runners">lucid
explanation of the basics</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
How does the blockchain decide which transactions to record, and in what
order? In Ethereum, the answer is: with money. People who want to do
transactions on the Ethereum network
<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/">pay fees to
execute the transactions</a>; there is a flat base fee, but people can
also bid more ‚Äî a ‚Äúpriority fee‚Äù or ‚Äútip‚Äù ‚Äî to get their transactions
executed quickly. Every 12 seconds, some computer on the Ethereum
network is selected to record the transactions in a block. This computer
used to be called a ‚Äúminer,‚Äù but in current proof-of-stake Ethereum
blocks are recorded by computers called ‚Äúvalidators.‚Äù Each block is
compiled by one validator,
<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/block-proposal/">selected</a>
more or less at random, called a ‚Äúproposer‚Äù; the other validators vote
to accept the block. The validators
<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/">share
the transaction fees</a>, with the block proposer getting more than the
other validators.<br /> <br /> The block proposer will naturally
prioritize the transactions that pay more fees, because then it will get
more money. And, again, the validators are all computers; they will be
<i>programmed</i> to select the transactions that pay them the most
money. And in fact there is a
<a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725">division
of labor</a> in modern Ethereum, where a computer called a
‚Äú<a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-boost/block-builders">block
builder</a>‚Äù puts together a list of transactions that will pay the most
money to the validators, and then the block proposer proposes a block
with that list so it can get paid.
</blockquote>
Levine then gets into
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-16/crypto-brothers-front-ran-the-front-runners">the
details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
I am giving a simplistic and somewhat old-fashioned description of MEV,
and modern Ethereum has a whole, like, institutional structure around
it. There are
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/01/31/inside-the-private-mempools-where-ethereum-traders-hide-from-front-running-bots/">private
mempools</a>, where you can hide transactions from bots. There is
<a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, ‚Äúa research and
development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities
posed by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) to stateful blockchains,
starting with Ethereum,‚Äù which has things like
<a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-boost/introduction">MEV-Boost</a>,
which creates ‚Äúa competitive block-building market‚Äù where validators can
‚Äúmaximize their staking reward by selling their blockspace to an open
market,‚Äù and
<a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-share/introduction">MEV-Share</a>,
‚Äúan open-source protocol for users, wallets, and applications to
internalize the MEV that their transactions create,‚Äù letting them
‚Äúselectively share data about their transactions with searchers who bid
to include the transactions in bundles‚Äù and get paid.
</blockquote>
<h3>
What Is Alleged?
</h3>
We have two explanations of what the brothers are alleged to have done,
one from the DoJ‚Äôs indictment and one from Flashbots, whose MEV-Boost
software was exploited.<br />
<h4>
Dept. of Justice
</h4>
The DoJ‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">indictment
explains MEV-Boost</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol start="11">
<li>
‚ÄúMEV-Boost‚Äù is an open-source software designed to optimize the
block-building process for Ethereum validators by establishing protocols
for how transactions are organized into blocks. Approximately 90% of
Ethereum validators use MEV-Boost.
</li>
<li>
Using MEV-Boost, Ethereum validators outsource the block-building
process to a network of ‚Äúsearchers,‚Äù ‚Äúbuilders,‚Äù and ‚Äúrelays.‚Äù These
participants operate pursuant to privacy and commitment protocols
designed to ensure that each network participant‚Äîthe searcher, the
builder, and the validator‚Äîinteracts in an ordered manner that maximizes
value and network efficiency.
</li>
<li>
A searcher is effectively a trader who scans the public mempool for
profitable arbitrage opportunities using automated bots (‚ÄúMEV Bots‚Äù).
After identifying a profitable opportunity (that would, for example,
increase the price of a given cryptocurrency), the searcher sends the
builder a proposed ‚Äúbundle‚Äù of transactions. following transactions in a
precise order: The bundle typically consists of the (a) the searcher‚Äôs
‚Äúfrontrun‚Äù transaction, in which the searcher purchases some amount of
cryptocurrency whose value the searcher expects to increase; (b) the
pending transaction in the mempool that the MEV Bot identified would
increase the price of that cryptocurrency; and (c) the searcher‚Äôs sell
transaction, in which the searcher sells the cryptocurrency at a higher
price than what the searcher initially paid in order to extract a
trading profit. A builder receives bundles from various searchers and
compiles them into a proposed block that maximizes MEV for the
validator. The builder then sends the proposed block to a ‚Äúrelay.‚Äù A
relay receives the proposed block from the builder and initially only
submits the ‚Äúblockheader‚Äù to the validator, which contains information
about, among other things, the payment the validator will receive for
validating the proposed block <i>as structured by the builder</i>. It is
only <i>after</i> the validator makes this commitment through a digital
signature that the relay releases the full content of the proposed block
(<i>i.e.</i> ‚Äî the complete ordered transaction list) to the validator.
</li>
<li>
In this process, a relay acts in a manner similar to an escrow account,
which temporarily maintains the otherwise private transaction data of
the proposed block until the validator commits to publishing the block
to the blockchain exactly as ordered. The relay will not release the
transactions within the proposed block to the validator until the
validator has confirmed through a digital signature that it will publish
the proposed block as structured by the builder to the blockchain. Until
the transactions within the proposed block are released to the
validator, they remain private and are not publicly visible.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
Note the importance of the relay maintaining the privacy of the
transactions in the proposed block.<br /> <br /> The indictment
summarizes how the brothers are alleged to have
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">stolen
$25M</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol start="17">
<li>
ANTON PERAIRE-BUENO and JAMES PERAIRE-BUENO took the following steps,
among others, to plan and execute the Exploit: (a) establishing a series
of Ethereum validators in a manner that concealed their identities
through the use of shell companies, intermediary cryptocurrency
addresses, foreign exchanges, and a privacy layer network; (b) deploying
a series of test transactions or ‚Äúbait transactions‚Äù designed to
identify particular variables most likely to attract MEV Bots that would
become the victims of the Exploit (collectively the ‚ÄúVictim Traders‚Äù);
(c) identifying and exploiting a vulnerability in the MEV-Boost relay
code that caused the relay to prematurely release the full content of a
proposed block; (d) re-ordering the proposed block to the defendants‚Äô
advantage; and (e) publishing the re-ordered block to the Ethereum
blockchain, which resulted in the theft of approximately $25 million in
cryptocurrency from the Victim Traders.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
The indictment
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">adds</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol start="15">
<li>
Tampering with these established MEV-Boost protocols, which are relied
upon by the vast majority of Ethereum users, threatens the stability and
integrity of the Ethereum blockchain for all network participants.

This statement has attracted attention. Why should the DoJ care about
‚Äúthe stability and integrity of the Ethereum blockchain‚Äù? Note that the
brothers are not charged with this, the indictment has three
counts:<br />
<ol>
<li>
Wire fraud, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1349.
</li>
<li>
Wire fraud, Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1343 and 2.
</li>
<li>
Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering, Title 18, United States Code,
Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(i).
</li>
</ol>
The steps in 11-14 are charged as wire fraud. The indictment then goes
on to detail the steps they are alleged to have taken to launder the
loot, leading to the money laundering charge.<br />
<h4>
Flashbots
</h4>
Flashbots‚Äô explanation starts by explaining the
<a href="https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540"><i>role
of a relay</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
mev-boost works through a commit and reveal scheme where proposers
commit to blocks created by builders without seeing their contents, by
signing block headers. Only after a block header is signed are the block
body and corresponding transactions revealed. A trusted third party
called a relay facilitates this process. <b>mev-boost is designed to
allow block builders to send blocks that contain valuable MEV to
validators without having to trust them. Removing the need for builders
to trust validators ensures that every validator has equal access to MEV
regardless of their size and is critical for ensuring the validator set
of Ethereum remains decentralized</b>.
</blockquote>
Notice the traditional
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/01/blockchain-gaslighting.html">cryptocurrency
gaslighting</a> about ‚Äútrustlessness‚Äù and ‚Äúdecentralization‚Äù in that
paragraph:<br />
<ul>
<li>
It is true that by introducing a relay they have eliminated the need to
trust the validators, but they have done so by introducing ‚Äúa trusted
third party called a relay‚Äù. The exploit worked because the third party
violated its trust. They would likely argue that, unlike the validators,
the relay lacks financial incentives to cheat. But a malign relay could
presumably also play the role of the malign proposer in the exploit.

Saying ‚Äúthe validator set of Ethereum <i>remains</i> decentralized‚Äù
implies that it <i>is</i> decentralized. It is certainly good that the
switch to Proof-of-Stake has increaed Ethereum‚Äôs
<a href="https://news.earn.com/quantifying-decentralization-e39db233c28e">Nakamoto
coefficient</a> from 2-3 to 5-6, as I pointed out last month in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/sufficiently-decentralized.html"><i>‚ÄúSufficiently
Decentralized‚Äù</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A year ago the top 5 staking pools controlled 58.4%, now they control
44.7% of the stakes. But it is still true that block production is
heavily centralized, with one producer claiming 57.9% of the rewards.
</blockquote>
But a Nakamoto coefficient of 6 isn‚Äôt very decentralized. Further, this
misses the point revealed by the brothers‚Äô exploit. With about
<a href="https://clientdiversity.org/#distribution">55% of execution
clients running Geth</a> and around
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">90% of validators
trusting MEV-Boost‚Äôs relaying</a>, just to take two examples, the
software stack is extremely vulnerable to bugs and supply chain attacks.
</li>
</ul>
Flashbots then explain the bug the
<a href="https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540">brothers
exploited</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The attack on April 3rd, 2023 was possible because the exploited relay
revealed block bodies to the proposer so long as the proposer correctly
signed a block header. However, the relay did not check if the block
header that was signed was valid. In the case that the block header was
signed but invalid, the relay would attempt to publish the block to the
beacon chain, where beacon nodes would reject it. <strong>Crucially,
regardless of whether the block was rejected by beacon nodes or not, the
relay would still reveal the body to the proposer</strong>.<br /> <br />
Having access to the block body allowed the malicious proposer to
extract transactions from the stolen block and use them in their own
block where it could exploit those transactions. In particular, the
malicious proposer constructed their own block that broke the sandwich
bots‚Äô sandwiches up and effectively stole their money.
</blockquote>
Then they explain the
<a href="https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540">mitigation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Usually, proposers publishing a modified block would not only
<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">equivocate</a>
but their new block would have to race the relay block - which has a
head start - to acquire attestations for the fork choice rule. However,
in this case, the relay was not able to publish a block because the
proposer returned an invalid block header. Therefore, the malicious
proposer‚Äôs new block was uncontested and they won the race
automatically. This has been addressed by requiring the relay to
successfully publish a block, thereby not sharing invalid blocks with
proposers. The mitigations section covers this and future looking
details at more length.
</blockquote>
By ‚Äúequivocate‚Äù they mean proposing more than one block in a time slot.
<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">Validators
responsibilities are</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The validator is expected to maintain sufficient hardware and
connectivity to participate in block validation and proposal. In return,
the validator is paid in ETH (their staked balance increases). On the
other hand, participating as a validator also opens new avenues for
users to attack the network for personal gain or sabotage. To prevent
this, validators miss out on ETH rewards if they fail to participate
when called upon, and their existing stake can be destroyed if they
behave dishonestly. Two primary behaviors can be considered dishonest:
proposing multiple blocks in a single slot (equivocating) and submitting
contradictory attestations.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Discussion
</h3>
Matt Levine covered this case in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-16/crypto-brothers-front-ran-the-front-runners"><i>Crypto
Brothers Front-Ran the Front-Runners</i></a> by focusing on
front-running:<br />
<blockquote>
There is a sort of cool purity to this. In stock markets, some people
are faster than others, and can make money by trading ahead of a big
order, and people get mad about this and think it is unfair and propose
solutions. And when money changes hands for speed advantages ‚Äî
‚Äú<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-05/robinhood-gamestop-saga-pressures-payment-for-order-flow">payment
for order flow</a>,‚Äù
‚Äú<a href="https://www.marketsmedia.com/revisiting-flash-boys/">colocation</a>‚Äù
‚Äî people complain about corruption. In crypto it‚Äôs like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs create an
efficient market in trading ahead of big orders.‚Äù I once wrote: ‚ÄúRather
than <i>solve</i> this concern about traditional markets, crypto <i>made
it explicit</i>.‚Äù That feels almost like a general philosophy of crypto:
Take the problems of traditional finance and make them, <i>worse</i>,
sure, but more transparent and visible and explicit and subject to
unbridled free markets.
</blockquote>
And then casting the brothers‚Äô
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-16/crypto-brothers-front-ran-the-front-runners">actions
as front-running</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Ethereum and its decentralized exchanges have a market structure that is
like ‚Äúbots can look at your transactions and front-run them if that‚Äôs
profitable.‚Äù And these guys, allegedly, front-ran the front-runners;
they turned the market structure around so that <i>they</i> could get an
early look at the front-running bots‚Äô front-running transactions and
front-run them instead. By hacking, sure, sure, it‚Äôs bad. But it leaves
the Justice Department in the odd position of saying that the integrity
of crypto front-running is important and must be defended.
</blockquote>
I think Levine is wrong here. Just as with high-frequency trading,
‚Äúcrypto front-running‚Äù is legal because it uses public information. The
brothers were not indicted for front-running. What is illegal, and what
the DoJ is alleging, is trading on ‚Äúmaterial non-public informatiion‚Äù,
which they obtained by wire fraud (a fraudulent signature). The
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1351996/dl">indictment
says</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
this False Signature was designed to, and did, trick the Relay to
prematurely release the full content of the proposed block to the
defendants, including the private transaction information.
</blockquote>
The DoJ is not defending the ‚Äúintegrity of crypto front-running‚Äù, it is
prosecuting activity that is illegal in all markets.<br /> <br /> The
next day Levine made the first of
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-20/the-endless-shrimp-investigation">two
clarifications</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
First, though I described the exploit as ‚Äúfront-running the
front-runners,‚Äù I do want to be clear that it was not <i>just</i> that.
This is not a <i>pure</i> case of (1) submitting spoofy orders to bait
front-running bots, (2) having them take the bait and (3) finding some
trade to make them lose money. (There are
<a href="https://github.com/Defi-Cartel/salmonella">prior examples of
that</a>, using oddly structured tokens to make the front-runners lose
money.) Here, though, the brothers are accused of something closer to
hacking, exploiting a weakness in software code to be able to see (and
reorder) a series of transactions that was supposed to be kept
confidential from them. That <i>is</i> worse; it‚Äôs sort of like the
difference between (1) putting in spoof orders on the stock exchange to
try to trick a high-frequency trading firm and (2) hacking into the
stock exchange‚Äôs computer system to reverse the HFT firm‚Äôs trades. Even
if you think that the front-running bots are bad, you might ‚Äî as the
Justice Department does ‚Äî object to this approach to punishing them.
</blockquote>
Exactly. Levine‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-05-20/the-endless-shrimp-investigation">second
clarification was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Second, I said that ‚Äúthey exploited a bug in Ethereum‚Äù to do this, but
that‚Äôs not quite right. They exploited a bug in Flashbots‚Äô
<a href="https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-mev-boost/introduction">MEV-Boost</a>,
open-source block-building software
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/media/1351931/dl">that</a>
‚Äúapproximately 90% of Ethereum validators use‚Äù but that is not part of
the core Ethereum system itself. (Here is
<a href="https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540">Flashbots‚Äô
explanation</a>.) They exploited a bug in how blocks are normally built
and proposed on Ethereum. From the names ‚ÄúFlashbots‚Äù and ‚ÄúMEV-Boost,‚Äù
though, you might get some sense of why the case is controversial. The
way that blocks are normally built and proposed on Ethereum involves
‚Äúmaximal extractable value‚Äù (MEV), where arbitrage traders bid to pay
validators for priority to make the most profitable trades. These
brothers hacked <i>that</i> system, but not everyone likes that system,
because it involves predatory traders front-running more naive
traders.<br /> <br /> This is also important because, as one reader
commented: ‚ÄúA a crucial distinguishing factor here is that James and
Anton did not re-order committed transactions; they instead picked an
ordering of pending transactions that were favorable to them. Under this
lens, the integrity of the blockchain is not compromised; the network
explicitly ‚Äòallows‚Äô validators to pick whatever arbitrary ordering of
transactions they like; it‚Äôs just that generally it‚Äôs economically
favorable for validators to prioritize transactions which pay them the
most first.‚Äù
</blockquote>
Part of Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs genius in designing Bitcoin was that he
observed KISS, the important software mantra
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">Keep It Simple,
Stupid</a>. The Bitcoin blockchain does only one thing, maintain a
ledger of transactions. So it the Bitcoin ecosystem has evolved very
slowly, and has been remarkably free of vulnerabilities over the last
decade and a half. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a Turing-complete
environment that does whatever the users want it to. So over the last
less than a decade the Ethereum ecosystem has evolved much faster,
accreting complexity and thus vulnerabilities.<br /> <br /> Look at
Molly White‚Äôs <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/"><i>Web3 is
Going Just Great</i></a>. It is full of exploits of ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù
such as ‚Äúdecentralized exchanges‚Äù and ‚Äúbridges‚Äù. Try searching for
‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù. You only find it in the context of the amuonts raided. It is
precisely the fecundity of the Ethereum‚Äôs programmability that leads to
an ecosystem full of buggy code vulnerable to exploits such as the
MEV-Boost one.<br /> <br /> Daniel Kuhn‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-the-dojs-first-mev-lawsuit-means-for-ethereum/amp/"><i>What
the DOJ‚Äôs First MEV Lawsuit Means for Ethereum</i></a> also discusses
the details of the case:<br />
<blockquote>
‚ÄúThey used a flaw in MEV boost to push invalid signatures to preview
bundles. That gives an unfair advantage via an exploit,‚Äù former employee
of the Ethereum Foundation and Flashbots Hudson Jameson told CoinDesk in
an interview. Jameson added that the Peraire-Bueno brothers were also
running their own validator while extracting MEV, which violates
something of a gentleman‚Äôs agreement in MEV circles.<br /> <br /> ‚ÄúNo
one else in the MEV ecosystem was doing both of those things at once
that we know of,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThey did more than just play by both the
codified and pinky promise rules of MEV extraction.‚Äù
</blockquote>
The ‚Äúgentleman‚Äôs agreement‚Äù is important, because what the brothers were
doing creates a conflict of interest, the kind that the SEC frowns
upon.<br /> <br /> Kuhn quotes
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-the-dojs-first-mev-lawsuit-means-for-ethereum/amp/">Consensys
General Counsel Bill Hughes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
‚ÄúAll of the defendants‚Äô preparation for the attack and their completely
ham-fisted attempts to cover their tracks afterwards, including
extensive incriminating google searches, just helps the government prove
they intended to steal. All that evidence will look very bad to a jury.
I suspect they plead guilty at some point,‚Äù
</blockquote>
He also discusses a different
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-the-dojs-first-mev-lawsuit-means-for-ethereum/amp/">reaction
in the cryptosphere</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
MEV, which itself is controversial, can be a highly lucrative game
dominated by automated bots that often comes at blockchain users‚Äô
expense, which is partially why so many in the crypto community have
rushed to denounce the DOJ‚Äôs complaint.<br /> ‚Ä¶<br /> Still, others
remain convinced that exploiting MEV bots designed to reorder
transactions is fair game. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little hard to sympathize with MEV
bots and block builders getting f<em>cked over by block proposers, in
the exact same way they are f</em>cking over end users,‚Äù the anonymous
researcher said.
</blockquote>
Kuhn quotes
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/15/what-the-dojs-first-mev-lawsuit-means-for-ethereum/amp/">Hudson
Jameson</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Jameson, for his part, said the MEV is something the Ethereum community
should work to minimize on Ethereum, but that it‚Äôs a difficult problem
to solve. For now, the process is ‚Äúinevitable.‚Äù<br /> <br /> ‚ÄúUntil it
can be eliminated, let‚Äôs study it. Let‚Äôs illuminate it. Let‚Äôs minimize
it. And since it does exist, let‚Äôs make it as open as possible for
anyone to participate with the same rules,‚Äù he said.
</blockquote>
<p>Jameson is wrong in suggesting that MEV could be eliminated. It is a
consequence of the goal of decentralizing the system. Even the mechanism
in place for ‚Äúanyone to participate with the same rules‚Äù <i>requires a
trusted third party</i>.<br /> <br /></p>

role that the 12 jurors in NYC did. I‚Äôd love to see a requirement that
every moderator of a major news show in the US do jury duty for a couple

apply to news, not just justice. (Update:

<p>
I was thinking about writing a simple editor again. The
<a href="https://smallandnearlysilent.com/">Small and Nearly Silent</a>
web app by
<a class="account" href="https://tenforward.social/@eli_oat" title="@eli_oat@tenforward.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="eli_oat">@eli_oat</span></a> is beautiful
because it mixes text and line drawings. I often feel that I‚Äôd like a
simple path-based SVG-like drawing ability, like
<a href="https://akkartik.name/lines.html">lines</a>, by
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="akkartik">@akkartik</span></a>. Some lines,
some control points, some curves, filling stuff with patterns‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt
know whether I‚Äôd actually use it, but it‚Äôs alluring.
</p>
<p>
The whole <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">uxn</a>
ecosystem with many different small tools is also quite alluring.
Unfortunately, it‚Äôs also a bit hard to get into an existing ecosystem
like that. I still feel that if spent a while writing something myself,
it‚Äôd feel more like it was ‚Äúmine‚Äù. I‚Äôd just understand it better. I just
don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to spend that much time on it, or if I‚Äôd even be
able to pull it off. So that‚Äôs why I wavering at the same time that I‚Äôm
fascinated.
</p>
<p>
Given all that, I was thinking about Gforth and found
<a href="https://github.com/JeremiahCheatham/Gforth-SDL2-Bindings/">SDL2
Bindings for Gforth</a>, and I found the example
<a href="https://github.com/JeremiahCheatham/Yellow-Snow">Yellow
Snow</a> game using this library, I tried to compile it and Gforth
complained about the missing headers. No problem, I thought to myself. I
know what to do: <code>sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-dev
libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev</code> ‚Äì but the mixer results in
<a href="https://doc.sccode.org/">SuperCollider</a> getting deinstalled.
Oh no!
</p>
<p>
So now I‚Äôm once again thinking about the thing I actually want to do. Do
I want to build an Emacs light? A simple line-based text editor like
<code>ed</code> but with more features? An editor that only runs inside
a terminal, like <code>kilo</code> or <code>mini</code>? See
<a href="2018-03-12_Writing_an_Editor">2018-03-12 Writing an Editor</a>
for more. Or would it be an editor with a GUI? Would it work only with
X11? Or would it be based on SDL?
</p>
<p>
I feel like an editor with a minimal GUI would be nice. I don‚Äôt think I
need a menu, but I think I‚Äôd like a way to scale font size up and down,
UTF-8 support to write German and Portuguese, basically render Markdown
and some simple variant of SVG, inline. I feel like that‚Äôs why I need to
start with graphics and font support. Otherwise I‚Äôll end up with
something like <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~m15o/grid/">grid</a>: a cool
<a href="https://plan9.io/wiki/plan9/using_acme/index.html">ACME</a>-inspired

<strong>2024-06-04</strong>. Thinking about Go and the
<a href="https://github.com/hibiken/mini">mini</a> editor. It runs in a
terminal. So what would it take to turn it into a graphical editor with
fonts, ligatures, bidirectional text, font-sizes, and all of that?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/go-text/typesetting">go-text/typesetting</a>
is a library that‚Äôs used by <a href="https://fyne.io">Fyne</a>,
<a href="https://gioui.org">Gio</a>, and
<a href="https://ebitengine.org">Ebitengine</a>. So perhaps one of these
frameworks?
</p>
<p>
Fyne has a
<a href="https://apps.fyne.io/apps/com.fynelabs.notes.html">Notes</a>
example application. It looks like a nice, simple app. When I built it,
however, it didn‚Äôt work. Is it because I‚Äôm on Wayland? I don‚Äôt know.
</p>
<p>
Gio is used by <a href="https://anvil-editor.net/">Anvil</a>, an
ACME-like editor with many features. In fact, it already looks like it
has too many features for me to start building something. I wonder.
Perhaps those are the right features? I just can‚Äôt warm up to using the
mouse all that much.
</p>
<p>
Ebitengine has a
<a href="https://ebitengine.org/en/examples/font.html">Font</a> example.
It just shows how one loads a font for a number of code-points and
that‚Äôs that. An interesting way to load a font, for sure.

<p>In other words the designers of CSS and JavaScript and probably every
other technology everyone uses had no idea what actual developers were
doing with their committee-designed creation. They made mistakes and
piled them on each other, fixing old mistakes with new mistakes. After
30 years of evolving in this convoluted way, if you want to create
useful software, you have to either master all of it (and no one has) or
pay $20 a month to OpenAI so you can use it to navigate the awful
hairball that the web platform has become. Where we only have a sliver
of knowledge as humans, <i>the machine knows all of it.</i> And that‚Äôs
just programming. I‚Äôm just guessing that everything is that way. You

whole life using the stuff and you still only know a tiny fraction of
what you need to make good software. We needed what ChatGPT does, but we
didn‚Äôt know we needed it. That‚Äôs where we are now, and the journos are

<p>What got me spinning was listening to Rachel Maddow advertise her
podcast at the beginning of her show last night. You can get the podcast
for free, she says, or if you want no ads, you can pay some money and
get it from Apple. What Apple is selling there, and Maddow is going
along with, is not a freaking podcast and by calling it one they
undermine a great medium. I understand why Maddow might not care, she
makes millions from a medium that doesn‚Äôt give users much choice (ie
MSNBC) so why should she care about podcasting, which does.</p>

podcasting had a marketing team behind it, we‚Äôd run a campaign that says
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not podcasting if you don‚Äôt have choice.‚Äù If you have to use
Apple, Audible, Spotify or Google to listen to something, that‚Äôs nice,
hope it‚Äôs good for you, but folks that is not a podcast. Podcasts give
you the listener all the power. If you give it up it‚Äôll all be
Disneyfied before too long. It pisses me off that Amazon Music sends me
messages about all the new ‚Äúpodcasts‚Äù they have. I mutter under my
breath when I hear this, some expletive I‚Äôd rather not repeat. Amazon,
the users know that podcasting == user choice, and they hate you just a
little every time you lie about it. Find another term you like and use
that. You have the money to do the marketing. Come on, just once play
fair. You‚Äôll be surprised how good it feels, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised
if the users reward you for it.</p>

I delete the comments and change the permissions to only allow friends
to comment. <i>The journalists are wrong about ChatGPT.</i> I solve
problems with it. It guides me through difficult programming situations,
esp around convoluted designs like CSS and JavaScript. It knows all of
it. The only times it hallucinates (and I know it‚Äôs doing it btw, I‚Äôm
not stupid) is when there is not enough info on the web to give an
answer. It would be nice if it just said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù but it‚Äôs early,
and they haven‚Äôt figured out how to do that yet. The journalists have no
sense of wonder I guess, or they never thought to use it in their jobs.

‚ÄúAha! Now I see what this is for and it‚Äôs freaking lovely.‚Äù But they‚Äôve

Interesting
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/roboform-password-3-million-dollar-crypto-wallet/">story</a>
of breaking the security of the RoboForm password manager in order to
recover a cryptocurrency wallet password.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Grand and Bruno spent months reverse engineering the version of the
RoboForm program that they thought Michael had used in 2013 and found
that the pseudo-random number generator used to generate passwords in
that version‚Äî¬≠and subsequent versions until 2015¬≠‚Äîdid indeed have a
significant flaw that made the random number generator not so random.
The RoboForm program unwisely tied the random passwords it generated to
the date and time on the user‚Äôs computer¬≠‚Äîit determined the computer‚Äôs
date and time, and then generated passwords that were predictable. If
you knew the date and time and other parameters, you could compute any
password that would have been generated on a certain date and time in

<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">
2024-05-23 Death and dying
</h1>
<p>
This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am
old enough to be an adult about it.
</p>
<p>
One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in
Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at
the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see
my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn‚Äôt go
myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn‚Äôt
there for my sister‚Äôs burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours,
back then. I don‚Äôt know how things are now. There was school and stuff
and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn‚Äôt feel very
close. It just felt weird. I didn‚Äôt know what it was supposed to mean.
</p>
<p>
Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are
failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his
heart is failing; they can‚Äôt give him his heart medication because the
kidneys are at their limits, can‚Äôt have him move around because he‚Äôs
weak, and so he‚Äôs breaking down. I mean, he‚Äôs calm, he knows what‚Äôs
happening, and he‚Äôs very, very tired. He‚Äôs ready to go.
</p>
<p>
I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to
go one day. I don‚Äôt want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines.
I‚Äôll be very, very tired. I‚Äôll just want to go home. I also won‚Äôt want
anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I‚Äôll feel that I lived a good
life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were
decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will
be able to let go and be at peace. It‚Äôs what I hear about my stepfather.
</p>
<p>
But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and
Germany and my mother, and one after another people start crying,
choking up, it‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs that invisible choker, grabbing us, one
after another.
</p>
<p>
I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the
laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our
family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back
to haunt us, now.
</p>
<p>
To go and support each other.
</p>
<p>
Go and hug your loved ones.
</p>

<strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn‚Äôt look good at
all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping,
mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us,
saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The
doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes,
stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.
</p>
<p>
There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister,
my sister, my half-brother‚Äôs wife, their kid, my mom‚Ä¶ the kid was the
only one that seemed unperturbed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be sad, grandma!‚Äù

Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of
them super nice. We‚Äôll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not
feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it‚Äôs not my
partner that has died.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his
birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I‚Äôm happy we were all
there for each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on
the radio.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-05-30</strong>. On the way home. It was good to see the
family again. I gave a little speech in Portuguese, explaining how the
language continues to remain important to us, even if we live a abroad,
and how hard it was for a family where people live in different
countries, alone ‚Äì but also how our parents divorcing and marrying had
led to an ever growing family. There are more parents, more siblings,
and I love it and it helps. We can all help each other. And my deceased
stepfather was certainly an enrichment for our family, bringing anarchy
and lawlessness and laughter into a family that was rigid and regimented
and dour, and how we all grew with that and how it was important to
remember the good times we had and the lessons we all drew from his
presence. Truly, a great influence for all of us.
</p>
<p>
I still remember how I met him years before my mother met him. He lived
across the river alone with his son, wild and free and I was so jealous.
I wished to live like that! And then my parents divorced, my dad went
back to Switzerland and a year later I followed him and got to live wild
and free like them, it was amazing. And one day I came back and there
were rumours that our mother had found a boyfriend. Imagine my surprise
when it was him, the wild and free guitar playing dude from across the
river! And eventually my friend from school turned into my stepbrother,
moved in with my mom, lived in my room. It was mysterious and magical
and then to see him and his father struggle with my mom, the changes
they brought about, it was a miracle.
</p>
<p>
So, my man, wherever you are, here‚Äôs to you and your last trip, to your
guitars and flutes, your love of music and freedom, your spirit of
independence and love of people and aliens. Cheers! I hope to see you
again.

<p>The fallout from the New York jury‚Äôs conviction of Donald Trump on 34
felony counts last Thursday, May 30, continues. Trump‚Äôs team continues
to insist that the guilty verdict will help him, but that‚Äôs nonsensical
on its face: if guilty verdicts are so helpful, why has he moved heaven
and earth to keep the many other cases against him from going to trial?
And why are he and House speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) calling for the
Supreme Court to overturn the convictions?</p>

all the feeds I‚Äôm subscribed to in my client so I can follow it in my
feed reader. I‚Äôd really like it to go the other way, actually, so I
could maintain the list on my desktop computer, and have it
automatically reflected in the mobile podcast client. It‚Äôs very
important that it use OPML, that‚Äôs the standard for this stuff. I
couldn‚Äôt possibly get excited by another format. Podcasting thrives on
these standards. The client I use is

where they listen to their podcasts, and as long as that‚Äôs true they
will imho continue to have choice. But even if Google took it over
tomorrow, I‚Äôd be happy with the outcome. It‚Äôs been over 20 years since
we rolled it out, and it‚Äôs still delivering huge value to lots of
people, and isn‚Äôt controlled by anyone, as far as I can tell there are

for the messages that tell you to do this or that to keep using FSD. And
when I‚Äôm flipping the glasses down, my eyes are not on the road Mr or Ms

<p>We should apply mathematics to language design. The goal of the
language should be maximum simplicity for the human developer. As much
of the complexity as possible should be handled by software, either at
compile-time or runtime. It should strive to read like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>. We
started out writing code by toggling switches on the front panel of the
computer, and for a few decades we were factoring and making it simpler
with every iteration, but then we turned around in the other direction.
I am from the church of factoring. I do it in my designs of products at
all levels, and I treat languages with the same care. It turns out all
the rules of working on open systems also apply to language design. I
plan to write more about this.</p>

Technology was once simply a tool‚Äîand a small one at that‚Äîused to
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1940761.1940772">amplify
human intent and capacity</a>. That was the story of the industrial
revolution: we could control nature and build large, complex human
societies, and the more we employed and mastered technology, the better
things got. We don‚Äôt live in that world anymore. Not only has technology
become entangled with the structure of society, but we also can no
longer see the world around us without it. The separation is gone, and
the control we thought we once had has revealed itself as a mirage.
We‚Äôre in a transitional period of history right now‚Ä¶

Will Increase the Quantity‚Äîand Quality‚Äîof Phishing Scams</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, updated: 2024-06-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A piece I coauthored with Fredrik Heiding and Arun Vishwanath in the
<cite>Harvard Business Review</cite>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Summary. </strong>Gen AI tools are rapidly making these emails
more advanced, harder to spot, and significantly more dangerous. Recent
research showed that 60% of participants fell victim to artificial
intelligence (AI)-automated phishing, which is comparable to the success
rates of non-AI-phishing messages created by human experts. Companies
need to: 1) understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced
phishing, 2) determine the company or division‚Äôs phishing threat
severity level, and 3) confirm their current phishing awareness
routines‚Ä¶

The name is great. In German we call slow worms <em>Blindschleiche</em>,
a blind sneak. Saw one today on the forest road as I was jogging after
the rain.

people who say you get wrong answers from ChatGPT, if I wanted my car to
kill me I could drive into oncoming traffic. If I wanted my calculator
to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other
words, ChatGPT is a very new tool. It can be hard to control, you have
to check what it says, and try different questions. But the result, if
you pay attention and don‚Äôt drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that
you can do things you never could do before.</p>

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, the post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ansible.com/blog/upcoming-changes-to-the-awx-project/&quot;&gt;Upcoming Changes to the AWX Project&lt;/a&gt; came across my feed. An innocuous title, but sometimes community-impacting changes are buried in posts like this. So, as an interested Ansible user, I read through the post.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
In 1,610 words, almost nothing of substance was written.
</p>
<p>
A lot about how it‚Äôs not 2014 anymore, so 2014-era architecture doesn‚Äôt
suit AWX. Then a big bold disclaimer at the bottom:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Before we conclude, we should be clear about what will not happen.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We are not changing the Ansible project
</li>
<li>
We are not adjusting our OSS license structure
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ultimately, we need to make some changes to the way our systems work and
our projects are structured. Not a rewrite but a refactoring and
restructuring of how some of the core components connect and communicate
with each other.

worked because for a while Adam did my job, and for a while I did his.
That guaranteed two things ‚Äì that the technology would be maximally
simple, and that anyone with a computer could do the whole recording and
production job without help from an expensive studio. In both cases the
result was nowhere near commercial standards, but that didn‚Äôt matter, in

<p>Today, as MAGA Republicans attack the rule of law and promise to
prosecute their political enemies if they get back into power, it‚Äôs easy
to forget that once upon a time, certain Republican politicians
championed reason and compromise and took a stand against MAGAs‚Äô
predecessors. On June 1, 1950, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a
Republican from Maine, stood up against Republican Senator Joe McCarthy
of Wisconsin and his supporters, who were undermining American democracy
in a crusade against ‚Äúcommunism.‚Äù</p>
