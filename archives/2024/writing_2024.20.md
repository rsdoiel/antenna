## How Much Should You Write Each Day; and When Should You Stop Writing?

date: 2024-05-15, from: Literature & a Latte blog


    
        
            
                <p>When you&rsquo;re writing a novel or another long work, it&rsquo;s like running a marathon, not a sprint. You won&rsquo;t finish it in a few days or a week, and you have to work at a rhythm that allows you to remain creative and achieve the appropriate word count over time. Slow and steady writing will eventually get you to your goal.</p>

How much should you write each day?

<p>If possible, it&rsquo;s a good idea to write every day, even if you can&rsquo;t write very much each day. You can set a target, which isn&rsquo;t a hard goal, but which is something to aim for. Some writers are happy with 500 words a day, others with 1,000 words, and some, who write full time, may even strive to write 2,000 words a day. If you do the math, even if you only write five 500 words a day, that comes to 130,000 words in a year. That means you can write the first draft of a novel - with room to spare - in twelve months, if you remain consistent.</p>

<p>Many writers can&rsquo;t write every day, so they set aside a couple of days a week to write. If you plan to write 1,000 words a day for two full days a week, that&rsquo;s more than 100,000 words a year. The key is consistency and maintaining your momentum.</p>

<p>How do you decide how many words to write a day? A lot depends on how experienced you are, and what your writing rhythm is. In <em>On Writing</em>, Stephen King says, &ldquo;As with physical exercise, it would be best to set this goal low at first, to avoid discouragement. I suggest a thousand words a day, and because I&rsquo;m feeling magnanimous, I&rsquo;ll also suggest that you can take one day a week off, at least to begin with. No more; you&rsquo;ll lose the urgency and immediacy of your story if you do.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Anthony Trollope had a day job at the General Post Office, but <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/anthony-trollope/trollope-autobiography/15/" target="_blank">he would write before going to work</a>. &ldquo;It was my practice to be at my table every morning at 5.30; and it was also my practice to allow myself no mercy. [...] It had at this time become my custom, and it still is my custom, though of late I have become a little lenient to myself, to write with my watch before me, and to require from myself 250 words every quarter of an hour.&ldquo; This meant that he could write up to 3,000 words each morning, and this is how he wrote dozens of novels and other works.</p>

<p>Scrivener <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/track-statistics-and-targets-in-your-scrivener-projects" target="_blank">has useful tools to help you set and meet targets</a>. You can view the word count of your current document in the app&rsquo;s footer, and you can view the total word count of your project by hovering your cursor over the Quick Search box in the toolbar.</p>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/statistics-and-targets/stats-top.png" width="412" /></figure>

<p>You can also get detailed statistics of your project by choosing Project &gt; Statistics:</p>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/statistics-and-targets/stats-full.png" width="490" /></figure>

<p>And you can set and view targets for each writing session, and for your overall project.</p>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/assets/image/blog/article/statistics-and-targets/targets.png" width="555" /></figure>

When should you end your writing sessions?

<p>So when should you stop writing? Should you set an alarm, time yourself, or write precisely for one or two hours? If your target is a word count, should you stop once you hit that number, or keep going if you feel the juices flowing?</p>

<p>Some writers push on to reach their daily sessions, but this can be counterproductive. When you&rsquo;ve lost your mojo, there&rsquo;s no point trying to force it. Sometimes, you just can&rsquo;t meet your target.</p>

<p>Other writers may choose to end their writing session when they finish the chapter or a scene. The fact of completing something, even if you haven&rsquo;t hit your session target, can be very satisfying.</p>

<p>However, some other writers like to end their writing session in the middle of a scene, paragraph, or even a sentence. <a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/1935/10/1/monologue-to-the-maestro" target="_blank">Ernest Hemingway said</a>, &ldquo;The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day &hellip; you will never be stuck.&ldquo;</p>

<p>And consider Anthony Trollope, who, if he finished a novel by 8:30 would immediately start writing the next one. This is probably not practical for most writers who need to work on multiple drafts to finish a novel. Trollope was immensely prolific, and, in his time, novels were not revised extensively, so he could easily move on to the next one at will.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s up to each writer to determine how much they should write and when they should end. Many factors influence this decision: how much time you have to write, how many days you can write, and what your writing goals are. It&#39;s a good idea to develop a rhythm, and you can take advantage of Scrivener&rsquo;s features to set session and project targets to help you meet your goals.</p>
