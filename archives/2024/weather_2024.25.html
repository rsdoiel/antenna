Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Fri Jun 21 2024

Valid 211300Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE NORTHERN
HIGH PLAINS TO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND OVER THE FOUR
CORNERS REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are expected from parts of the
northern High Plains into the upper Mississippi Valley, mainly this
afternoon and evening. Scattered strong/severe thunderstorms are
also possible across the Four Corners vicinity. A few strong storms
may occur from parts of the lower Great Lakes to southern New
England.

...Northern High Plains...
A shortwave trough will shift eastward from the Canadian Rockies
toward Saskatchewan, with southeasterly low-level flow deep into
Montana ahead of this shortwave trough. Relatively strong (40 kt)
mid-level flow will develop across central Montana as the upper
ridge flattens. Scattered robust convection should easily develop
within a flow regime favorable for supercells. Forecast soundings,
especially for central Montana, exhibit favorable deep-layer shear
with strong buoyancy and relatively low cloud bases. Scattered
supercells should evolve by early afternoon then propagate
southeastward along the instability axis toward
eastern/south-central Montana through early evening. Very large hail
and gusty winds are expected along with some tornado risk.

...Middle Missouri Valley/Siouxland to Upper Mississippi Valley...
Scattered thunderstorms persist this morning regionally in vicinity
of the convectively modified frontal zone. A mid-level impulse over
Colorado/southeast Wyoming this morning will reach the Siouxland by
late afternoon and early evening, all while a south-southwesterly
low-level jet markedly intensifies after sunset. Strong diurnal
heating south of the boundary will ease CINH across the warm sector
and scattered storms are expected to develop and intensify. Updrafts
may initially develop along the cool side of the boundary but with
time surface-based storms are expected. Hail, wind, and perhaps a
couple tornadoes can be expected with supercells occurring near the
front.

...Four Corners Region...
A seasonally high PW plume will advance into the Four Corners region
as a low-latitude shortwave trough over southern California/Nevada
ejects over the Great Basin, strengthening mid-level flow across
southern Utah into southwestern Colorado. Sustained multicells and
some supercells should develop along the southern fringe of this
shortwave trough, where strong shear will support organized
longer-lived updrafts. Large hail and strong/gusty winds can be
expected, and some tornado risk may exist as well.

...Lower Great Lakes to southern New England...
Strong boundary-layer heating will once again occur across the lower
Great Lakes region into portions of southern New England, with a
southward-shifting front focusing scattered convection into
early/mid-afternoon. Within a moderately unstable environment,
localized wind damage will be the primary concern with the strongest
storms his afternoon through around sunset.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0346 AM CDT Fri Jun 21 2024

Valid 241200Z - 291200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...D4/Monday: Northern Plains into the upper MS Valley/Great
Lakes...
A mid/upper-level shortwave trough and deepening surface low are
forecast to move across parts of SK/MB on Monday. A surface trough
will extend southward from the low into the northern Great Plains,
with secondary surface low development possible across the Dakotas.
A warm front will move northeastward somewhere from the eastern
Dakotas into the upper MS Valley. Strong buoyancy is forecast to
develop near and to the south/west of the warm front, with favorable
deep-layer shear providing a conditionally favorable environment for
severe thunderstorms. 

While some severe potential appears likely to evolve somewhere from
the northern Plains into the upper MS Valley and/or upper Great
Lakes, guidance varies regarding the position of the warm front, and
also the southern extent of height falls and large-scale ascent
attendant to the SK/MB shortwave trough. Much of the warm sector
will likely remain capped, but severe storm development will be
possible in closer proximity to the warm front and secondary surface
low, which could potentially grow upscale and move southeastward
along the instability gradient. Severe probabilities will likely be
needed once confidence increases regarding the placement of the
primary surface features. 

...D5/Tuesday: Upper Midwest into the central/southern Plains...
The shortwave trough that moves across parts of SK/MB on Monday is
generally forecast to move east-southeastward on Tuesday across
parts of ON and the upper Great Lakes. Model spread regarding the
timing and track of this shortwave continues to increase at this
time range, and the potential for MCS development on D4/Monday
further reduces predictability regarding the severe threat on
Tuesday. However, some severe-thunderstorm potential may evolve
along a southeastward moving cold front from the Great Lakes/upper
Midwest into parts of the central/southern Great Plains. 

...D6/Wednesday - D8/Friday...
Some threat for strong to severe thunderstorms could continue to
accompany a southeastward-moving cold front on D6/Wednesday from the
southern Plains into the Ohio Valley and Northeast, though
predictability remains low regarding the details at this time range.

By D7/Thursday into D8/Friday, extended-range guidance generally
suggests the potential for a mid/upper-level shortwave trough to
move across the northern Rockies toward the northern High Plains.
However, model spread remains rather high regarding the evolution of
moisture return and any increasing severe potential in association
with this system.

Mesoscale Discussion 1300
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0844 AM CDT Mon Jun 17 2024

Areas affected...Eastern NE

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 171344Z - 171545Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail is possible across eastern Nebraska
over the next hour or two. Limited severe coverage will likely
preclude the need for a watch, but convective trends will be
monitored closely.

DISCUSSION...Regional radar imagery has shown an increase in
thunderstorms along a north-south line from the OFK vicinity
southward to around 20 miles southeast of HSI. Surface analysis
reveals a warm front across southern NE, with this new development
likely a result of warm-air advection across this frontal zone.
Moderate elevated buoyancy is in place ahead of this line, with
mesoanalysis estimation MUCAPE around 2000 J/kg. This elevated
buoyancy will likely persist throughout the remainder of the
morning, but the low-level jet is expected to gradually weaken. As a
result, the general expectation is that this line will gradually
diminish in intensity over the next few hours. Even so, sporadic
intensification of the updrafts within this line is possible, with
large hail as the primary severe risk. A strong gust or two is also
possible given the modest low-level stability. Given the anticipated
weakening of these storms, a watch is not currently expected, but
convective trends will still be monitored closely.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024

Valid 162000Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND
MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms appear possible across parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley late this afternoon, with additional storms
likely tonight across the north-central Plains to upper Mississippi
Valley. Large hail and damaging winds are the primary risks. A small
bowing complex, with mainly a severe/damaging wind threat, will
continue across parts of northern Illinois and vicinity this
afternoon.

...20Z Update...

...Northern Illinois/Southern Wisconsin...
A well-defined, compact MCV continues to move northeastward along
the central/northern IA/IL border. Several strong to severe gusts
were measured along the outflow associated with thunderstorm
generated by this vorticity max over the past hour. Ample low-level
moisture and buoyancy exists downstream across northern IL and far
southern WI, which will likely support the development of additional
storms along the outflow. As a result, the potential for strong to
severe gusts is expected to extend into the area this afternoon, and
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #424 was recently issued to address this
threat.

...Northern/Central MN into northern WI/western Upper MI...
A cold front continues to push eastward across western MN this
afternoon. Downstream destabilization has been mitigated by abundant
cloud cover thus far, but continued low-level moisture advection is
still expected to help remove the remaining convective inhibition
over the next few hours. As such, development along the front as it
continues eastward still appears possible this afternoon. Large hail
and damaging gusts are the primary risks, but a tornado or two is
possible if more discrete, cellular activity is realized.

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest/Upper MS Valley...
Recent surface analysis places a low over northeast CO and another
low over west-central MN. Boundary between these two lows has
recently started pushing back northward/northeastward as a warm
front, particularly from southwest into south-central NE. Increasing
cumulus across eastern CO continues to suggest that some
surface-based development may occur later this afternoon, but the
higher coverage is still expected north of the warm front tonight
across northern NE and southern SD amid warm-air advection supported
by a strengthening low-level jet. Large hail remains the primary
severe risk with this elevated development, but isolated damaging
gusts are possible as well, particularly if storms occur in close
proximity to the warm front.

...Elsewhere...
Isolated thunderstorms are still possible along the lee trough
extending from the northeast CO low through the southern High
Plains. Moderate instability and a deeply mixed boundary layer
should support an isolated threat for strong to severe downbursts.
Numerous thunderstorms are also expected to continue across the
central Gulf Coast as tropical moisture continues to advect
northward into the region ahead of a tropical wave. Weak shear
should keep any severe potential very isolated, but a few strong
water-loaded downbursts are possible.

..Mosier.. 06/16/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024/

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest/Upper Mississippi
Valley...
A strong upper trough/low will continue advancing east-northeastward
across the northern Plains and Canadian Prairie provinces today.
While the primary surface low is expected to remain in central
Canada, a weak secondary low should develop generally eastward
across MN through this evening in tandem with a cold front. Warm
mid-level temperatures associated with a cap should tend to inhibit
robust convective development for at least a few more hours into the
early afternoon. But, most guidance now does show thunderstorm
initiation occurring along the front in northern MN by 20-22Z. There
are still concerns/uncertainty with how many intense thunderstorms
will be able to form given fairly prevalent cloudiness that should
temper daytime heating to some extent. Still, strong deep-layer
shear and steepening mid-level lapse rates atop a gradually
destabilizing low-level airmass should support a threat for
supercells and large hail. Some guidance suggests a fairly quick
progression to a MCS, which seems reasonable given the linear
forcing of the cold front. If this occurs, then a severe/damaging
wind threat may persist through the evening into parts of northern
WI and the U.P. of MI. Enough low-level shear is also forecast to
support low-level updraft rotation and a tornado or two across this
region.

A separate area of intense thunderstorm development is possible late
this afternoon and early evening along the trailing portion of the
cold front in NE/northwest KS and vicinity. If convection can
initiate along this boundary, strong instability and modest
deep-layer shear would support a threat for mainly multicells posing
a risk for severe winds given the well mixed boundary layer
forecast. Some hail could also occur with marginal supercell
structures. The Slight Risk has been expanded southward across the
central Plains to account for this scenario. Otherwise, scattered to
numerous elevated thunderstorms are still expected to develop this
evening and overnight generally north of the front from eastern WY
into NE/SD and southern MN. A strengthening low-level jet in this
time frame across these regions and ample deep-layer shear/MUCAPE
will easily support supercells and a hail threat with initial
development. But, convective mode may quickly become messy, with one
or more bows/clusters possible as thunderstorms move eastward across
the upper MS Valley overnight. Even though this activity should tend
to remain elevated, an isolated severe/damaging wind threat may
persist given the strong MUCAPE forecast. 

...Northern Illinois/Southern Wisconsin...
A well defined MCV remains evident on visible satellite and radar
imagery late this morning over northeast MO and southern IA. This
feature should continue to track northeastward this afternoon and
evening in the modest southwesterly mid-level flow regime across the
mid MS Valley/Midwest. Ample daytime heating of a moist low-level
airmass should support around 1500-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE by mid
afternoon across northern IL and vicinity. Ascent associated with
the MCV and its associated mid-level vorticity maximum will likely
encourage the development of isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms by 20-22Z. Modest but sufficient deep-layer shear for
updraft organization is indicated in various RAP forecast soundings
across this region. Scattered severe/damaging winds, along with
isolated hail, could occur with a small bowing complex that may
develop and move east-northeastward across the Chicago metro area
late this afternoon and early evening. Enough low-level shear is
also forecast to support a low chance for a tornado or two. Given
recent guidance and observational trends, a small Slight Risk has
been added across northern IL/southern WI to account for this
scenario.

...Southern High Plains...
Isolated/widely spaced thunderstorms should form once again this
afternoon along the length of a surface lee trough/dryline extending
southward across the southern High Plains. Although deep-layer shear
is forecast to remain weak, moderate instability and a well-mixed
boundary layer should support an isolated threat for severe
downdraft winds. Occasional hail may also occur with the more robust
cores before convection weakens after sunset.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 424
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
215 PM CDT Sun Jun 16 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Eastern Iowa
  Northern Illinois
  Far Northwest Indiana
  Southern Wisconsin
  Lake Michigan

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 215 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A small bowing cluster of thunderstorms should continue to
increase in size and intensity this afternoon as it spreads
east-northeastward across northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin.
Severe/damaging winds around 60-70 mph should be the main threat,
but isolated hail up to 1-1.5 inches in diameter and a brief tornado
also appear possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 65
statute miles north and south of a line from 65 miles west southwest
of Rockford IL to 50 miles north of Valparaiso IN. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
25035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1278
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0658 PM CDT Sat Jun 15 2024

Areas affected...Northwest MO into western/central IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 152358Z - 160130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A threat for damaging wind, isolated hail, and possibly a
tornado or two will spread eastward this evening. Watch issuance is
likely.

DISCUSSION...A storm cluster is gradually increasing in size across
northeast KS into southeast NE, as the northern portion of a smaller
cluster that developed earlier over central KS begins to merge with
ongoing storms across southeast NE. Moderate downstream buoyancy and
marginally sufficient deep-layer shear will continue to support
organized convection through the evening, and the ongoing storm
cluster is expected to move into parts of northwest MO and
southwest/central IA with time. 

With a linear mode already established, damaging winds may be the
most likely hazard as storms progress east-northeastward this
evening. However, rather strong low-level shear/SRH (as noted on
regional VWPs) will also support potential for a tornado or two.
Downstream watch issuance is likely between 7-8 PM CDT if trends
continue to support a severe threat this evening into northwest MO
and southwest/central IA.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 420
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
355 PM MDT Sat Jun 15 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Montana

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 355 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 85
    mph likely
  Isolated very large hail events to 2 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...An intensifying broken band of thunderstorms is forecast
to grow upscale into a squall line this afternoon and into the
evening across the Watch area.  Severe gusts (60-85 mph) will be the
primary hazard with the band of storms.  Large hail may accompany
any more discrete storm on the south flank of the evolving
thunderstorm activity during the evening, as well as perhaps a brief
risk for a tornado.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 95
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles north northeast
of Glasgow MT to 35 miles south southwest of Miles City MT. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 417...WW 418...WW 419...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 75 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 450. Mean storm motion vector
