**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

One of the flaws in the design of Teslas is they are really difficult to operate safely for people who are farsighted, such as myself. A lot of the status messages are too small for me to read without reading glasses, and in the time it takes to put them on the message is gone. Esp frustrating for the messages that tell you to do this or that to keep using FSD. And when I'm flipping the glasses down, my eyes are not on the road Mr or Ms Tesla. This is a design problem. Maybe you should use voice prompts for this kind of stuff. Or use a camera to see if my hands are on the wheel.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/02/librarian.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I keep coming back to this -- ChatGPT is a vast library that comes with its own librarian. And the librarian has read and digested all of it, and can give you useful and usually exactly right summaries (despite what the critics say) in an instant. I've been using libraries my whole life, going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on that timeline and you'll see its significance. You didn't write it, I didn't. Each of us may have contributed a little, and <i>isn't that what we want?</i> To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn't get more meaningful than this.

Another great application for ChatGPT. Try to find a blog post or article about the design of a language that gets to what you want to know without wading through a lot of stuff you don't care about. I got it to explain Swift, Go and Rust quickly. Okay now I know what they're doing. It would have taken me days before to assemble this, and I never have that kind of time for such execursions.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

We should apply mathematics to language design. The goal of the language should be maximum simplicity for the human developer. As much of the complexity as possible should be handled by software, either at compiletime or runtime. It should read like pseudocode. I want to write about this. We should study languages for the real reason we use them. We started out writing code by toggling switches on the front panel of the computer, and for a few decades we were factoring but then we turned around in the other direction. I am from the church of factoring. I do it in my designs of products at all levels, and I treat languages with the same care. It turns out all the rules of working on open systems also apply to language design. I plan to write more about this.

## Seeing Like a Data Structure

date: 2024-06-03, updated: 2024-05-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Technology was once simply a tool&#8212;and a small one at that&#8212;used to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1940761.1940772">amplify human intent and capacity</a>. That was the story of the industrial revolution: we could control nature and build large, complex human societies, and the more we employed and mastered technology, the better things got. We don&#8217;t live in that world anymore. Not only has technology become entangled with the structure of society, but we also can no longer see the world around us without it. The separation is gone, and the control we thought we once had has revealed itself as a mirage. We&#8217;re in a transitional period of history right now...</p>

## AI Will Increase the Quantity—and Quality—of Phishing Scams

date: 2024-06-03, updated: 2024-06-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A piece I coauthored with Fredrik Heiding and Arun Vishwanath in the <cite>Harvard Business Review</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Summary. </strong>Gen AI tools are rapidly making these emails more advanced, harder to spot, and significantly more dangerous. Recent research showed that 60% of participants fell victim to artificial intelligence (AI)-automated phishing, which is comparable to the success rates of non-AI-phishing messages created by human experts. Companies need to: 1) understand the asymmetrical capabilities of AI-enhanced phishing, 2) determine the company or division’s phishing threat severity level, and 3) confirm their current phishing awareness routines...</p></blockquote>

## 2024-06-02 Slow worm

date: 2024-06-03, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-02-slow-worm">2024-06-02 Slow worm</h1>

<p>The name is great. In German we call slow worms <em>Blindschleiche</em>, a blind sneak. Saw one today on the forest road as I was jogging after the rain.</p>

<p>It was a small one, but unafraid!</p>

<p>The sandals you see in the picture above are my running sandals.
See <a href="2015-08-27_Luna_Sandals_Review_by_Benjamin_Baugh">a review by Benjamin Baugh</a> from nearly 10 years ago.</p>

<p>I was running through the forest on the hill behind us:</p>

<p>This map from 1925 shows all the land between the river and the forest that used to be agriculture and now it&rsquo;s mostly just the city…</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If I wanted my calculator to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other words, ChatGPT is a very new tool. It can be hard to control, you have to check what it says, and try different questions. But the result, if you pay attention and don't drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that you can do things you never could do before.

## Saying a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX

date: 2024-06-02, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Saying a lot while saying nothing at all about Ansible AWX</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few days ago, the post <a href="https://www.ansible.com/blog/upcoming-changes-to-the-awx-project/">Upcoming Changes to the AWX Project</a> came across my feed. An innocuous title, but sometimes community-impacting changes are buried in posts like this. So, as an interested Ansible user, I read through the post.</p>

<p>In 1,610 words, almost nothing of substance was written.</p>

<p>A lot about how it's not 2014 anymore, so 2014-era architecture doesn't suit AWX. Then a big bold disclaimer at the bottom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we conclude, we should be clear about what will not happen.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>We are not changing the Ansible project</li>
  <li>We are not adjusting our OSS license structure</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Ultimately, we need to make some changes to the way our systems work and our projects are structured. Not a rewrite but a refactoring and restructuring of how some of the core components connect and communicate with each other.</p></blockquote></div>

## I have a beef with “content”

Apple, really stepped into it, when it made an iPad advertisement that essentially showed all creativity (and creative effort) being crushed and compacted into a thin piece of glass. It was a tone-deaf move from a company, that has always relied on (and portrayed itself as an ally of creatives. Last week, Daniel Ek, chief &#8230;

I bet you could do a beautifully readable blog by just dynamically rendering its RSS feed.  Why bother statically rendering the home page, month page, day page or pages for each individual post. Dynamic servers are so cheap these days.

Ken Smith pointed out the story in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/31/123255.html#a125308">very last postscript</a>. Before that, I hadn't put it together that podcasting worked because for a while Adam did my job, and for a while I did his. That guaranteed two things -- that the technology would be maximally simple, and that anyone with a computer could do the whole recording and production job without help from an expensive studio. In both cases the result was nowhere near commercial standards, but that didn't matter, in fact it helped that there were so many glitches in my early podcasts, that said that hey if this guy can do it, so can I.

Today, as MAGA Republicans attack the rule of law and promise to prosecute their political enemies if they get back into power, it&#8217;s easy to forget that once upon a time, certain Republican politicians championed reason and compromise and took a stand against MAGAs&#8217; predecessors. On June 1, 1950, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, a Republican from Maine, stood up against Republican Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin and his supporters, who were undermining American democracy in a crusade against &#8220;communism.&#8221;
