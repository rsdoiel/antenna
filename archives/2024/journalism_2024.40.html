<p>Big Ten opportunities come with big-time travel. With a quick

<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated Oct. 5 at 9:40 p.m.</em> A switch seems to
flip in the Bruin locker room at halftime. In fact, the team’s season
could be defined by a cycle of two clashing stories.  One half almost
silences naysayers, the other forces the crowd to seek the nearest exit
– consistency has been a fleeting ghost.  This time, with a dreamy first
half and nightmarish second, UCLA football (1-4, 0-3 Big Ten) was bowled
over by No. </p>

Take: The declining popularity of girl groups in Western music harms

<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Contemporary pop hits have sounded hollower without the regular
inclusion of girl groups in the Western musical landscape. Even as this
summer featured the explosion in popularity of several female artists
from Sabrina Carpenter to Chappell Roan – while others such as Charli
xcx experienced a resurgence in mainstream attention – the music
industry’s ever-evolving ecosystem remains strangely absent of female
groups.</p>
