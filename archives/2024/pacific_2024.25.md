## OPINION ǀ The scales of justice — should Trump be sentenced to jail?

date: 2024-06-17, updated: 2024-06-18, from: Marianas Variety

A JURY of twelve in New York City found Donald Trump guilty of 34 felony counts related to falsifying documents for a criminal purpose. His sentencing will occur on July 11, 2024. Judge Merchan will make the decision and he will make that decision only after he gets and considers a pre-sentence report, and hears from both the prosecution and defense about their positions on the sentence. We have to wait for the actual decision.
