## Trump, Biden and CNN prepare for a hostile debate (with muted mics)

date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>There will be no opening statements. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will each have two minutes to answer questions &#8212; followed by one-minute rebuttals and responses to the rebuttals. Red lights visible to the candidates will flash when they have five seconds left, and turn solid red when time has expired. And each man&#8217;s microphone will be muted when it is not his turn to speak.</p>

## Volcano Watch: A decade later, remembering the Pahoa lava flow crisis

date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Over the past few years, eruptions of Kilauea volcano on the Island of Hawaii have happened in remote regions and lava flows have not directly threatened communities. However, the approaching anniversary of a lava flow crisis a decade ago reminds us that eruptions on Kilauea have the potential to cause damage and island-wide disruption.</p>

## Irwin: Islands of Opportunity in the Pacific

date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Like many people from Hawaii Island, I was privileged to attend a small part of the 13th Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture, or FestPAC. The energy in the convention center, the range of engaging performances and displays, the diversity of people in Honolulu, all combined for an amazing experience even if I could only attend for a couple of hours.</p>

## Steves: ‘It feels like a new morning in Belfast’

date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Belfast, Northern Ireland&#8217;s capital city, is perhaps best known for the sectarian strife that took place here during the era of the Troubles, and as the birthplace of the Titanic (and many other ships that didn&#8217;t sink). While these two claims to fame aren&#8217;t too uplifting, Belfast&#8217;s story is hardly a downer. This unsinkable city, just two hours away from Dublin by train, makes for a fascinating day trip.</p>

## Supreme Court isn’t above other branches

date: 2024-06-16, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Speaking freely at a glitzy Supreme Court Historical Society event earlier this month, Justice Samuel Alito pointed out that there are &#8220;fundamental things that really can&#8217;t be compromised&#8221; in society, and speculated that &#8220;one side or the other is going to win.&#8221; The comments were recorded by a documentarian who had attended the events and surreptitiously recorded the justices as they increasingly find themselves under the microscope for tossing precedent overboard and embarking on ideologically rigid right-wing path.</p>
