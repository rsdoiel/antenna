<p><strong>WASHINGTON&nbsp;— </strong>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) today announced its <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-19478/environmental-impact-statements-availability-etc-utility-scale-solar-energy-development-and-proposed">proposed roadmap</a> for solar energy development on public lands, designed to expand efficient and environmentally responsible solar project permitting on public lands across the West.&nbsp;Today’s release of the Final Utility-Scale Solar Energy Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement and Proposed Resource Management Plan Amendments (also known as the proposed updated Western Solar Plan), comes as the Biden-Harris administration releases new data to demonstrate how it has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-releases-permitting-action-plan-to-accelerate-and-deliver-infrastructure-projects-on-time-on-task-and-on-budget/">improved federal permitting processes</a> to help deliver more projects, more efficiently, across the United States.</p>

<p>The proposed Western Solar Plan builds on President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, which is working to transition the nation to clean energy, lower energy costs for consumers, create good-paying union jobs, tackle the climate crisis, and advance clean air and environmental justice priorities, with the goal of achieving a 100-percent clean electricity grid by 2035. Earlier this year, BLM <a href="https://www.blm.gov/press-release/biden-harris-administration-delivers-historic-milestones-new-actions-clean-energy">surpassed the goal</a> of permitting more than 25 gigawatts of clean energy projects on public lands, and the updated Western Solar Plan will support continued progress on responsible permitting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The updated Western Solar Plan will help build modern, resilient energy infrastructure that creates a strong clean energy economy and protects our communities from the worsening impacts of climate change,” said <strong>Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management Dr. Steve Feldgus.</strong> “Through extensive planning and collaboration, we’re not only protecting our public lands but also ensuring that permitting for solar projects moves faster and more efficiently, avoiding conflicts and striking the right balance as we advance clean energy and safeguard the environment.”</p>

<p>Developed with substantial public input, the proposed updated <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2022371/510">Western Solar Plan</a> will guide BLM’s management of solar energy proposals and projects on public lands.&nbsp;It would make over 31 million acres of public lands across 11 western states available for potential solar development, driving development closer to transmission lines or on previously disturbed lands and avoiding protected lands, sensitive cultural resources and important wildlife habitat.</p>

<p>Steering project proposals away from areas where they may conflict with other resources or uses will help ensure responsible development, speed the permitting process, and provide greater predictability to the solar energy industry. The plan updates and expands the original 2012 Western Solar Plan in order to reflect changes in technology and meet the higher demand for solar energy development. This plan analyzes five additional western states (Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming), in addition to the six states analyzed in the original plan.</p>

<p>“The updated Western Solar Plan is a responsible, pragmatic strategy for developing solar energy on our nation’s public lands that supports national clean energy goals and long-term national energy security,” said&nbsp;<strong>BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning.</strong> “It will drive responsible solar development to locations with fewer potential conflicts while helping the nation transition to a clean energy economy, furthering the BLM’s mission to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>No solar developments are authorized through this planning effort; proposed projects will still undergo site-specific environmental review and public comment. This Final Utility-Scale Solar Energy Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement follows a draft published in January 2024 for public comment, with input from a wide range of stakeholders helping BLM to make additional updates that will help protect wildlife habitats and migration corridors and other key resources, while providing clarity to industry about low-conflict areas and project design approaches to guide responsible development.</p>

<p>To date, the Biden-Harris administration has approved 40 renewable energy projects on public lands (9 solar, 13 geothermal, and 18 gen-ties) allowing for early achievement of the goal to permit 25 gigawatts by 2025. In total, BLM has now permitted clean energy projects on public lands with a total capacity of approximately 29 gigawatts of power – enough to power over 12 million homes. This year BLM also issued a final Renewable Energy Rule that will lower consumer energy costs and the cost of developing solar and wind projects, improve project application processes, and incentivize developers to continue responsibly developing solar and wind projects on public lands.</p>

<p>Publication of the Final Utility-Scale Solar Energy Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement and Proposed Resource Management Plan Amendments initiates a 30-day protest period and 60-day governor’s consistency review. Following resolution of any remaining issues identified in this phase, the BLM will publish the Record of Decision and Final Resource Management Plan Amendments.</p>

<p>For more information on the updated Western Solar Plan, visit the project’s National NEPA Project Register (ePlanning) website at <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2022371/510">https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2022371/510</a>.</p>

<p>BARSTOW, CA. – <a name="_Hlk160197126">The Bureau of Land Management is seeking public comment on a proposed land sale of approximately 30 acres of public lands located in San Bernardino County to </a><a name="_Hlk160562469">Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway</a>. The <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-19256.pdf">Notice of Realty Action</a> will publish in the Federal Register on Wednesday, August 28, to begin a public comment period that will close Oct. 15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway has proposed to use the land for the <a href="https://bnsfbig.com/">Barstow International Gateway</a> project, an approximately 4,500-acre integrated rail facility that would transfer goods from international to domestic containers. The proposed project would result in a more than $1.5 billion investment in the community, potentially creating more than 20,000 new jobs and helping to address logistics and supply chain issues. If approved, the Barstow International Gateway project is expected to also help reduce freeway congestion around the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.</p>

<p>The public land proposed for sale is suitable for private sale since it is surrounded by private lands and provides no public access. As such, there would be no impacts to public land access or recreation. If approved, the public lands would be sold to Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway at fair market value.</p>

<p>Anyone interested reviewing the environmental assessment, the appraisal, or maps, may visit the <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2033900/510">BLM National NEPA Register</a>, or visit the BLM Barstow Field Office, 2601 Barstow Road in Barstow, CA 92311, during business hours 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., five days a week, excluding federal holidays. The public may contact the office at 760-252-6000 to make visitation arrangements.</p>

<p>Written comments should be sent to Bureau of Land Management, Barstow Field Office, ATTN: Tim McCain, 2601 Barstow Road in Barstow, CA 92311, or sent by email to tmccain@blm.gov.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For additional information, contact Tim McCain, Realty Specialist, at <a href="mailto:tmccain@blm.gov">tmccain@blm.gov</a>.</p>
