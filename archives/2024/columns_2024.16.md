## Uber goes to Washington

date: 2024-04-21, from: Enlightenment Economics blog

Uber arouses strong opinions, for some good reasons. The trouble is &#8211; for those who strongly dislike the company&#8217;s treatment of its drivers &#8211; that it offers a service users and even some drivers seem to like a lot. That &#8230; <a href="http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2024/04/uber-goes-to-washington/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## Maldives 2024

date: 2024-04-21, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="maldives-2024">Maldives 2024</h1>

<p>The biosphere as we know it is ending and I‚Äôm spending two weeks in the Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.</p>

<p>The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane, Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the <a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible, too.</p>

<p>With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in 2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to the Maldives.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Pictures">#Pictures</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Maldives">#Maldives</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-04-06</strong>.
The last leg of the journey ‚Äì our water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the reef begins a few meters in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10 before we left.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to hide in the sand.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There‚Äôs sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Black tipped reef sharks‚Ä¶ harmless! At a later point we did see it attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most corals look dreary! It‚Äôs certainly not as colourful and busy as in Australia or the Galapagos.
This purple giant is cool, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are still plenty of colourful fish.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whenever we‚Äôre away on a trip, we play games.
The most popular tropical island game is Race for the Galaxy.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday we also played <a href="http://mixedsignals.ml/games/petition/">Petition</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@klaatu" title="@klaatu@mastodon.xyz">@klaatu</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-10</strong>. More pictures.</p>

<p>We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they‚Äôre slow and easily scared and therefore obviously harmless.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when you‚Äôre snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.</p>

<p>There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can stay on the ‚Äúlocal islands‚Äù since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work on the tourist islands.</p>

<p>The capital city is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Mal√© on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism ‚Äì but I know what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a> book. Check out these stats from the <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia page on the Maldives</a>:
In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement from the point of view of the locals.</p>

<p>From my green perspective, though‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs not forget the garbage island <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don&rsquo;t know what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in the the fish. People eat the fish. It&rsquo;s easy to feel grim about this. I need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much, much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre wondering why I‚Äôm basically skimming, reading and finally summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look away.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-12</strong>. Bad luck for Claudia. Yesterday, late at night, she stuck her small toe in a gap between two planks, took another step, nearly fell and twisted her foot. There‚Äôs a huge dark bruise on its back and a significant dark bruise below. No more fins, for a while. üò≠</p>

<p>We had signed up for a snorkel safari when suddenly the buzz was that the young humpback whale they had seen two days ago was still around and so the ship picked up some extra passengers and Claudia came along to do some whale watching.</p>

<p>The whale watching did not disappoint.</p>

<video src="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-15.mov" poster="2024-04-06-maledives-15.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" controls muted>

</video>

<p>This adolescent <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale">humpback whale</a> was about 8m long. It‚Äôs unusual to find a whales here, now, so close to the reef, so young, without its family. There was speculation that it might be waiting for its family to pick it up again, or that perhaps it was sick.</p>

</video>

<p><strong>2024-04-13</strong>. To it is raining. Good for Claudia since she is supposed to rest her foot.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-16.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>2024-04-21</strong>. After snorkling with the whale, not much seemed to be worth posting about.</p>

<p>Before going on this trip, I bought an older GoPro HERO 10. Now I have a few gigabytes of reef snorkeling footage. I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it. Post it? Unlikely! It takes too much space and nobody would look at it. Donate it to YouTube? Unlikely! Upload it to some Peertube instance and thereby offload the cost? Unlikely.</p>

<p>Regarding the economy of the Maldives and the shock when I learned about the garbage island and my dismay when I saw the skyline of Mal√© island ‚Äì when we flew back, I got a closer look at Mal√© from the air as we landed and while it wasn&rsquo;t an island nature paradise, it was just a city with nice, tall buildings and roads and palm trees and construction sites and glass fronts and cars and motorcycles. In other words, it seemed like a perfectly normal city and it wasn&rsquo;t shabby and it didn&rsquo;t have slums and so I keep coming back to the main issue: Beating poverty is of ultimate importance in order to improve people&rsquo;s lives and giving them options so that they can work on the problems they care about. When we flew over Thilafushi, the garbage island didn&rsquo;t look &ldquo;apocalyptic&rdquo; but just like some industrial zone elsewhere in the world, except it&rsquo;s an island in the middle of the ocean.</p>

## This Thing is Bigger Than Journalism

date: 2024-04-21, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Journalism as we knew it is washing away. But the story is bigger than journalism alone, and bigger than a story alone can tell. (Image¬†borrowed from¬†the brilliant¬†Despair.com.) We who care about journalism are asked to join the¬†Save Journalism Project, and its fight against Big Tech. Their pitch begins, and adds, On the first point, we [&#8230;]

## Phonefree

date: 2024-04-21, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Technology has given us instant access to everything. From internet with all of humanity‚Äôs knowledge, to food delivery at our door, or even cat videos, you have an app for it. But technology has also given everybody access to you, and that‚Äôs bad. Not everything requires an instant response, nobody will die if you answer [&#8230;]

## Global nutrient transfer

date: 2024-04-21, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Trade and exchange have been around essentially forever. How much is too much, though? How far is too far? How do the critical quantities of phosphate mined in the Western Sahara and sent to fertilize farms all over the world compare with peat moss harvested fifty miles from me and used to feed gardens like [&#8230;]
