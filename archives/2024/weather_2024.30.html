Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0812 AM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

CORRECTED FOR MISSING ELEVATED LABEL

...Synopsis...
Isolated dry thunderstorms are anticipated across portions of
southern Idaho into southwestern Montana as an upper-level trough
continues to progress eastward across the Northwest. Additionally,
elevated fire-weather conditions are expected across the southern
Cascades, portions of northern Montana, and the northern Great
Plains. 

...Pacific Northwest...
As an upper-level trough is forecast to continue progressing
eastward out of the Pacific Northwest and into Montana on Thursday,
isolated dry thunderstorms are expected across much of the region
over receptive fuels. While thunderstorm coverage could approach
scattered criteria, current forecast guidance suggests a mix of both
wet and dry thunderstorms, in addition to at least some minor
potential for some wetting rainfall from the previous day's weather.
This uncertainty currently precludes the expansion of the isolated
dry thunder area and the inclusion of any scattered dry thunder
areas, though forecast trends will continue to be monitored for
subsequent updates. 

Elevated fire-weather conditions are expected to occur over the
southern Cascades, especially where local gap flow enhanced winds
could contribute to wildfire spread with existing fires. Current
forecast guidance suggests that there is less potential for winds to
reach elevated criteria over the northern Cascades as the
upper-trough begins to leave the region, resulting in the removal of
the area from the previous forecast. Some elevated fire weather
conditions are also possible in portions of north-central Montana,
but the overlap of stronger surface winds and receptive fuels is
somewhat narrow. 

...Northern Great Plains...
Elevated fire-weather conditions are anticipated, particularly along
portions of western Montana and Wyoming, into eastern Nebraska and
the Dakotas. Strong southerly flow, coupled with hot, dry boundary
layer profiles, are expected to persist for much of the afternoon
and into the evening. However, current fuel guidance leaves some
uncertainty on where these conditions have significant overlap with
receptive fuels, particularly with eastward extent.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0758 AM CDT Wed Jul 24 2024

Valid 241300Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHERN
ARIZONA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms may produce damaging wind
gusts across southern Arizona, and from parts of Iowa and Illinois
into Pennsylvania/New York. Other locally strong storms are possible
in parts of the Northwest, northern Rockies and Mid-Atlantic
regions.

...Arizona...
A relatively active scenario for thunderstorms is expected later
today with the potential for thunderstorms/outflows to spread
generally south-southwestward onto the desert floor by evening. The
upper-level ridge over the western states will remain centered over
parts of Nevada/Utah today, with 15-20 kt of northeasterly mid-level
flow across central/eastern Arizona. This should help steer storms
onto the desert flow where a moist/deeply mixed boundary layer
environment will exist, with the potential for severe-caliber wind
gusts and considerable blowing dust late this afternoon into
evening.

...Midwest including Iowa/Illinois/Indiana...
The region will be influenced by the western cyclonically curved
portion of the upper-level trough over the Great Lakes/Ontario, with
a cold front moving southward across Iowa/Illinois and into
Indiana/Ohio, with very warm and humid conditions south of the
front. Some thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across eastern
Iowa and northern Illinois, but a greater coverage and intensity of
storms is expected later this afternoon near/south of the front.
Moderately strong west-northwesterly flow aloft, steep lapse rates,
and ample buoyancy suggest the potential for strong/isolated severe
storms capable of damaging winds and some hail.

...Northeast including Pennsylvania/New York....
As a front sags into western New York, modestly enhanced
southwesterly low-level winds will strengthen warm advection and
lift over the region. This will likely lead to scattered
thunderstorms through the afternoon. Forecast soundings show MLCAPE
values over 1000 J/kg and sufficient deep-layer shear for a few
organized storm clusters capable of locally gusty/damaging winds.

...North Carolina/Virginia...
Deep west-southwesterly winds will strengthen by this afternoon
along a corridor from the southern Appalachians into the
Mid-Atlantic states. This enhanced flow/shear profile will aid in
helping to organize scattered diurnal thunderstorm development from
western North Carolina into parts of southern/eastern Virginia.
Mid-level lapse rates will be poor, but strong heating and high PWAT
values will promote a risk of a few intense storm clusters capable
of gusty/damaging winds.

...Northwest...
Relatively fast cyclonic flow aloft will remain over the Pacific
Northwest states into the northern Great Basin. Mid-level moisture
will spread eastward and aid in afternoon thunderstorm development
from Oregon into parts of Idaho/Montana. Forecast soundings show
weak CAPE, but a few of the stronger cells could produce locally
gusty/damaging winds.

...Coastal Texas/southern Louisiana...
Aided by the possibility of weak surface low development, some
guidance suggests that a modest strengthening of low-level flow may
occur today. However, mid-level winds will remain weak, with inland
destabilization expected to be limited. This should minimize the
potential for anything beyond a few very weak/transient
mesocyclones.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0953 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The ongoing forecast remains on track. No changes were made. 

... Northern Rockies ...

Several hours of gusty winds will promote elevated-to-critical fire
weather conditions in and around the Cascade Gaps. A categorical
upgrade to Critical was contemplated with this forecast, but the
spatial extent of the area potentially achieving critical thresholds
is too small and the duration too short to attempt to highlight.
That said, the combination of wind, relative humidity, along with
the potential for new fire starts associated with isolated dry
thunderstorms, may result in an active fire weather day.

Elsewhere, no changes were made to the ongoing forecast.

..Marsh.. 07/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough over the Northwest will remain in place west of
a weakening upper ridge centered across the northern Rockies.
Stronger flow aloft will gradually overspread the Northwest and
northern Rockies through the week. Isolated dry thunderstorms and
gusty downslope winds will promote elevated fire-weather potential
today and tonight.

...Northwest and northern Rockies...
Lingering mid-level moisture ahead of the consolidating Pacific
trough will again support the risk for thunderstorms across the
Northwest and northern Rockies this afternoon and evening. While
weaker than previous days, subtle ascent and diurnal heating over
the terrain should allow for isolated storms to develop across parts
of the northern Great Basin and Northwest by early afternoon. Low
precipitation efficiency, owing to PWATs under 1 inch, and low
surface RH will support the risk for lightning with little to no
wetting rainfall. With area fuels still receptive to ignitions,
IsoDryT probabilities have been maintained.

West/southwest flow aloft is forecast to increase over the northern
Rockies and Cascade Gaps ahead of the trough. This may promote
several hours of gusty downslope winds across parts of eastern ID
and western MT. Model guidance shows surface winds of 15-25 mph
overlapping with RH values below 25%. This, along with the increase
in lightning and numerous ongoing fires, will support the potential
for elevated fire-weather conditions this afternoon.
