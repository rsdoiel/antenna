Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0953 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The ongoing forecast remains on track. No changes were made. 

... Northern Rockies ...

Several hours of gusty winds will promote elevated-to-critical fire
weather conditions in and around the Cascade Gaps. A categorical
upgrade to Critical was contemplated with this forecast, but the
spatial extent of the area potentially achieving critical thresholds
is too small and the duration too short to attempt to highlight.
That said, the combination of wind, relative humidity, along with
the potential for new fire starts associated with isolated dry
thunderstorms, may result in an active fire weather day.

Elsewhere, no changes were made to the ongoing forecast.

..Marsh.. 07/23/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough over the Northwest will remain in place west of
a weakening upper ridge centered across the northern Rockies.
Stronger flow aloft will gradually overspread the Northwest and
northern Rockies through the week. Isolated dry thunderstorms and
gusty downslope winds will promote elevated fire-weather potential
today and tonight.

...Northwest and northern Rockies...
Lingering mid-level moisture ahead of the consolidating Pacific
trough will again support the risk for thunderstorms across the
Northwest and northern Rockies this afternoon and evening. While
weaker than previous days, subtle ascent and diurnal heating over
the terrain should allow for isolated storms to develop across parts
of the northern Great Basin and Northwest by early afternoon. Low
precipitation efficiency, owing to PWATs under 1 inch, and low
surface RH will support the risk for lightning with little to no
wetting rainfall. With area fuels still receptive to ignitions,
IsoDryT probabilities have been maintained.

West/southwest flow aloft is forecast to increase over the northern
Rockies and Cascade Gaps ahead of the trough. This may promote
several hours of gusty downslope winds across parts of eastern ID
and western MT. Model guidance shows surface winds of 15-25 mph
overlapping with RH values below 25%. This, along with the increase
in lightning and numerous ongoing fires, will support the potential
for elevated fire-weather conditions this afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0755 AM CDT Tue Jul 23 2024

Valid 231300Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC STATES AND CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Today's overall risk for organized severe thunderstorms is expected
to remain relatively low, but a few severe storms may occur across
the Mid-Atlantic States/Carolinas.

...Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas/Southeast States...
The air mass over the region will remain very moist with
Precipitable Water values in excess of 2 inches, contributing to a
moderately unstable and minimally inhibited boundary layer this
afternoon. A modest increase in mid-level flow may occur today from
the southern Appalachians northeast across the mid-Atlantic, but
low-level winds will remain weak. While locally heavy rainfall will
be the most common hazard regionally, wet microbursts could cause a
few instances of localized wind damage this afternoon, with a
somewhat greater potential across parts of North Carolina and
Virginia.

...Midwest...
Thunderstorms are expected to redevelop along the northern front
from southern Wisconsin across Iowa and southern Minnesota this
afternoon, with the potential for multiple rounds of storms in some
locations. Moderate buoyancy should be in place near the front,
however deep-layer shear should generally remain at 25-30 kt (or
less) for much of the day. Some risk for hail and gusty winds will
exist with any stronger storm, but will defer any potential
introduction of low severe probabilities to subsequent outlooks.

...Arizona/Lower Colorado River Valley...
Thunderstorms are expected to develop over the Mogollon Rim of
Arizona again this afternoon, with relatively weak northeast
mid-level flow steering storms southwest into the lower elevations.
Despite very hot temperatures and a deep/well-mixed boundary layer,
overall confidence that storms will cluster and produce more than
localized strong/damaging gusts remains too low to introduce severe
probabilities.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CDT Mon Jul 22 2024

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper trough over the Northwest is forecast to remain mostly
stationary as the adjacent ridge over the Rockies begins to weaken
and shift to the east. Stronger flow aloft will gradually overspread
the Northwest and northern Rockies through the week. Isolated dry
thunderstorms and gusty downslope winds will promote elevated
fire-weather potential D2/Tuesday.

...Northwest and Northern Rockies...
With the upper trough over the Northwest expected to remain fairly
stationary, lingering mid-level moisture and weak ascent will
continue to support mid-level destabilization and thunderstorms
D2/Tuesday afternoon. Very warm surface temperatures and fast storm
speeds will again favor mostly dry storms with the potential for
lightning ignitions in dry fuels. Forcing for ascent should be
slightly less than previous days, casting some uncertainty on storm
coverage. However, at least isolated dry thunderstorms are possible
over parts of eastern WA/OR and into western ID.

West/southwest flow aloft is forecast to increase over the northern
Rockies and Cascade Gaps ahead of the trough. This may promote
several hours of gusty downslope winds across parts of eastern ID
and western MT. Model guidance shows surface winds of 15-25 mph
overlapping with RH values below 20%. This, along with the increase
in lightning, will support the potential for elevated fire-weather
conditions D2/Tuesday afternoon.
