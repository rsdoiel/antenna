**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I'm <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lej4s4kysc2u">playing</a> with using Bluesky as a very simple feed reader. 1. Running up against its lack of style and formatting. Very bare bones. Not sure if people will like.
2. What's the rate limit? My app is getting rate-limited with not very many posts. (According to their <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/rate-limits">docs</a> on rate limits, I don't think my project is anywhere near the limit. It's creating posts. I'll start counting them, I guess.)

## curl with partial files

date: 2024-12-30, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

Back in September 2023, we extended the curl command line tool with a new fairly advanced and flexible variable system. Using this, users can use files, environment variables and more in a powerful way when building curl command lines in ways not previously possible &#8211; with almost all existing command line options. curl command lines &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/12/30/curl-with-partial-files/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">curl with partial files</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## How about if Canada annexes Blue America?

It&#8217;s a perfect way out for Trump, who doesn&#8217;t like these states anyway.

## The Kraken Won

date: 2024-12-30, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Imagine what would have happened had Martin Winterkorn not imploded, and if Volkswagen, under his watch, not become a datakranken (data sea-monster, or octopus), spying on drivers and passengers—just like every other car company. What would the world now be like if Volkswagen since 2014 had established itself as the only car maker not operating [&#8230;]

## Panama Is Back in the News. That Can be a Good Thing.

The Panama Canal and its home country should be newly important to Americans. But in the opposite way from what Donald Trump has been talking about.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Here's a list of <a href="https://viewfeedlist.opml.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedland.social%2Fopml%3Fscreenname%3Ddavewiner%26catname%3Dblogroll">all the feeds in my blogroll</a>, with links to the XML version. I've wanted to have a nice non-XML way of viewing the feeds in an OPML subscription list. I took the time today to put one together. I had all the pieces, it was just a matter of putting them all in one place. You can use it if you want, if you want to show someone what feeds are in an OPML subscription list. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/29/screenshotopmllistviewer.png">Screen shot</a>.

## ★ OpenAI’s Board, Paraphrased: ‘To Succeed, All We Need Is Unimaginable Sums of Money’

date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-30, from: Daring Fireball

OpenAI is to this decade’s generative-AI revolution what Netscape was to the 1990s’ internet revolution.

## What are they really seeking?

Trump, Musk, Sachs, and the other billionaires taking over in three weeks and one day want to do something quite different from what the previous generation of conservatives sought.

Three comments. 1. There are no masses. You can see this by looking at the stats for each tweet, available on most platforms. 2. Most users on the social web are trying to get attention for themselves, the only reason they read the posts is to see if there's a place for them to attach their message. 3. A simple tweak to the software would make it so that only the author of the post being responded to could see the replies. Then they could RT a reply if they thought everyone should see it. This would make the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> a lot more useful imho.

## AI as the Moneypenny of the 21st century

Today&#8217;s Observer column: If 2024 was the year of large language models (LLMs), then 2025 looks like the year of AI “agents”.

## The Story of Stent

Today is my 17th re-birthday. If you’ve been a longtime reader, you know why I call it my re-birthday. If you are new around here, well, here is a short recap. Just after I turned 41—17 years ago—a life of poor habits and family genetics caught up with me. I had a heart attack and &#8230;
