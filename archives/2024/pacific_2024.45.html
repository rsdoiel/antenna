Watch: How tiltmeters monitor volcano activity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-03, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Over the past century, technological advancements have vastly improved volcano monitoring. One key innovation was the introduction of modern borehole tiltmeters, devices that measure very small changes in the inclination of the volcano&amp;#8217;s surface.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m in Volterra, my favorite hill town in Tuscany, sitting under rustic, noble stones at the base of a palace that made commoners feel small six centuries ago. Bats burst through the floodlights amid ghostly towers held together with rusted iron corsets.&lt;/p&gt;
