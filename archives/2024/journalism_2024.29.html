more likely to believe fake news shared by someone you barely know than
by your best friend</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Half a century ago, a young Stanford professor named Mark Granovetter
published what would become one of the seminal papers in the field of
sociology. “The Strength of Weak Ties” argued for the important of mere
acquaintances — not just your friends — in the growing field of social
network analysis. (It’s been cited more…</p>

<p>Vaping and doomscrolling are both addictive and both bad for you, so
why not combine the two? Because look, here’s a touchscreen vape that
gets news alerts. You’re still looking at Twitter to get your news?

Carlos Watson’s conviction, the Ozy story reaches its poetic ending</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Carlos Watson’s luck may have run out. The founder of Ozy — that
Google-exec-impersonating, mystery-traffic-generating discoverer of
people who have already been discovered — was found guilty Tuesday in
his trial in Brooklyn. A jury of his peers found he had indeed engaged
in a conspiracy to commit securities fraud, a conspiracy to commit
wire…</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Three summers ago, in my first weeks getting to know the town of
Lexington, Mass. as a local news reporter, I had the typical
conversations with community members about what I should think about
covering and where I should look for story ideas. Two names came up
early in those conversations — not of people,…</p>

contract</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>In a precedent-setting contract negotiation, the editorial union for
Mashable, Lifehacker, and PC Mag has successfully bargained for
protections against generative AI. The tentative contract explicitly
prohibits any union member from being laid off or receiving a cut in
their base salary as a result of the publications using generative AI.
The tentative contract with…</p>

Businessweek’s editor believes print remains the ultimate

<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>As part of a larger “rethink,” Bloomberg Media’s signature print
product, Bloomberg Businessweek, is now publishing every month. The
magazine’s new editor, Brad Stone, spent decades reporting on the tech
industry for Bloomberg, The New York Times, and Newsweek before taking
the reins at Businessweek earlier this year. Despite the industry
headwinds that reduced the…</p>
