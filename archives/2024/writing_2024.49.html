What struck me about Tara Campbell’s 2019 collection, <strong>Midnight
at the Or­ganporium</strong>, was the breadth of her imagination and the
way she switched between surrealism, revisionist fairytales, and horror.
Her story ‘‘Speculum Crede’’ about a very odd work picnic (an

to get at the early stages, so it’s advisable for a beginner
screenwriter to shoot for a manager first: most managers are open to
