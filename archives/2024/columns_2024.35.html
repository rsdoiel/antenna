<h2 id="standards">Standards</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: Enlightenment Economics blog</p>
<p>Colleen Dunlavy’s Small, Medium, Large is an interesting and thought
provoking read – and relevant to today’s debate on industrial policy.
It’s a relatively short book, a history of the emergence of standards in
US goods in the 1910s and …

<h2
id="to-a-tiling-wm-user-apparently-other-guis-are-like-wearing-handcuffs">To
a tiling WM user, apparently other GUIs are like wearing handcuffs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-29, from: Liam on Linux</p>
 This is interesting to me. I am on the other side, and ISTM that the
tiling WM folks are the camp you describe.
<p>
Windows (2.01) was the 3rd GUI I learned. First was classic MacOS
(System 6 and early System 7.0), then Acorn RISC OS on my own home
computer, then Windows.
</p>
<p>
Both MacOS and RISC OS have beautiful, very mouse-centric GUIs where you
<i>must</i> use the mouse for most things. Windows was fascinating
because it has rich, well-thought-out, rational and consistent keyboard
controls, and they work everywhere. In all graphical apps, in the window
manager itself, <i>and on the command line</i>.
</p>
<p>
– Ctrl + a letter is a discrete action: <i>do this thing now</i>.
</p>
<p>
– Alt + a letter opens a menu
</p>
<p>
– Shift moves selects in a continuous range: shift+cursors selects text
or files in a file manager. Shift+mouse selects multiple icons in a
block in a file manager.
</p>
<p>
– Ctrl + mouse selects discontinuously: pick disconnected icons.
</p>
<p>
– These can be combined: shift-select a block, then press ctrl <i>as
well</i> to add some discontinuous entries.
</p>
<p>
– Ctrl + cursor keys moves a word at a time (discontinuous cursor
movement).
</p>
<p>
– Shift + ctrl selects a word at a time.
</p>
<p>
In the mid-’90s Linux made Unix affordable and I got to know it, and I
switched to it early ’00s.
</p>
<p>
But it lacks that overall cohesive keyboard UI. Some desktops implement
most of Windows’ keyboard UI (Xfce, LXDE, GNOME 2.x), some invent their
own (KDE), many don’t have one.
</p>
<p>
The shell and editors don’t have any consistency. Each editor has its
own set of keyboard controls, and some environments honour some of them
– but not many because the keyboard controls for an editor make little
sense in a window manager. What does "insert mode" mean in a file
manager?
</p>
<p>
They are keyboard-driven windowing environments built by people who live
in terminals and only know the extremely limited keyboard controls of
the most primitive extant shell environment, one that doesn’t honour GUI
keyboard UI because it predates it and so in which every app invents its
own.
</p>
<p>
Whereas Windows co-evolved with IBM CUA and deeply embeds it.
</p>
<p>
The result is that all the Linux tiling WMs I’ve tried annoy me, because
they don’t respect the existing Windows-based keystrokes for
manipulating windows. GNOME &gt;=3 mostly doesn’t either: keystrokes for
menu manipulation make little sense when you’ve tried to eliminate menus
from your UI.
</p>
<p>
Even the growing-in-trendiness MiracleWM because the developer doesn’t
use plain Ubuntu, he uses Kubuntu, and Kubuntu doesn’t respect basic
Ubuntu keystrokes like Ctrl+Alt+T for a terminal, so neither does
MiracleWM.
</p>
<p>
They are multiple non-overlapping, non-cohesive, non-uniform keyboard
UIs designed by and for people who never knew how to use a
keyboard-driven whole-OS UI because they didn’t know there was one. So
they all built their own ones without knowing that there’s 30+ years of
prior art for this.
</p>
<p>
All these little half-thought-out attempts to build something <i>that
already existed</i> but its creators didn’t know about it.
</p>
<p>
To extend the prisoners-escaping-jail theme:
</p>
<p>
Each only extends the one prisoner cell that inmate knew before they got
out, where the prison cell is an app – often a text editor but sometimes
it’s one game.
</p>
<p>
One environment lets you navigate by only going left or straight. To go
right, turn left three times! Simple!
</p>
<p>
One only lets you navigate in spirals, but you can adjust the size, and
toggle clockwise or anticlockwise.
</p>
<p>
One is like Asteroids: you pivot your cursor and apply thrust.
</p>
<p>
One uses Doom/Quake-style WASD + mouse, because everyone knows that,
right? It’s the standard!
</p>
<p>
One expects you to plug in a joypad controller and use that.

In the next scene, Wordle Kitty, lithe and slender, and fiercely cute,
is doing an AMA on Reddit.

<p>
One of the questions asks if Wordle Kitty knows anyone in the US
Government.

<p>
“I don’t know anyone in the US Government,” she said, “but I do know
their kittens!” she concluded.

This scene is shown on the front page of the NY Times along with the
headline “Wordle Kitty is leading an insurrection in DC, other kittens
are colluding!”

<h1 id="2024-08-28-traveller-and-mongoose">
2024-08-28 Traveller and Mongoose
</h1>
<p>
Marc Miller’s email was reposted in a few places, like Usenet (oh yes,
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/news/article/rec.games.frp.misc/290">it
was posted on rec.games.frp.misc</a>!),
<a href="https://batintheattic.blogspot.com/2024/08/concerning-future-of-traveller.html">Rob
Conley’s blog</a>, and elsewhere. What are your thoughts on it?
</p>
<p>
I am of two minds. Mongoose has been good for Traveller, I think. I
liked Mongoose Traveller 1st ed., which I ran for a bit, and I have no
reason to doubt that the current Mongoose Traveller 2nd ed. is as good a
system the many other Traveller editions out there.
</p>
<p>
I also have my doubts regarding Mongoose’s quality in terms of editing –
but who am I kidding, these days people are cutting corners all over the
place and sometimes they’re cutting corners in editing. It happens. It’s
the Zeitgeist. I guess in the world of quality assurance Mongoose
wouldn’t actually be all that bad because I’m assuming they fix all the
typos in later printings. 😏
</p>
<p>
Also they based a lot of follow-up products on the Traveller system and
what’s not to like about more 2d6 systems! 😸
</p>
<p>
This at least ensures that they remain committed to the basic idea. And
maybe that means that the PDFs will remain around for much longer.
That’s certainly better than ending up being managed by kids or being
sold off to the highest bidder after Miller’s passing. It’s not the
greatest plan but it’s a plan. Wouldn’t a real TAS be great? An
association that had a board elected by its members, the community? An
association based on Swiss law, like FIFA or the ICRC? Anyway, that’s a
dream and it wouldn’t be clear whether it would work in the long run so
perhaps passing it on to Mongoose was the best idea after all.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if Mongoose has a better succession plan, though. Looking at
<a href="https://forum.mongoosepublishing.com/threads/state-of-the-mongoose-2023.124344/">State
of Mongoose 2023</a>, it seems that the whole company is owned by
Matthew Sprange. Is he so much younger than Marc Miller? What’s the long
term plan, here?
</p>
<p>
Anyway. Thinking about what happens to our games when we die is a good
idea.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Miller should have slapped a CC-BY-SA 4.0 or a CC0 onto the
products he owns and said: “On the day I die, these licenses go into
effect immediately.”
</p>
<p>
But that’s not how these things go. I suspect some money changed hands
and that’s probably for Miller’s best.

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/185316/james-carville-trump-deep-troubleand-knows">interview</a>
with James Carville. Two take-aways for Democrats. 1. Avoid NPR
politics. 2. Appeal to college-educated white men. Most of them vote
Republican, but with Walz on the ticket, they have a special ambassador,
he represents that straight-talking country folk are part of the
Democratic coalition. It’s still true that white voters are the
majority. Get a small number to vote Democratic could be enough to win
the election. It never is about policy. It’s about whether you are like
them. That’s what it means to avoid NPR politics. And btw, imho –
getting the press to like you might not be good. I wonder if the Dems
would ever have the courage to sever itself from the journos. Imagine
Harris saying “If the press says we’re bad you know that means we’re
good.” She could say that in her big interview. 😀</p>

The fields in the table are as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<i>Month</i>: The date marked on the media in Sharpie, and verified via
the on-disk metadata.
</li>
<li>
<i>Media</i>: The type of media.
</li>
<li>
<i>Good</i>: The number of media with this type and date for which all
MD5 checksums were correctly verified.
</li>
<li>
<i>Bad</i>: The number of media with this type and date for which any
file failed MD5 verification.
</li>
<li>
<i>Vendor</i>: the vendor name on the media
</li>
</ul>
<p>The drives I use from ASUS and LG report significant numbers of read
errors from the CDs but verify the MD5s correctly. I didn’t notice them
reporting any read errors from the DVDs. An off-brand drive fails to
read the CDs, but read one of the older DVDs with no read errors.<br />
<br /> Surprisingly, with no special storage precautions, generic
low-cost media, and consumer drives, I’m getting good data from CD-Rs
more than 20 years old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 18 years old. Your
mileage may vary. Tune in again next year for another episode.<br />
<br /> I also checked my Memorex

read errors. So that CD-R is delivering good data after nearly 28

<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/185200/kamala-wins-inside-clever-strategy-causing-trump-unravel">Greg
Sargent’s podcast</a> gave me an idea. The oppressor in a fascist state
doesn’t need you to love them, so long as you don’t love anyone else.
The NYT isn’t trying to make us love Trump, that’s impossible. But they
are trying to make us not fall in love with Harris. I doubt they foresaw
that possibility. But our feelings about Harris are very much love. The
NYT is our only master, they must think. There’s no room for us to love
someone else, because we might listen to them. In a sense they respond
like a first born child on the arrival of their little sister or
brother. I don’t know. As I said it doesn’t matter why. That’s their
problem. Our problem is to get them out of the way.</p>

if our team has overwhelming power, speed and depth, and gets on base in

<h2 id="the-status-of-twitters-api">The status of Twitter’s API</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The Twitter API still works, with some serious limits. Not easily
incorporated into products, but useful for individuals with developer
accounts. Not an insurmountable hurdle, it seems, though I was a
developer from before. A few bullet points.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
My linkblog now reliably works on
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew">Threads</a>, in addition to
<a href="https://social.masto.land/@dave">Mastodon</a>,
<a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>,
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">RSS</a> and
<a href="https://linkblog3.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>.
</li>
<li>
I was confused about the status of the Twitter API, but it turns out
it’s still there, and there is a
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2">package</a> that
connects to it for Node apps.
</li>
<li>
It took me a few hours to add
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/textcasting.js#L543">support
for Twitter</a> in my
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main">textcasting</a>
server app which is how my software connects to all the various
services.
</li>
<li>
I should probably add a plugin abilitiy for textcasting so that other
services could easily be added, without modifying the core app. Totally
doable. It’s already factored that way internally.
</li>
<li>
I should probably write
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/README.md">some
docs</a> for it too. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</li>
<li>
Anyway, the
<a href="https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api">deal
with Twitter</a> is that it’s free for up to 1500 posts per month, as I
read it, which seems manageable for one person (me), but no way is it
enough for a community of users.
</li>
<li>
Why connect to Twitter? People are there. Until they aren’t we’re going
to need a way to push stuff to Twitter.
</li>
</ul>

the investigation into
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/310">getting
UserTalk running</a> in 2024 has been a trip. The last time I did any
work on this code, or even in this area of computer science, was approx
1990. It comes right back, like riding a bike. I saw a tremendous amount
of potential fun here, but I had to move on to runtime, object database,
verbs, user interface – for Frontier. In the 34 years between then and
now – a lot of software has been written, and I’m only looking at a
fraction of it, limited to stuff that runs in Node, the browser and
Electron. And I have to say I’m totally enjoying reading about what
they’ve done. I’m learning about evolution of technology, a facet of
development I am extremely drawn to, in a whole new way, as if viewed
through a tunnel in time.

Court Rules Against Geofence Warrants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This is a big deal. A US Appeals Court
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/13/us-appeals-court-rules-geofence-warrants-are-unconstitutional/">ruled</a>
that geofence warrants—these are general warrants demanding information
about all people within a geographical boundary—are unconstitutional.

<p>
The decision seems obvious to me, but you can’t take anything for
granted.

I like it. I use it. This post is about the problems you should be
expecting at the moment.

It’s not surprising, after all. This is a very prominent sentence in
their README:

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
But what are the exact problems? Sometimes alpha software is good
enough, right?

<h2 id="major-annoyances">
Major annoyances
</h2>
<p>
<strong>No post editing</strong>. I hope you can handle your own typos.
All you have is “Delete and Redraft”. But that orphans all replies,
undoes all boosts, forgets all likes and removes posts from bookmarks.
“Delete and Redraft” is a sledge hammer. “Edit post” is a delicate
quill. And you don’t get to have it. YOLO! (You only live once.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>No filtering</strong>. You can mute and block and all that, but
when everybody is posting about Monsterdon, the European Song Contest,
the US elections, Caturday or Wordle, you can’t filter those hashtags.
You must endure the enthusiasm of the people you are following. (I think
the developers are implementing things, but it does not seem to have an
effect in the front-ends I use, so who knows.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Limited federation</strong>. This one is hard to spot. You want
to follow this account and that account and it all seems to work until
you go back and find that for one account, your follow request seems to
hang in limbo, waiting. You cancel, and follow again. It seems to work.
Come back later, back in limbo again, waiting. If you check the log,
you’ll find errors about signatures failing and what not. I have no
idea. There are currently
<a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+signature">8
open issues containing the word ‘signature’</a>. Something is not
working and you’ll have to have an alt (a separate account) on a
different server that doesn’t have this issue. That makes me sad. 😥
</p>
<h2 id="minor-annoyances">
Minor annoyances
</h2>
<p>
<strong>No automatic post expiry</strong>. You’ll have to use something
like
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/mastodon-archive.git/">Mastodon
Archive</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="no-problem">
No problem
</h2>
<p>
<strong>No front-end</strong>. There is no front-end. I use apps like
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@tootapp">Toot!</a> on my phone and
<a href="https://semaphore.social/">Semaphore</a> on the web. I don’t
need anything fancy. And for the non-fancy options, I have
<a href="https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el">mastodon.el</a> for
Emacs, <a href="https://github.com/ihabunek/toot">toot</a> for the

<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bitlbee-mastodon.git/">bitlbee-mastodon</a>
for IRC, and so on. There are plenty of options.

<strong>Markdown</strong> in your posts. I like my code blocks.

<p>
<strong>SQLite</strong> on the server. It’s currently 8.4G. The media

<strong>Memory footprint</strong>. I use Monit to monitor processes and

<p>The raucous roll call of states at the 2024 Democratic National
Convention on Tuesday, as everybody danced to DJ Cassidy’s state-themed
music, Lil Jon strode down the aisle to cheers for Georgia, and
different delegations boasted about their states and good-naturedly
teased other delegations, brought home the real-life meaning of E

American flags waved and attendees joyfully chanted “USA, USA, USA,” the
convention welcomed a new vision for the Democratic Party, deeply rooted
in the best of traditional America.</p>
