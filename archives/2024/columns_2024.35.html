<p>The NYT et al aren‚Äôt even doing a fair job of covering the election
as a horserace, because they‚Äôre making sure it‚Äôs a virtual tie, so even
if our team has overwhelming power, speed and depth, and gets on base in
every at bat and plays by the rules, our odds are no better than the
other team.</p>

<h2 id="the-status-of-twitters-api">The status of Twitter‚Äôs API</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
The Twitter API still works, with some serious limits. Not easily
incorporated into products, but useful for individuals with developer
accounts. Not an insurmountable hurdle, it seems, though I was a
developer from before. A few bullet points.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
My linkblog now reliably works on
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew">Threads</a>, in addition to
<a href="https://social.masto.land/@dave">Mastodon</a>,
<a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>,
<a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">RSS</a> and
<a href="https://linkblog3.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>.
</li>
<li>
I was confused about the status of the Twitter API, but it turns out
it‚Äôs still there, and there is a
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2">package</a> that
connects to it for Node apps.
</li>
<li>
It took me a few hours to add
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/textcasting.js#L543">support
for Twitter</a> in my
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main">textcasting</a>
server app which is how my software connects to all the various
services.
</li>
<li>
I should probably add a plugin abilitiy for textcasting so that other
services could easily be added, without modifying the core app. Totally
doable. It‚Äôs already factored that way internally.
</li>
<li>
I should probably write
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/README.md">some
docs</a> for it too. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>
</li>
<li>
Anyway, the
<a href="https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api">deal
with Twitter</a> is that it‚Äôs free for up to 1500 posts per month, as I
read it, which seems manageable for one person (me), but no way is it
enough for a community of users.
</li>
<li>
Why connect to Twitter? People are there. Until they aren‚Äôt we‚Äôre going
to need a way to push stuff to Twitter.
</li>
</ul>

the investigation into
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/310">getting
UserTalk running</a> in 2024 has been a trip. The last time I did any
work on this code, or even in this area of computer science, was approx
1990. It comes right back, like riding a bike. I saw a tremendous amount
of potential fun here, but I had to move on to runtime, object database,
verbs, user interface ‚Äì for Frontier. In the 34 years between then and
now ‚Äì a lot of software has been written, and I‚Äôm only looking at a
fraction of it, limited to stuff that runs in Node, the browser and
Electron. And I have to say I‚Äôm totally enjoying reading about what
they‚Äôve done. I‚Äôm learning about evolution of technology, a facet of
development I am extremely drawn to, in a whole new way, as if viewed
through a tunnel in time.

Court Rules Against Geofence Warrants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This is a big deal. A US Appeals Court
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/13/us-appeals-court-rules-geofence-warrants-are-unconstitutional/">ruled</a>
that geofence warrants‚Äîthese are general warrants demanding information
about all people within a geographical boundary‚Äîare unconstitutional.
</p>
<p>
The decision seems obvious to me, but you can‚Äôt take anything for
granted.

<p>
So you‚Äôre considering self-hosting? You heard good things about
<a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial">GoToSocial</a>?
I like it. I use it. This post is about the problems you should be
expecting at the moment.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs not surprising, after all. This is a very prominent sentence in
their README:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
GoToSocial is still ALPHA SOFTWARE.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But what are the exact problems? Sometimes alpha software is good
enough, right?

<h2 id="major-annoyances">
Major annoyances
</h2>
<p>
<strong>No post editing</strong>. I hope you can handle your own typos.
All you have is ‚ÄúDelete and Redraft‚Äù. But that orphans all replies,
undoes all boosts, forgets all likes and removes posts from bookmarks.
‚ÄúDelete and Redraft‚Äù is a sledge hammer. ‚ÄúEdit post‚Äù is a delicate
quill. And you don‚Äôt get to have it. YOLO! (You only live once.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>No filtering</strong>. You can mute and block and all that, but
when everybody is posting about Monsterdon, the European Song Contest,
the US elections, Caturday or Wordle, you can‚Äôt filter those hashtags.
You must endure the enthusiasm of the people you are following. (I think
the developers are implementing things, but it does not seem to have an
effect in the front-ends I use, so who knows.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Limited federation</strong>. This one is hard to spot. You want
to follow this account and that account and it all seems to work until
you go back and find that for one account, your follow request seems to
hang in limbo, waiting. You cancel, and follow again. It seems to work.
Come back later, back in limbo again, waiting. If you check the log,
you‚Äôll find errors about signatures failing and what not. I have no
idea. There are currently
<a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+signature">8
open issues containing the word ‚Äòsignature‚Äô</a>. Something is not
working and you‚Äôll have to have an alt (a separate account) on a
different server that doesn‚Äôt have this issue. That makes me sad. üò•
</p>
<h2 id="minor-annoyances">
Minor annoyances
</h2>
<p>
<strong>No automatic post expiry</strong>. You‚Äôll have to use something
like
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/mastodon-archive.git/">Mastodon
Archive</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="no-problem">
No problem
</h2>
<p>
<strong>No front-end</strong>. There is no front-end. I use apps like
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@tootapp">Toot!</a> on my phone and
<a href="https://semaphore.social/">Semaphore</a> on the web. I don‚Äôt
need anything fancy. And for the non-fancy options, I have
<a href="https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el">mastodon.el</a> for
Emacs, <a href="https://github.com/ihabunek/toot">toot</a> for the
command-line, <a href="https://tuba.geopjr.dev/">tuba</a> for Gnome,
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bitlbee-mastodon.git/">bitlbee-mastodon</a>
for IRC, and so on. There are plenty of options.
</p>
<h2 id="the-good-stuff">
The good stuff

<p>
<strong>Markdown</strong> in your posts. I like my code blocks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>SQLite</strong> on the server. It‚Äôs currently 8.4G. The media
stuff is 11G.

<p>
<strong>Memory footprint</strong>. I use Monit to monitor processes and
this process uses 185.6 MB.
</p>
<p>
<strong>No admin</strong>. I haven‚Äôt had to run any administration task.
Not once. ‚ù§Ô∏è
