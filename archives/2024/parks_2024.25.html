“This plan is a collaborative effort of communities, Tribes, local
governments, and other partners,” said <strong>BLM California Acting
State Director Gordon Toevs</strong>. “Together, we have developed a
plan that reflects stakeholder values, allowing for informed decisions
and conservation reflective of the BLM’s multiple-use mission.”
</p>
<p>
The management plans for the Redding and Arcata field offices have not
been updated since the mid-1990s. The proposed plan addresses changing
use patterns, provides for a broad array of recreation uses, plans for
wilderness management, and protects and conserves
