<p>If you follow the latest developments in modern gaming even casually,

concluded the most eye-watering transaction ever to take place in the
industry: the former acquired the latter for a price higher than the
gross national product of more than half of the world’s […]</p>

8th June</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>If you have any interest in software development on RISC OS, then
you’ll be pleased to read that the next occasional ‘friendly fireside
chat’ for programmers, and anyone with a related interest or who is
thinking about trying their hand at coding, is set to take place on
Saturday, 8th June. These meetings take place on a semi-regular basis,
online via the Zoom video conferencing system, and provide a means for
people to get together and discuss programming issues that matter to
them. For some they are an opportunity to…</p>

talking to WROCC about Lander – 5th June</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>If your use of RISC OS goes back to the early days of the operating
system, there’s a very good chance you’ll have either have played Lander
or, at the very least, will have found it lurking on one of the discs
that came with your computer. It was supplied on the ‘Applications
Discs’ that came with early Archimedes and A3000 computers. The game was
based around a very simple concept: You control a craft called a Lander,
and you fly around the protecting your world by eliminating enemy
ships…</p>

<p>The next meeting of the Midlands User Group (MUG) will be an
in-person event, and will be held from 2:00pm on Saturday, 8th June, at:
Dodderhill Parish Community Hall,School Road,Wychbold,WR9 7PU. Attendees
will see a demonstration of how to update a system based around the
‘ROOL distribution’ of RISC OS – that’s one where the operating system
and disc image comes from the RISC OS Open Limited website – so that
it’s running version 5.30 of the OS. This will cover not just updating
the ROM image itself, but also…</p>

<h2 id="macadd-becomes-2.00">MACadd becomes 2.00</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Kevin Wells has released a new version of his application for looking
up information about MAC addresses from the RISC OS desktop. Version
2.00 of MACadd brings with it a number of changes over the last release.
The chief driver of the update is that the provider of the remote
application programmer interface (API) that was being used is no longer
working with the software, so Kevin has changed the code to support a
new one, called MACLookup. Other changes include preventing multiple
copies of the software running at once,…</p>
