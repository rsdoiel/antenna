misguided backlash against California’s SB-1047</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>
<p>State Senator Scott Wiener and others in California have proposed a
bill, SB-1047m that would some modest (to my taste) restraints on AI. It
doesn’t call for a private right of action, which would allow individual
citizens to sue AI companies for a wide set of reasons; it doesn’t call
for ban on training or deploying AI, not even the kind of extremely
large language models some called for ban on. It certainly doesn’t call
for a ban on research, The most stringent rules don’t even apply to
training runs that cost less than a $100 million dollars, exempting all
or nearly all academic research, and most of what smaller and even
medium-sized startups could afford. It doesn’t call for the state to
make decisions about what can be deployed, as an FDA-like approval
process for drugs does.</p>

<h2 id="quick-out-of-the-box-bsd-support-for-the-topton-gm1">Quick
out-of-the-box BSD support for the Topton GM1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>I bought a Topton GM1 Industrial Mini PC for my HomeLab. It is aimed
at running Slackware Linux but I wanted to have a quick look at how well
BSD OSes support it out-of-the-box. ↫ Joel Carnat That’s really all
there’s to this story. I just really, really love tiny industrial and
office computers and thin clients, and every time I see another one for
sale I really have to stop myself from buying one I have absolutely no
use for. There’s just something about how these little guys are built
that speaks to me – they’re different than regular PCs, but only
marginally so, making them fun to play around with, getting drivers for
everything, seeing if Linux and BSD have any issues with it, and so on.
They’re also often fanless, which is a major boon. The Dell thin client
I wrote about last week has been run through a gauntlet of operating
systems to see just how capable it is, and I’m surprise by just how much
you can do even with a pedestrian Pentium Silver. For now it’s running
Fedora GNOME to get an idea how the most default of default Linux
environments performs and feels – so I can include it in future articles
about it – but I think I’m going to set it up as a retrogaming console
using Batocera. Industrial, office, and thin client computers are just
fun to play around with, and they’re incredibly cheap when buying used.
If things like a Raspberry Pi are hard to get, backordered, or
overpriced due to demand outstripping supply, it’s definitely a good
idea to see if you can find some cast-off thin client or whatever for
your project instead.</p>

id="microsoft-blocks-windows-11-workaround-that-enabled-local-accounts">Microsoft
blocks Windows 11 workaround that enabled local accounts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Before PC users can enjoy everything Windows 11 has on tap, they must
first enter an e-mail address that’s linked to a Microsoft account. If
you don’t have one, you’ll be asked to create one before you can start
setting it up. A frequently used trick to circumvent this block is a
small but ingenious step. By entering a random e-mail address and
password, which doesn’t exist and causes the link to fail, you end up
directly with the creation of a local account and can thus avoid
creating an official account with Microsoft. ↫ Laura Pippig at PCWorld
Microsoft has now “fixed” this trick, and it’s no longer possible to use
it. The other popular method of circumventing the Microsoft account
requirement, by opening the command prompt during installation and
running OOBE, still works, but one has to wonder how long it’s going to
take before Microsoft plugs that method, too. It seems the company is
hell-bent on getting every consumer onto the Microsoft Account train,
come hell or high water, so I wouldn’t be surprised seeing local
accounts eventually being positioned as a “pro” or even “enterprise”
feature that will simply no longer be available on consumer PCs. I don’t
think there’s anything inherently wrong with offering an online account
option, but the keyword here is option. You should always be able to set
up any computer to run with a regular old local account, even if only
because internet access isn’t always a given in many places around the
world. Add the obvious privacy concerns to that – an issue amplified by
Recall – and I doubt users’ desire to run a local account and jump
through hoops to do so will fade any time soon.</p>

<p>
I was talking with
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="akkartik">@akkartik</span></a> and
<a class="account" href="https://mas.to/@TodePond" title="@TodePond@mas.to"><span
class="citation" data-cites="TodePond">@TodePond</span></a> about
programming.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mas.to/@TodePond" title="@TodePond@mas.to"><span
class="citation" data-cites="TodePond">@TodePond</span></a> got me
thinking about communities around programming when they wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
the problem i see is that no one is talking to each other. everyone is
trying to build their solutions in isolation - as island communities. in
my opinion we shouldnt build anything new, we should try to make
compatible the mindsets and tools that we already have. its an extreme
viewpoint but i see no one else taking it, so im taking it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I can definitely see many people writing their own software and many
more people using existing software and never adapting it. I do it, too!
</p>
<p>
To put a really hurtful spin onto it: we rarely sit next to a newbie
using our software. I never do. Never. We should listen to them
muttering to themselves for the first four hours. The bugs they
attribute to their own incompetence; the confusing usability issues they
never report… and now imagine sitting next to a newbie looking at our
code, trying to find their way. No comments. No helpful guides. The code
is the best documentation, some people say. I guess they haven’t seen my
code. All those readability refactors I didn’t do. All these questions
nobody ever asked me. People look at the code and don’t come back.
</p>
<p>
Those are my free software nightmares when I look at all the things I’ve
written with a community of one. 😳
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I guess what I want to say: if you feel like you write free
software for others but nobody joins your community, you are not alone.
We are all together in this, alone. 😥
</p>
<p>
I think the reason for this has to do with how hard it is to understand
code by just reading it instead of writing. It’s super hard to get into
another code base. And it is hard to write code such that it is a
welcoming ramp up. I’d say Emacs is one of the examples where it worked
but we don’t actually know whether the approach is “good”. I certainly
used Emacs for a year or two before writing my own init file way back
when.
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure which parts enable it and I’m not sure if having more of
the same would result in more programmers modifying the code and sharing
their modifications.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Good documentation of the programming language, Emacs Lisp
</li>
<li>
Good documentation of the software itself, Emacs
</li>
<li>
Good documentation of the code, with documentation strings and comments
throughout the code base
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Nearly every function is documented, nearly every global variable is
documented, the concepts are documented in the manual, the language is
documented in the manual – it’s a gigantic group effort to build that
ramp.
</p>
<p>
I think this is how you get started modifying Emacs: with an init file
that customizes some part of it.
</p>
<p>
That reminds me of the post by Peter Seibel (2014) that I recently saw
linked in my feed:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It was sometime after that presentation that I finally realized the
obvious: code is not literature. We don’t read code, we decode it. We
examine it. A piece of code is not literature; it is a specimen. Knuth
said something that should have pointed me down this track when I asked
him about his own code reading: … He’s not describing reading
literature; he’s describing a scientific investigation.” –
<a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/">Code is not
literature</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I feel this is how I approach new code: find a tiny task and see whether
I can make that change. Usually this requires building the code,
searching the best location, learning about the code style,
investigating the libraries used, and so on. There are many strings
attached.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know how else to do it.
</p>
<p>
The same is true at the office. Our code base is about four million
lines of code. Newbies get assigned small issues to fix and need to ask
a gazillion questions and that’s how they learn.
</p>
<p>
If only there were a better way. If there is, I don’t know it.

We all read code already; it’s just that we usually read when we want to
edit. And the <em>comprehension</em> that questions about reading are
really concerned with—it comes from both reading and writing,
interleaved in complex ways. That hacking produces better comprehension
than passive, linear reading fits with what we know about learning. –

students’ progression in the era of generative AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Raspberry Pi (.org)</p>
<p>
Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming more easily
accessible to learners and educators, and increasingly better at
generating code solutions to programming tasks, code explanations,
computing lesson plans, and other learning resources. This raises many
questions for educators in terms of what and how we teach students about
computing and AI, and AI’s impact…

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
My name is JF Martin, a.k.a. Numeric Citizen in the digital space. I’m
56 years old. I live in Montreal, Canada. I’m a French Canadian. I have
a master’s degree in computer science (1993). My research field was user
experience and user interface quality assessment. I credit my passion
for Apple for this choice of research field because at that time, in
1990-1993, there was a hot debate about which was better, the PC or the
Mac, and I advocated for better user interfaces. I’ve been working in
the information technology field for thirty years. I wrote about that
<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/celebrating-reflecting-on-my-30-years-career-in-it/">here</a>.
My first job was to work for an Apple dealer. I eventually moved to a
more traditional IT type of work, doing things in IT infrastructures,
first with PC deployments in small and medium enterprises, then in data
center related technologies deployment and management.
</p>
<p>
Apple played a significant influence in my life since 1983. I have
always preferred creative people and Apple has attracted them more than
any other computer brand. I always felt at home in this user community,
even though I’m a rather analytic guy professionally. Yet, I consider
myself a compulsive creator. Creating something has always been part of
my life. When I was a young boy, I was building something with Legos.
Then, it was replaced with photography. Then, computers came to my life,
first with a Commodore and then with an Apple Macintosh in 1985. Since
then, computers, i.e. the Mac, the iPad, have always been central to any
creative project. One of them being an indie iOS developer from 2009 to
2013 when I was developing apps for the iPhone. Since then, I mostly
spend my time as a blogger and a writer. Photography is also one of my
creative hobbies, and you can find my work here on
<a href="https://pixelfed.social/numericcitizen">Pixelfed</a> and
<a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen">Glass</a>.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
First, let’s clear something out of the way: using the Numeric Citizen
name. To me, Numeric Citizen was evocative of a citizen living in
cyberspace, sharing things with it, learning things from it, etc. I
thought it was a good parallel with real-world citizenship. But
eventually, I found out that in English, the more frequent word for this
would have been “Digital Citizen”, but I couldn’t get the right domain
name for it, and it was too late, so I decided to keep the Numeric
Citizen moniker.
</p>
<p>
Now, about my blog. Well, I have a few blogs and websites. Four, to be
precise. But let’s go back in time. In 1994, I had a Mac and created a
website about meteorology. It was a science-related educative project.
This lasted a couple of years. Next, in 2006, I experimented with Apple
iWeb, part of the iLife suite. Sadly, I can’t remember what my website
was about, but I do remember that I preferred the version of Apple where
RSS was still a thing in Safari and iWeb let anyone own a blog for a
MobileMe subscription. It’s too bad that Apple dropped iWeb.
</p>
<p>
I started blogging in 2009 using Google’s Blogger platform. This time,
it was about sharing my experiences and discoveries while developing
apps for the iPhone. Eventually, I stopped doing that and kept the blog
running until 2013. That was it for Blogger. Then, in 2015, I went back
to blogging, this time on
<a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, and it was a more
general-purpose blog where I was sharing my thoughts about Apple, among
other things. Since then, I’ve been writing about Apple, technology, and
photography. Last year, I completed a migration out of
<a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> to
<a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost.org</a>. I couldn’t be happier. Ghost
is much simpler to use and manage (no plugins!). But that’s not all.
Starting in 2018, I opened a blog on Micro.blog. Since then, I’ve been
blogging regularly, and I love it. My website on Ghost is more dedicated
to long-form articles, which require more research and writing work. My
blog on Micro.blog is about sharing short thoughts and comments about
the same subjects.
</p>
<p>
I often consider myself a digital nomad (or a numeric nomad?). I
frequently try different things and don’t hesitate to move from one
place to another if I see better value and functionality. Last year, I
was really on the move, but I think I will settle for a while once I
finish my migration from SmugMug to PixelFed.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a highly iterative type of guy. I rarely start writing an article
and finish it in one stretch. It’s way too demanding for me. I have a
few parallel ongoing research and writing projects and do round-robin
writing across them. I’m using Craft Docs for most of my writing needs,
an app I love dearly. I developed a rather sophisticated template for my
research needs. This template helps me organize my research and support
my writing efforts with Craft. When I’m ready to publish, I export to
Ulysses, do the final proofing using Grammarly, select the destination
and hit publish. I wish I could do all this from Craft, but it’s
currently impossible.
</p>
<p>
Inspiration comes without warning. I often go for a walk and think about
so many things. I usually come back with an idea about a new article or
a tweak to my creative workflows and start working on it as soon as
possible. My creative hobby is what makes me thrive in life. Without it,
the last three years with the COVID pandemic would have been so hard on
me.
</p>
<p>
I write a lot about my creative process and the tools that I use all the
time. Occasionally, I’ll share an update about my creative workflow when
there are enough changes to it. You can read about my last update right
<a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/content-creator-workflow-update-as-of-2023-11">here</a>.
These articles are posted on what I call: a blog about blogging. It is
currently available as a series of shared documents built-in Craft, but
I recently started re-publishing them on a
<a href="https://meta.numericcitizen.me/">new Micro.blog website</a> so
that I could let people follow my updates using RSS, which Craft doesn’t
support.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
My creative environment is relatively simple: my home. I do like to go
to coffee shops. I
<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/on-creative-work-in-a-coffee-shop/">wrote
about these</a>. I also love to write on my terrasse outside during
summer. Bird noises and the wind are indeed delightful while writing.
The best triggers for my creativity come down to the time of the day. I
love working early in the morning and during the weekends. At night or
late in the evening, I’m less into it and find it hard to focus. One
thing is clear: many of my ideas come when I do something other than
creating, like while taking a walk or… taking my shower. 😅
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I depend on three hosting solutions: Ghost, Micro.blog, and Craft Docs.
I don’t self-host anything. I don’t have time for that (and I’m probably
too old, too). At some point, I contemplated the idea of self-hosting a
Hugo instance, but when I started to dig a bit into Hugo’s inner
workings, I quickly changed my mind. I’m a « SaaS » type of guy, I
guess.
</p>
<p>
My main domain name is
“<a href="http://numericcitizen.me/">numericcitizen.me</a>” and I use a
subdomain for each of my publishing space or “channel”. Publishing on
Ghost goes to
“<a href="http://numericcitizen.me/">numericcitizen.me</a>”, but sharing
on Micro.blog goes to
<a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/">blog.numericcitizen.me</a>
while my metablog goes to
<a href="https://meta.numericcitizen.me/">meta.numericcitizen.me</a>.
Photos shared on Pixelfed photos can be seen by visiting
<a href="https://photos.numericcitizen.me/">photos.numericcitizen.me</a>.You
get the idea. I have so many small websites (too many?) and so I created
a hub page that can be reached via, you guessed it,
<a href="https://hub.numericcitizen.me/">hub.numericicitizen.me</a>. The
latter is hosted on Micro.blog.
</p>
<p>
But what about newsletters for those who prefer the email experience? I
tried Substack and was happy with it until I wasn’t. I tried Buttondown
but eventually settled on Ghost. It was one of the many reasons I
decided to leave WordPress behind. Under Substack, I used to have the
<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/numeric-citizen-introspection-24/">Introspection
newsletter</a>, which wasn’t about introspection but rather a collection
of thoughts and links divided into sections. I stopped publishing this
newsletter in September 2022. One year later, I started a new one
covering
<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/my-weekly-creative-summary-for-the-week-of-2024-08/">my
creative week</a>. And I hope to continue publishing this one for a long
time because of the pleasure I get while putting it together.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
It’s a hard question. We can always do things differently but the way I
see it is simple: my current state is essentially the culmination of all
my past experiences, good or bad. It’s an infinite learning process,
always feeding the future “me”.
</p>
<p>
I often wonder if a single “big” website would be better than having so
many small ones. I could achieve similar results by using categories and
tags with each post. But in the end, I prefer dedicated and more focused
but connected silos.
</p>
<p>
Regarding RSS feeds, I wish I had known about FeedPress earlier so that
my readers wouldn’t have to change their subscriptions each time I moved
my stuff from one place to another. It’s a great way to centralize feeds
from different places where I publish content. Someone can subscribe to
my megafeed to see everything I share online.
</p>
<p>
I wish I had done one thing: each time I made a significant design
change to one of my websites or moved from one platform to another, I
wish I had kept a screenshot of the previous design. I don’t have a
visual memory of my journey as a blogger. I find this a bit sad.
</p>
<p>
And yes, I still prefer Digital Citizen over Numeric Citizen. 🤷🏻‍♂️
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
Ghost isn’t exactly cheap (300$ per year), but their support is stellar.
Micro.blog is a bargain (120$ per year) for everything you get. Craft is
rather a cheap option, too (at 116$ per year) if you do more than
note-taking with it, which I do. All in all, if you do the math, my
online presence comes at a cost. I’ll let you do the math. I didn’t
count domain name registration and other stuff like apps and other
services making
<a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/meta-toolset">my digital
toolset</a>. You can see the full details right
<a href="https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/current-subscriptions">here</a>,
on my “Subscriptions” page.
</p>
<p>
Now, I want to share a few words about monetization possibilities. I
have tried many times, and it’s tough. Over the years, I slowly learned
that when someone shows support with a subscription to my website or
sends me money, I consider this a gift. Visitors to my main website on
Ghost can subscribe for free or pay a small fee to show appreciation.
That’s about it. I don’t make money with my YouTube channel because I
haven’t met the requirements yet. I’m looking to make money there. I did
receive some money via PayPal once or twice. I wasn’t expecting that.
It’s cool. I said a big thank you.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
I think you should give a try with
<a href="https://maique.eu/about/">Maique</a>. He’s from Portugal. He is
passionate about photography and shares a lot of creative content on
different platforms, mostly open ones. I think he could share a lot as a
blogger who constantly tries new things. We’re cosmic brothers.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
Oh, did I mention my YouTube channel? It’s a complement to my blogs. I
know I’m spread everywhere, but it is still manageable. You can find it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos">here</a>. I
also have a podcast because I wanted to test the medium, and I quite
like it, too, but I don’t produce new episodes often enough. And yes,
I’m an amateur photographer with a Glass
<a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen">profile</a>. I don’t read
books. I don’t play games, but I prefer experimenting with modern media
(words, audio, video, images).
</p>

recycled electrons. 🤓 Thanks for having me on People &amp; Blog series!

<h2 id="how-to-converse-online">How to converse online</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The web is, at its core, a conversation tool. At least for the most part. You can have a conversation synchronously via chats and DMs, you can have a conversation semi-synchronously via posts on social media and forums, and you can have a conversation asynchronously using emails or blog posts. The vast majority of what’s happening on the web is a conversation of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Over the past few weeks, this topic of online conversations managed to
find its way over and over again in my brain. What’s the ideal workflow
for a good online conversation? I’m currently typing these words and I’m
talking to nobody. I don’t have an imaginary audience and I usually
assume that nobody will read these words even though I know for a fact
that some of you do. And yet, more often than not these posts I write
end up being excellent conversation starters. But what’s the best way to
have that conversation? I defaulted to email for pretty much all my
interactions even though some people do ping me via Apple Messages every
now and again. Is this arrangement ideal? Is email the best tool to have
these conversations? I honestly don’t know. I do know that so far I
haven’t found a better alternative.
</p>
<p>
Is this workflow ideal? I write something, you read it on the site, in
your RSS reader, or in your inbox, you send me an email, I reply to you
and off we go? Those are a lot of steps and there’s substantial friction
involved. You need to decide to send me an email, hunt for my email
address, write something, and overcome the weirdness of sending an email
to a stranger. It’s a lot. Wouldn’t it be a lot easier to leave a quick
comment? Shouldn’t I have comments on my site? Well, no. Comments are
easily one of the worst ways to have meaningful conversations online.
I’m not saying it’s impossible to have a smart, thoughtful conversation
in a comment section, I’m just saying it’s bloody hard. Comments are
performative. You write knowing the other people will see your comment
and so it’s not just a conversation between you and me. It’s a
conversation between you, me, and the countless other people who will
stumble on this page at any point in time.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to conversations, the location matters. It matters in the
real world and it matters in the digital world. Do you know how many
people have sent me awful, nasty emails in the past 7 years, since I
started this blog? Exactly zero. I’m aware that now that I said it
someone will do it just to be the first but still, my point stands.
Since an email is private people don’t usually bother because it takes
time and effort and there’s no reward at the end. They won’t get to see
my reaction, people won’t add a +1 to a like or a whatever to their
comment. The private space of an email conversation matters, it matters
a lot.
</p>
<p>
Another thing that matters is intentions. I recently removed from this
site the integration with webmention.io to receive webmentions from
other sites. Why? Well, because as much as I like and approve the idea
behind the concept of a webmention I also think that taking the time
matters. Taking 20 seconds to send an email to say “Hey, I wrote
something and I quoted something you wrote” has a lot more value in my
world than configuring a server to automatically send a ping towards my
server. I know most people won’t bother doing that and that’s fine. I
honestly prefer to not know, I prefer to not receive all those automated
pings and live in ignorance.
</p>
<p>
I obviously don’t have an answer to the question I’m asking in this
post. I don’t know what’s the best way to have a conversation online.
What I do know is that a good conversation takes time and effort. It
takes willingness to engage and it takes honesty. But they’re rewarding.
Good conversations are incredibly rewarding. I encourage you to try. Try
emailing the people behind the sites you read. Try to get in touch. See
what happens. Most won’t reply, and that’s fine. It happens. But some
will. And you never know what can happen.

<h2 id="osnews-needs-your-help-to-stay-alive">OSNews needs your help to
stay alive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>As some of you will know, I recently started working on OSNews as my
full-time job, and that means I sometimes need to be annoying and remind
you all that I need your help in keeping the website going. Ad income
has been going down the drain for years and years now, so your support
is crucial in keeping OSNews online. We’ve been providing you with the
latest technology news for over 25 years now, and I’d really like to
keep things going for another 25 years. So, how can you help? You can
become an OSNews Patreon, which will remove ads from OSNews, and give
you a little bit of flair on every comment you post to show off that you
support us. We offer three pricing tiers with an increasing level of
prominence for your flair, with the highest tier giving you the option
of choosing your own flair to really show off to your fellow readers and
commenters that you are just a little bit more equal than everyone else.
You can also make individual donations through Ko-Fi. Since I really
need to replace the monitor of my OSNews workstation – after eight years
of loyal use, the cheap monitor is started to show ghosting and
flickering, and I feel like it could give out at any moment – I’ve set a
goal on Ko-Fi for this very purpose. I don’t expect this goal to be met
any time soon, but it’s a nice target to aim for and look forward to. I
intend to replace the old 4K display with the cheapest 4K/144Hz panel I
can find here in Sweden, but since that will most likely be unrealistic
price-wise, the goal is rooted more in aspiration than reality. There
are other ways to support us too – you can make a donation through
Liberapay, or go to our merch store and buy T-shirts, mugs, and other
cool items. The ultimate goal that I’m working towards is to eventually
be able to offer ad-free by default, fully supported by you, our
generous readers. This is a long-term goal and not something we’ll
achieve overnight, but I want to maintain OSNews’ independence at all
costs. Virtually every other technology news site you visit is part of a
major media empire, such as The Verge or Ars Technica, with huge amounts
of staff and massive funds backing them – and all the questionable
relationships between writers and the technology companies that entails.
Add to it the rise of artificial intelligence and the negative
consequences that’s going to have, and the need for independent,
reader-funded technology websites is greater than ever. That being said,
we will not be gating content behind paywalls, so even if you cannot or
are unwilling to support us, you will still get all the same content as
everyone else. As such, supporting OSNews financially is entirely
optional, and will not degrade your experience in any way. Still,
OSNews’ continued existence is entirely dependent on me being able to
generate enough income through it, so while you do not have to support
us, it’s definitely needed.</p>

<p>You know what could really use a dose of “AI”? Your BIOS. aiBIOS
leverages an LLM to integrate AI capabilities into Insyde Software’s
flagship firmware solution, InsydeH2O® UEFI BIOS. It provides the
ability to interpret the PC user’s request, analyze their specific
hardware, and parse through the LLM’s extensive knowledge base of BIOS
and computer terminology to make the appropriate changes to the BIOS
Setup. This breakthrough technology helps address a major hurdle for PC
users that require or desire changes to their BIOS Setup for their
personal computers but do not fully understand the meaning of the
settings available to them. ↫ Insyde press release Google told users to
put glue on pizzas and eat rocks, so I’m sure the combined efforts of a
BIOS maker will surely not pose any problems when automatically changing
BIOS settings based on the requests of users who do not really
understand what they’re doing. This surely is a recipe for success, and
I can’t wait to tell my BIOS to enable XMP, only for it to disable
hyperthreading, change the boot order to only allow booting from the
non-existent floppy drive, and to force the use of the integrated GPU
when I’m actually using a dedicated one. This is going to be just
fine.</p>

<h2
id="windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned">Windows
Recall demands an extraordinary level of trust that Microsoft hasn’t
earned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>The short version is this: In its current form, Recall takes
screenshots and uses OCR to grab the information on your screen; it then
writes the contents of windows plus records of different user
interactions in a locally stored SQLite database to track your activity.
Data is stored on a per-app basis, presumably to make it easier for
Microsoft’s app-exclusion feature to work. Beaumont says “several days”
of data amounted to a database around 90KB in size. In our usage,
screenshots taken by Recall on a PC with a 2560×1440 screen come in at
500KB or 600KB apiece (Recall saves screenshots at your PC’s native
resolution, minus the taskbar area). Recall works locally thanks to
Azure AI code that runs on your device, and it works without Internet
connectivity and without a Microsoft account. Data is encrypted at rest,
sort of, at least insofar as your entire drive is generally encrypted
when your PC is either signed into a Microsoft account or has Bitlocker
turned on. But in its current form, Beaumont says Recall has “gaps you
can drive a plane through” that make it trivially easy to grab and scan
through a user’s Recall database if you either (1) have local access to
the machine and can log into any account (not just the account of the
user whose database you’re trying to see), or (2) are using a PC
infected with some kind of info-stealer virus that can quickly transfer
the SQLite database to another system. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars
Technica It really does seem Recall is kind of a mess in the security
department, and it has a certain rushed quality about it. All the
screenshots are saved in an AppData folder, and data pulled from those
screenshots is stored in a local SQLite database that happens to be
entirely unencrypted. TotalRecall, a tool developed by Alexander
Hagenah, will neatly pull the data from Recall for you without any
hassle or issues. This truly is a security nightmare. Aside from all the
obvious issues this presents, such as making it even easier for law
enforcement to gain access to pretty much everything you do online,
something especially troubling for minorities or in countries with
less-than-stellar police departments, Recall also presents a whole host
of other problems. Imagine being in an abusive relationship, and the
abusive partner demanding Recall be left on at all times to exert even
more control. Imagine an unscrupulous employee abusing Recall to steal
sensitive information from a company for a competitor. Imagine living in
some backwards part of a country with controlling religious parents, and
you happen to be gay. The problems here are endless. The fact you can
turn Recall off doesn’t mean much, since in the above examples, turning
it off is not an option since there are controlling people involved who
will demand you keep it on. Browser history and other forms of history
in your computer exist as well, of course, but they’re not always as
easy to parse, they’re easier to manipulate, sanitise, and temporarily
hide. Recall just combines all of this and puts a neat little bow on it,
ready to be abused by anyone with bad intentions. Recall is
ill-conceived, badly implemented, and a solution looking for a problem,
that in an of itself creates tons of other problems. I hope Microsoft
reconsiders, but in a world where “AI” makes investors go nuts, I doubt
we’ll see a sudden sense of clarity coming out of Redmond.</p>

Mental Health?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: Quanta Magazine</p>
Research suggests that psychedelic drugs can reopen critical periods of
brain development to create opportunities for re-learning and
psychological healing. In this episode, co-host Janna Levin speaks with
Gül Dölen, a neuroscientist studying the therapeutic potential of
psychedelic substances.

The cemetery has a bunch of rectangular, brutalist ponds. It‘s not easy
for animals to get down to the water. These bees found a corner where
moss or algae suck up some water from below and so the bees can drink
from the wet plant material. I think. 😍

<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>OpenAI’s efforts to produce less factually false output from its
ChatGPT chatbot are not enough to ensure full compliance with European
Union data rules, a task force at the EU’s privacy watchdog said.
“Although the measures taken in order to comply with the transparency
principle are beneficial to avoid misinterpretation of the output of
ChatGPT, they are not sufficient to comply with the data accuracy
principle,” the task force said in a report released on its website on
Friday. ↫ Tassilo Hummel at Reuters I’m glad at least some authorities
are taking the wildly inaccurate nonsense outputs of many “AI” tools
seriously. I’m not entirely sure when a tool like ChatGPT can be
considered “accurate”, but whatever it is now, is not it.</p>

<h2 id="gnu-nano-gains-optional-modern-keybindings">GNU Nano gains
optional modern keybindings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>GNU Nano, by far my favourite text editor when using the command
line, released version 8.0 recently – and by recently I mean a month ago
– and in it, there’s a pretty interesting additional feature that should
make using Nano a little bit more straightforward for those not used to
its key combinations. Command-line option –modernbindings (-/) makes ^Q
quit, ^X cut, ^C copy, ^V paste, ^Z undo, ^Y redo, ^O open a file, ^W
write a file, ^R replace, ^G find again, ^D find again backwards, ^A set
the mark, ^T jump to a line, ^P show the position, and ^E execute. ↫ GNU
Nano’s news page Basically, this option makes Nano’s key bindings a bit
more in line with what you might expect as someone coming from a
graphical environment. Of course, Nano’s keybindings are listed at the
bottom of its user interface, but it’s still nice to have the option of
making them more in line with the wider computing world. Instead of
using the command-line option, you can also change the name of Nano’s
executable, or a symlink to it, to start with “e”.</p>

recommends (which is on the right track). They could be playing the same
role that the 12 jurors in NYC did. I’d love to see a requirement that
every moderator of a major news show in the US do jury duty for a couple

apply to news, not just justice. (Update:

drops Windows 10 support for new chipsets and processors, while
Microsoft expands testing efforts for new Windows 10 features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember when I said the honeymoon with AMD’s consumer-friendly
chipset and socket support policy would eventually end? Well, while this
is not exactly that, it will make a lot of people very unhappy. While
AMD, as does any other company, was boastful about its product touting
the 16% IPC boost on Zen 5 and the big AI performance leap delivering up
to 50 TOPS on the NPU side, an interesting drawback of the Ryzen AI 300
series that has managed to avoid getting media attention is the lack of
support for Windows 10. While this was just an unconfirmed rumour last
month even though it was suggested by a supposed Lenovo China manager,
we have now got confirmation from AMD itself that the report, that Strix
point and newer CPUs and APUs will not support Windows 10 is true. ↫
Sayan Sen at NeoWin Official support for Windows 10 is ending next year,
so there is some reason to AMD’s madness, but at the same time, almost
70% of Windows users are currently using Windows 10, and leaving those
users behind might not be the best idea AMD ever had. There is an
argument to be made that at least a reasonable number of these people
are still using Windows 10 not out of their own volition, but because of
Microsoft’s strict hardware requirements, and as such, anyone buying a
new AMD machine will just opt for the latest version of Windows out of
habit, but I still think there’s a sizable contingent of people who
actively choose Windows 10 over 11 for a whole host of reasons. On a
strongly related note, despite 2025 marking the end of regular support
for Windows 10, Microsoft yesterday announced it’s expanding the the
number of Insider channels for new Windows 10 features from one to two,
adding a Beta tier below the existing Release Preview tier. Microsoft,
too, will have to come to terms with the fact that with 70% of Windows
users using Windows 10, they might not even be able to drop support for
the operating system as early as next year. While this 70% number will
surely slowly decrease over the next 12 months, with many people simply
being unable to upgrade due to hardware limitations, I have a suspicion
we might see an extension on that 2025 date.</p>

</h1>
<p>
I was thinking about writing a simple editor again. The
<a href="https://smallandnearlysilent.com/">Small and Nearly Silent</a>
web app by
<a class="account" href="https://tenforward.social/@eli_oat" title="@eli_oat@tenforward.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="eli_oat">@eli_oat</span></a> is beautiful
because it mixes text and line drawings. I often feel that I’d like a
simple path-based SVG-like drawing ability, like
<a href="https://akkartik.name/lines.html">lines</a>, by
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@akkartik" title="@akkartik@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="akkartik">@akkartik</span></a>. Some lines,
some control points, some curves, filling stuff with patterns… I don’t
know whether I’d actually use it, but it’s alluring.
</p>
<p>
The whole <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">uxn</a>
ecosystem with many different small tools is also quite alluring.
Unfortunately, it’s also a bit hard to get into an existing ecosystem
like that. I still feel that if spent a while writing something myself,
it’d feel more like it was “mine”. I’d just understand it better. I just
don’t know if I’m ready to spend that much time on it, or if I’d even be
able to pull it off. So that’s why I wavering at the same time that I’m
fascinated.
</p>
<p>
Given all that, I was thinking about Gforth and found
<a href="https://github.com/JeremiahCheatham/Gforth-SDL2-Bindings/">SDL2
Bindings for Gforth</a>, and I found the example
<a href="https://github.com/JeremiahCheatham/Yellow-Snow">Yellow
Snow</a> game using this library, I tried to compile it and Gforth
complained about the missing headers. No problem, I thought to myself. I
know what to do: <code>sudo apt install libsdl2-ttf-dev
libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev</code> – but the mixer results in
<a href="https://doc.sccode.org/">SuperCollider</a> getting deinstalled.
Oh no!
</p>
<p>
So now I’m once again thinking about the thing I actually want to do. Do
I want to build an Emacs light? A simple line-based text editor like
<code>ed</code> but with more features? An editor that only runs inside
a terminal, like <code>kilo</code> or <code>mini</code>? See
<a href="2018-03-12_Writing_an_Editor">2018-03-12 Writing an Editor</a>
for more. Or would it be an editor with a GUI? Would it work only with
X11? Or would it be based on SDL?
</p>
<p>
I feel like an editor with a minimal GUI would be nice. I don’t think I
need a menu, but I think I’d like a way to scale font size up and down,
UTF-8 support to write German and Portuguese, basically render Markdown
and some simple variant of SVG, inline. I feel like that’s why I need to
start with graphics and font support. Otherwise I’ll end up with
something like <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~m15o/grid/">grid</a>: a cool
<a href="https://plan9.io/wiki/plan9/using_acme/index.html">ACME</a>-inspired
text editor, but it would only really works for English.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Editor">#Editor</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-06-04</strong>. Thinking about Go and the
<a href="https://github.com/hibiken/mini">mini</a> editor. It runs in a
terminal. So what would it take to turn it into a graphical editor with
fonts, ligatures, bidirectional text, font-sizes, and all of that?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/go-text/typesetting">go-text/typesetting</a>
is a library that’s used by <a href="https://fyne.io">Fyne</a>,
<a href="https://gioui.org">Gio</a>, and
<a href="https://ebitengine.org">Ebitengine</a>. So perhaps one of these
frameworks?
</p>
<p>
Fyne has a
<a href="https://apps.fyne.io/apps/com.fynelabs.notes.html">Notes</a>
example application. It looks like a nice, simple app. When I built it,
however, it didn’t work. Is it because I’m on Wayland? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Gio is used by <a href="https://anvil-editor.net/">Anvil</a>, an
ACME-like editor with many features. In fact, it already looks like it
has too many features for me to start building something. I wonder.
Perhaps those are the right features? I just can’t warm up to using the
mouse all that much.
</p>
<p>
Ebitengine has a
<a href="https://ebitengine.org/en/examples/font.html">Font</a> example.
It just shows how one loads a font for a number of code-points and
that’s that. An interesting way to load a font, for sure.

states, from the Sun’s water vapor to the ice of Pluto and beyond. Water
is not only linked to the possibility to sustain life, it is also
interesting for its own geological properties and potential uses. For
example, ice on the Moon and Mars could support human exploration.
Comets that hit Earth may have deposited water on our planet. The icy
comets and rings of Saturn reveal how solar systems change over

<h2 id="intel-unveils-lunar-lake-architecture-moves-ram-on-die">Intel
unveils Lunar Lake architecture, moves RAM on-die</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of AMD, here’s Intel’s next-generation processor,
this time for the laptop market. Overall, Lunar Lake represents their
second generation of disaggregated SoC architecture for the mobile
market, replacing the Meteor Lake architecture in the lower-end
space. At this time, Intel has disclosed that it uses a 4P+4E (8 core)
design, with hyper-threading/SMT disabled, so the total thread count
supported by the processor is simply the number of CPU cores, e.g.,
4P+4E/8T. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech The most significant change in
Lunar Lake, however, has nothing to do with IPC improvements, core
counts, or power usage. No, the massive sea change here is that Lunar
Lake will do away with separate memory sticks, instead opting for on-die
memory at a maximum of 32GB LPDDR5X. This is very similar to how Apple
packages its memory on the M dies, and yes, this also means that as far
as thin Intel laptops go, you’ll no longer be able to upgrade your
memory after purchase. You choose your desired amount of memory at
purchase, and that’s what you’ll be stuck with. Buyer beware, I suppose.
We can only hope Intel isn’t going to default to 8GB.</p>

<p>About a week ago, there has been a little addition to the 3dbrew wiki

how the 3DS cartridge controller and a 3DS cartridge talk to each other.
I would like to take this opportunity to also include the 3DS itself in
the conversation to illuminate which part of which device performs which
step. I will then proceed to outline where I think the corresponding
design decisions originate. Finally, I will conclude with some concrete
ideas for improvement. ↫ Forbidden Tempura Everything you ever wanted to

I asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of an interviewer hallucinating during
a news show with several distinguished panelists discussing an important
issue.

<p>In other words the designers of CSS and JavaScript and probably every
other technology everyone uses had no idea what actual developers were
doing with their committee-designed creation. They made mistakes and
piled them on each other, fixing old mistakes with new mistakes. After
30 years of evolving in this convoluted way, if you want to create
useful software, you have to either master all of it (and no one has) or
pay $20 a month to OpenAI so you can use it to navigate the awful
hairball that the web platform has become. Where we only have a sliver
of knowledge as humans, <i>the machine knows all of it.</i> And that’s
just programming. I’m just guessing that everything is that way. You
know the

<a href="https://youtu.be/Ny_mr3QX9Q8?si=7GMMS7dBvZW5cOag&t=165">no one
knows</a> how the technology works. That’s where we are now. Spend your
whole life using the stuff and you still only know a tiny fraction of
what you need to make good software. We needed what ChatGPT does, but we
didn’t know we needed it. That’s where we are now, and the journos are
sitting on the sidelines hurling

<p>What got me spinning was listening to Rachel Maddow advertise her
podcast at the beginning of her show last night. You can get the podcast
for free, she says, or if you want no ads, you can pay some money and
get it from Apple. What Apple is selling there, and Maddow is going
along with, is not a freaking podcast and by calling it one they
undermine a great medium. I understand why Maddow might not care, she
makes millions from a medium that doesn’t give users much choice (ie
MSNBC) so why should she care about podcasting, which does.</p>

podcasting had a marketing team behind it, we’d run a campaign that says
“It’s not podcasting if you don’t have choice.” If you have to use
Apple, Audible, Spotify or Google to listen to something, that’s nice,
hope it’s good for you, but folks that is not a podcast. Podcasts give
you the listener all the power. If you give it up it’ll all be
Disneyfied before too long. It pisses me off that Amazon Music sends me
messages about all the new “podcasts” they have. I mutter under my
breath when I hear this, some expletive I’d rather not repeat. Amazon,
the users know that podcasting == user choice, and they hate you just a
little every time you lie about it. Find another term you like and use
that. You have the money to do the marketing. Come on, just once play
fair. You’ll be surprised how good it feels, and I wouldn’t be surprised
if the users reward you for it.</p>

I delete the comments and change the permissions to only allow friends
to comment. <i>The journalists are wrong about ChatGPT.</i> I solve
problems with it. It guides me through difficult programming situations,
esp around convoluted designs like CSS and JavaScript. It knows all of
it. The only times it hallucinates (and I know it’s doing it btw, I’m
not stupid) is when there is not enough info on the web to give an
answer. It would be nice if it just said “I don’t know” but it’s early,
and they haven’t figured out how to do that yet. The journalists have no
sense of wonder I guess, or they never thought to use it in their jobs.
I can’t wait for the first aha! from a journalist – who will say this:
“Aha! Now I see what this is for and it’s freaking lovely.” But they’ve
decided it sucks and that’s that. Too bad, we’re going on without them.
And thanks to the good moderation tools we can keep the turd-droppers
from totally screwing it up.</p>

<h2 id="death-and-dying">2024-05-23 Death and dying</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-05-23-death-and-dying">
2024-05-23 Death and dying
</h1>
<p>
This is the first time somebody is dying in my close family where I am
old enough to be an adult about it.
</p>
<p>
One of my sisters died when I was about twenty. I was living in
Switzerland with my dad, and it was terrible to hear my mom crying at
the phone, practically unable to tell me what had happened, to then see
my father confused, shocked. I booked a flight for him but didn’t go
myself. My mom was living in Portugal with my two sisters. I wasn’t
there for my sister’s burial. People had to be buried within 48 hours,
back then. I don’t know how things are now. There was school and stuff
and I had not lived with my sisters for a few years. I didn’t feel very
close. It just felt weird. I didn’t know what it was supposed to mean.
</p>
<p>
Now, thirty years later, my stepfather is dying. His kidneys are
failing, his liver is failing, his lungs are filling up with water, his
heart is failing; they can’t give him his heart medication because the
kidneys are at their limits, can’t have him move around because he’s
weak, and so he’s breaking down. I mean, he’s calm, he knows what’s
happening, and he’s very, very tired. He’s ready to go.
</p>
<p>
I think that in my heart, I know that this is how it works. We have to
go one day. I don’t want to spend the last hours hooked up to machines.
I’ll be very, very tired. I’ll just want to go home. I also won’t want
anybody around me to be sad. Hopefully, I’ll feel that I lived a good
life, that I had a good time, that the people I spend my time with were
decent people, worthy of the short time I was given. I hope that I will
be able to let go and be at peace. It’s what I hear about my stepfather.
</p>
<p>
But when I sit in that family video call, with siblings in Portugal and
Germany and my mother, and one after another people start crying,
choking up, it’s hard. It’s that invisible choker, grabbing us, one
after another.
</p>
<p>
I need to remember the good times, the conversations we had, the
laughter we shared. I need to book a flight and see the rest of our
family. All that independence and all that living abroad is coming back
to haunt us, now.
</p>
<p>
To go and support each other.
</p>
<p>
Go and hug your loved ones.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Family">#Family</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-05-27</strong>. I arrived today. He didn’t look good at
all. In fact, he seemed to be barely holding on to life. Sleeping,
mostly. Occasionally, gasping for air, staring, maybe recognizing us,
saying a word or two. It was heartbreaking. He died the same day. The
doctor and the nurse came, two very friendly people. Removed the tubes,
stopped the Morphium machine, made his death official.
</p>
<p>
There were so many tears. A step brother, a half-brother, a half-sister,
my sister, my half-brother’s wife, their kid, my mom… the kid was the
only one that seemed unperturbed. “Don’t be sad, grandma!”
</p>
<p>
Later the funerary services came to pick up the body. Again, both of
them super nice. We’ll see how things go, tomorrow. My mother is not
feeling well. I seem to be doing OK. I can be strong when it’s not my
partner that has died.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy we were all there for him, singing songs, bringing him his
birthday cake (he died on his 78th birthday). I’m happy we were all
there for each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-05-28</strong>. Cremation today. The sun is out. People on
the radio.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-05-30</strong>. On the way home. It was good to see the
family again. I gave a little speech in Portuguese, explaining how the
language continues to remain important to us, even if we live a abroad,
and how hard it was for a family where people live in different
countries, alone – but also how our parents divorcing and marrying had
led to an ever growing family. There are more parents, more siblings,
and I love it and it helps. We can all help each other. And my deceased
stepfather was certainly an enrichment for our family, bringing anarchy
and lawlessness and laughter into a family that was rigid and regimented
and dour, and how we all grew with that and how it was important to
remember the good times we had and the lessons we all drew from his
presence. Truly, a great influence for all of us.
</p>
<p>
I still remember how I met him years before my mother met him. He lived
across the river alone with his son, wild and free and I was so jealous.
I wished to live like that! And then my parents divorced, my dad went
back to Switzerland and a year later I followed him and got to live wild
and free like them, it was amazing. And one day I came back and there
were rumours that our mother had found a boyfriend. Imagine my surprise
when it was him, the wild and free guitar playing dude from across the
river! And eventually my friend from school turned into my stepbrother,
moved in with my mom, lived in my room. It was mysterious and magical
and then to see him and his father struggle with my mom, the changes
they brought about, it was a miracle.
</p>
<p>
So, my man, wherever you are, here’s to you and your last trip, to your
guitars and flutes, your love of music and freedom, your spirit of
independence and love of people and aliens. Cheers! I hope to see you
again.

The Hailo-8L’s claim to fame is 3-4 TOPS/W efficiency, which, along with
the Pi’s 3-4W idle power consumption, puts it alongside Nvidia’s edge
devices like the Jetson Orin in terms of TOPS/$ and TOPS/W for price and
efficiency.

Google’s <a href="https://coral.ai">Coral TPU</a> has been a popular
choice for a machine learning/AI accelerator for the Pi for years now,

Coral hardware was scalped for a couple years about as badly as the

<h2 id="rebalancing-our-rest-api-traffic">Rebalancing our REST API
traffic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Since we first launched our REST API around 2013 as a Labs project, it
has evolved well beyond a prototype into arguably Crossref’s most
visible and valuable service. It is the result of 20,000 organisations
around the world that have worked for many years to curate and share
metadata about their various resources, from research grants to research
articles and other component inputs and outputs of research.
</p>
<p>
The REST API is relied on by a large part of the research information
community and beyond, seeing around 1.8 billion requests each month.
Just five years ago, that average monthly number was 600 million. Our
members are the heaviest users, using it for all kinds of information
about their own records or picking up connections like citations and
other relationships. Databases, discovery tools, libraries, and
governments all use the API. Research groups use it for all sorts of
things such as analysing trends in science or recording retractions and
corrections.
</p>
<p>
So the chances are high that almost any tool you rely on in scientific
research has somewhere incorporated metadata through us.
</p>
<h2 id="optimising-performance">
Optimising performance
</h2>
<p>
For some time, we’ve been noticing reduced performance in a number of
ways, and periodically we have a flurry of manually blocking/unblocking
IP addresses from requesters that are hammering and degrading the
service for everyone else, and this is of course only minimally
effective and very short term. You can always watch our status page for
alerts. This is the current one about REST API performance:
<a href="https://status.crossref.org/incidents/d7k4ml9vvswv" target="_blank">https://status.crossref.org/incidents/d7k4ml9vvswv</a>.
</p>
<p>
As the number of users and requests has grown, our strategies for
serving those requests must evolve. This post discusses how we’re
approaching balancing the growth in usage for the immediate term and
provides some thoughts about things we could try in the future on which
we’ll gladly take feedback and advice.
</p>
<h3 id="load-balancing">
Load balancing
</h3>
<p>
In 2018, we started routing users through three different pools
(<em>public</em>, <em>polite</em>, and <em>plus</em>). This coincided
with the launch of
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus">Metadata
Plus</a>, a paid-for service with monthly data dumps and very high rate
limits. Note that all metadata is exactly the same and real-time across
all pools. We also, more recently, introduced an <em>internal</em> pool.
Here’s more about them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<em>Plus</em>: This is the aforementioned premium option; it’s really
for ‘enterprise-wide’ use in production services and is not really
relevant here.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Public</em>: This is the default and is the one that is struggling
at the moment. You don’t have to identify yourself and, in theory, we
don’t have to work through the night to support it if it’s struggling
(although we often do). <em>Public</em> currently receives around
<strong>30,000</strong> requests per minute.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Polite</em>: Traffic is routed to <em>polite</em> simply by
detecting a mailto in the header. Any system or person including an
email is being routed to a currently-quieter pool, this means we can
always get in touch for troubleshooting (and only troubleshooting).
<em>Polite</em> currently receives around <strong>5,000</strong>
requests per minute.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Internal</em>: In 2021, we introduced a new pool just for our own
tools where we can control and predict the traffic. <em>Internal</em>
currently receives around <strong>1,000</strong> requests per minute.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The volumes of traffic across <em>public</em>, <em>polite</em> and
<em>internal</em> pools are very different and yet each pool has always
had similar resources. The purpose of each of these pools has been
long-established but our efforts to ask the community to use
<em>polite</em> by default have not been particularly successful and it
is clear that we don’t have the right balance.
</p>
<p>
The <em>internal</em> pool has been dedicated to our internal services
that have predictable usage and that have requests that are not
initiated by external users. The <em>internal</em> pool has arbitrarily
included reference matching but not Crossmark, Event Data, or
search.crossref.org, which all use the <em>polite</em> pool instead,
along with the community. We have the capacity on the <em>internal</em>
pool to shift all of this “internal” traffic across, and in doing so we
will create more capacity for genuine <em>polite</em> users and redefine
what we consider to be “internal”.
</p>
<p>
Creating more capacity on <em>polite</em> will also give us the
opportunity to load-balance requests to both <em>polite</em> and
<em>public</em> across the two pools. We are at a point where we cannot
eke more performance out of the API without architectural changes. In
order to buy ourselves time to address this properly, we will modify the
routing of <em>polite</em> and <em>public</em> and evenly distribute
requests to the two pools 50/50.
</p>
<p>
The <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em> pools have equal resources at
the moment yet handle very different volumes of traffic (30,000 req/min
vs 5,000 req/min), and with the proposed changes to internal traffic the
<em>polite</em> pool would handle a fraction of this. The result would
look something like 31,000 req/min evenly distributed across
<em>public</em> and <em>polite</em>.
</p>
<h3 id="rate-limiting">
Rate limiting
</h3>
<p>
Our rate-limiting also needs review. We track a number of metrics in our
web proxy but only deny requests on one of them - the number of requests
per second. On <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em> we limit each IP
address to sending 50 req/sec and if this rate is exceeded users are
denied access for 10 seconds. These limits are generous and we cannot
realistically support this volume of request for all users of the
<em>public</em> or <em>polite</em> API.
</p>
<p>
However, when requests are taking a long time to return, we potentially
have a separate problem of high concurrency as hundreds of requests
could be sent before the first one has returned. We intend to identify
and impose an appropriate rate limit on concurrent requests from each IP
to prevent a small number of users from disproportionately affecting all
users with long-running queries.
</p>
<h3 id="longer-term">
Longer-term
</h3>
<p>
So, in the short-term we will revise our pool traffic as described
above. We’ll do that this week. Then we will review the current rate
limits and reduce them to something more reasonable for the majority of
users. And we’ll identify and introduce a rate limit for concurrent
requests from each user.
</p>
<p>
Longer-term, we need to rearchitect our Elasticsearch pools so that we
can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Reduce shard sizes to improve performance of queries
</li>
<li>
Balance data shards and replicas more evenly
</li>
<li>
Optimise our instance types for our workload
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="want-to-help">
Want to help?
</h2>
<p>
Thanks for asking!
</p>
<p>
Firstly, please, everyone, do always put an email in your API request
headers - while the short term plan will help stabilise performance,
this habit will always help us troubleshoot e.g. we can always contact
you instead of blocking you!
</p>
<p>
Secondly, we know many of you incorporate Crossref metadata, add lots of
value to it in order to deliver important services, and also develop
APIs of your own. We’d love any comments or recommendations from those
of you handling similar situations on scaling and optimising API
performance. You can comment on this post which is managed via our
Discourse forum. We’ll also be adding updates to this thread as well as
on status.crossref.org. If you’d like to be in touch with any of us
directly, all our emails are

Kling steps down from SerenityOS to focus entirely on the Ladybird
browser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve got some possibly sad, possibly great news. Today, Andreas
Kling, the amazing developer who started SerenityOS as a way to regain a
sense or normalcy after completing his drug rehab program, has announced
he’s stepping down as the ‘big dictator for life’ of the SerenityOS
project, handing leadership over the maintainer group. The other half of
the coin, however, is that Kling will officially fork Ladybird, the
cross-platform web browser that originated as part of SerenityOS,
turning it into a proper, separate project. Personally, for the past two
years, I’ve been almost entirely focused on Ladybird, a new web browser
that started as a simple HTML viewer for SerenityOS. When Ladybird
became a cross-platform project in 2022, I switched all my attention to
the Linux version, as testing on Linux was much easier and didn’t
require booting into SerenityOS. Time flew by, and now I can’t remember
the last time I worked on something in SerenityOS that wasn’t related to
Ladybird. ↫ Andreas Kling If you know a little bit about Kling’s career,
it’s not entirely surprising that his heart lies with working on a
browser engine. He originally worked at Nokia, and then at Apple in San
Francisco on WebKit, and there’s most likely some code that he’s written
in the browser you’re using right now (except, perhaps, for us Firefox
users). As such, it makes sense that once Ladybird grew into something
more than just a simple HTML viewer, he’d be focusing on it a lot. As
part of the fork, Ladybird will focus entirely on Linux and macOS, and
drop SerenityOS as a target. This may seem weird at first, but this is
an entirely amicable and planned step, as this allows Ladybird to adopt,
use, and integrate third party code, something SerenityOS does not
allow. In addition, many of these open source projects Ladybird couldn’t
really use anyway because they simply didn’t exist for SerenityOS in the
first place. This decision creates a lot of breathing room and
flexibility for both projects. Ladybird was getting a lot of attention
from outside of SerenityOS circles, from large donations to code
contributions. I’m not entirely surprised by this step, and I really
hope it’s going to be the beginning of something great. We really need
new and competitive browser engines to push the web forward, and
alongside Servo, it now seems Ladybird has also picked up the baton.
What this will mean for SerenityOS remains to be seen. As Kling said, he
hasn’t really been involved with SerenityOS outside of Ladybird work for
two years now, so it seems the rest of the contributors were already
doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I hope this doesn’t mean the project
will peter out, since it has a certain flair few other operating systems
have.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another month, another Redox progress report. The Rust-based
operating system, headed by system76 engineer Jeremy Soller, has made a
big move by replacing Redox’ Orbital file manager, text editor and
terminal by their COSMIC counterparts, COSMIC Files, COSMIC Editor and
COSMIC Terminal, in the default Redox installation. COSMIC is the
Rust-based desktop environment system76 is currently developing for
their Linux distribution, Pop!_OS. You really have to start wondering
what the long-term goals for Redox really are here. I’m not saying
they’re intending to replace Linux with it – that’d be suicide – but the
steady progress towards a general purpose operating system is
undeniable.</p>

<h2 id="libadwaita-splitting-gtk-and-design-language">Libadwaita:
splitting GTK and design language</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s no denying that not everyone is happy with the state of the
GTK world, and I, too, have argued that GNOME’s massive presence and
seeming unwillingness to cooperate with or even consider the existence
of other GTK-based desktop environments is doing real, measurable harm
to the likes of Xfce, Cinnamon, and others. A major root cause is a
feeling that GTK is nothing but a vessel for GNOME, and that the project
doesn’t really seem to care much about anyone else. GNOME Foundation
member and all-round very kind person Hari Rana, also known as
TheEvilSkeleton, penned a blog post highlighting the other side of the
story. In essence, what it comes down to, according to Rana, is that
it’s better for everyone if GNOME-specific widgets are moved out of GTK,
and into something else – first libhandy, and now its succesor
libadwaita, splitting the toolkit (GTK) from the design language
(libadwaita). This allows GNOME developers to focus on, well, GNOME, and
frees up time for GTK developers to focus on generic widgets that aren’t
specific to GNOME. Thanks to the removal of GNOME widgets from GTK 4,
GTK developers can continue to work on general-purpose widgets, without
being influenced or restricted in any way by the GNOME HIG. Developers
of cross-platform GTK 3 apps that rely exclusively on general-purpose
widgets can be more confident that GTK 4 won’t remove these widgets, and
hopefully enjoy the benefits that GTK 4 offers. ↫ Hari Rana From a GNOME
standpoint, this makes perfect sense, and I can obviously see the
benefits for them. However, what this entire post seems to ignore is
that the main effect of the split between GTK 4 and libadwaita is that
various GTK applications, now targeting libadwaita because of GNOME’s
immense popularity, simply no longer integrate very well with other
desktops, like Xfce or Cinnamon. GNOME is, of course, under no
obligation to remedy this situation, but at the very least they could
acknowledge this is a very real problem that their fellow developers
working on Xfce, Cinnamon, MATE, and others, have to deal with. It works
the other way around too. Developers targeting the Linux desktop, where
GNOME is more or less the default, have to choose between making a GTK
application that integrates well with GNOME by opting for libadwaita and
leaving non-GNOME users with a crappy experience, or opting for ‘pure’
GTK 4 and leaving GNOME users with a worse experience. Neither option is
good for the Linux desktop as a whole. The very real ripple effects of
GNOME’s choices regarding GTK and libadwaita are seemingly being
stubbornly ignored, neglected, and often not even acknowledged at all,
and it’s no surprise this creates an immense amount of friction in the
wider desktop Linux community. It just feels smug and careless, and of
course that’s going to rub people the wrong way- regardless of the
purity of your intentions.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Months ago I ranted about &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search&quot;&gt;Arc Search&lt;/a&gt;. My thoughts on the subject have not changed. Not long after that post, the fun people at The Browser Company released a teaser video for an upcoming 5 video series called “WE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT”. And guess what? My blog post made a brief cameo in the trailer, right after Casey Newton, something I found amusing. Anyway, the series was supposed to make fun of all the people who criticise what TBC is doing with their Arc browser and highlight all the reasons why they’re not going to make it. I guess that’s because they’re so confident in their product and are probably sure that they will, in fact, make it, whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Well, it’s June. The teaser video came out on March 21st, the second
episode on March 22nd, and the third on April 4th. I’m still waiting for
a new one to come out but I guess they might not make it to the end of
their planned 5 videos series. Oh well.
</p>
<p>
Unrelated but can I just say that I find the name of the company itself
quite baffling? It’s called The Browser Company but what they make is a
wrapper around the Chromium web browser. So the browser company is
making everything but the actual browser. Can you imagine starting a
company called “the pizza company” and then outsourcing the pizza part
to a 3rd party? So bizarre.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, TBC people, if you’re reading this, I look forward to your next
video about how you “ruined the internet” and also very much look
forward to the one about how you “listen to your members” considering
you never replied to the two emails I sent to your support.

<p>One of the flaws in the design of Teslas is they are really difficult
to operate safely for people who are farsighted, such as myself. A lot
of the
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/03/teslascreen.png">status
messages</a> are too small for me to read without reading glasses, and
in the time it takes to put them on the message is gone. Esp frustrating
for the messages that tell you to do this or that to keep using FSD. And
when I’m flipping the glasses down, my eyes are not on the road Mr or Ms
Tesla. This is a design problem. Maybe you should use voice prompts for
this kind of stuff. Or use a camera to see if my hands are on the
wheel.</p>

keep coming back to this – ChatGPT is a vast library that comes with its
own librarian. And the librarian has read and digested all of it, and
can give you useful and usually exactly right summaries (despite what
the critics say) in an instant. I’ve been using libraries my whole life,
going back to when I was a child. I worked with card catalogs and
non-virtual book collections. Archives of news on film. View ChatGPT on
that timeline and you’ll see its significance. You didn’t write it, I
didn’t. Each of us may have contributed a little, and <i>isn’t that what
we want?</i> To help build the base of human knowledge? It gives our
lives meaning. Sometimes I wonder how much value people place on
themselves and so little on progress. I think we all want our lives to
have meaning. Well here you go, it doesn’t get more meaningful than
this.</p>

<p>Another great application for ChatGPT. Try to find a blog post or
article about the design of a language that gets to what you want to
know without wading through a lot of stuff you don’t care about. I got
it to explain Swift, Go and Rust quickly. Okay now I know what they’re
doing. It would have taken me days to assemble this, and I never have
that kind of time for such execursions.</p>

unveils Ryzen 9000 CPUs for desktop, Zen 5 takes center stage at
Computex 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>In regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC
increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop
Ryzen chips’ turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their
Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance
expectations for the new chips. The AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also
launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD’s Ryzen 7000 series and
marks AMD’s commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the
Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the
X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features
that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain
tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the
X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe
storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than
previous generations. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech I absolutely love
that AMD maintains compatibility with its chipset and socket generations
as well as it does. I’m currently running a Ryzen 9 7900X, and I see no
reason to upgrade any time soon, but it’s good to know I’ll at least
have otions once the time comes. Compare this to Intel, which broke
compatibility pretty much intentionally almost every generation for
years now, and this is a huge win for consumers. Of course, as AMD
regains more and more of its foothold across the market, it will
eventually also resort to the kind of tactics Intel has been using while
it pretty much had the market to itself. It’s only a matter of time
before we’ll see the first new Ryzen generation that mysteriously
requires a new socket or chipset out of the blue.</p>

<p>We should apply mathematics to language design. The goal of the
language should be maximum simplicity for the human developer. As much
of the complexity as possible should be handled by software, either at
compile-time or runtime. It should strive to read like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>. We
started out writing code by toggling switches on the front panel of the
computer, and for a few decades we were factoring and making it simpler
with every iteration, but then we turned around in the other direction.
I am from the church of factoring. I do it in my designs of products at
all levels, and I treat languages with the same care. It turns out all
the rules of working on open systems also apply to language design. I
plan to write more about this.</p>

a secure embedded operating system for microcontrollers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Tock is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple
concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V
based embedded platforms. Tock’s design centers around protection, both
from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock
uses two mechanisms to protect different components of the operating
system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in Rust, a
systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety
and type safety. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (e.g. the
scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device
drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock
uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and
the kernel. ↫ Tock GitHub page We’ve never featured Tock on OSNews
before, as far as I can tell, which seems odd considering it’s been
around for a while. The most recent release stems from January 2023, so
a short while ago, but that’s not too surprising considering the target
audience of this embedded operating system. It’s licensed under either
Apache or MIT.</p>

We spent this month moving northward through both southern and northern
British Columbia. We’ve been moving almost every day, stopping every
night to anchor, sleep and recuperate. Sailing near land is not as
relaxing as sailing offshore, this reef-strewn coast requires careful
navigation. We’ve had many long days of endless tacking from one side of
the channel to the other, almost all the way to Port McNeill, then after
that we started to get more weather from the south for some mostly
pleasant, but cold and rainy, downwind sailing. We’ve been using our
woodstove a lot, in evenings it helps warm the boat after a long sail.
</p>
<p>
On May 29th, 623 nautical miles miles after leaving Victoria, we arrived
in Prince Rupert, our last major port in British Columbia before we head
north to Southeast Alaska. Then, on June 2nd, we arrived in Ketchikan,
Southeast Alaska. Most of our updates this month detail some of the
places we’ve been(see the above list). To see our path, look at
<a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.htm">Western Canada</a> and

update the map as we find internet.

We’ve seen sea otters, lots of humpback whales, two pods of orcas(one
pod had a baby tagging along), eagles, and lots of mountains. In other

people who say you get wrong answers from ChatGPT, if I wanted my car to
kill me I could drive into oncoming traffic. If I wanted my calculator
to give me incorrect results I could press the wrong keys. In other
words, ChatGPT is a very new tool. It can be hard to control, you have
to check what it says, and try different questions. But the result, if
you pay attention and don’t drive it under the wheels of a bus, is that
you can do things you never could do before.</p>

<p>
In 1,610 words, almost nothing of substance was written.

<p>
A lot about how it’s not 2014 anymore, so 2014-era architecture doesn’t
suit AWX. Then a big bold disclaimer at the bottom:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Before we conclude, we should be clear about what will not happen.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We are not changing the Ansible project
</li>
<li>
We are not adjusting our OSS license structure
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ultimately, we need to make some changes to the way our systems work and
our projects are structured. Not a rewrite but a refactoring and
restructuring of how some of the core components connect and communicate
with each other.

Mossberg shows</a> why ChatGPT is such a conversation-starter, and thus
is incredible art. He asked it to draw a picture of himself with Kara
Swisher. Of course everyone did that, and posted the result to the
thread. The variety of responses is amazing, revealing of what I’m not
sure. Here’s

<p>I bet you could do a beautifully readable blog by just dynamically
rendering its RSS feed. Why bother statically rendering the home page,
month page, day page or pages for each individual post. Dynamic servers
are so cheap these days.</p>

a lot of stuff in Friday’s piece. Ken Smith pointed out the story in the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/31/123255.html#a125308">very last
postscript</a>. Before that, I hadn’t put it together that podcasting
worked because for a while Adam did my job, and for a while I did his.
That guaranteed two things – that the technology would be maximally
simple, and that anyone with a computer could do the whole recording and
production job without help from an expensive studio. In both cases the
result was nowhere near commercial standards, but that didn’t matter, in
fact it helped that there were so many glitches in my early podcasts,
that said that hey if this guy can do it, so can I.</p>

<h2 id="this-message-does-not-exist">This message does not exist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>The act of discarding a message that does not exist must therefore do
one of two things. It may cause the message contents to also cease to
exist. Alternately, it might not affect the existence but only the
accessibility of message contents. Perhaps they continue to exist, but
discarding the message (which already did not exist) causes the copy
operation to cease being invokable on the message contents (even though
they do continue to exist). The story of existence has many mysteries. ↫
Mark J. Nelson The one question that can really break my brain in a way
that is feels like it’s physically hurting – which it can’t, because,
fun fact, there’s no pain receptors in the brain – is the question what
exists outside of the universe? Any answer you can come up with just
leads to more questions which just lead to more questions, in an
infinite loop of possible answers and questions that the human mind is
not equipped to grasp. Anyway, it turns out using Outook can lead to the
same existential crises.</p>
