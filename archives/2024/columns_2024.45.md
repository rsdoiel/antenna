## 2024-11-10 Weltensegler

date: 2024-11-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-10-weltensegler">2024-11-10 Weltensegler</h1>

<p>Weil wir letzthin im <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/Internet%20Office%20Hours">Internet Office Hours Podcast</a> wieder √ºber Traveller geredet haben und davon geredet, dass wir ein kurzes, einfaches Regelwerk brauchen. <a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@hasran" title="@hasran@rollenspiel.social">@hasran</a> meinte zu Beginn der Sendung: Schreiben wir einen Traveller Klon und wann tun wir das?</p>

<p>Jetzt haben wir damit angefangen. Ich habe es <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/index">Weltensegler</a> genannt.</p>

<p>Unser Zielbild, f√ºr den Moment:</p>

<p>Hasran: &ldquo;Als Spiel soll Weltensegler erm√∂glichen, eigene Welten und Abenteuer im Stile klassischer Science Fiction Literatur erlebbar zu machen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ich: &ldquo;Weltensegler soll ein relativ kurzes 2W6 basiertes Science Fiction Rollenspiel sein, auf Deutsch, f√ºr alles von Star Wars bis Perry Rhodan, von Star Trek bis Dune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wir sind beide grosse Fans vom urspr√ºnglichen Classic Traveller Ger√ºst. Also haben wir damit mal angefangen: <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/figuren">Personagenerschaffung</a>, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/erfahrung">Berufserfahrung</a>, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/karriere">Karrieren</a>. Es fehlen noch ein paar Tabellen aber grunds√§tzlich steht schon einiges. Und wenn wir nicht weiter wissen, hilft uns <a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@wandererbill" title="@wandererbill@tabletop.social">@wandererbill</a> mit Traveller 5 Erfahrung. üòÑ</p>

<p>Allerdings habe ich f√ºr mich beschlossen, dass ich f√ºr Weltensegler bei den Regeln bleiben will, die ich am Tisch schon verwendet habe. Erstaunlicherweise waren das nie die Preislisten. Viel wichtiger war der Tech Level der Welt und das wars. Ausr√ºstung war geschenkt, gesponsert, geklaut, aus dem Ship Locker, oder aus der Lebensgeschichte heraus gegeben. Ich glaube, ich habe als Spieler nur einmal eine Sonnenbrille f√ºr 100 Cr. gekauft, mehr nicht. Entsprechend habe ich unter Ausr√ºstung eine Seite f√ºr <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/view/weltensegler/feudalismus">Wirtschaft ohne Geld</a> erstellt.</p>

<p>Entsprechend habe ich auch noch nie ein Schiff nach den Regeln zusammengebaut. Mal schauen, wie es bei Hasran aussieht. Ich glaube jedenfalls, dass er schon gerne Preislisten h√§tte.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that what's missing in the two-party system in the US is that one of the parties does not own a social network. It is not represented online 7-by-24-by-12 every year, not just presidential election years. Democrats, when you lose it's because you didn't show up. It's happened three times so far, at least. We could have led here because most of the innovators in this space vote Democratic, but the leadership doesn't listen. The voters could get to know all the stars of the parties. People were right when they said they didn't know Harris. It's time to let the leaders rise from the net, not just from the insiders. This is how you do it.

## 2024-11-06 What a nightmare

date: 2024-11-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-06-what-a-nightmare">2024-11-06 What a nightmare</h1>

<p>I really hoped that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to extend the link list on Trump I started <a href="2016-11-14_Trump">back in 2016</a> because I didn&rsquo;t understand how he could win.</p>

<p>Then again, I also didn&rsquo;t understand why Bush got re-elected.
I just read a 20 year old blog post of mine: <a href="2004-11-09_USA">2004-11-09 USA</a> where I was grappling with it.</p>

<p>Trump is truly a setback for my <a href="priorities">priorities</a>.</p>

<p>Fuck this timeline.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mstdn.social/@mattwilcox" title="@mattwilcox@mstdn.social">@mattwilcox</a> said it best:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fascism is the inevitable result of a society with large imbalances of personal security. Which in a capitalist society means large imbalances of wealth.</p>

<p>If your society allows some people to be mega secure and untouchable, while also allowing large portions of it to feel very insecure&hellip; you will become a fascist society, eventually.</p>

<p>Do not allow this. Do not allow excessive wealth stratification. It. will. Destroy. Your. Civilisation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best defence against many divisive issues is to solve them.
To leave festering wounds invites further prodding by the troll armies.
Start small but start early, because soon the prodders are in power, prodding ever harder until it all falls apart.</p>

<p>Remember that these days, all dictators are voted in.
The elections may be a farce, but it&rsquo;s always a legal farce.
The people in power may be the most corrupt criminals but ever and always they are the ones fighting corruption.
It&rsquo;s just that the corruption of their enemies is always uncovered and punished whereas their own is hidden in plain sight, know to all.</p>

<p>Look around at the countries around you.
Erdoƒüan is still in power.
Putin is still in power.
Dictatorships may end eventually, but they take a fucking long time to fall.
If it takes forty years, I won&rsquo;t be around to see it.
It&rsquo;s hard to wait them out.</p>

<p>If you meet somebody thinking about a civil war with armed militia doing this or that, I&rsquo;d say forget about all of that.
In the real world, revolts that are not decisive inevitably lead to warlordism.
Organised armed forces will shoot all the wanna-be resistance to bits.
The police will beat the unarmed resistances into submission.</p>

<p>I take solace in the fact that when Stalin was dying and calling for help in his office, the attendants just didn&rsquo;t listen.
They didn&rsquo;t open the door and the fucker died alone.</p>

## Future of AR is in Your Ears

date: 2024-11-09, from: Om Malik blog

Dennis Crowley&#160;has built his career at the intersection of emerging technologies and human behavior. Twenty years ago, as a 25-year-old inspired by Harry Potter&#8217;s Marauder&#8217;s Map, he created Dodgeball‚Äîturning text messaging into a way for friends to find each other in the city. When the iPhone emerged, he launched Foursquare, riding the convergence of GPS, &#8230;

I'd like to hear from tech vendors, asap, which ones will help American voters learn what's true independent of whatever "truth" the government wants us to believe? Who will stand with the people? A good question for all of us to ask. Ask news orgs the same question.

Since we now understand that most of the information flow now goes around the NYT, CNN etc -- even Fox, and largely through social web and podcasts, if that's where we're all getting our news from, and btw MSNBC are already pretty well limited in what they'll tell us (this was our beef with NYT if you recall) -- the next step is to make it impossible for us to hear what each other are saying. Now is the time to plant seeds for a defense of our speech and communication later.

## Why Raspberry Pi for an SBC guy

<p>If anyone asks why I prefer to work with Raspberry Pis when I want to tinker on a random project, consider:</p>

<p>I just spent the past hour with a brand new ArmSoM Sige7 board (<a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/56">see my debugging notes in my <code>sbc-reviews</code> repo</a>). This SBC has been on the market for months, with <a href="https://www.electronics-lab.com/armsom-sige7-review-a-rockchip-rk3588-sbc-with-dual-2-5gbe-ethernet-nvme-storage-and-triple-display-output/">glowing reviews</a> all the way back in May...</p></div>

One way to do it is with my product <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>. It manages news streams for feeds you subscribe to. I think every publication should share news from feeds they depend on, experts they quote, other news sources they read. We can build our own networks this way. The advantage of this approach is that it is truly decentralized and not at all complicated to use. Here's the <a href="https://news.scripting.com/">news stream</a> I provide for readers of my blog. It's the most popular feature on the site. With FeedLand you can <a href="https://docs.feedland.com/newsproducts.md">create your own</a>.

## Home Assistant and CarPlay with the Pi Touch Display 2

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Home Assistant and CarPlay with the Pi Touch Display 2</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>After a decade, Raspberry Pi <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-touch-display-2-on-sale-now-at-60/">finally upgraded their official Touch Display</a> from 480p to 720p, while keeping the price and overall aesthetic the same.</p>

<p>I've had early access to the Touch Display 2, and have been testing it in a variety of scenarios. Generally, Linux touchscreen support isn't wonderful. And Pi OS, being a fairly customized UI focused on simple use cases, is not quite to a usable state if you go touchscreen-only, considering I had trouble getting the onscreen keyboard to work in Chromium half the time, and it would overlay things I was typing even in fully-supported apps like Terminal.</p></div>

## Democratic mistakes

date: 2024-11-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I've actually written a lot, but haven't wanted to publish most of it. So many reasons why the Dems lost. Maybe I should just list them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Biden shouldn't have run again. There would have been a primary. Given the result of the election this week, we should have found out what support each candidate had with voters. We didn't get to choose the candidate. That said Harris ran a fantastic campaign. </li>
<li>Biden should not have shut down his campaign website. Rather than using it to raise money to feed to the media industry, they should have organized and listened, to develop new channels of communication with voters that were not dependent on journalism. Every time the Dems run a campaign, win or lose, they shut down their connection to the electorate. The voters' only role in the party was when they needed our money and our vote. <b>We were not part of governing</b>. Huge mistake. And I'm not just saying that now, I've said that about every Democratic campaign since Obama. This is probably the biggest single mistake the Dems keep making.</li>
<li>We needed a prosecutor at the top of Justice. I don't know what Garland actually did, but I'm sure it will all be swept out by whoever is Trump's AG. </li>
<li>Men's votes need to be sought and welcomed, specifically. So much has been done to alienate male voters, which is why so many voted for Trump. We could have had a bunch of them this year, if we had only spoken to them with respect. </li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know if we can reboot the Democrats as an opposition party given all these problems. Whatever comes next is going to perform very differently from the party that lost this election. If we try to do it again the same old way, it will fail even worse. I think everyone knows this by now. </p>

## Prompt Injection Defenses Against LLM Cyberattacks

date: 2024-11-07, updated: 2024-11-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20911">Hacking Back the AI-Hacker: Prompt Injection as a Defense Against LLM-driven Cyberattacks</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being harnessed to automate cyberattacks, making sophisticated exploits more accessible and scalable. In response, we propose a new defense strategy tailored to counter LLM-driven cyberattacks. We introduce Mantis, a defensive framework that exploits LLMs&#8217; susceptibility to adversarial inputs to undermine malicious operations. Upon detecting an automated cyberattack, Mantis plants carefully crafted inputs into system responses, leading the attacker&#8217;s LLM to disrupt their own operations (passive defense) or even compromise the attacker&#8217;s machine (active defense). By deploying purposefully vulnerable decoy services to attract the attacker and using dynamic prompt injections for the attacker&#8217;s LLM, Mantis can autonomously hack back the attacker. In our experiments, Mantis consistently achieved over 95% effectiveness against automated LLM-driven attacks. To foster further research and collaboration, Mantis is available as an open-source tool: ...</p></blockquote>

## Subverting LLM Coders

date: 2024-11-07, updated: 2024-11-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Really interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-yan.pdf">An LLM-Assisted Easy-to-Trigger Backdoor Attack on Code Completion Models: Injecting Disguised Vulnerabilities against Strong Detection<a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code com-<br />
pletion tasks, providing context-based suggestions to boost developer productivity in software engineering. As users often fine-tune these models for specific applications, poisoning and backdoor attacks can covertly alter the model outputs. To address this critical security challenge, we introduce CODEBREAKER, a pioneering LLM-assisted backdoor attack framework on code completion models. Unlike recent attacks that embed malicious payloads in detectable or irrelevant sections of the code (e.g., comments), CODEBREAKER leverages LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for sophisticated payload transformation (without affecting functionalities), ensuring that both the poisoned data for fine-tuning and generated code can evade strong vulnerability detection. CODEBREAKER stands out with its comprehensive coverage of vulnerabilities, making it the first to provide such an extensive set for evaluation. Our extensive experimental evaluations and user studies underline the strong attack performance of CODEBREAKER across various settings, validating its superiority over existing approaches. By integrating malicious payloads directly into the source code with minimal transformation, CODEBREAKER challenges current security measures, underscoring the critical need for more robust defenses for code completion...</p></blockquote></a></a>

Final note (I think). The pain you feel at first may abate. It did for me. I had pushed down memories of 2020 and 2021. It was a horror show, and Trump was the main character. So the first thing I had to deal with is that I don't want to remember that. Too painful. But once I realized that's not where we are right now, it's a totally different situation, that's when the creative impulse rose as the pain receded. We have one short term thing to do -- keep the campaign running, and long term we have to recognize division we add, and counteract it. We are the party that welcomes everyone regardless or race, religion, country of origin, age or gender. <i>All</i> of them. No exceptions. The election result represents big change. And it's a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/10/21/bruceSterlingAtReboot.html">good time</a> to make more changes.

<p>Here&rsquo;s something to watch out for, if you&rsquo;re like me: Disable all the infrastructure that watches over your processes. In my case, the problem was Monit. It checks the website every five minutes and if it fails to connect for three times in a row it restarts the server, breaking the migration. üò≠</p>

<pre><code>systemctl stop gotosocial
# prevent systemctl from restarting it
systemctl disable gotosocial
# prevent monit from interrupting the migration with a restart!
monit unmonitor gotosocial
# backup!
mkdir backup
cp sqlite.db backup/
</code></pre>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to extract the new version over the old one, compare your config file with the example provided, and start it again.</p>

<pre><code>systemctl enable gotosocial
systemctl start gotosocial
journalctl --unit gotosocial --follow
</code></pre>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be like me and start Monit because my Monit config checks the URL every five minutes and restarts GoToSocial if the site is not up. Which is a big problem if migration takes more than a handful of minutes.</p>

<p>I ended up with a borked migration restart loop and ended up stopping it all again, overwriting the borked database file with the backup, and redoing it.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23GoToSocial">#GoToSocial</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-10-28</strong>. Another thing to note for the GoToSocial upgrade is that I ran 16.0 using a systemd MemoryMax of 200M; today the upgraded instance with 17.1 ran fine for a while and then locked up. A restart didn&rsquo;t bring it back. It remained stuck after a log message saying &ldquo;compiling WebAssembly&rdquo;. I increased MemoryMax to 300M, no change. I increased it to 500M and the instance came up. Just in case you&rsquo;re as memory-stingy as I am&hellip;</p>

<p>In order to avoid future compilation, <a class="account" href="https://gts.superseriousbusiness.org/@dumpsterqueer" title="@dumpsterqueer@superseriousbusiness.org">@dumpsterqueer</a> pointed me at this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can instruct GoToSocial on where to store the Wazero artifacts by setting the environment variable <code>GTS_WAZERO_COMPILATION_CACHE</code> to a directory, which will be used by GtS to store two smallish artifacts of ~50MiB or so each (~100MiB total). ‚Äì <a href="https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/configuration/#gts_wazero_compilation_cache">Configuration Overview</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try that.</p>

<p>It looks like a side-effect of GoToSocial implementing the direct messages API is that the Toot! App I&rsquo;m using is showing me all my former direct messages using it&rsquo;s special user interface (those bubbles on the right hand side). I have to open every single one of them to dismiss it. ü§®</p>

<p><strong>2024-10-29</strong>. Today I read that the botsin.space instance was shutting down.
I figured I might start thinking about creating a second account for my blog on my own instance.
I tried to run <code>./gotosocial admin account create</code> a few times, forgetting this or that parameter.
And then I noticed that the replies I saw scrolling by always ended in an error message.
In fact, there were more such error messages in my log files: &ldquo;database disk image is malformed&rdquo; üò±</p>

<p>The <code>.recover</code> command didn&rsquo;t work when I tried it:</p>

<pre><code># sqlite3 sqlite.db &quot;.recover&quot; | sqlite3 new.db
sql error: SQL logic error (1)
</code></pre>

<p>So then I tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>monit unmonitor gotosocial
systemctl stop gotosocial
sqlite3 sqlite.db &quot;.dump&quot; &gt; db.sql
mkdir backup
mv sqlite.db backup/
sudo -u gotosocial sqlite3 sqlite.db &lt; db.sql
gzip backup/sqlite.db
gzip db.sql
</code></pre>

<p>Some errors that I saw:</p>

<p>A few lines about accounts with no account_uri even though that was a NOT NULL column.</p>

<p>Many, many such lines:</p>

<pre><code>no such table: sqlite_stat4
</code></pre>

<p>Then this one:</p>

<pre><code>NOT NULL constraint failed: conversations.thread_id (19)
</code></pre>

<p>I started to feel bad about the whole thing.</p>

<p>I aborted the operation. The gzip command hadn&rsquo;t finished, yet.
I restored the old database file.</p>

<pre><code>mv backup/sqlite.db .
systemctl start gotosocial
</code></pre>

<p>As it turns out, now my GoToSocial instance seems to be unreachable.
The service starts, <code>htop</code> shows processes churning.
The log shows i/o timeouts and &ldquo;No Content: wrote 0B&rdquo; log messages scrolling by.
Oof!
üòì</p>

<p>Looking at the timestamps again, it seems that the recovery command left a <code>sqlite.db-shm</code> and a <code>sqlite.db-wal</code> file in place.</p>

<pre><code>-rw-r--r--     1 gotosocial gotosocial 10445488128 29. Okt 22:47 sqlite.db
-rw-r--r--     1 gotosocial gotosocial       32768 29. Okt 23:19 sqlite.db-shm
-rw-r--r--     1 gotosocial gotosocial      341992 29. Okt 23:19 sqlite.db-wal
</code></pre>

<p>That can&rsquo;t be right. So I&rsquo;m going to stop <code>gotosocial</code>, move these two files away, and start it again.</p>

<p>Sadly, no luck.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is a database recovery going on? I can&rsquo;t tell. This time around I see the typical startup messages, something about &ldquo;recovered queued tasks&rdquo;, about 12 requests that look like regular requests, and then nothing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll let it run for a bit.</p>

<p>I restarted it again. It seems to work?</p>

<p><strong>2024-10-30</strong>. The database is still corrupt in some way. There are a lot of errors. Here are two examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>error dereferencing remote status ‚Ä¶ : enrichStatus: failed to dereference status author ‚Ä¶ : enrichAccount: error putting in database: sqlite3: database disk image is malformed (code=11 extended=11)</p>

<p>0xc0091c61e0: error processing: CreateAnnounce: error dereferencing announce: EnrichAnnounce: error fetching boost target ‚Ä¶ : enrichStatus: failed to dereference status author ‚Ä¶ : enrichAccount: error putting in database: sqlite3: database disk image is malformed (code=11 extended=11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s something about these authors that&rsquo;s not working.</p>

<p>The code in <code>account.go</code>:</p>

<pre><code>// This is new, put it in the database.
err := d.state.DB.PutAccount(ctx, latestAcc)
if err != nil {
	return nil, nil, gtserror.Newf(&quot;error putting in database: %w&quot;, err)
}
</code></pre>

<p>I feel that this is where things are going wrong. Something about the accounts table.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to make an offline copy of the <code>sqlite.db</code> file. Sadly the <code>.recover</code> doesn&rsquo;t work on my laptop, either.</p>

<pre><code>$ sqlite3 sqlite.db &quot;.recover&quot; &gt; data.sql
sql error: SQL logic error (1)
</code></pre>

<p>Not looking good! I&rsquo;m going to try the dump.</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3 sqlite.db &quot;.dump&quot; &gt; data.sql
sqlite3 recovery.db &lt; data.sql 2&gt;&amp;1 |tee recovery.log
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the log file and list the errors!</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Occurences</th>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">454</td>
<td>Runtime error</td>
<td>UNIQUE constraint failed: media_attachments.id</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">69</td>
<td>Runtime error</td>
<td>NOT NULL constraint failed: accounts.uri</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">2111</td>
<td>Parse error</td>
<td>no such table: sqlite_stat4</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="left">1</td>
<td>Runtime error</td>
<td>NOT NULL constraint failed: conversations.thread_id</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I ended up filing <a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues/3499">an issue</a>.</p>

<p>And then, later that day, I used <code>.dump</code>. This time around, there was a <code>COMMIT</code> at the end of the dump, so no change was required.</p>

<pre><code>sqlite3 sqlite.db &quot;.dump&quot; &gt; data.sql
tail data.sql  # verify that there is a COMMIT at the end
sqlite3 recovery.db &lt; data.sql 2&gt;&amp;1 |tee recovery.log
rsync --archive --itemize-changes recovery.db &quot;sibirocobombus.root:/home/gotosocial/sqlite.db&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The recovery log showed all the errors mentioned above, and I used the new database anyway.</p>

<p><strong>2024-10-31</strong>. Currently the instance is locking up every few minutes, as far as I can tell. üò∞</p>

<p><strong>2024-11-06</strong>. The instance has been stable these days!</p>

## (The Day After) Field Notes

The chatbots-as-search paradigm encourages us to just accept answers as given, especially when they are stated in terms that are both friendly and authoritative. The chatbot interface invites you to just sit back and take the appealing-looking AI slop as if it were &#8220;information.&#8221; Emily Bender, Prof, Linguistics, UW By The Numbers Worth Reading&#160; R.I.P&#160; &#8230;

Also to the Twitter founders, amassing that much power and centralizing it as Twitter did, had a cost that we're paying now. But it's very hard to stop when the juggernaut is rolling. I understand, but in the future we have to think about this more clearly. <b>When a medium becomes too big and centralized, there's trouble ahead</b>. It was accidental that Trump was the one to take advantage of this to route around journalism and go direct, but it was not accidential that Musk did.

Speaking of Musk, maybe he will temper Trump's desire for retribution. It may be a vain hope, but I'll cling to it anyway. Doing business in a world of retribution might not be too conducive to the creativity needed to run innovative tech businesses. A climate of fear doesn't inspire great software. I know the quality of products Musk makes, I own and love my Tesla Model Y. Best car I've ever owned or driven.

Ben Thompson wrote in his <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a> newsletter: "What is fascinating is how this fundamentally transforms any attempt to evaluate the Twitter acquisition. From a business perspective it‚Äôs a massive failure, and might always be: Musk paid too much for Twitter as it was, and in the intervening years the flight of advertisers from the platform has made it worth even less. From a Musk Inc. perspective, however, X played a pivotal role in ensuring that the incoming administration will do whatever Musk needs at the exact moment that SpaceX is gaining the capabilities to actually make a trip to Mars, if only the FAA in particular will give him the freedom to do so. That alone is almost certainly worth $44 billion to Musk!" I wrote in 2017, that <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">some Repub would buy Twitter</a>, and it would merge and thus transform politics and tech. This was obvious, but for some reason I was the only one who saw it. We could have headed this off, if people would just listen. I beg you to listen to people you don't usually listen to. The NYT will never hire someone like me to write on their op-ed page, so if you only accept your input from people with legit credentials, you'll miss insights like this. We're paying a heavy price for this now. When I begged people to listen they came back with the balance sheet valuation of Twitter, but they were leaving the most important asset off the balance sheet, the dollar value of being able to elect a president. Musk <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/31.html#a140612">didn't</a> miss this.

I recommended it yesterday as inspirational. Now that we know the outcome of the election, it's a marker of where we were before the results were known. A world that no longer exists. But like stories written in 2016, the markers are useful to see where we once were and how we got here, and what we can learn from what happened between. I wish it had turned out the way these two great friends thought it should have. But it didn't. But there was a hint that they knew what wouldn't work this time. No spoilers.

Be generous with all classes of people, by gender, age, race, religion, whatever is used to divide us. Stop <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vilifying">vilifying</a> men. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/11/05/don-lemon-james-carville-democrats-stupid-wokeness-newday-vpx.cnn">Carville was right</a>. There's no reason to make one whole gender the scapegoat for all our problems. It's no accident that the Repubs own the men. We could probably have had ten percent or more of their voters if we stopped doing this. Key point, when you blame a whole gender, you hurt people who have no power to stop it.

Blame is pointless. It may be emotionally satisfying at some level, but it is division, and that's why we keep losing elections. We don't see it but we create our own divisions. This must stop.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-11-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

First thing -- <b>Don't shut down the campaign</b>. We must keep communicating with the electorate, independent of what they get from the news orgs. The Harris campaign did an exemplary job. Why shut it down. Keep setting the agenda. Help keep us organized. Preserve the perspective and expectation of democracy in the US. Change the message from raising money, to keeping us all in touch with the opposition (ie us). This is the mistake we made in every election since we had the web to organize. The Repubs, almost by accident, never stopped organizing. And now that Musk, who will be part of the new administration, owns Twitter, you can be sure they will stay and get more organized. We can do it too! We have to stop making this mistake of going back to zero after election, whether we win or lost.

In 2016, on the night of Election Day, when it was obvious Trump would win, before taking a Xanax and going to sleep, I wrote a <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/11/09/whyTrump.html">piece</a>, that my friend Chuck Shotton <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrwheat.bsky.social/post/3labvjcfh2j2k">says</a> I should run again. Rather than doing that, I'll quote the important part. "I don't think it's about economics, I think it's about change happening too fast.

## IoT Devices in Password-Spraying Botnet

date: 2024-11-06, updated: 2024-11-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Microsoft is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/11/microsoft-warns-of-8000-strong-botnet-used-in-password-spraying-attacks/">warning</a> Azure cloud users that a Chinese controlled botnet is engaging in &#8220;highly evasive&#8221; password spraying. Not sure about the &#8220;highly evasive&#8221; part; the techniques seem basically what you get in a distributed password-guessing attack:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Any threat actor using the CovertNetwork-1658 infrastructure could conduct password spraying campaigns at a larger scale and greatly increase the likelihood of successful credential compromise and initial access to multiple organizations in a short amount of time,&#8221; Microsoft officials wrote. &#8220;This scale, combined with quick operational turnover of compromised credentials between CovertNetwork-1658 and Chinese threat actors, allows for the potential of account compromises across multiple sectors and geographic regions.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

date: 2024-11-05, from: Om Malik blog

A few weeks ago, I went on a road trip to Montana with Rod Clark, a photographer friend. On the way back, we stopped in Wells, NV, to get food at Sher-E-Panjab Dhaba, a converted¬†truck stop¬†diner that serves good¬†old-fashioned Punjabi food. When paying for our lunch, I got into a conversation with the guy behind &#8230;

## 2024-11-05 Gomphotherium helps you forget

date: 2024-11-05, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-11-05-gomphotherium-helps-you-forget">2024-11-05 Gomphotherium helps you forget</h1>

<p>If you use GoToSocial, like I do, then your posts do not expire.
Mastodon, on the other hand, has that feature.</p>

<p>Now, you could use <a href="Mastodon_Archive">Mastodon Archive</a>.
But that makes you archive your toots before expiring them.</p>

<p>No good!</p>

<p>I want them gone. So here&rsquo;s a tiny Python script, built on the shoulders of the Mastodon.py library.
It deletes and unboosts ten posts older than eight weeks that you haven&rsquo;t pinned.</p>

<p>The idea is to run it from a cron job every hour, deleting up to 240 toots per day.
The reason is that the deletion rate limits are super strict.
So you have to be slow about it.</p>

<p>Now, I could not be arsed to write yet another oAuth workflow. So here&rsquo;s the deal:
Use <code>toot</code> to login.
It&rsquo;s a great client for the command line and it comes with a separate text-based user-interface.</p>

<p>Gomphotherium uses the <code>toot</code> config file to log in. üò¨</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably full of bugs. At least it&rsquo;s short.</p>

<p>So I decided I wanted to gzip the PDF files (&ldquo;pre-compress&rdquo;) them.
I found the answer I was looking for in <a href="https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/serving-pre-compressed-files-using/">Serving pre-compressed files using Apache</a> by Fran√ßois Marier.
Sometimes searching for stuff is hard just because you don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s called. üòÖ</p>

<pre><code>AddEncoding gzip gz
Options +Multiviews
SetEnv force-no-vary
Header set Cache-Control &quot;private&quot;
&lt;FilesMatch &quot;\.pdf\.gz$&quot;&gt;
ForceType application/pdf
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>OK, time to gzip them all!</p>

<pre><code>for d in 2*; cd /home/alex/campaignwiki.org/1pdc/$d; echo $d; gzip *.pdf; end
</code></pre>

<p>Aaaaand ‚Ä¶ the gains are abysmal! üòì</p>

<p>The PDFs really are that big! ü§®</p>

<p>Somebody should put a size limit on submissions!</p>

<p>The whole collection is still 4.4G. üòû</p>

<p><strong>2024-11-04</strong>. I started looking at Ghostscript to reduce filesize.
The result of using <code>-dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook</code> is disappointing. The first PDF I opened had text in the original turned to a badly pixelated image.</p>

<p>I started reading <a href="https://ghostscript.com/blog/optimizing-pdfs.html">Optimizing PDFs</a> on the Ghostscript blog and my head started smoking.</p>

<p>I ended up writing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="1pdc/markdown-links">markdown-links</a> to turn the filenames into Markdown links for the wiki page</li>
<li><a href="1pdc/zip-original">zip-original</a> to create the first zip file of the originals</li>
<li><a href="1pdc/shrink-pdfs">shrink-pdfs</a> to shrink all the PDFs using <code>pdf-shrink</code></li>
<li><a href="1pdc/pdf-shrink">pdf-shrink</a> reduce the images in a PDF files to 150dpi (ebook quality)</li>
<li><a href="1pdc/zip-dir">zip-dir</a> to create the zip file of the shrunk files for upload</li>
<li><a href="1pdc/upload-dir">upload-dir</a> to upload the files to the site itself</li>
</ul>

<p>To this, <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.acm.org/@mxp" title="@mxp@mastodon.acm.org">@mxp</a> replied:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My invocation is less elaborate (w/o the threshold, filter settings, etc.), but similar in that I also downsample images to 150 dpi. In addition, I have <code>-dSubsetFonts=true -dCompressFonts=true</code>, but since I use this for my own LaTeX-generated documents, I guess I could drop this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t look into fonts because I don&rsquo;t mind people using weird fonts; for the moment images are a bigger problem than fonts.</p>

<p>Then I went through my local directories and called <code>pdf-shrink</code> on them all, regenerated the zip file containing the year&rsquo;s entries and gzipped the individual files.</p>

<p>As I was going through the files for 2024 I noticed that sometimes the filenames betray different names (from email senders, I presume), leaking privacy related information. I wanted to make sure that the filenames reflected the authors of the works and that made me realize two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>not every entry has the license URL clearly visible</li>
<li>not every entry has the author names clearly visible</li>
</ol>

<p>Then again, anonymous works are OK, but it would have saved me some time if it said &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; somewhere. üòè</p>

<p>In any case, if you publish PDF files somewhere, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m planning to do from here on out:</p>

<ol>
<li>add copyright information and the license (if any), i.e. a date or at least a year and the names of all the people that have rights to the work (text, art, layout, editing, maps, and so on)</li>
<li>add the work&rsquo;s title and the names of the all the people to the PDF&rsquo;s metadata (&ldquo;properties&rdquo;)</li>
<li>put the work&rsquo;s title, data or version and the name of the main author (your name?) into the filename</li>
</ol>

## AIs Discovering Vulnerabilities

date: 2024-11-05, updated: 2024-11-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>I&#8217;ve been <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2018/03/artificial_intellige.html">writing about</a> the possibility of AIs automatically discovering code vulnerabilities since at least 2018. This is an ongoing area of research: AIs doing source code scanning, AIs finding zero-days in the wild, and everything in between. The AIs aren&#8217;t very good at it yet, but they&#8217;re getting better.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some <a href="https://zeropath.com/blog/0day-discoveries">anecdotal data</a> from this summer:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since July 2024, ZeroPath is taking a novel approach combining deep program analysis with adversarial AI agents for validation. Our methodology has uncovered numerous critical vulnerabilities in production systems, including several that traditional Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools were ill-equipped to find. This post provides a technical deep-dive into our research methodology and a living summary of the bugs found in popular open-source tools...</p></blockquote>

He declined, for good reason, there was private stuff in the list he couldn't share. I certainly understand that. Then I realized, as often is the case, that I could do myself what I had been asking others to do. And in fact I already was sharing my OPML subscription lists, but people who didn't use <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> wouldn't know <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/04/whereTheOpmlLinkIsInFeedland.png">how to find</a> them. So I decided to make it easier. On <a href="https://lists.opml.org/">lists.opml.org</a> I've got a link to the <a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/podcasts.opml">lists of podcasts</a> I'm subscribed to. That list should update every hour for any additions or removals from this list. I don't update the list very often, fwiw. And I make no warranties about the quality of the podcasts, or when the feeds in the list update. And maybe this will give other people an idea that they might want to do this as well. Let me know if you do, I'd love to see what you do.

## Rebooting the news

date: 2024-11-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>My opinion: At this point it doesn‚Äôt matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.</p>
<p>After the election if we still have freedom of speech, we should reboot news around the simple idea of news written by experts. They must know the basic rules of journalism, imho that's much easier than the know-nothing journalist posing as everyman with a <a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">view from nowhere</a>, trying to understand what they're writing about. They don't have any basis to judge, we give them far too much power. That system is rooted in a time when publishing was expensive but that hasn't been true for thirty years. the old system has run its course. This election, either way, is a lesson in how that system, if it ever worked, doesn't work today. The next news system will be sources going direct to interested readers. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rosen">Jay Rosen</a> and I did a <a href="https://rebootnews.wordpress.com/">series of podcasts</a> in the early teens called Rebooting the News. This was the basic premise. I believe more than ever that this is the best path for news going forward. </p>
<p>They did this at Wired for a while. I was invited to be a columnist when my main qualification was that I was an accomplished software developer. I think that's the way to go. Experts sharing their perspectives on current events. </p>
<p>Before Twitter existed, in 2002, I proposed to the NYT that they offer a blog to anyone who is quoted in a NYT article. If they had done this, the NYT would be what Twitter became, and it wouldn't now be owned by Elon Musk, for the benefit of humanity. I wish they had done it. It would have been a real moneymaker. And good for the flow of knowledge.</p>

For the sports fan in me, this has been a bit of a tough week. Two teams I normally like lost in a humiliating fashion. The New York Yankees lost to the L.A. Dodgers in the MLB World Series (4-1), and the Indian Cricket Team (ICT) was spanked by New Zealand, 3-0. The Indians have &#8230;

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/23/hopeKamala.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">About polls, I learned how they work and how much they are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija">Ouija board</a>, where the reports are tuned up based on the pollsters assumptions about who are the real voters, and account for the limited people who can be polled. They're trying to estimate what millions of people will do by talking with a few hundred. So they read each others' work, and try not to be too far off the consensus. It's at best an art, at worst they're just press releases designed to get the ad money to flow in certain directions. Don't overlook that the money is flowing to the same businesses that are choosing which polls to report on. Most of what the news orgs report on, it makes it into a sport like the NBA or MLB, but there at least there's objective news to report on, you know -- the score of each game, how many runs were scored, who got injured, fired, traded. In politics, there is no objective news, and if there were, the journalists we have don't report it. There's a lot of inputs that are connected to the outputs, conflicts of interest everywhere. Even so, the <a href="https://www.memeorandum.com/241102/p54#a241102p54">top item</a> on <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/11/03/iowapoll.png">Memeorandum</a> is about a <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/iowa-poll-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-2024-presidential-race/75354033007/">poll in Iowa</a> that says Harris is ahead. Iowa was never thought to be in play. Yes, I too am addicted. Endlessly fascinated. Maybe we'll survive next week after all? Hope.

## Could a Musk buy Bluesky?

date: 2024-11-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/#tie-yourself-to-a-federated-mast">Cory Doctorow</a>: "I will never again devote my energies to building up an audience on a platform whose management can sever my relationship to that audience at will." It's a good practice, and while I completely support it, I am part of several communities that could remove me without recourse. I do it because I value the people in the community, and feel that life is too short to wait for everyone to get it right. </p>
<p>Doctorow was writing about Bluesky, and once again, on Bluesky a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7ygxnh7ce2a">discussion</a> starts on what it would take for Bluesky to attract developers, and each time I am told that they have done enough, and I go away thinking that their pitch is a scam, and they're building value in a user base that they will sell. They certainly could do it, and for all we know the founders may have already sold some of their stock in the <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/10-24-2024-series-a">latest investment round</a> which valued the company at $x billion. (I did a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bluesky+investment+round+%2415m">search</a> to find the evaluation but it appears to have not been announced.) </p>
<p>I gave them a roadmap, again, of how to demonstrate that they're open, and finally <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l7zvw43d752a">concluded</a> that the only way to <i>really</i> do it is to "provide a download that you can install on any popular operating system to get an instant blue sky network, running on its own without any help from anyone else. Then you can claim to be really open and until then there will be a lot of confusion." (And I was generous at that. More accurately, people with experience in tech will be certain this is yet another deal where the founders get rich, where the users are the product and have read too much into their promise of being open.) </p>
<p>I'm still on Bluesky but I expect them to be another Twitter, which btw had an open API too, and it's pretty good, but they never offered the option of people running their own twitters. That would have been good protection against a Musk buying them out and turning us into pawns in his plan for world domination. Do we really want to help someone else build one of those? </p>
<p>In early 2017 I <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">observed</a> that Twitter had just been used to route around journalism and elect a president. This value wasn't on their balance sheet as an asset. I felt its stock was vastly underpriced. Exactly as it turned out when Musk bought it. Everyone still thinks he paid too much, at this moment it could possibly gain him control of part of the US government's $6 trillion per year budget early next year, and if they start selling the assets of the government he could be in the best position to buy them at pennies on the dollar, or take a percentage of each saleAt this point it doesn‚Äôt matter what the NYT says. Either way they jumped the shark for the last time in this election.. He could probably start borrowing against it the day after the election is called for Trump.</p>
<p>In the title I ask if a Musk could buy Bluesky, it's possible they have a way to prevent that in the design of their corporation, that's why it's a question. But if the price were right maybe the founders would sell out even if they didn't have to. </p>
