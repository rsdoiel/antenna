the Start menu</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Building on top of recent improvements like grouping recently
installed apps and showing your frequently used apps, we are now trying
out recommendations to help you discover great apps from the Microsoft
Store under Recommended on the Start menu. This will appear only for
Windows Insiders in the Beta Channel in the U.S. and will not apply to
commercial devices (devices managed by organizations). This can be
turned off by going to Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Start and
turning off the toggle for “Show recommendations for tips, app
promotions, and more”. As a reminder, we regularly try out new
experiences and concepts that may never get released with Windows
Insiders to get feedback. Should you see this experience on the Start
menu, let us know what you think. We are beginning to roll this out to a
small set of Insiders in the Beta Channel at first. ↫ Amanda Langowski
and Brandon LeBlanc The Start menu, August 24, 1995 – April 12, 2024.

The one thing I am dreading about Godot/iPad is setting up the CI on
Xcode Cloud.
</p>
<p>
Those devices are powered by modded raspberry pis running MacOS.
</p>
<p>
I am thinking that one hack might be to use GitHub CI + custom runners
that SSH into my Studio to do the heavy lifting, and then use those
binaries as the input to Xcode Cloud.

<p>I was, unfortunately, beheaded today, while visiting Teylers Museum
in Haarlem.  This was a trifle inconvenient, but I still managed to
smile about it.  This is straight out of the iPhone camera, with no
image manipulation. I look a slightly funny colour not because of
embarrassment at my recent decapitation, because I got rather too

So I was quite happy with some UI to connect signals on the iPad, when I
thought "Miguel, let us try this without the hardware keyboard".
</p>
<p>
Now I need to go back to the drawing board.

<p>
Thinking I can stash the "search" on the navigation bar.

<p>
It is a replacement for the UI on the 3rd screenshot:

<p>On April 8, 2024, the Moon’s shadow swept across North America,
treating millions to a breathtaking view of a total solar eclipse. As
the Moon passed in front of the Sun, it revealed the Sun’s wispy white
outer atmosphere — the corona. Pictures of total solar eclipses are
beautiful — they capture a moment happening […]</p>

<h2 id="do-not-use-kagi">Do not use Kagi</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>For quite a while now, you might have noticed various people
recommending a search engine called “Kagi”. From random people on the
internet, to prominent bloggers like John Gruber and David Pierce,
they’ve all been pushing this seemingly new search engine as a paid-for
alternative to Google that respects your privacy. Over the past few
months to a year, though, more and more cracks started to appear in
Kagi’s image, and I’ve been meaning to assemble those cracks and tie a
bow on them. Well, it turns out I don’t have to, because lori (I’m not
aware of their full name, so I’ll stick to lori) already did it for me
in a blog post titled “Why I lost faith in Kagi“. Even though I knew all
of these stories, and even though I was intending to list them in more
or less the same way, it’s still damning to see it all laid out so well
(both the story itself, as well as the lovely, accessible, approachable,
and simple HTML, but that’s neither here nor there). Lori’s summary hits
on all the pain points (but you should really read the whole thing):
Between the absolute blase attitude towards privacy, the 100% dedication
to AI being the future of search, and the completely misguided use of
the company’s limited funds, I honestly can’t see Kagi as something I
could ever recommend to people. Is the search good? I mean…it’s not
really much better than any other search, it heavily leverages Bing like
DDG and the other indie search platforms do, the only real killer
feature it has to me is the ability to block domains from your results,
which I can currently only do in other search engines via a user script
that doesn’t help me on mobile. But what good is filtering out all of
the AI generated spamblogs on a search platform that wants to spit more
AI generated bullshit at me directly? Sure I can turn it off, but who’s
to say that they won’t start using my data to fuel their own LLM? They
already have an extremely skewed idea of what counts as PII or not. They
could easily see using people’s searches as being “anonymized” and
decide they’re fine to use, because their primary business isn’t search,
it’s AI. ↫ lori at lori’s blog The examples underpinning all these pain
points are just baffling, like how the company was originally an “AI”
company, made a search engine that charges people for Bing results, and
now is going full mask-off with countless terrible, non-working,
privacy-invasive “AI” tools. Or that thing where the company spent one
third of their funding round of $670,000 on starting a T-shirt company
in Germany (Kagi is US-based) to print 20,000 free T-shirts for their
users that don’t even advertise Kagi. Or that thing where they claimed
they “forgot” to pay sales tax for two years and had to raise prices to
pay their back taxes. And I can just keep on going. To make matters
worse, after publication of the blog post, Kagi’s CEO started harassing
lori over email, and despite lori stating repeatedly they wanted him to
stop emailing them, he just kept on going. Never a good look. The worst
part of it, though, is the lack of understanding about what privacy
means, while telling their users they are super serious about it. Add to
that the CEO’s “trust me, bro” attitude, their deals with the shady and
homophobic crypto company Brave, and many other things, and the
conclusion is that, no, your data is not safe at Kagi at all, and with
their primary business being “AI” and not search, you know exactly what
that means. Do not use Kagi.</p>

virtually kills efforts to develop Alexa Skills, disappointing
dozens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>There was a time when it thought that Alexa would yield a robust
ecosystem of apps, or Alexa Skills, that would make the voice assistant
an integral part of users’ lives. Amazon envisioned tens of thousands of
software developers building valued abilities for Alexa that would grow
the voice assistant’s popularity—and help Amazon make some money. But
about seven years after launching a rewards program to encourage
developers to build Skills, Alexa’s most preferred abilities are the
basic ones, like checking the weather. And on June 30, Amazon will stop
giving out the monthly Amazon Web Services credits that have made it
free for third-party developers to build and host Alexa Skills. The
company also recently told devs that its Alexa Developer Rewards program
was ending, virtually disincentivizing third-party devs to build for
Alexa. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I’ve never used Alexa – Amazon
doesn’t really have a footprint in either The Netherlands or Sweden, so
I never really had to care – but I always thought the Skills were the
reason it was so loved. It seemingly makes no sense to me to start
killing off this feature, but then, I’m assuming Amazon has the data to
back up the fact people aren’t using them. It sucks, I guess? Can
someone who uses Alexa fill in the blanks for me here?</p>

<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m a writer and graphic designer in the Seattle area. I can’t get
enough writing; on top of
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/mind-garden/">blogging</a>, I also
write speculative fiction. I love reading, mostly fiction, and use my
website as an alternative to Goodreads to write reviews and
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/reading/read-in-2024/">track
reads</a>. Over the past several years, I’ve added more and more things
to my site: listens, playlists, recipes, follows, accountability
tracking, big questions.
</p>
<p>
I work in sustainability, previously in local government and now as a
consultant. My background is in ecology; I thought I wanted to be a
wildlife biologist, but after one field season studying lizards in the
Los Angeles suburbs, I realized the itinerant research biologist
lifestyle was not for me.
</p>
<p>
Now I stay connected to nature through my wildlife garden. My yard backs
up to a greenbelt, so on top of
<a href="https://cascadiainspired.com/diy-lawn-replacement-overview/">ripping
out our lawn</a> and planting native plants, we also restored the
natural area adjacent. (I ran a blog devoted to Pacific Northwest nature
for ten years!)
</p>
<p>
This probably makes it sound like I blog a lot about the environment,
but I get enough of that in my work life, so not much actually! I’ll
keep notes from webinars and bookmark articles related to work on my
website since they’re related to learning, but I try to preserve my blog
as a non-work thinking space for me to play.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I started my current blog at
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/mind-garden/">tracydurnell.com</a>
when I encountered the idea of a
<a href="https://indieweb.org/digital_garden">digital garden</a>* in
2021. The concept appealed to me for its looseness and built-in
acceptance of incompleteness and imperfection. On my previous blog,
<a href="https://cascadiainspired.com/">Cascadia Inspired</a>, I’d
locked myself into a narrow pool of topics that no longer matched my
life, and felt constrained. Releasing myself upon a boundless format
with lower expectations unleashed a deluge of thoughts I hadn’t realized
had no outlet before (or that I hadn’t really given myself space to
think).
</p>
<p>
*(Having learned more about digital gardens, the blog itself is more of
a <a href="https://indieweb.org/commonplace_book">commonplace book</a>,
but I feel it’s fine to trick our brains however we need to to grant
ourselves permission to create. Some people
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2022/11/09/tricking-your-brain-into-writing-the-way-you-want/">write
in all lowercase</a>, I tell myself my blog is a garden.)
</p>
<p>
I’d had a handmade HTML portfolio site parked on the domain for years
because I felt obliged to have one, but it was a huge pain to update
without a content management system. Letting go of that was a great
relief in itself, and then reinless blogging was joyfully liberating.
(Ironically, this means that one of the last things I now rely on a
third party site to host is my design portfolio 😂)
</p>
<p>
That switch from professional portfolio to blog is why I’ve done so
little to personalize the design of my website: I used the base theme
from the year I launched the blog and tweaked the colors slightly, but
otherwise only add CSS to solve specific layout or display issues. For
too long, I’d been paralyzed by the need to design and code a fully
customized site that “represented me as a designer,” so I decided to
completely release myself from that burden and use the absolute simplest
design option. I chose to not care whether people judge me for using a
generic template because the purpose of the site is the information on
it, not its aesthetics. As long as the styling works to convey the info
I want, I’m happy to leave the default. (This prioritization is a design
decision in itself, which I suppose represents my practicality when it
comes to design 🤷‍♀️)
</p>
<p>
I first
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/09/23/my-20th-anniversary-of-blogging/">started
blogging twenty years ago</a>, when I went to college, to share what I
was doing with my family. In that initial blogging phase, I focused on
writing about “mini adventures” I took – but after college I found I
didn’t <em>do</em> enough to warrant writing about because I was too
exhausted after work. I half-heartedly tried some commentary style
blogging, but it didn’t stick.
</p>
<p>
In 2012, missing that creative outlet, I started writing at Cascadia
Inspired as a way to connect more deeply with Washington nature and
explore creative processes. I hoped that having the site would prompt me
to go on more hikes, which worked for a while, then became an albatross.
</p>
<p>
When I started blogging at
<a href="http://tracydurnell.com/">TracyDurnell.com</a>, I then faced
the conundrum of
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2022/10/27/deciding-what-belongs-on-my-website/">what
writing belonged on which blog</a>. More and more, I shifted my writing
over to the new site. Now that I was letting myself write about
anything, I wanted to. Finally, I put the Cascadia Inspired blog on
hiatus last fall.
</p>
<p>
Since going freelance, I’ve also been posting weeknotes to help me
recognize the progress I’m making on long term projects and keep myself
honest about how much I can do in a week. My website is a toolbox in
itself: a tool for thinking, a place for storing information, a
non-corporate means of tracking my intake, a method of self-kindness and
personal growth, an outlet for reflection. It’s endlessly adaptable and
expandable to my needs. Part of the fun is that it’s always evolving.
</p>
<p>
As an adult, I learned my grandpa had been a letterpress printer, as had
his mother; it tickles me that I have wound up in design and (digital)
publishing too.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Most of my blogging is reactive, prompted by something I’ve read. (I’ve
written about
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/12/18/choosing-between-ideas-for-blog-posts/">choosing
between ideas</a> for posts.) I especially enjoy finding connections
between pieces and seeing whether pairing articles reveals something
more than either alone; Tom Critchlow described this, or something like
it, as
<a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/01/20/digital-bricolage/">digital
bricolage</a>.
</p>
<p>
Because lots of my blogging is interspersed with online reading, it
happens <em>where</em> I read… which is primarily on my phone. I blog
most often in my phone’s browser window, which is not ergonomic. For
pieces over a certain length and complexity, I do try to move to my
desktop, where I still write directly in the browser. (I’ve written at
length about my process for
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/09/27/how-i-approach-crafting-a-blog-post/">crafting
long blog posts</a> – tl;dr many (too many) rounds of revisions.)
</p>
<p>
I’ve been paying attention to
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2024/01/02/challenging-myself-playfully/">what
I admire on other blogs</a>, and one of my goals this year is to write
more self-prompted articles. Right now I’m experimenting with writing a
longer piece in Scrivener, the writing software I use for fiction.
Switching to Scrivener for fiction writing made a massive difference,
helping me organize my thoughts better, so I’m curious how it will
affect blogging. I’ve also read a couple books specifically for this
article – a fun return to purpose-driven research, which I’ve rarely had
cause for since college. We’ll see whether it comes together or I’ve
gathered too much material and overwhelmed myself!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Ideas aren’t a limiting factor for me; I can be creative anywhere, but
the question for me is whether I can <em>work</em> in a space. Physical
comfort is the most important aspect of a work space for me: decent
ergonomics, enough light, not too loud, not too cold. I find not having
enough space to spread out to be limiting – I prefer to have enough room
for both my computer and a notebook for brainstorming on paper.
</p>
<p>
Before the pandemic, I used to work in coffee shops regularly as a
commitment device, but it was never that productive because I’d get
distracted by friends or noise, be crammed into small tables with my
laptop perched precariously, or feel anxious whether I’d bought enough
food and drinks. Now I much prefer working at my wide desk with a large
monitor and ergonomic keyboard.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My webhosting is through HostGator, and my domain registrar is
NameCheap. I’m on shared hosting, which is sufficient to host all of my
websites.
</p>
<p>
I self-host WordPress as my content management system with
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/12/11/my-current-wordpress-plugins-and-customizations/">these
plugins</a>. I use the IndieWeb plugin to enable Webmentions, so I can
send and receive comments from other websites.
</p>
<p>
I also have a <a href="https://notes.tracydurnell.com/">notes blog</a>
on a subdomain, powered by micro.blog, which is federated.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
While I’ve run most of my sites on WordPress since 2012, if I was
starting today I might explore other options. There’s a lot that’s great
about WordPress, but I find the block structure poorly suited to
blogging; fortunately, I can use a plugin to restore the classic editor
(for now).
</p>
<p>
I’ve chosen to blog under my real name for a number of reasons, but I
also can see the value and freedom in anonymity. There are some subjects
I’d like to write about that are too personally revealing. (When I first
blogged, I wrote openly about some things I now keep private; were the
times simpler or was I more naive?)
</p>
<p>
From a content perspective, I’d try to be more social with my website
earlier. Discovering the IndieWeb and meeting other people who think
keeping websites is rad has totally enlivened my blogging. I feel
<a href="https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/">much
more connected to the online community</a> than I ever did during my
first decade and a half of blogging.
</p>
<p>
Back in the day I followed mostly big name bloggers and topic-focused
blogs, which fostered more parasocial relationships between writer and
audience; now <a href="https://tracydurnell.com/blogroll/">I follow a
lot of other ‘normal people’</a> with personal websites who are sharing
their ponderings and slices of life. It’s easier for me to engage in a
bloggy conversation with people who feel like peers, and fun to join in
with what I see others writing about. (How much do our follows reveal
our interests versus shape them?)
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Webhosting costs me about $200 a year, and my domain about $15. (Of
course, like many people with websites, I have way too many domains so
they add up 😉) I begrudgingly subscribe to Google Drive, where I have
automatic website backups stored, for $20 a year. Micro.blog is another
$5 a month. As a hobby, I consider blogging reasonably affordable at
about $25 a month.
</p>
<p>
I don’t mind other people monetizing their blogs, especially with
affiliate links, membership programs, and donations. It totally makes
sense for people who need more expensive hosting than I can get away
with – but I also think it’s fine for people to charge for their work
even if they don’t “need the money” – creators shouldn’t be ashamed for
earning money from their work. The only aspect that troubles me is when
content is paywalled, which then removes it from the open web, but I
understand that people need to make money and people come first.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Blog recommendations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mandy Brown’s <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/">A Working
Library</a>, with reading notes and reflections, and
<a href="https://everythingchanges.us/blog/">Everything Changes</a>,
with business-adjacent life musings, are both insightful
</li>
<li>
Anna Havron writes thoughtfully about a meaningful life at
<a href="http://annahavron.com/">annahavron.com</a> and practically
about getting work done at <a href="https://analogoffice.net/">Analog
Office</a>
</li>
<li>
At <a href="https://going-medieval.com/">Going Medieval</a>, Dr. Eleanor
Janega writes hilariously (and informatively) about medieval history,
gender roles, and how these all tie in to our lives today
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It’d be interesting to hear from Reimena Yee, a comic artist who has a
fun <a href="https://reimenayee.com/">website</a> and interesting
<a href="https://blog.reimenayee.com/">blog</a>. I’d also love to hear
from <a href="https://erinkissane.com/">Erin Kissane</a>, and if we’re
going big, Deb Perelman of <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/">Smitten
Kitchen</a>!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’d encourage anyone who wants to meet other bloggers and website makers
to check out an <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/">IndieWeb online
event</a> like Homebrew Website Club, which is held regularly in
European and North American timezones. It’s not just for technical
folks!

is nuking Nintendo Switch emulator devs and their entire servers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Discord has shut down the Discord servers for the Nintendo Switch
emulators Suyu and Sudachi and has completely disabled their lead
developers’ accounts — and the company isn’t answering our questions
about why it went that far. Both Suyu and Sudachi began as forks of
Yuzu, the emulator that Nintendo sued out of existence on March 4th. ↫
Sean Hollister at The Verge This is exactly what people were worried
about when Nintendo and Yuzu settled for millions of dollars. Even
though it’s a settlement and not a court ruling, and even tough the code
to Yuzu is entirely unaffected by the settlement and freely shareable
and usable by anyone, and even though emulators are legal – the chilling
effect this settlement is having is absolutely undeniable. Here we have
Discord going far beyond its own official policy, without even giving
the affected parties any recourse. It’s absolutely wild, and highlights
just how dangerous it is to rely on Discord for, well, anything. I wish
that for once, we’d actually see a case related to console emulation go
to court in either the EU or the US, to make it even clearer that yes,
unless you distribute copyrighted code like game ROMs or console
firmware, emulators are entirely legal and without any risk. You know, a
recent court ruling we could point to to dissuade bullies like Nintendo
from threatening innocent developers and ruining their lives because of
entirely legal activities. And let me reiterate: don’t use Discord as
for anything other than basic chat. This platform ain’t got your
back.</p>

read-only compression file system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>DwarFS is a read-only file system with a focus on achieving very high
compression ratios in particular for very redundant data. DwarFS also
doesn’t compromise on speed and for my use cases I’ve found it to be on
par with or perform better than SquashFS. For my primary use case,
DwarFS compression is an order of magnitude better than SquashFS
compression, it’s 6 times faster to build the file system, it’s
typically faster to access files on DwarFS and it uses less CPU
resources. ↫ DwarfFS GitHub page DwarfFS supports both Linux, macOS, and
Windows, but macOS and Windows support is experimental at this point. It
seems to have higher compression ratios at faster speeds than various
alternatives, so if you have a use case for compression file systems –
give DwarfFS a look.</p>

system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>With the recent release of OpenBSD 7.5, I decided to run through my
personal OpenBSD “installer” for laptop/desktop devices. The project is
built off of the dwm tiling window manager and only installs a few basic
packages. The last time I updated it was with the release of 7.3, so
it’s been due for an minor rework. While making these minor changes, I
remembered how incredibly easy the entire install process for OpenBSD is
and how cozy the entire operating system feels. All the core systems
just work out the box. Yes, you need to “patch” in WiFi with a firmware
update, so you’ll need an Ethernet connection during the initial setup.
Yes, the default desktop environment is not intuitive or ideal for
newcomers. But the positives heavily outweigh the negatives (in my
opinion). ↫ Bradley Taunt OpenBSD has a very dedicated community, and
I’ve noticed they tend to be very helpful and friendly. It’s making me
curious about trying it out, and both this article and the helpful posts
it links to will be a great way to start.</p>

<p>After two months of developer previews, Google has finally released
Android 15 Beta 1. While the beta usually offers more user-facing
changes, Google is still pretty light on details with this build, giving
us only a few more details on what we can expect. Instead, the company
is pointing to Google I/O for more details, which will take place on May
14 this year, basically confirming that this is when we will get the
second beta with more features. ↫ Manuel Vonau There’s very little of
interest in this beta, so unless you’re really into Android development,
I’d wait out installing any betas until after Google I/O.</p>

<h2 id="greenmask-v0.1.7-release">Greenmask v0.1.7 Release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-12, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<h1>
Greenmask v0.1.7 Release
</h1>
<h2>
PostgreSQL Dump and Obfuscation Tool
</h2>
<p>
This release introduces a new Greenmask command, improvements, bug
fixes, and documentation updates.
</p>
<h1>
Greenmask Overview
</h1>
<h2>
Key Features
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cross-platform</strong> — can be easily built and executed on
any platform, thanks to its Go-based architecture, which eliminates
platform dependencies.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Interactive</strong> - allows to check the transformation result
and show problems if any using the single command <code>validate</code>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Schema difference check</strong> - validate your current
database with the previous dump in storage and show diff
</li>
<li>
<strong>Database type safe</strong> — ensures data integrity by
validating data and utilizing the database driver for encoding and
decoding operations. This approach guarantees the preservation of data
formats.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Transformation validation and easy maintainable</strong> —
during obfuscation development, Greenmask provides validation warnings
and a transformation diff feature, allowing you to monitor and maintain
transformations effectively throughout the software lifecycle.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Partitioned tables transformation inheritance</strong> — define
transformation configurations once and apply them to all partitions
within partitioned tables, simplifying the obfuscation process.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Stateless</strong> — Greenmask operates as a logical dump and
does not impact your existing database schema.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Backward compatible</strong> — it fully supports the same
features and protocols as existing vanilla PostgreSQL utilities. Dumps
created by Greenmask can be successfully restored using the pg_restore
utility.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Extensible</strong> — users have the flexibility to implement
domain-based transformations in any programming language or use
predefined templates.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Declarative</strong> — Greenmask allows you to define
configurations in a structured, easily parsed, and recognizable format.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Integrable</strong> — integrate Greenmask seamlessly into your
CI/CD system for automated database obfuscation and restoration.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Parallel execution</strong> — take advantage of parallel dumping
and restoration, significantly reducing the time required to deliver
results.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Provide a variety of storage</strong> — Greenmask offers a
variety of storage options for local and remote data storage, including
directories and S3-like storage solutions.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Greenmask is ideally suited for:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Routine backup and restoration tasks, ensuring data integrity and
availability.
</li>
<li>
Anonymization and data masking for staging environments and analytics,
protecting sensitive information while maintaining data utility.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Release Notes
</h2>
<h3>
v0.1.7
</h3>
<h5>
New features
</h5>
<ul>
<li>
Added restoration filtering by <code>–table</code>, <code>–schema</code>
and <code>–exclude-schema</code> parameters
</li>
<li>
Validate command without parameters validates only the configuration
file
</li>
<li>
Added the <code>–schema</code> parameter, which allows to make a schema
diff between the previous dump and the current. This is useful when you
want to check if the schema has changed after the migration. By
controlling it we can exclude data leakage after migration
</li>
<li>
Validate command divided by many stages that can be controlled using
parameters
<ul>
<li>
Configuration validation
</li>
<li>
Transformer validation
</li>
<li>
Constraint violation check
</li>
<li>
Data difference check
</li>
<li>
Schema difference check
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>
Improvements
</h5>
<ul>
<li>
Improved Hash transformer
<ul>
<li>
Added salt parameter that can be set via config or via
<code>GREENMASK_GLOBAL_SALT</code>
</li>
<li>
Added sha3 functions support in different modes (sha3-224, sha3-256,
sha3-384, sha3-512)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Refactored <code>Cmd</code> transformer logic
<ul>
<li>
Json API: Now it allows to use of column names instead of column indexes
in JSON format
</li>
<li>
Csv API: Now it can use the column order from config via column
remapping
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The <code>validate</code> command was rewritten almost from scratch.
<ul>
<li>
New option <code>–transformed-only</code> - displays only columns that
are transformed with a primary key (if exists). This allows to reduce
the output data and make it more readable
</li>
<li>
Implemented <code>json</code> format for output
</li>
<li>
Added the <code>–table-format</code> parameter which is responsible for
the <code>vertical</code> and <code>horizontal</code> table orientation.
This works only when <code>–format=text</code>
</li>
<li>
Added the <code>–warnings</code> parameter, if it is specified then not
only fatal-warnings will be displayed, but also those with a lower
severity
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>
Fixes
</h5>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed <code>–use-list</code> option - now it applies to entries
according to the order in the list file
</li>
<li>
Fixed <code>–use-list</code> option behavior together with
<code>–list-format</code> option (<code>json</code> or
<code>text</code>). Now it generates a temporal list file in text format
for providing it to the pg_restore call
</li>
<li>
Updated documentation according to the latest changes
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
v0.1.2 - v0.1.6
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed uncontrolled buffer growth in the restore command

The <code>Hash</code> transformer has been completely remastered and now
has the <code>function</code> parameter to choose from several hash
algorithm options and the <code>max_length</code> parameter to truncate
the hash tail.
</li>
<li>
Split information about transformers between the
<code>list-transformers</code> and new <code>show-transformer</code> CLI
commands, which allows for more comprehensible and useful outputs for
both commands
</li>
<li>
Added error severity for the <code>Cmd</code> parameter validator
</li>
<li>
Significantly refactored the structure and content of documentation
</li>
<li>
Fixed metadata enrichment for validation warnings caused by
<code>RawValueValidator</code>
</li>
<li>
Fixed a typo in the <code>credit_card</code> value for the
<code>type</code> parameter of the <code>Masking</code> transformer
</li>
<li>
Fixed Greenmask Playground environment variables and the
<code>cleanup</code> command
</li>
<li>
Fixed <code>list-dump</code>, <code>list-transformers</code>, and
<code>restore</code> commands exit code on error
</li>
<li>
Fixed database connection parameters behavior fields
</li>

This was the place where I started development of what became
<a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a>. I always wanted to
do a great system level scripting thing, based on what I learned from
Unix and what I loved about the graphic user interface.
</p>
<p>
It became a lot bigger than I anticipated. In the beginning it was meant
to be a replacement for the Macintosh Finder, with an outliner for a
file system browser, and of course a fantastic scripting ability, of the
OS and of scriptable apps. I wish Apple had supported this effort but I
didn’t understand at the time that they couldn’t. They weren’t set up to
let anyone but Bill and Andy make great products, even if their products
weren’t all that great, imho of course. You have to live with the
mythology you create.
</p>
<p>
A lot of people got their first programming experience with Hypercard. I
would have loved if more of them get their first experience with
Frontier. Even better would have been if our products worked together,
but that wasn’t in the cards either.

<h2 id="gnu-hurd-ported-to-aarch64-and-more-hurd-news">GNU Hurd ported
to AArch64, and more Hurd news</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hurd, the kernel that is supposed to form the basis of the GNU
operating system, is perpetually a research project that doesn’t get
anywhere close to being a replacement for Linux, but that doesn’t mean
the project doesn’t make progress and has a place in the world of
operating systems. Their most recent major improvement has been porting
GNU Hurd to AArch64, spearheaded by Hurd developer Sergey Bugaev. Since
then, however, I have been (some may say, relentlessly) working on
filling in the missing piece, namely porting GNU Mach (with important
help &amp; contributions by Luca D.). I am happy to report that we now
have an experimental port of GNU Mach that builds and works on AArch64!
While that may sound impressive, note that various things about it are
in an extremely basic, proof-of-concept state rather than being
seriously production-ready; and also that Mach is a small kernel
(indeed, a microkernel), and it was designed from the start (back in the
80s) to be portable, so most of the “buisness logic” functionality
(virtual memory, IPC, tasks/threads/scheduler) is explicitly
arch-independent. Despite the scary “WIP proof-of-concept” status, there
is enough functionality in Mach to run userland code, handle exceptions
and syscalls, interact with the MMU to implement all the expected
virtual memory semantics, schedule/switch tasks and threads, and so on.
Moreover, all of GNU Mach’s userspace self-tests pass! ↫ Sergey Bugaev
On top of all this, glibc works on the AArch64 port, and several
important Hurd servers work as well, namely ext2fs, exec, startup, auth,
and proc, as a do a number of basic UNIX programs. This is an
exceptional effort, and highlights that while people tend to make fun of
Hurd, it’s got some real talent working on it that bring the platform
forward. While we may not see any widely usable release any time soon,
every bit of progress helps and is welcome. Speaking of progress, the
progress report for GNU Hurd covering the first quarter of 2024 has also
been published, and it lists a number of other improvements and fixes
made aside from the AArch64 port. For instance, the console will now use
xkbcommon instead of X11 for handling keyboard layouts, which reduced
code complexity a lot and improved keyboard layout coverage, to boot.
The port of GDB to the 64 bit version of Hurd is also progressing, and
SMP has seen a ton of fixes too. Another awesome bit of news comes from,
once again, Sergey Bugaev, as he announced a new Hurd distribution based
on Alpine Linux. Work on this project has only recently begun, but he’s
already had some success and about 299 Alpine packages are available.
His reasons for starting this new project is that while Debian GNU/Hurd
is a great base to work from for Hurd users and developers, Debian is
also a bit strict and arcane in its packaging requirements, which might
make sense for Debian GNU/Linux, but is annoying to work with when
you’re trying to get a lot of low-level work done. For now, there’s no
name yet, and he’s asking for help from the Hurd community for name
ideas, hosting, and so on. That’s a lot of GNU Hurd progress this
quarter, and that’s good news.</p>

Call it Freakout Day.

Works like this.

When you think of a pronouncement you’d like to make, write it in your
favorite “tiny little text box”, but before you send it, add the word
“freaking” between every word in the punchline.

Like so –

United freaking States of freaking America.

AI pins review confirm what we already expected: it’s useless trash</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>I didn’t want to spend too much time on this thing, but I feel like
we can all use a good laugh at a stupid product hyped only by the tech
media. The Verge reviewed the Humane AI pin, and entirely predictably,
it’s a complete and utter trashfire. But until all of that happens, and
until the whole AI universe gets better, faster, and more functional,
the AI Pin isn’t going to feel remotely close to being done. It’s a beta
test, a prototype, a proof of concept that maybe someday there might be
a killer device that does all of these things. I know with absolute
certainty that the AI Pin is not that device. It’s not worth $700, or
$24 a month, or all the time and energy and frustration that using it
requires. It’s an exciting idea and an infuriating product.  AI gadgets
might one day be great. But this isn’t that day, and the AI Pin isn’t
that product. I’ll take my phone back now, thanks. ↫ David Pierce at The
Verge It takes dozens of seconds to reply to any query, the battery is
severely lacking, the answers you get are mostly wrong or useless,
sending text messages is effectively broken, and tons of promised
features don’t work because they’re not implemented. In another video
review, MrMobile also shows the device overheating all the time, a
problem that’s common to all of the devices. I don’t think trashfire is
harsh enough to describe this junk.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>We are about 18 months away from the end of mainstream Windows 10
support, but Microsoft thinks it is time to start nagging warning
Windows 10 users about the inevitable. Users on Reddit report spotting a
new full-screen ad with a notification that Windows 10 is about to reach
its end of life in October 2025, even though it is still getting new
features (there are even rumors about Microsoft re-opening the Windows
Insider Program for Windows 10). ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin I mean, I have
a long history of crying foul over Windows being adware now, but I don’t
think warning users that their operating system is losing support and
that they should upgrade to a new version really constitutes an ad.
Sure, technically it does, but I think we can all agree that such a
warning is useful and informative.</p>

<p>I’ve been a little less online lately, but not to worry, I have just
been living my life :) Several weeks ago, I gave notice at work and
left. Some people in my life were surprised, because it was a good job
at a good company, I generally enjoyed it, I got to work with wonderful
people, and I was paid money to do it. The younger version of me who
hadn’t yet figured out a career direction would be curious (and more
than a little skeptical) about why I would quit such an objectively good
job.</p>

<h2 id="me-and-fsd">Me and FSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Check out my
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html">political
preamble</a> on Tesla, X and Musk.
</p>
<p>
One more disclaimer: I love my Tesla Model Y. Best car ever. I’ve been
driving a Tesla since late 2021, and I still feel privileged to drive
the car every time I do. It’s the Macintosh of cars.
</p>
<p>
I don’t generally use
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html">FSD</a>,
even though I paid for it and have had it available all the time I’ve
driven a Tesla.
</p>
<p>
They say you should always be fully attentive when using FSD. I am
always <i>soooo</i> ready to take over for it. I don’t trust it. And I
also don’t feel that when I’m in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-knuckle">white-knuckle</a>
mode when it’s driving, that my reflexes are anywhere near as good as
the reflexes I have when I’m driving, with fifty years of experience,
and maybe a few hours of experience supervising a FSD car. I don’t have
a sense of how to work with it. So I err on the side of turning it off
whenever I feel like even slightly scared.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/10/trumpBeingCarriedAway.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
also don’t like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster">roller
coasters</a>, but if I did, I’d recognize that this is different. A
roller coaster is designed to give the exact same experience to every
user every time. It’s designed to give the impression that your life is
about to end, using gravity and eyesight and all that evolution trained
you to be scared of. It fools you into being scared, when you’re
actually safe. Every so often you read about someone dying on a
rollercoaster. That probably improves the fun for thrill-seekers, and
gives people like me justification for staying away. People also
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping">bungee jump</a>
knowing there’s a chance the chord could break, but they know it’s not
going to.
</p>
<p>
None of that is true for the Tesla. It’s making it up as it goes along.
And it definitely encounters situations it can’t handle, or it
misinterprets a set of obvious facts, or even worse it hallucinates just
like ChatGPT.

from Lake Katrine to Woodstock with FSD, and it was doing really well,
up to a point. First I was on

onto
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_375">375</a>
which is a curvy two-lane road. I was starting to feel slightly
comfortable. Then we come up to

where 375 ends. A busy

Traffic coming from the left and right, and many are turning onto the
road I’m on. I watched in awe as FSD tried to find a way to make a left
turn in this complicated situation, starting, stopping, it tried, found
itself out in traffic, and got stuck there. I had enough and took over.
Luckily the car waiting behind us had left a little room. I’ve dealt
with this intersection probably a few hundred times in the last few
years. I know the crazy things the other drivers do here, and I know to
watch out for them. The Tesla didn’t know.

<p>
At the end of each MSNBC YouTube video right now they have a 30 second
post-roll of Ali Velshi explaining the 5-step process on how to install
the new MSNBC app.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Tap on the App Store on your phone
</li>
<li>
Hit “Search” on the bottom right corner
</li>
<li>
Type in “MSNBC”
</li>
<li>
Click on the MSNBC app
</li>
<li>
Click on “Get” or the cloud icon
</li>
</ol>
<p>
There’s an implied sixth step where you need to actually open the newly
installed app. Opening the app for the first time you swipe through a
little slideshow that has two more (optional) steps: give your email and
turn on notifications. Standard engagement economy tactics.
</p>
<p>
Hearing the 5-step native app install process a few times a day makes me
think we lost something along the way. Remember when the call to action
was to visit a URL? Not only is “Visit msnbc.com” more succinct,
catchier, private, less prone to user error, and immune to competitive
advertisements but it also doesn’t require a paid presenter to coach you
through it. Once upon a time users might have needed Ali Velshi’s help
getting to a website, but in my experience visiting a website is one of
the first computing skills my kids learned without my direct
involvement. The URL isn’t a foreign concept anymore.
</p>
<p>
I know I’m making a mountain out of a “We just want to promote our new
app, maaan” molehill here, but even saying “Visit msnbc.com/mobile” with
a redirect to their
<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/information/msnbc-info/download-msnbc-app-n1241692">actual
app download page</a> would be easier. It boggles my mind why you’d push
a clunky app store install flow over a five-letter domain name. I’d even
bet $5 that the “native app” is actually a bunch of web views in a
trench coat. In an even wilder twist, that app download page isn’t
linked anywhere on the website! Ughck. I’m 0% invested on what’s
happening over at MSNBC but I’m already getting whiffs of misaligned
goals, interdepartmental strife, and poorly designed content management
systems.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, websites. They’re old tech but still work great from time to
time.

id="eus-new-tech-laws-are-working-small-mobile-browsers-gain-market-share">EU’s
new tech laws are working; small mobile browsers gain market share</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Independent browser companies in the European Union are seeing a
spike in users in the first month after EU legislation forced Alphabet’s
Google, Microsoft and Apple to make it easier for users to switch to
rivals, according to data provided to Reuters by six companies. The
early results come after the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act, which
aims to remove unfair competition, took effect on March 7, forcing big
tech companies to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list
of available web browsers from a “choice screen.” ↫ Supantha Mukherjee
and Foo Yun Chee I can’t believe this is even remotely surprising. A lot
of especially Apple fans and people from outside of the European Union
complained left, right, and centre about the choice screen and how it
was ugly, unnecessary, and would just confuse users. These are
interesting claims, considering the fact that setting up a modern
smartphone such as the iPhone takes the user through 40-50 setup screens
chockful of confusing choices to make, so adding one more surely
wouldn’t make a difference. Of course giving users the option to choose
a different default browser would lead to an increase in browsers other
than Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android) being set as the default. I’m
pretty sure quite a few users learned, through the choice screen, for
the first time, that there even are different browsers to choose from,
and that some of those might offer features and benefits they didn’t
even know they could enjoy. That’s the whole point of this endeavour:
informing users that they have a choice, something Apple, Google, and
others would rather you either do not have, or at least not know about.
It’s far too early to tell if these spikes are a one-off thing, or if
the rise in browsers other than Safari on iOS and Chrome on Android is
more structural. I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s the latter, and even if
the numbers remain in the single digits or low double digits, it will
still lead to an increase in competition, and a more vibrant mobile
browser market. Good news, regardless.</p>

id="microsoft-details-new-features-coming-in-windows-server-2025">Microsoft
details new features coming in Windows Server 2025</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft recently held a streaming event in which it detailed a lot
of the new features and changes coming in Windows server 2025, and has
now followed that up with a blog post, as well. There’s a lot to go over
here, and I’m anything but a Windows Server specialist, so I’ll
highlight some of the thing I’m certain will be welcomed by Windows
Server administrators. First and foremost, the biggest improvement:
hot-patching. Security updates can be installed without having to
reboot, because Server 2025 will modify code in memory without
restarting the processes in question. Quarterly updates, however, will
still require reboots. Hot-patching will be free on all versions of
Server 2025. Microsoft also promises a massive performance boost for
NVMe drives – the company claims a 70% improvement going from Server
2022 to Server 2025. Microsoft’s other file system, ReFS, is also seeing
improvements, and Storage Replica’s compression will be available in all
editions of Windows Server 2025. A major improvement in Hyper-V is the
ability to partition GPUs, so you can use one GPU to power multiple
virtual machines. As far as licensing goes, the most important news here
is that you’ll still be able to buy a normal, regular, run-of-the-mill

<p>
I bought <a href="https://amzn.to/3xsz1Xj">a 40 pound weighted vest for
$40 dollars on Amazon</a>. The workout term for this is “rucking” and
has connotations with being outdoorsy and/or in the military. Load up a
backpack full of weights (or in my case, a vest full of sand bags) and
head outdoors. The
<a href="https://www.goruck.com/pages/what-is-rucking">marketing
benefits</a> of rucking sound great:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It is simple and anyone can do it
</li>
<li>
Gets you outside
</li>
<li>
Active Resistance Training™️
</li>
<li>
Burns up to 3x more calories than walking
</li>
<li>
Good for your back and improves your posture
</li>
<li>
Good for your mental health
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A neighbor friend of mine (that’s also a physical therapist) has one and
she recommended it. My body is adept at carrying heavy
objects<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>,
so this seems like an easy way to squeeze out some gains from my regular
walks. Bonus points that it gets me outside and gets rid of my developer
hunch. After a handful of walks, I’m enjoying the vest and –as expected–
my body handles the weight fine but it’s sweatier and hills knock the
wind out of me a bit more.
</p>
<p>
There’s an army fetish around rucking. It’s hard to tell if that’s
fragile male ego in workout culture or if it’s because an armored plate
carrier is a well-tested and efficient way to carry weight. My vest
doesn’t look that masculine and looks more like I duct taped C4 to my
chest. With my uni-bomber glasses, long hair, beard, and resting scowl I
don’t need more help looking like a disgruntled domestic terrorist but I
suppose this completes the look. If I can sustain
<a href="/2021/06/two-options/">the $40 fix</a>, then I’ll upgrade to
the $200 plate vest solution.
</p>
<p>
The cynical side of me wonders if this is more skinny people shit. As I
dawn the weighted vest, the irony is not lost on me I used to be about
the same amount of weight heavier. Being heavy never helped me lose
weight. No one gives you an approving head nod for walking while fat,
but velcro a little vest to your torso and people give you the “good for
you” pity eyes.
</p>
<p>
Putting my optimist hat back on,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po4adxJxqZk">it might work this
time</a>. Maybe this is the one weird trick my body needs to activate
dormant caveman genetics that will unleash my inner Adonis. Walking in
hard mode seems sustainable for the time-being and I can already feel my
ass morphing into a perfect badonkadonk.

<p>
The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the
Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.
</p>
<p>
The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane,
Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like
sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the
<a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible,
too.
</p>
<p>
With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We
went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in
2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to
the Maldives.

<strong>2024-04-06</strong>. The last leg of the journey – our
water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the
reef begins a few meters in.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an
underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or
the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10
before we left.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to
hide in the sand.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it
attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in
Australia or the Galapagos. This purple giant is cool, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" />

There are still plenty of colourful fish.

Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games. The most popular tropical

We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey
moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily
scared and therefore obviously harmless.

<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when
you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful
fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep
blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.

There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either
uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can
stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work
on the tourist islands.
</p>
<p>
The capital city is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one
of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage
problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know
what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a>
book. Check out these stats from the
<a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia
page on the Maldives</a>: In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had
about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much
better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman
has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years
in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement
from the point of view of the locals.
</p>
<p>
From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The
picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don’t know
what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage
incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had
to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in
the the fish. People eat the fish. It’s easy to feel grim about this. I
need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a
generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much,
much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally
summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that
this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look
away.

id="why-does-part-of-the-windows-98-setup-program-look-older-than-the-rest">“Why
does part of the Windows 98 Setup program look older than the
rest?”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, this is something I never knew. Over on the retrocomputing
section of StackExchange, someone asked why the second phase of the
Windows 98 installation looked decidedly different from the third phase,
even though they’re both graphical phases (the first phase is textual).
The answer turns out to be both surprising, and entirely predictable.
The first phase is a DOS program called DOSSETUP.BIN, which is the
infamous blue part of the installation. The second part, however, is
what we’re interested in here, and if the first phase is DOS, and the
third phase is Windows 98 itself… What do you think the second phase is
running? Yeah, exactly. Basically, because it is running under Windows
3.1 at that point. The second uses this minimal Windows 3.1 to run a
Windows 3 program, W98SETUP.BIN (specified as the “shell” in
SYSTEM.INI). This starts by copying more files to support all the
information-gathering during setup, and various other niceties including
the 3D look shown in your screenshot (the contents of the PRECOPY CABs);
it ends by copying most of Windows 98, setting the system up so that it
will boot Windows 98 from the target drive, and rebooting. ↫ Stephen
Kitt So, in order to install Windows 98, you first run DOS, followed by
Windows 3.1, ending in Windows 98. I have no idea why this is so funny
to me, especially since it fits entirely within expectations of how
Microsoft does things.</p>

<p>For me, using FSD in my Tesla is like riding a roller coaster. I
don’t trust the car not to kill me though. I spend most of my working
life dealing with bugs in software. It’s very easy for me to imagine
what could go wrong. I don’t understand how people can trust a computer
with their lives this way. It’s also disconcerting that the car coming
at me in the other direction could be computer-driven. And nowadays when
I see the other car is a Tesla, esp this month when everyone’s getting a
free demo of FSD, it’s somewhat likely the OP is a computer.</p>

But Rob’s podcast is just the excuse I needed to complain about something I find quite annoying: video podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Season 3 of Yo! is “video first”. Podcasts switching to video to be on
YouTube ranks quite high on the list of things that I find annoying. I
get why they’re doing it. I’m not an idiot. Yet I still find it
annoying. Especially because podcasts that were audio-only would start
referencing and talking about things that are “on the screen right now”
and now I’m missing out on parts of the conversation because I’m
listening to a podcast while I’m driving.

<p>
Video podcasts are the worst of both worlds. They’re not as good as
actual video content designed to be consumed exclusively as video and
they’re inferior to audio-only podcasts. And if you disagree

<p>date: 2024-04-10, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>The project has been haunted by a mysterious bug since sometime
February. It relates to the code that constructs the index, particularly
the code that merges partial indices. In short the search engine
constucts the reverse index through successive merging of smaller
indices, which reduces the overall memory requirement. You can
conceptualize the revese index itself as two files, one with offset
pointers into another file, which has sorted numbers. This code runs
after each partition finishes crawling and processing its data, and has
a run time of about 4 hours.</p>

id="ixsystems-focusing-on-linux-makes-more-sense-than-freebsd">iXsystems:
focusing on Linux makes more sense than FreeBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few weeks ago we talked about how iXsystems, the company behind
TrueNAS CORE and SCALE, has all but confirmed that its FreeBSD-based
CORE product will be put in maintenance mode, while the Linux-based
SCALE product will get all the attention and focus from here on out. In
an interview with Blocks &amp; Files, the company gave more insight into
this choice. “We had a huge chunk of our engineering staff spending time
improving FreeBSD as opposed to working on features and functionalities.
What’s happened now with the transition to having a Debian basis, the
people I used to have 90 percent of their time working on FreeBSD,
they’re working on ZFS features now … That’s what I want to see; value
add for everybody versus sitting around, implementing something Linux
had a years ago. And trying to maintain or backport, or just deal with
something that you just didn’t get out of box on FreeBSD.” “It’s not
knocking against FreeBSD. We love it. That’s our heritage. That’s our
roots, I was on the CORE team elected twice. So believe me, if I felt
like I could have stayed on FreeBSD for the next 20 years, I would have
absolutely preferred to do that … But at some point, you gotta read the
writing on the wall and say, well, all the the vendor
supported-innovations are happening on the Linux side these days.” BSD
aficionados don’t like this change. Moore said: “Talk is cheap and
complaints are free. You know, everyone loves to complain about it. But
… if people wanted to push FreeBSD forward for the last 15 years, they
would have.” ↫ Chris Mellor at Blocks &amp; Files Above all else, my
personal north star is choice, especially in technology, and as such, I
want iXsystems to keep focusing on FreeBSD so that not everyone is using
Linux for server- and server-like workloads. The fact that TrueNAS was a
FreeBSD-based product for this long was amazing, and I would definitely
have preferred if it stayed that way for many, many more years to come.
However, I don’t think the people of TrueNAS are saying anything wrong
or outrageous here. They’ve got employees to feed, and the money is in
Linux, not FreeBSD. If they spend more money, time, and resources on
getting FreeBSD on par with features Linux has had for ages than on
actually developing their own product – TrueNAS – then they’re fighting
a losing battle. Honestly, I’m surprised it’s taken them this long to
take this controversial step. All we can hope for is that the things
they work on, the features they develop, will make it to FreeBSD
regardless.</p>

acquired by Automattic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you haven’t already heard of Beeper, welcome! Beeper is a
universal chat app for Android, iOS and desktop. Our goal is to build
the best chat app on earth. Beeper is built on an open source chat
protocol called Matrix. Over time, we’ll help people migrate from
proprietary, siloed chat networks to an open standard for chat. If
you’re interested in learning about this, we’ve written more about our
intentions. ↫ Beeper team Beeper is just great. Because I’m European and
have ties to two different countries with vastly different chat
preferences, as well as a number of friends living all over Europe and
the US, I’ve always had to deal with at least four different instant
messaging applications. Beeper, and especially the recent completely
redesigned Android version, is so good and seamless that I no longer
need to use the individual applications at all. It’s not perfect – the
new Android version (the iOS version is old and outdated compared to the
Android one) still has some issues. If you receive a video and play it,
it doesn’t maximise unless you perform a very delicate zoom in pinch.
Sometimes, sending video fails. Some emoji replies on some services look
huge and pixellated. I’m sure these are all relatively low-hanging fruit
types of bugs that’ll get fixes over the coming weeks and months now
that the application is out of beta. However, the actual core of the
application has been working amazingly well for me. Beeper also has
another major announcement. I’m excited to announce that Beeper has been
acquired by Automattic. This acquisition marks the beginning of an
exciting new chapter as we continue our mission to create the best chat
app on earth. ↫ Eric Migicovsky Automattic is the company behind
WordPress, Tumblr, Pocket Casts, and a whole load of other products and
services. Beeper seems like a good fit, since Automattic recently also
acquired Texts.com, another multi-platform messaging client.</p>

details privacy and security features of its new Find My Device
network</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Yesterday, I posted an item about the updated Find My Device network
Google launched for Android, but I forgot to link to an additional blog
post by Google about the various security and privacy precautions
they’ve taken. One aspect in particular stands out as something new that
Apple’s Find My network doesn’t do (yet): This is a first-of-its-kind
safety protection that makes unwanted tracking to a private location,
like your home, more difficult. By default, the Find My Device network
requires multiple nearby Android devices to detect a tag before
reporting its location to the tag’s owner. Our research found that the
Find My Device network is most valuable in public settings like cafes
and airports, where there are likely many devices nearby. By
implementing aggregation before showing a tag’s location to its owner,
the network can take advantage of its biggest strength – over a billion
Android devices that can participate. This helps tag owners find their
lost devices in these busier locations while prioritizing safety from
unwanted tracking near private locations. In less busy areas, last known
location and Nest finding are reliable ways to locate items. ↫ Dave
Kleidermacher In addition, when you’re at home, your devices won’t
contribute any information either. There’s a whole bunch of other things
in there, too, so head on over if you’re curious.</p>

<h2 id="on-tesla-nazis-x-and-the-macintosh-of-cars">On Tesla, Nazis, X
and the Macintosh of cars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m not sure I’d buy a Tesla today because of Musk’s politics which he
puts in our face, thus influencing other people to inflict their
nightmares on us. I bet in the end Musk will be responsible for a lot of
people dying.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I love the car, and thus love the people who
developed it, who I don’t know. I hope they’re not Nazis. I don’t see
how someone who could design such a thing as a Tesla Model Y, in
<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/19/140204.html?title=myNewTesla">2021</a>,
the year I bought mine, could be anything like that.
</p>
<p>
This car is going to be copied. There will be a generation of cars that
comes along, some that have not arrived yet, that will have to stand up
to a comparison to a Tesla. This is the original.
</p>
<p>
To be alive when such a product comes out and not own one, that would be
hard for me to do. I don’t think my “support” of Tesla could mean that
much. The money is already spent. It costs nothing to maintain the car
(one of its innovations).
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/09/word.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">It’s
like the Macintosh of cars. I would have owned a Macintosh in 1984 even
if I wasn’t one of Apple’s top developers. I also know that Steve Jobs
didn’t design the machine, he stole it from people at Xerox who did.
Apple refined the idea, made it practical, like a Tesla, commercial.
That’s a huge accomplishment, commercializing and humanizing a concept
like the Mac was harder than inventing, imho. I have a feeling that
Tesla must stand on the shoulders of giants in a similar way.
</p>
<p>
Tesla is always sending me emails, which I usually read, but last week I
got one urging me to join X. I thought what bullshit. I don’t want these
products connected. There was a time, not that long ago, that I would
have thought a car hooked up to Twitter as a fantastic and futuristic
idea, but now, I think it means no one of principle, certainly no one
who is a target of Nazis could work at Tesla in the future. And those
are some of the brightest people out there.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile I’m looking at other company’s EVs with lust. I might like a
Kia or a BMW. If you’re making a consumer product, Nazi branding is not
a good look. And X is becoming a stinker too.
</p>

PS: I was inspired to write this piece by one written by

<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>The energetic electrons that drive the aurora borealis (the northern
lights) have a rich and very dynamic structure that we currently do not
fully understand.  Much of what we know about these electrons comes from
instruments that have fundamental limitations in their ability to sample
multiple energies with high time resolution. To overcome these
limitations, NASA is using an innovative approach to develop
instrumentation that will enhance our measurement capabilities by more
than an order of magnitude—revealing a wealth of new information about
the amazing physics happening within the aurora.</p>

<h2 id="ten-years-ago-windows-xp-received-its-final-update">Ten years
ago, Windows XP received its final update</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Exactly ten years ago, on April 8, 2014, Microsoft released the final
security patch for Windows XP. The day marked the end of the road for
one of the most iconic Windows versions ever released. ↫ Taras Buria at
Neowin I never liked Windows XP. Compared to the operating systems I was
using at the time – BeOS, Mandrake Linux 8.x – Windows XP felt kind of
like a bad joke I wasn’t in on. It looked ridiculous, didn’t seem to
offer anything substantial, and it didn’t take long for major security
incidents related to Windows XP to start dominating the news. It wasn’t
until several service packs had been released that Windows XP came into
its own, but by that point, I had already found a much better
alternative for my Windows needs at the time. I’m of course talking
about Windows Server 2003, the better Windows than Windows XP. Today
though, I do have an odd fondness for Windows XP, as I grow older and XP
has become something from my teenage years. The look and feel of Windows
XP – the classic theme, not that horrendous Fisher Price nonsense – the
sound set, the wallpaper of course – has become iconic, warts and all,
and whole generations of people will feel instant feelings as soon as
they see Bliss or hear that iconic startup sound. Windows XP with a few
service packs now belongs to the small group of Windows releases that I
would call the peak of the platform, together with Windows 95 and
Windows 7 (and perhaps Server 2003, but that’s more of a personal thing
and not a consumer operating system). Everything else has not exactly
been great or even aged well, and I doubt Windows 10 and 11 will
suddenly get good, either.</p>

launches Axion processors, new Arm-based CPUs for the data centre</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Built using the Arm Neoverse™ V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant
leaps in performance for general-purpose workloads like web and app
servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory
caches, data analytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training
and inferencing, and more. Axion is underpinned by Titanium, a system of
purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out
offloads. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like
networking and security, so Axion processors have more capacity and
improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also offloads
storage I/O processing to Hyperdisk, our new block storage service that
decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically
provisioned in real time. ↫ Amin Vahdat on the Google blog Fancy new ARM
processors from Google, designed explicitly for the data centre. In
other words, we’ll never get to play with it unless one makes its way to
eBay in a few years.</p>

engine in Qt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve been talking about Servo, the Rust browser engine project
originally started at Mozilla, for a while now, and while the project’s
still got a long way to go, it’s definitely a serious contender to
become a competitive browser engine in the future. It seems it’s
starting to get some traction already, as The KDAB Group is working on
bringing Servo to Qt. At KDAB we managed to embed the Servo web engine
inside Qt, by using our CXX-Qt library as a bridge between Rust and C++.
This means that we can now use Servo as an alternative to Chromium for
webviews in Qt applications. ↫ Andrew Hayzen and Magnus Groß They’re
already showing off a basic QML application rendering websites using
Servo, which is pretty cool. It goes to show that Servo can definitely
eventually fulfill the role that Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko fulfill
now.</p>

<h2>
Usage example
</h2>
<p>
pl/dotnet gives you the full power of C# and F# in your PostgreSQL
procedures, functions, and triggers.
</p>
<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dynamic_record_generator_srf(lim INT8)  
RETURNS SETOF record  
AS $$  
    upperLimit = lim.HasValue ? lim : System.Int32.MaxValue;  
    for(long i=0;i&lt;upperLimit;i++){ yield return new object?[] { i, $"Number is {i}" }; }  
$$ LANGUAGE plcsharp;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dynamic_record_generator_srf_fsharp(lim INT8)  
RETURNS SETOF record  
AS $$  
    let upperLimit = Option.defaultValue (int64 System.Int32.MaxValue) lim  
    seq { for i in 0L .. upperLimit - 1L do yield [| box i; $"Number is {i}" |] }  
$$ LANGUAGE plfsharp;
</code></pre>
<h2>
SQL features
</h2>
<p>
We support all SQL function modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
normal procedures and functions
</li>
<li>
trigger functions, will full trigger support: trigger arguments, old/new
row, row rewriting (where allowed), and all the standard trigger
information
</li>
<li>
set-returning functions, nicely mapped to iterators in C# and sequences
in F#
</li>
<li>
table functions, as well as functions returning records or sets of
records
</li>
<li>
full support for IN/OUT/INOUT functions
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Data type support
</h2>
<p>
We support 40 PostgreSQL types, with all mapped to their NPGSQL-standard
dotnet types. The only notable exceptions are multirange, enum, and
struct types, which we hope to add in the future. All datatypes are
nullable, have full array support, and are fully unit-tested for C# and
F#. (Formatted as a list of (PostgreSQL type: Dotnet type) instead of a
table for technical reasons.)

<h2>
SPI
</h2>
<p>
Our SPI leverages the NPGSQL client library to provide a native dotnet
implementation which is maximally compatible with existing client code.
We intercepted the NPGSQL calls at a very low level to replace the
client protocol handling with SPI calls; otherwise, NPGSQL was
unmodified. We imported the NPGSQL test suite as stored procedures and
are using it for our testing, giving us very good understanding of our
compatiblity level.
</p>
<p>
Work remains to improve the compatibility and add features. Our biggest
category of NPGSQL tests that continue to fail is error mapping, because
SPI throws exceptions differently than NPGSQL does. Such
incompatibilities are minor but numerous; we continue working to improve
them.
</p>
<p>
Here are our currently tested SPI operations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Data Manipulation Language (DML) Operations
<ul>
<li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
What we don’t have
</h2>
<p>
We lack support for multirange, enum, and composite/table types. We
intend to add them.
</p>
<p>
Our SPI implementation lacks some minor features like sub-transactions,
and we sometimes raise errors in a different (and therefore slightly
incompatible) way from NPGSQL.
</p>
<p>
Our build system, with both dpkg and binary output, is functional but
not as tidy as we would like.
</p>
<p>
We welcome code submissions to address any of these issues, and we hope
to improve them all in time.
</p>
<h2>
Where to get it
</h2>
<p>
Our operating system support:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We fully support Linux and provide dpkg’s for Debian and Ubuntu.
(Details on our
<a href="https://pldotnet.brickabode.com/how-to-install-pl-net">installation
page</a>)
</li>
<li>
We have built and tested the system on OSX (arm and x86), but we have
not packaged it yet.
</li>
<li>
We look forward to having Windows support soon; ping us if you would
like to help.

<h2 id="intels-ambitious-meteor-lake-igpu">Intel’s ambitious Meteor Lake
iGPU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Intel and AMD both tried to ship iGPUs fast enough to compete with
low end discrete cards over the past 10 years with mixed results.
Recently though, powerful iGPUs have been thrown back into the
spotlight. Handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck and ASUS’s ROG Ally
demonstrated that consumers are willing to accept compromises to play
games on the go. AMD has dominated that market so far. Valve’s Steam
Deck uses AMD’s Van Gogh APU, and the ROG Ally uses the newer Phoenix
APU. Unlike Van Gogh, Phoenix is a general purpose mobile chip with both
a powerful CPU and GPU. Phoenix doesn’t stop at targeting the handheld
segment, and threatens Intel’s laptop market share too. In response,
Meteor Lake brings a powerful iGPU to the party. It has the equivalent
of 128 EUs and clocks up to 2.25 GHz, making it modestly wider and much
faster than Raptor Lake’s 96 EU, 1.5 GHz iGPU. Raptor Lake’s Xe-LP
graphics architecture gets replaced by Xe-LPG, a close relative of the
Xe-HPG architecture used in Intel’s A770 discrete GPU. At the system

chiplet configuration where the iGPU gets significant transistor and
area budget. I’ll be testing Meteor Lake’s iGPU with the Core Ultra 7

myself in late February. ↫ Chips and Cheese I’m absolutely here for the
resurgence in capable integrated GPUs, both for PC gaming on the go and
for better graphics performance even in thinner, smaller laptops. I
would love to have just a bit more graphics power on my thin and small

<h2 id="google-launches-new-find-my-device-network-on-android">Google
launches new Find My Device network on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, the all-new Find My Device is rolling out to Android devices
around the world, starting in the U.S. and Canada. With a new,
crowdsourced network of over a billion Android devices, Find My Device
can help you find your misplaced Android devices and everyday items
quickly and securely. Here are five ways you can try it out. ↫ Erik Kay
on the Google blog This old Android feature has basically been updated
to be the same thing as Apple’s Find My, but with more than just one
vendor making the tracking tags. Of course, this means it also comes
with the same problems, from its use by stalkers to controlling
partners, and everything in between. This is a very problematic
technology, one which I think is almost impossible to make safe. Still,
I have a Samsung tracker that I don’t use anymore – because I bought a
Pixel 8 Pro, and don’t want to install any Samsung applications – and I
do plan on getting a new tracker that’s compatible with this new Find My
Device network. With two small kids, it’s easy to lose track of
something like my car keys, and instead of stressing about where they
are when we need to leave on time, I can just ping them using our Google
Home devices instead. Sometimes, these silly smart technologies really
do take just that little bit of stress out of your life – you just have
to be really picky and honest with yourself about what you really
need.</p>

id="microsoft-adds-driver-to-windows-that-prevents-changing-the-default-browser-using-the-registry">Microsoft
adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using
the registry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>There are various ways you can change the default browser and similar
defaults on Windows, but oneof the ways many third-party tools do this
is by editing the relevant registry strings. It turns out that Microsoft
is not particularly happy with this, as they’ve recently introduced a
new driver specifically designed to prevent this from happening, by
blocking tools like regedit or PowerShell from editing a number of
registry keys for setting default applications. The driver was
discovered by Christoph Kolbicz. Microsoft implemented a driver based
protection to block changes to http/https and .pdf associations by 3rd
party utilities. The rollout was staggered and activated “randomly”, but
in the meantime I got many reports – also from business or education
environments (but not Server OS). Microsoft also updated the driver
during my tests (from 2.0 to 2.1) and extended the deny list of
executables. This means, they can change the behavior almost on the fly
and add new tricks or block additional extensions/protocols! ↫ Christoph
Kolbicz Digging further into what, exactly, this driver can do,
Microsoft also made it so that even if you disable the driver, an
additional scheduled task will run to re-enable the driver and revert
the registry changes. It also seems this is somehow related to the
changes Microsoft has to make to comply with the EU’s DMA, but the
driver is also installed on systems outside of the EU, so it’s all a bit
unclear at the moment.</p>

Somewhat-related notes about different kinds of networks, ActivityPub

tries out new ideas.

ActivityPub you know who’s following you and in RSS you don’t. This may
sound like a negative until you think about it from the user’s
standpoint: no spam, spyware, etc. Which is probably why Google didn’t
like RSS btw.

It has been
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@dusoft@fosstodon.org/112230502776773193">pointed
out</a> that some level of spying happens based on IP address, and I can
testify to that, I get podcasts with ads for a local supermarket, kind
of spooky but I guess ok. I can’t recall ever receiving spam as a result
of subscribing to a feed, and I never get messages from them when I
unsub begging me to come back. So it isn’t a huge problem in a real way
at least for me, yet.
</li>
<li>
I block spammers. In twitter-like systems, like Mastodon, spam means you
attached a post to my post that is in no way responsive to it. You’re
just trying to coast on the flow generated by other posts. I don’t abide
that. Have a nice day.

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">
ALGOL is one of those topics that’s haunted the show for a while. It
comes up any time we talk about programming languages, and with good
reason. Many of the features and ideas found in modern languages have
their roots in ALGOL. Despite that influence, ALGOL itself remains
somewhat obscure. It never reached the highs of a C or LISP.
</p>
<p>
In this series we are going to look at ALGOL from 1958 all up to 1968,
keeping a careful eye on how the language evolved, how it’s problems
were addressed, and how new problems were introduced.

longer works in Windows 11 24H2. ExplorerPatcher from Valinet is quite a
popular app that lets you bring back the old Windows 10 taskbar in
Windows 11, apply additional modifications to make Windows 11 slightly
better, and restore some of its missing features. Windows 11 version
24H2 is now flagging ExplorerPatcher as incompatible due to “security or
performance issues” with the following message. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin
I guess the taskbar and Start menu are incredibly important real estate
for Microsoft, since it’s the absolute prime spot for showing ads. If
users replace their taskbar and Start menu with something from a third
party, that prime real estate is gone. Major conspiracy vibes, yes, and
I know this isn’t the reason, but why else would they be blocking these
applications? I can’t think of anything that makes more sense.</p>

<h2 id="outlook-is-microsofts-new-data-collection-service">Outlook is
Microsoft’s new data collection service</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>With Microsoft’s rollout of the new Outlook for Windows, it appears
the company has transformed its email app into a surveillance tool for
targeted advertising. Everyone talks about the privacy-washing campaigns
of Google and Apple as they mine your online data to generate
advertising revenue. But now it looks like Outlook is no longer simply
an email service; it’s a data collection mechanism for Microsoft’s 801
external partners and an ad delivery system for Microsoft itself. ↫
Edward Komenda on the Proton blog Now, note that this is an article
written by Proton, posted on the company blog, so of course they’re not
going to be too kind towards their competitors. That being said, the
article’s not wrong: the new Outlook web application, now the default in
Windows, not only shared your data with around 800 partners, it also
displays ads inside of the application. On macOS, it will even show yo
fake emails that are, in fact, ads. Furthermore, once you add your
accounts to this new Outlook web application, you’ll also be uploading
your username and password to Microsoft, giving them access to your
email accounts for advertising and data collection purposes, a shady
practice a ton of email clients on mobile devices tend to do as well.
Suffice it to say you really shouldn’t be using this new Outlook, and
you should make sure friends and family don’t either. This is yet
another nail in the coffin of Windows, now an advertising and data
collection platform first, and operating system second.</p>

open-source btrfs driver for Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>WinBtrfs is a Windows driver for the next-generation Linux filesystem
Btrfs. A reimplementation from scratch, it contains no code from the
Linux kernel, and should work on any version from Windows XP onwards. It
is also included as part of the free operating system ReactOS. ↫
WinBtrfs GitHub page If you’re running a distribution that defaults to
Btrfs, or you actively choose to use it on other distributions, and you
also happen to dual-boot Windows because your boss makes you use some
garbage corpo software, this driver will make your setup a bit easier to
manage.</p>

<p>You may have read yesterday’s New York Times report by Cade Metz and
others on how many of the biggest AI companies have been cutting ethical
corners in a race to gather as much data as possible (“OpenAI, Google
and Meta ignored corporate policies, altered their own rules and
discussed skirting copyright law as they sought online information to
train their newest artificial intelligence systems”).</p>

Bluesky, Andrew Hickey
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/andrewhickey.bsky.social/post/3kpjm37omkj2b">explains</a>
how hard it is for him to focus while construction is going on at his
house. I recognize the problem. I had major work done on the roof of my
house last summer, and lost focus for a good two months, even though I
had rented office space and at times an AirBnb to get away from the
chaos. It wasn’t until the work was over that I was able to start to get
back into my flow.
</p>
<p>
In my work, I start pretty much at the same time every day, and I get a
good five or six hours before it’s time to do the next thing. The first
hour is warming up. Then I go to the notes I left the night before about
where I’m going next. By hour two, I’m not quite at my highest rate but
getting there, by hours 3-5 I get monster stuff done, if I’m in a good
groove. Hour six is iffy. All the while I’m taking short breaks to check
email, tweets, whatever. All of it asynchronous. Waiting for my
attention to be available, for a short period.
</p>
<p>
After 5-6 hours of this, I’m wiped out.
</p>
<p>
I can handle small interruptions, like a package delivery.
</p>
<p>
But if it involves the front of my brain for any real amount of time, if
I have to shift my attention elsewhere, boom, it all drops out of my
head. It doesn’t take much of a shift in attention to lose the whole
thing, and basically have to start over the next day.
</p>
<p>
Try to imagine a professional tennis player. Do they talk about anything
other than tennis during the game. Not with any focus. I’m sure of it.
Their attention is fully on the sport. Same deal with intellectual
achievement. If you’re doing something that few other people do well,
you’re not only doing the complex things, and require multiple steps and
a lot of detail, and memory, but you’re sometimes inventing things that
no one has done before. All the levels interact and affect each other.
And you’re doing a shitload of learning the whole time. Until you’re
burned out for the day that is. Or your deck gets shuffled. ;-)
</p>
<p>
PS: People sending you emails saying how great your last thing was, they
don’t interfere at all. ;-)
</p>
<p>
PPS: I wrote this post during one of my breaks. I won’t edit it until
the evening, when I do lite work that doesn’t require much focus for any
duration.

2024-04-06 Travelling
</h1>
<p>
The last ten years, travels – even holiday travels! – have made me more
and more nervous. I used to be so cool about travel. We lived abroad and
travelled so much. And now I’d prefer to just stay in Switzerland all
the time. But my wife still loves to travel and once I’m there, wherever
it is, I feel OK again.
</p>
<p>
I can’t say what it is. A vague anxiety about everything. From the
smallest thing like it’s spring and I’m going to miss the next two weeks
of flowers, and the bees are all emerging from their reed tubes and I
hope our friend is OK with watering the gazillion plants we have and I
hope we didn’t forget anything and I hope security checks are going to
be OK and foreign dictatorship and secret services are going to stay out
of our lives and out of our phones and I hope we have enough money for
tips and how much does one tip again?
</p>
<p>
Back when I was about thirty I argued that equipped with a credit card
nothing else mattered. I’d just buy whatever I was missing. These days
we start our “packing mound” days beforehand.
