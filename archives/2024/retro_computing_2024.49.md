date: 2024-12-06, from: Digital Antiquarian

For some of you, Andrew Plotkin will need no introduction. The rest of you ought to know that he&#8217;s quite an amazing guy, easily one of the half-dozen most important figures in the history of post-Infocom interactive fiction. By my best reckoning, he&#8217;s written an even dozen fully realized, polished text adventures in all, from [&#8230;]

## RingBind reaches version 0.20

date: 2024-12-06, from: RiscOS Story

And there&#8217;s now a beta version of the Impression User Manual in Bound format Chris Hall has made available a new version of RingBind. The application offers an alternative way to view user manuals and other publications on screen, making them look like ring-bound manuals, as though open on your desk &#8211; provided they have first been converted to the Bound format (and file-type). With version 0.20, a few bugs have been corrected, and the software now correctly implements page-to-page links &#8211; so rather than thumb (in a virtual manner)&#8230;

## There may be 100 mega-reasons to grab Elesarâ€™s new NIC for your RiscPC

date: 2024-11-30, from: RiscOS Story

Well, okay, that&#8217;s a 100mbps connection &#8211; so just the one reason, then. Elesar Ltd launched a new product at the London Show last month1, a 100baseT NIC (with patch lead) for the RiscPC and A7000/A7000+ machines. The new NICs feature an optimised design, using an ASIX AX88796 fast Ethernet controller with a built-in 16kB buffer memory, which allows network packets to be handled locally inside the chip. There&#8217;s also 128kB of flash memory containing the driver software &#8211; which is both 26 and 32-bit compatible, so it&#8217;s as suitable&#8230;
