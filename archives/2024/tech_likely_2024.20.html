MSNBC yesterday I saw a discussion where two black panelists were asked
to comment on Trump’s idea that black people go for him because they can
relate to his awful prison mug shot. How incredibly insulting. It’s just
like what Trump says about Jewish Americans being loyal to Israel. Such
an un-American idea. We all got here different ways. Some for a better
life, some for life at all, others as slaves. But the United States is a
big-hearted idea – the <i>United</i> States. It’s unfortunate that such
a small-minded <i>dis</i>united person is so powerful now. We still have
a long way to go.</p>

Innovator’s Dilemma in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
It’s overwhelming how much ground Google has to cover to get AI into all
their products, but that’s what they think they have to do, and I more
or less agree. They feel they have to because their main product,
search, is undermined by ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/17/innovatorsDilemma.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Clayton
Christensen called

published in 1997. It’s why Netscape was able to undermine Microsoft
when the web came out. Microsoft had a huge beast they had to move,
Windows and all its apps, and while they had a hardcore, scrappy and
rich culture, they couldn’t overcome the inertia that comes from being
dug in, with their cannons pointed at the already-defeated IBM, not the
upstarts that came from the VCs in Silicon Valley.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft and the rest of the PC industry had written off Unix, but
there it was, again – ugly as ever, but with networking that realllly
worked and was easy, and the users wanted networking even though
Microsoft wanted them to want Office.
</p>
<p>
Google did the same thing with AI. As did Apple, Amazon, Facebook,
Microsoft, etc. They had AI projects, and used AI in limited areas, as
did Microsoft with Unix in the early 90s. But they couldn’t bet
everyting on it like a startup can. Now they have to. But the they don’t
have the tools needed to fight the new war. <i>That’s</i> the dilemma.
</p>
<p>
This is the toughest corner any tech company has to turn, but there is
an approach that could work for Google. Their strength is distribution.
They have all the users. They can take a product that’s ready for the
world to market in a day. But they can’t develop it. You can’t snap your
fingers and have a good new UI for every one of their products, ready in
a year, although they will try as MS tried to adapt Office to the web.
They don’t have the right people or corporate culture to do that.
Instead you have to hope you can find a great bootstrapper outside to
work with, and use their strength as a distributor to help them. This is
what I recommended for Microsoft in the 1990s, and I think I was
vindicated, it would have imho worked a lot better than the path they
chose.
</p>
<p>
But now, their second time around this loop, Microsoft has learned! With
their OpenAI partnership they’ve done exactly what I recommended in the
90s. They still have to convert all the old software and their user
interfaces around the new capabilities, but at least they also own a
share of a bootstrap that’s booming.
</p>
<p>
PS: I am blessed to have lived long enough now to have been part of now
six different rearrangements like this. I love that we have now gotten
there again. There’s absolutely no doubt now, imho. The six
rearrangements – minis, PCs, GUIs, web, Napster, and now AI.
</p>
<p>
PPS: This is all my opinion, and from the polls I did
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/16.html">yesterday</a>, it’s
obvious that many of the people in earshot don’t agree or have seen the
light yet.

a ‘frozen’ distribution Linux kernel isn’t the safest choice for
security</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a compelling story and on the surface makes a lot of sense.
Carefully curated software patches applied to a known Linux kernel,
frozen at a specific release, would obviously seem to be preferable to
the random walk of an upstream open source Linux project. But is it
true? Is there data to support this ? After a lot of hard work and data
analysis by my CIQ kernel engineering colleagues Ronnie Sahlberg and
Jonathan Maple, we finally have an answer to this question. It’s no. The
data shows that “frozen” vendor Linux kernels, created by branching off
a release point and then using a team of engineers to select specific
patches to back-port to that branch, are buggier than the upstream
“stable” Linux kernel created by Greg Kroah-Hartman. ↫ Jeremy Allison at
CIQ I mean, it kind of makes sense. The full whitepaper is available,
too.</p>

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
My name is Om. I grew up in Delhi, India. After attending university and
starting off as a journalist in India, I became fascinated with
technology and the emergence of the Internet. I eventually immigrated to
the United States. Media was part of my worldview, and I knew very early
on as a teenager that I wanted to be a writer. The rest of the journey
is in pursuit of that one truth about myself. Since then, I have added
“camera” to my tool belt — I try to write with my photos as well.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
Being so early to the network, it made me realize the importance of
publishing to the new network. IT didn’t matter what tools you were
using — people still get caught up in the whole idea of tools — when
writing to the network (whether with words, visuals or voice) is the
main thing.
</p>
<p>
I was writing on the internet even before we had blogs. I used to
publish personal stuff on the web in a hardcoded (hand written) html and
post it to my minuscule home page on Pipeline, a local ISP in North East
United States. Eventually I joined Forbes.com, which was one of the
earliest mainstream media outlets to establish a dedicated web team and
website.
</p>
<p>
I used to have a newsletter - dotcomwala- that I would send to a few
hundred people and I shared a lot of “news” I would pick up from my
works as a reporter. It didn’t pass the rigor of a mainstream media
website, so it was my lightweight take on news, even though I had
confirmed it with a one or two people, just not three people a
mainstream news outlets expected you to have. Eventually the newsletter
gave way to a website - GigaOm — and in late 2001 it became pretty
obvious that the idea of “technology magazines” covering technology on a
weekly or monthly cadence was a dumb idea. Tech moved so fast, and the
print world so slow.
</p>
<p>
I decided to basically turn my website into a blog — first with
<a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, then with
<a href="https://www.movabletype.org">Moveable Type</a>, because it
allowed me to have comments and community. In a way, my evolution as a
writer happened as the network matured and gave us an opportunity to put
the power of the network to work.
</p>
<p>
My initial focus was core technology— which is what I liked intuitively.
It was always a bit more skewed in favor of startups, because I have
always liked upstarts with long odds. We in tech at that time were all
upstarts. Over the years I have become more explanatory in my writing
and do more analysis than just plain news. That transition was a result
of personal growth, more experience and ability to be very confident in
being able to articulate myself without needing editors.
</p>
<p>
I would say my grounding in core technology and lessons learned as a
Forbes reporter allow me to understand the downstream impacts of
technology, and at the same time allowed me to think about the
possibilities of what new chips, new photonic gear or new storage could
make possible.
</p>
<p>
For me, blogging is my perfect form of writing and expression. As a
reporter I respect the facts, and as an essayist I can make
correlations. Blogging gives me the voice, the platform and freedom to
be a tad casual, should the topic require so.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
My creative process is pretty uncreative really. I am constantly
reporting. I am always reading. I am always making notes — either
mentally or on paper. I keep a common place notebook — I take notes,
write down thoughts and basically leave myself messages. I write with a
100 year old pen and ink made by a company that is almost 300 years old.
There is something gratifying about the technology perfected in the
past, allowing me to dream about the future.
</p>
<p>
I often get ideas for a blog post, and when that happens I start
writing. I use my phone to draft a post. I use the phone to dictate a
document. And then I run it through some kind of tool to check grammar.
I use <a href="https://lex.page">Lex</a> for writing and editing — this
is AI powered and smarter version of Google Docs. I use
<a href="https://www.sudowrite.com">Sudowrite</a> for my creative
writing which I almost never share.
</p>
<p>
I have had editors and collaborators in the past, but now I use a lot of
ai tools to fill out the procedural aspect of the writing and editing. I
still have half-a-dozen people (including former editors) who I share my
ideas and longer pieces to get second and often third opinion. I find
that as I have grown older, I want to be more measured (and less
bombastic) in my approach.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I am not too picky about where I work — I write in cafes, airports,
planes, back seat of a cab, or I will just stop on the side of the road
if the words come to me. During the pandemic I converted a spare room
into my office, but it is mostly for my other creative practice — photos
and photo editing. I have a Mac Studio with a big monitor for editing
images. I occasionally use it for writing and zoom calls. But, when it
comes to computers, I write on an iPad with a keyboard.
</p>
<p>
However, most of my writing including blog posts start in a notebook. I
buy fountain pen friendly notebooks from Japan. I have a bunch of
fountain pens, though my favorite is a 100-year old pen. It is too
fragile to travel, so I have a couple of others, like a
<a href="https://www.lamy.com/en/lamy-aion/">Lamy AiOn</a> which takes
cartridges and is made out of metal that I can taken when I have to
travel overseas. I have a couple of others that are almost always in my
bag — either with blue or another blue ink.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
This is fairly easy. I was on Moveable Type, but I was an early convert
to open source, and was an early switcher to WordPress. I think I was in
the initial batch of users even before they officially launched the
alpha. I have been on WordPress since then. It is hosted on Pressable.
It is fairly simple WP installation. I use some plugins, such as
Postmark for my newsletter. There are some others for photo galleries
and categories, but mostly whatever comes with WP and with the official
Jetpack plugins.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
So, this is a tough question for me. When I started my blog, it was a
personal blog. GigaOM, eventually became a company, and my personal blog
ended its existence. A few years later, I started my current blog, On My
Om (<a href="https://om.co">Om.co</a>) to really revive all my
non-professional writing, and musings since I couldn’t publish those on
GigaOM, which had become a collaborative publication and was more
polished than my casual scribbles. When GigaOM shutdown in 2015, I
started publishing more “tech” related writing on Om.co, and since then
I have been writing there.
</p>
<p>
The name, On My Om, is a reflection on the reality — this is just me,
and no-one else writing. It is much more like my old blog, as it allows
me to be quirky about things that I care about. I recently restructured
the blog to reflect the new reality of my writing — for instance, I
separated essay and interviews into their own categories. I have a daily
blog. And I created two categories — one for my photography and one for
my other obsessions such as fountain pens and inks.
</p>
<p>
As to using a different platform, I have toyed with the idea, but I
don’t because I am so familiar with WordPress. Plus, I am friends with
Matt Mullenweg and he does good tech support, when I run into a problem.
No seriously, though I like what Ghost is doing. I think WP could learn
a lot from them in how to seamlessly go between email publishing and
blog publishing. On email front, I love what
<a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown.Email</a> is doing. I
highly recommend them over Substack or any other large entity because
they are independent.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
I don’t monetize my blog. I don’t look at stats. I don’t care about
traffic. I don’t want to put any ads on my blog — and the reason is that
through the luck of the draw and my good fortune, I have been able to
make a decent living and can afford to spend a few hundred bucks a year
on my blog. For me, Om.co is my homestead on the web, where people come
to either get to know me better, learn about things I have learned
about, or generally be part of my community. I am on the other end of
the whole blog cycle. Almost like I have come a full circle. I had
started Gigaom as a means of expression at that time, and then it became
a business, and well, here I am again.
</p>
<p>
As for supporting others — I have subscriptions to about half a dozen
newsletters (not tech), and a whole bunch of small and indie
publications. I love supporting the small media, but don’t have time for
establishment media outlets. I don’t much care for some of the larger
blogs as well. And same goes for the larger YouTubers and podcasts. You
need to catch them early — that’s when they really are pure and hustling
to serve the reader.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
I don’t know if I have a must read blog any more — there are many, that
I love. If you were to twist my arm, I would say
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-arun-venkatesan">Arun
Venkatesan</a> has a low key blog at
<a href="https://arun.is">Arun.is</a>. I like his “design” centric
approach and intentionality. I also love
<a href="https://www.lastwordonnothing.com/">Last Word On Nothing</a>, a
really great group blog by bunch of science writers. It is fantastic.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
Well, this is a good one. I love a photography-focused podcast,
<a href="https://photowork.foundation/podcast/">Photo Work</a>. I am
also in love with <a href="https://www.slowdownshow.org">The Slowdown
Podcast</a>. I highly recommend using
<a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a> as a replacement for Pocket.
It is very good. And my current favorite desktop tool is
<a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper">MacWhisper</a> —
it is basically transcription on the desktop and not having to share all
your audio with others. I love creating voice memos and using it to
transcribe, and then ideating with it on Lex or one of the other
AI-enhanced editing tools.

I’m really curious what my dad would have thought about the student
protests for Palestine. He was at Kent State when the shootings
happened. He was in a class with John Filo, who took the famous photo of
Mary Ann Vecchio. But the last few years of his life he was slipping
further and further into Fox News’ black hole. I like to blame it on the
disease; it was killing his brain piece-by-piece after all. I can’t be
sure, though.
</p>
<p>
Still, imagining this man with his collection of Kent State documents
and histories in our basement growing up now being faced with students
protesting genocide. The right-wing is seething and police are being
brought in to break up the protests. The rhetoric is so familiar, it
must have been able to trigger something in him, right? I would have
liked the opportunity to have that talk.

<h2 id="state-of-the-terminal">State of the terminal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s only been in the last couple of years that I’ve begun to dig
deep into the inner workings of how terminal emulators, and the
applications that run inside of them, really work. I’ve learned that
there is a lot of innovation and creative problem solving happening in
this space, even though the underlying technology is over half a century
old. I’ve also found that many people who use terminal based tools
(including shells like Bash and editors like Vim) know very little about
terminals themselves, or some of the modern features and capabilities
they can support. In this article, we’ll discuss some of the problems
that terminal based applications have historically had to deal with (and
what the modern solutions are) as well as some features that modern
terminal emulators support that you may not be aware of. ↫ Gregory
Anders I don’t use the terminal much – usually just to update my systems
– but on occasion I’ve had to really sit down and explore them more than
usual, especially now that my workstation runs OpenBSD, and the depth
and breadth of features, options, and clever tricks they possess is
amazing. Over the past half century they’ve accumulated a lot of
features along the way, and even though its unlikely to ever be for me,
I can somewhat begin to appreciate why some people just tile a bunch of
terminals on their screens and do all their computing that way. I grew
up with MS-DOS and Windows 3.x and later, so I’m just too attached to my
mouse and pretty icons to switch to a terminal lifestyle, but over the
years I’ve seen some pretty amazing terminal applications, from Mastodon
clients to complex mail applications and web browsers, and you can be
sure none of them steal your data or show you ads. Maybe the terminal
people are right after all.</p>

materials a product is made of, along with each material’s mass. This is
straightforward for most clothes like jumpers and pants. These are
typically made of a single fabric, such as cotton or polyester. The mass
of each material is roughly the same as the product’s mass.</p>

Boy: the bizarre rise and quick fall of Nintendo’s enigmatic red
console</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Nearly 30 years after the launch of the Virtual Boy, not much is
publicly known about how, exactly, Nintendo came to be interested in
developing what would ultimately become its ill-fated console. Was
Nintendo committed to VR as a future for video games and looking for
technological solutions that made business sense? Or was the Virtual Boy
primarily the result of Nintendo going “off script” and seizing a
unique, and possibly risky, opportunity that presented itself? The
answer is probably a little bit of both. As it turns out, the Virtual
Boy was not an anomaly in Nintendo’s history with video game platforms.
Rather, it was the result of a deliberate strategy that was consistent
with Nintendo’s way of doing things and informed by its lead creator
Gunpei Yokoi’s design philosophy. ↫ Benj Edwards and Jose Zagal at Ars
Technica I’ve never used a Virtual Boy, and in fact, I’ve never even
seen one in real life. It was mythical object when I was not even a
teenager yet, something we read about in gaming magazines in The
Netherlands. We didn’t really know what it was or how it worked, and it
wasn’t until much later, in the early YouTube age, that I got to see
what using one was actually like in the countless YouTube videos made
about the device. It seems it caused quite a few headaches, was
cumbersome to use, had very few games, and those that were sold ended up
collecting dust pretty quickly. In that sense, it seems not a lot has
changed over the past thirty years.</p>

<h2 id="winamp-to-open-up-its-source-code">Winamp to “open up” its
source code</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Winamp has announced that on 24 September 2024, the application’s
source code will be open to developers worldwide. Winamp will open up
its code for the player used on Windows, enabling the entire community
to participate in its development. This is an invitation to global
collaboration, where developers worldwide can contribute their
expertise, ideas, and passion to help this iconic software evolve. ↫
Winamp press release Nice, I guess, but twenty years to late to be of
any relevance. At least it’ll be great for software preservation. But
what’s up with the odd language used in the press release, and the
weirdly specific date that’s month from now? They really seem to want to
avoid the term “open source”, which makes me think this is going to be
one of those cases where they hope the community will work for them for
free without actually using a real open source license. You know, those
schemes that always – no exception – fail.</p>

<h2 id="the-x-window-system-and-the-curse-of-numlock">The X Window
System and the curse of NumLock</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ordinary modifiers are normally straightforward, in that they are
additional keys that are held down as you type the main key. Control,
Shift, and Alt all work this way (by default). However, some modifiers
are ‘sticky’, where you tap their key once to turn them on and then tap
their key again to turn them off. The obvious example of this is Caps
Lock (unless you turn its effects off, remapping its physical key to be,
say, another Ctrl key). Another example, one that many X users have
historically wound up quietly cursing, is NumLock. Why people wind up
cursing NumLock, and why I have a program to control its state, is
because of how X programs (such as window managers) often do their key
and mouse button bindings. ↫ Chris Siebenmann I always have an applet in
my KDE panel that shows me if I have any sticky modifiers enabled
without realising it. On some of my keyboards, this isn’t always easily
noticable, especially when you’re focused on what’s happening on your
display. A little icon that only shows up when a sticky modifier is
engaged solves this problem, as it immediately stands out in your
peripheral vision.</p>

<h1 id="2024-05-16-irc-forever">
2024-05-16 IRC forever!
</h1>
<p>
You know the joke, right? <a href="https://xkcd.com/1782/">In the far
future, somebody, somewhere, still wants to use IRC</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-05-16-irc-1.jpg" alt="XKCD called it, many years ago" />
</p>
<p>
I’ve been working on a bot that can connect to both Discord and IRC. It
connects to Discord because this is where I found people to game with.
Discord comes with audio chat. It catapulted my gaming to a whole new
level. So much so that I decided that I’d be a paying customer. Still, I
want to be prepared for the day when Discord goes down. When it
inevitably missteps and becomes untenable. I want to have systems ready
to go.
</p>
<p>
The idea is to have something read that does
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Chat">chat</a> for us all.
</p>
<p>
Behind the curtains, I run an IRC server using
<a href="https://ngircd.barton.de/">ngIRCd</a>. I was able to configure
it and I was able to federate with
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a>’s IRC server.
IRC has been federated for all these years and it’s so incredibly light
weight, very much unlike XMPP and Matrix and the other options I’ve
seen.
</p>
<p>
There are a number of web-based IRC clients that give it a Discord-like
user interface. I personally run two instances of
<a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>, one that’s free for
all and one with accounts. If you register for an account, you can
upload a small amount of files for easy image sharing and the like and
it also keeps logs for you (so you don’t have to learn how to use an IRC
“bouncer”).
</p>
<p>
Other options would be <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/">Kiwi IRC</a> or
<a href="https://www.irccloud.com/">IRC Cloud</a>, if you want a paid
service.
</p>
<p>
The bot I was talking about is called
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/norn.git">Norn</a>. Right now we
have an <code>#﻿open-table</code> or <code>#﻿next-games channel</code> on
the Discord servers where people announce their games. As players sign
up, the messages get edited. It’s not really events, it’s not reminders,
it’s not a calendar, but it’s simple and it works. You can search it.
But if you’re on IRC, it doesn’t work so well. So Norn does that.
</p>
<p>
On one of the Discord server, there’s a bot called Wettergoblin (the
weather goblin) that keeps track of in-game events. Every channel has
its own time-axis and you can get an export of all the events. This is
great for coordinating the many games in the same setting, each
happening in their own channel. I really wanted something like that but
instead of using in-game time, I wanted to use real time. This
simplified the requirements for me, so Norn does a bit of that. The
Wettergoblin also does in-game weather, keeps a Greyhawk calendar, shows
a timeline comparing where the various channels are compared to each
other and all of that, which Norn doesn’t do.
</p>
<p>
Norn also acts as a dice bot and as a knowledge repository.
</p>
<p>
Game dates, sign-ups, in-game events, knowledge base, all of that
happens per channel. It’s great!
</p>
<p>
If you look at the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%C3%BCrich/Norn">bilingual
help page</a> of the bot on a phone, prepare for a bit of confusion as
the German and the English bits are interleaved. On a bigger screen,
you’d get two columns…

<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: mrusme blog</p>
<p>“Granada is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the
autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Granada is located at the foot
of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers, the
Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. Ascribed to the Vega de
Granada comarca, the city sits at an average elevation of 738 m (2,421
ft) above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the Mediterranean
coast, the Costa Tropical.”</p>

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://chirp.enworld.org/@taichara" title="@taichara@chirp.enworld.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="taichara">@taichara</span></a> pointed me
to a blog post that Creative Commons (CC) wrote in 2023 about the court
cases against GitHub, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and the claim that
their use of copyrighted works to train the machines is copyright
infringement. CC does not agree.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As Creative Commons has argued elsewhere, and others agree, I believe
that this type of use should be protected by copyright’s fair use
doctrine. In this blog post I will discuss what fair use is, what
purpose it serves, and why I believe that using copyrighted works to
train generative AI models should be permitted under this law. –
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/02/17/fair-use-training-generative-ai/">Fair
Use: Training Generative AI</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I guess I don’t mind that blog post. For one, Fair Use is a very USA
thing and I don’t live there. Furthermore, the CC licenses don’t say
“this material is fine for AI training” – so whether this is fine or not
will be decided by the courts. I would only worry if CC turns out to be
working on a version 5 of their licenses with an explicit exception for
AI training. And even then, we can keep on using version 4 of the
license. There is no automatic upgrade option.
</p>
<p>
This is why I feel fine.
</p>
<p>
Imagine the Dude from The Big Lebowski saying, “Yeah, well, that’s just,
like, their opinion…”
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t look as if CC will be changing the license. The courts still
get to decide. If the courts decide in favour of free-for-all AI
training, then rich people win for the moment. But even then, we can
still nationalise their businesses, or prohibit AI training, or raise
prices on electricity and water. The fight isn’t over. Not by a long
shot.
</p>
<p>
Maybe this is a thing with lawyers. We trust people who share our values
and we’d trust somebody when they write something along the lines of “AI
training is terrible and AI use is dubious but what can you do, it’s in
the hand of the courts, we certainly don’t support it.” But lawyers
trust other lawyers who say “we’ll see what the courts say but our
understanding is that nobody should stop AI training because that’s the
trade-off copyright makes and we support people and corporations
exercising their rights.”
</p>
<p>
The apparent moral support on copyright grounds is revolting, but this
approach seems typical to me. They say: The point of the law is this or
that. We say: The result of these actions is bad for society and bad for
the climate. They are externalising all the costs. The artists and
authors who want to produce new works are losing their jobs. The people
double-checking the computers and their training are burning out. The
communities where these corporations build their computing centres
suffer from water scarcity because the water is used to cool the
computers. The countries where these corporations build their computing
centres need to build more power plants because so much electricity is
required to train their models. The move to renewable energies is
delayed. Phasing out nuclear power is delayed and more radioactive waste
ends up on our lands.

<p>
Or we can believe in nuclear fusion:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
AI models made up of billions of parameters require huge amounts of
energy to train. OpenAI’s old GPT-3 system reportedly consumed 936
megawatt hours … the average household consumes about 10.5 MWh per year.
That means training GPT-3 consumed as much energy as about 90 households
consume in a year. –

</blockquote>
<p>
Sadly, nuclear fusion only seems to be working inside the sun:
</p>
<blockquote>

predicts that fusion will be in commercial use within two decades. –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And what for? The people who are looking for answers get served bullshit
slop that’s wrong and hurtful and racist and misogynist. We see this in
customer service degrading, in search engines degrading, in websites
degrading. The corporations don’t mind that they’re feeding us slop as
long as they are making money.
</p>
<p>
We are enabling this because these corporations are powerful and rich.
They buy our politicians with money and promises of jobs, they don’t pay
the taxes they ought to pay and then they don’t deliver on the jobs, and
the jobs they offer are menial and subservient when we’d prefer to be
creative and free. We thought we’d be writing and painting all day while
the machines serve us but we end up serving them while they do the
writing and painting, badly!
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to defend against these corporations because the knowledge
required to defeat them is not known to us all. We don’t read about it
in the media. Instead, they volunteer for all the posts, offer their
experts, pay for their own research, write their own glowing press
releases and commission promising reports. This is how regulatory
capture works.
</p>
<p>
So yes, we should nationalise them, regulate them, force them to pay for
the true cost of resources they use, outlaw their energy waste, force
them to label their output, shun them. We should kick them from our
company. Like a creeping disease their rot spreads, destroying the
technology we built, the search engines, databases, websites, turning it
all into AI slop. It is revolting.
</p>
<p>
And maybe copyright is not the right tool to stop corporations from
training their machines on our works. But in the big picture, they are
still wrong.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.coop/@eloquence" title="@eloquence@social.coop"><span
class="citation" data-cites="eloquence">@eloquence</span></a> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The folks who are calling such training “theft” might regret what they
seem to be implicitly asking for, i.e. much stricter copyright.
Copyright law won’t prevent Microsoft, Google, OpenAI or Adobe from
making shady licensing deals, but they’ll prevent the free/open
community from keeping up.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s true, I don’t want to ask for stricter copyright. But I still
oppose all the things that are wrong with the current AI bubble.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc" title="@mcc@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mcc">@mcc</span></a> recently wrote about a
similar thing: We use free software licenses in order to distribute our
software for the benefit of our fellow humans but not necessarily to
train the machines of corporations that are responsible for all the
slop.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Like, heck, how am I <em>supposed</em> to rely on my code getting
preserved after I lose interest, I die, BitBucket deletes every bit of
Mercurial-hosted content it ever hosted, etc? Am I supposed to rely on
<em>Microsoft</em> to responsibly preserve my work? Holy crud no. We
<em>want</em> people to want their code widely mirrored and distributed.
That was the reason for the licenses. That was the social contract. But
if machine learning means the social contract is dead, why would people
want their code mirrored? –
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc/112209218607258564">mmc</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We’re using copyright to keep the software free. If AI regurgitating our
software from its impenetrable memories circumvents copyright it also
circumvents our licenses and therefore pulls the claws and teeth free
software has to fight for its freedom.
</p>
<p>
This is why opposing the current AI bubble is important. No matter how I
look at it, the big picture shows that this kind of AI is our enemy.
It’s just that copyright is the wrong weapon.
</p>
<p>
This is why we continue fighting all the negatives these corporations
bring to the table. And if it turns out that their business model
doesn’t work unless they bring all these negatives to the table, then I
guess that’s just that. We are under no obligation to support their
business model. In fact, it is our right and our duty to regulate the
world in order to improve it for all of us. We’ve been doing it for a
very long time.
</p>
<p>
Here’s to hoping for the next AI winter.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of
reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The
field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment
and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest
years or even decades later. –

the wrong weapon:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Creative workers who hope that they can use copyright law to prevent AI
from changing the creative labor market are likely to be very
disappointed in court … Individual creative workers rarely have any
bargaining leverage over the corporations that license our copyrights. …
Rather than going to Congress alongside our bosses from the studios and
labels and publishers to demand more copyright, we could go to Congress
alongside every kind of worker, from fast-food cashiers to publishing
assistants to truck drivers to demand the right to sectoral bargaining.

<h2 id="dave-goes-microsoft">Dave Goes Microsoft</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Last Monday was my first day as an official employee of Microsoft where
I’ll be working on web components as part of the
<a href="https://fluent2.microsoft.design/">Fluent</a> design system
team. As longtime readers already know, I’ve had a long term
relationship with Microsoft – from
<a href="https://paravelinc.com/work/microsoft/">Paravel’s 2012
responsive redesign of the Microsoft homepage</a> to the five year
<a href="https://daverupert.com/tag/davegoeswindows">#davegoeswindows</a>
stunt –  it feels like a new chapter in the career story arc to finally
acquire one of the famous blue badges. I’m still new and have barely
setup my computer but so far my team of peers, the larger group, the
project itself, and the other folks across Microsoft I’ve connected with
are all great.
</p>
<p>
Going from a company with two coworkers to a company with 200K coworkers
is certainly an adjustment. It’s my first job in 18 years where I’m not
working for myself but by far the biggest eye-opener throughout this
process was doing tech interviews! I learned a lot about myself; like
how after decades of coding in a room by myself, performing in front of
someone else isn’t natural for me. Weirdly for me, a live demo in front
of thousands of people… no problem. A random generated coding challenge
in front of one person… palms sweaty, mom’s spaghetti levels of
difficult. I also learned that too much caffeine and the panic-flavored
adrenaline of interviewing is a lot of chemistry for my active brain to
process.
</p>
<p>
I eventually figured out how to interview and I had a lot of great
conversations with great people at great companies. That said, this
experience left me with lingering qualms about the tech interview
process. A lot of it comes down to the information asymmetry where the
seller (the hiring company) has more information than the buyer (the job
candidate) and it’s hard to get any feedback for self-improvement. Even
in my limited experience, it’s not uncommon to sink 15+ hours into a
take home coding test and interview loop only to receive a terse
rejection. Granted there’s promise of a six figure salary at the end of
the rainbow, these jobs don’t fall out of the sky so you need to put in
work, but I think that situation needs to be a bit more equitable to
candidates – a Newtonian dynamic of matching effort.
</p>
<p>
One question they ask you at interviews is “What are you looking for in
your next role?” and while that sparks thousands of ideas, I boiled my
needs and wants down to two core concepts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Be a part of a larger team of engineers</strong> - I’d like to
work on a larger team of developers. I want to be in a situation where I
can actively and passively learn from other engineers who are subject
matter experts in different subjects. As a life-long learner, I’d like
to take myself out of the “lone developer” paradigm and absorb as much
as I can.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Be tangential to the money machine</strong> - When you run your
own business there’s a tight coupling between <em>how much you work</em>
and <em>how much money you make</em> and you’re constantly aware of that
fact. After 18 years of running my own business and two particularly
intense years of startup burnout, I’d like to try something different
and play a more supportive operational role for a bit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think I found that in Microsoft. There’s a multitude of people I can
ping about niche technology choices. There’s even access to a library of
research papers. And already I can see how operating in a product
support role seems to provide more opportunity for strategy to the
broader needs of the organization as opposed to reactivity to the needs
<em>du jour</em> that happen in Productland.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure throughput will be a bit slower without direct access to the
publish to production button. I’m sure there’s topics I won’t be able to
talk about on this here blog (but I tend not to blog about specific
work-related activities here anyways so that won’t change). And I’m sure
I’ll have to put a disclaimer here and there that these ideas are my own
and not reflective of my employer. Henceforth and furthermore all bad
ideas are copyright of Dave Rupert LLC®.
</p>
<p>
It’s the end of an era for sure but also the beginning of a new one and
potentially the beginning of lots of new ones, who knows. Thanks to
Trent and Reagan. Thanks to everyone who provided emotional support on
this journey. Thanks to esteemed friends who provided referrals. Given
the current macroeconomic situation, I feel lucky to have landed
somewhere familiar with great opportunities and many Dave Rupert-shaped
problems.

<p>The thing that

Newton predicts</a> for Google and news has already happened for the
huge base of reference info and know-how for software development. We no
longer go to the sources, don’t need to, the ChatGPT version is an order
of magnitude better. What we do need is people to keep asking and
answering questions for each other, so the knowledge can be added into
the AI database. We’re going somewhere here. It’s worth going there,
imho, having experienced the before, and only starting to glimpse the
now and near-future. But it’s as big a step as the move to PCs, then

details Linux on Snapdragon X Elite, and it’s looking surprisingly
good</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>With Qualcomm and Microsoft about to flood the market with devices
using the new Snapdragon X Elite, those of us who don’t want to use
Windows felt a bit uneasy – what’s Linux support going to look like for
this new generation of ARM devices? Well, it seems Qualcomm’s been busy,
and they’ve published a blog post detailing their work on Linux support
for the X Elite. It’s been our priority not only to support Linux on our
premium-tier SoCs, but to support it pronto. In fact, within one or two
days of publicly announcing each generation of Snapdragon 8, we’ve
posted the initial patchset for Linux kernel support. Snapdragon X Elite
was no exception: we announced on October 23 of last year and posted the
patchset the next day. That was the result of a lot of pre-announcement
work to get everything up and running on Linux and Debian. ↫ Qualcomm’s
developer blog In the blog post, the company details exactly which X
Elite features have already been merged into mainline with Linux 6.8 and
6.9, as well as which features will be merged into mainline in Linux
6.10 and 6.11, and to be quite frank – it’s looking really solid,
especially considering this is Qualcomm we’re talking about. Over the
coming six months, they’re going to focus on getting end-to-end hardware
video decoding working, including in Firefox and Chrome, as well as
various CPU and GPU optimisations, adding the required firmware to the
linux-firmware package, and providing access to easy installers. All in
all, it’s looking like the X Elite will be exceptionally well supported
by Linux before the year’s over. The blog post also details the boot
path for Linux on the X Elite, and that, too, is looking good. It’s
using a standard UEFI boot process, and supports GRUB and systemd-boot
out of the box. Linux boots up using devicetrees, though, and
apparently, there’s a known problem with using those that Qualcomm and
the community are working on. We’re working closely with upstream
communities on an open problem with the UEFI-based BIOS while booting
with devicetrees. The problem is that, when you have more than one
devicetree blob (DTB) packed into the firmware package flashed on the
device, there is no standard way of selecting a devicetree to pass on to
the kernel. OEMs commonly put multiple DTBs into the firmware package so
it will support devices with slightly different SKUs, so we’re keen to
solve this problem. ↫ Qualcomm’s developer blog I am pleasantly
surprised by the openness and straightforwardness Qualcomm is showing
the Linux community here, and I really hope this is a sign of how the
company will keep supporting its laptop and possibly desktop-oriented
SoCs from here on out. It seems like next year we will finally be
getting competitive ARM laptops that can run Linux in a fully supported
fashion.</p>

<p>I’ve experimentally replaced some of the Java implementations of
quicksort and binary search with calls to C++ code, and saw huge
benefits for the sorting code but the same or worse performance for
binary search. The Marginalia Search engine is mainly written in Java,
which is language that is good at many things, but not particularly
pleasant to work with when it comes to low level systems programming.
Unfortunately, a part of building an internet search engine involves
database-adjacent low level programming.</p>

matching 101: what is it and why do we need it?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-16, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
At Crossref and ROR, we develop and run processes that match metadata at
scale, creating relationships between millions of entities in the
scholarly record. Over the last few years, we’ve spent a lot of time
diving into details about metadata matching strategies, evaluation, and
integration. It is quite possibly

But sometimes it is good to step back and look at the problem from a
wider perspective. In this blog, the first one in a series about
metadata matching, we will cover the very basics of matching: what it
is, how we do it, and why we devote so much effort to this problem.
</p>
<h2 id="what-is-metadata-matching">
What is metadata matching?
</h2>
<p>
Would you be able to find the DOI for the work referenced in this
citation?
</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Everitt, W. N., &amp; Kalf, H. (2007). The Bessel differential equation and the Hankel transform. Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 208(1), 3–19.
</code></pre>
<p>
We bet you could! You might begin, for example, by pasting the whole
citation, or only the title, into a search engine of your choice. This
would probably return multiple results, which you would quickly skim.
Then you might click on the links for a few of the top results, those
that look promising. Some of the websites you visit might contain a DOI.
Perhaps you would briefly compare the metadata provided on the website
against what you see in the citation. If most of this information
matches (see what we did there?), you would conclude that the DOI from
that website is, in fact, the DOI for the cited paper.
</p>
<p>
Well done! You just performed metadata matching, specifically,
bibliographic reference matching. Matching in general can be defined as
the task or process of finding an identifier for an item based on its
structured or unstructured “description” (in this case: finding a DOI of
a cited article based on a citation string).
</p>
<p>
But matching doesn’t have to just be about citations and DOIs. There are
many other instances of matching we can think of, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
finding the ROR ID for an organisation based on an affiliation string,
</li>
<li>
finding the ORCID ID for a researcher based on the person’s name and
affiliation,
</li>
<li>
finding the ROR ID for a funder based on the acknowledgements section of
a research paper,
</li>
<li>
finding the grant DOI based on an award number and a funder name.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Matching doesn’t have to be done manually. It is possible to develop
fully automated strategies for metadata matching and employ them at
scale. It is also possible to use a hybrid approach, where automated
strategies assist users by providing suggestions.
</p>
<p>
Developing automated matching strategies is not a trivial task, and if
we want to do it right, it takes a great deal of time and effort. This
brings us to our next question: is it worth it?
</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-matching">
Why do we need matching?
</h2>
<p>
In short, metadata matching gives us a more complete picture of
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">the
research nexus</a> by discovering missing relationships between various
entities within and throughout the scholarly record:
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive">
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/matching-101-relationships.png"
alt="Example relationships in the scholarly record" width="75%"/>
</figure>
</div>
<br />
<p>
These relationships are very powerful. They provide important context
for any entity, whether it is a research output, a funder, a research
institution, or an author. Imagine for a moment the scholarly record
without any such relationships, where all bibliographic references,
affiliations (institution names and addresses), and funding information
(funder names and grant titles) are provided as unstructured strings
only. In such a world, how would you calculate the number of times a
particular research paper was cited? How would you get a list of
research outputs supported by a specific funder? It would be incredibly
challenging to navigate, summarise, and describe research activities,
especially considering the scale. Thankfully, these and many other
questions can be answered thanks to metadata matching that discovers
relationships between entities in the scholarly record.
</p>
<p>
There are two primary ways we can use metadata matching in our
workflows: as semi-automated tools that help users look up the
appropriate identifiers or as fully automated processes that enrich the
metadata in various scholarly databases.
</p>
<p>
The first approach is quite similar to the example we described at the
beginning. If you are submitting scholarly metadata, for example of a
new article to be published, you can use metadata matching to look up
identifiers for the various entities and include these identifiers in
the submission. For example, with the help of metadata matching, instead
of submitting citation strings, you could provide the DOIs for works
cited in the paper and instead of the name and address of your
organisation, you could provide its ROR ID. To make this easier for
people, metadata submission systems and applications sometimes integrate
metadata matching tools into user interfaces.
</p>
<p>
The second approach allows large, existing sources of scholarly metadata
to be enriched with identifiers in a fully automated way. For example,
we can match affiliation strings to ROR IDs using a combination of
machine learning models and ROR’s default matching service, effectively
adding more relationships between people and organisations. We can also
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/discovering-relationships-between-preprints-and-journal-articles/">compare
journal articles and preprints metadata</a> in the Crossref database by
calculating similarity scores for titles, authors, and years of
publication to match them with each other and provide more relationships
between preprints and journal articles. This automated enrichment can be
done at any point in time, even after research outputs have been
formally published.
</p>
<p>
There are fundamental differences between these two approaches. The
first is done under the supervision of a user, and for the second, the
matching strategy makes all the decisions autonomously. As a result, the
first approach will typically (although not always) result in better
quality matches. By contrast, the second approach is much faster,
generally less expensive, and scales to even very large data sources.
</p>
<p>
In the end, no matter what approach is used, the goal is to achieve a
more complete accounting of the relationships between entities in the
scholarly record.
</p>
<p>
This blog is the first one in a series about metadata matching. In the
coming weeks, we will cover more detail about the product features
related to metadata matching, explain why metadata matching is not a
trivial problem, and share how we can develop, assess, compare, and
choose matching strategies. Stay tuned!

<h2 id="android-15-beta-2-released">Android 15 beta 2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google released Android 15 beta 2 today, and with it, they unveiled
some more of the new features coming to Android later this year when the
final release lands. Android 15 comes with something called a private
space, an area with an extra layer of authentication where you can keep
applications and data hidden away, such as banking applications or
health data. It’s effectively a separate user profile, and shows up as a
separate area in the application drawer when unlocked. When locked, it
disappears entirely from sight, share sheets, and so on. Another awesome
new feature is Theft Detection Lock, which uses Google “AI” to detect
when a phone is snatched out of your hands by someone running, biking,
or driving away, and instantly locks it. Theft like this is quite common
in certain areas, and this seems like an excellent use of “AI” (i.e.,
accelerometer data) to discourage thieves from trying this. There’s also
a bunch of smaller stuff, like custom vibration patterns per
notification, giving applications partial access to only your most
recent photos and videos, system-wide preferences for which gender you’d
like to be addressed as in gendered languages (French gets this feature
first), and a whole lot more. Developers also get a lot to play with
here, from safer intents to something like ANGLE: Vulkan is Android’s
preferred interface to the GPU. Therefore, Android 15 includes ANGLE as
an optional layer for running OpenGL ES on top of Vulkan. Moving to
ANGLE will standardize the Android OpenGL implementation for improved
compatibility, and, in some cases, improved performance. You can test
out your OpenGL ES app stability and performance with ANGLE by enabling
the developer option in Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer Options
-&gt; Experimental: Enable ANGLE on Android 15. ↫ Android developer blog
You can install Android 15 beta 2 on a number f Pixel devices and
devices from other OEMs starting today. I installed it on my Pixel 8
Pro, and after a few hours I haven’t really noticed anything breaking,
but that’s really not enough time to make any meaningful observations.
Google also detailed Wear OS 5. Later this year, battery life
optimizations are coming to watches with Wear OS 5. For example, running
an outdoor marathon will consume up to 20% less power when compared to
watches with Wear OS 4. And your fitness apps will be able to help
improve your performance with the option to support more data types like
ground contact time, stride length and vertical oscillation. ↫ Android
developer blog Wear OS 5 will also improve the Watch Face Format with
more complications, which is very welcome, because the selection of
complications is currently rather meager. Wear OS 5 will also ship later
this year.</p>

<h2 id="raspberry-pi-officially-announces-intent-to-ipo">Raspberry Pi
officially announces intent to IPO</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>As expected earlier this year, Raspberry Pi is going public on the
stock exchange in London. Back then, CEO Eben Upton said he did not
expect the IPO to change how Raspberry Pi did things, but history tells
us that initial public offerings tend to, well, change how companies do
things. In their official announcement that they intend to hold an IPO,
there’s an incredibly interesting and telling contradiction, as noted by
<span class="citation" data-cites="yassie_j">@yassie_j</span> on
MastoAkkoma: Raspberry Pi, in their listing press release, says: The
Enthusiast and Education market is the “heart” of the Raspberry Pi
movement. But also says: Industrial and Embedded market accounts over 72
per cent So the heart seems to be going neglected, it seems, because
there’s no way you’re going to not cash in on industrial applications.
Especially when you’ve just done a big IPO. ↫ <span class="citation"
data-cites="yassie_j">@yassie_j</span> on Akkoma This exactly
illustrates the fears we all have about what an IPO is going to mean for
Raspberry Pi. It’s already become increasingly more difficult for
enthusiasts to get their hands on the latest Raspberry Pi models, but
once the IPO’s done and there’s shareholders breathing down their neck,
that will most likely only get worse. If the industrial and embedded
market is where you’re making most of your money, where do you think
Raspberry Pi devices are going to end up? Luckily the market’s a lot
bigger and more varied now than it was back when Raspberry Pi was new,
so we have a wide variety of options to choose from. Still, I’m
definitely worried about what Raspberry Pi, as a company, will look like
five, ten years from now.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Google I/O 2024 is underway and a bunch of articles came out about what Google&#39;s changes to its core product (search) mean for the web as a whole. Sean Hollister at The Verge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24074314/google-now-offers-web-search&quot;&gt;has a piece on the new “web” search option&lt;/a&gt; (a piece that starts with &lt;em&gt;“This is not a joke”&lt;/em&gt;) while Casey Newton wrote a  nice articled titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/&quot;&gt;“Google’s broken link to the web”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Unsurprisingly Google has revealed that AI is going to be integrated
pretty much everywhere, and the goal is to let the AI do the googling
for you. Which sounds great, in theory. After all, as the fine people at
The Browser Company have eloquently explained to the world, the web is
in such a terrible state that the only way out of this madness is to let
an AI deal with all the garbage and spammy content that’s out there. I
already
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">expressed my
doubts about this plan</a> and I don’t think what Google is doing is any
better.
</p>
<p>
Google, as a company, is in an odd position. They are, fundamentally, an
advertising company. Almost 70% of their revenues are generated by ads.
Ads on the SERP, ads on their various products and ads served by their
ad network on 3rd party websites. When they say that they’re going to do
the googling for you they don’t just mean the search part. In theory, AI
will also go find the information you’re looking for on 3rd party sites
so they’ll do the googling but also the actual browsing. Did you spot
the issue? How are people going to consume ads on 3rd party sites if you
no longer need to visit 3rd party sites? And if AI is going to take over
the entire top part of the SERP with its generated answer, why should
companies pay Google to appear at the top of the search results if those
search results are not going to be seen by the majority of people?
</p>
<p>
It’s a bizarre situation. The answer to missing ad revenues is obviously
going to be more ads. I’m sure Google will figure out a way to inject
ads into their AI-generated bullshit.
</p>
<p>
Some people are obviously freaking out about the recent news. That’s
because a huge number of sites out there rely on Google to bring traffic
to their websites, sites that are then monetised via ads in most cases.
If traffic goes down, ad revenues go down. And that’s a bad thing,
right? Right? Well, maybe? I guess it depends. The current state of the
web is unsustainable. And maybe AI and AI-generated garbage is what we
need to push the current situation over the edge and force some changes.
</p>
<p>
I think curation, actual human curation, is going to play an important
role in the future. In a web filled with generated nonsense, content
curated by knowledgeable human beings is going to be incredibly
valuable.
</p>
<p>
I find this current phase of the web incredibly interesting. I have no
idea how things will evolve but I’m glad I can be part of it, even just
as an external observer.

Copilot-generated code</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>The NetBSD project seems to agree with me that code generated by “AI”
like Copilot is tainted, and cannot be used safely. The project’s added
a new guideline banning the use of code generated by such tools from
being added to NetBSD unless explicitly permitted by “core“, NetBSD’s
equivalent, roughly, of “technical management”. Code generated by a
large language model or similar technology, such as such as
GitHub/Microsoft’s Copilot, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, or Facebook/Meta’s Code
Llama, is presumed to be tainted code, and must not be committed without
prior written approval by core. ↫ NetBSD Commit Guidelines GitHub
Copilot is copyright infringement and open source license violation at
an industrial scale, and as I keep reiterating – the fact Microsoft is
not training Copilot on its own closed-source code tells you all you
need to know about what Microsoft thinks about the legality of
Copilot.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-os-is-switching-from-ostree-to-systemd-sysupdate">GNOME OS
is switching from OSTree to systemd-sysupdate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure most of you are familiar with KDE Neon, the
distribution KDE maintains to provide easy access to the latest KDE
technologies. However, did you know GNOME has something similar, called
GNOME OS? It’s been around for a while, but has a far lower profile than
KDE Neon does, and it seems they want to change that and put more of a
spotlight on GNOME OS. GNOME OS is an immutable distribution using
OSTree, the same technology used by the various popular immutable
versions from the Fedora family. It seems GNOME OS is working to leave
OSTree behind, and move to systemd-sysupdate instead, which has been
available since systemd 251, released in May 2022. The developers claim
this will bring the following benefits: To complete the move from OSTree
to systemd-sysupdate, a few things need to be completed. First, the boot
process and root filesystem had to be migrated, which was done last
year. Second, sysupdate needs to integrated into GNOME, as for now, you
can only use it via the command line. This work is ongoing, and requires
a new D-Bus service and polkit integration to allow GNOME Software to
manage the update process. Of course, there’s more work that needs to be
done to complete this migration, but these are the main tasks. All of
this work is part of the project’s goal to make GNOME OS nightlies
viable for daily-driving for quality assurance purposes, and I’m sure
all this work will also make GNOME OS more attractive to people outside
of the developer community. It’s basically GNOME/systemd taken to the
extreme, and while that will surely make quite a few people groan, I
personally find it great that this will make GNOME OS a more capable
choice for everyone. That’s what open source is all about, in the
end.</p>

is not over-hyped</a>, imho. I’m discovering new significance for it
every day. An example. I had to go back to some very complex code I
wrote a week ago. I wanted to give it new flexibility, that would be
simple from the user’s point of view, and in order for it to work
technically it has to maintain that simplicity internally. It’s a tall
order to go back to something complex a week after writing it, and rip
it apart and put it back together and have it retain the simplicity it
had before. But I had an advantage this time that I had never had
before, a programming partner with a perfect memory. I had written the
original code with ChatGPT. So I went back and asked it to review my
plan, and then worked with it step by step as I had before. It had
perfect recall, right, of course where my recall is pretty sketchy. It
took two sessions to get it done, but it works now, and I’m confident
I’ve covered all the bases. How do you put that story in a press
release? If you want to understand a new technology, don’t talk to the
CEO of the tech company that made the product, their lives are
whirlwinds, they don’t have time or the capacity to understand how big
the idea is, they just know that it is big. If you want to understand
you have to use it and you have to talk with other users.</p>

people who follow me via RSS or email, or on Bluesky or Mastodon, thus
giving them a chance to sell others on paying $0.50 to read the freaking

<p>
For years, SBCs that aren’t Raspberry Pis experimented with eMMC and M.2
storage interfaces. While the Raspberry Pi went from full-size SD card
in the first generation to microSD in every generation following
(Compute Modules excluded), other vendors like Radxa, Orange Pi, Banana
Pi, etc. have been all over the place.
</p>
<p>
Still, <em>most</em> of the time a fallback microSD card slot remains.
</p>
<p>
But microSD cards—even the fastest UHS-II/A2/V90/etc. ones that
advertise hundreds of MB/sec—are laggards when it comes to any kind of
SBC workflow.
</p>
<p>
The two main reasons they’re used are cost and size. They’re tiny, and
they don’t cost much, especially if you don’t shell out for
industrial-rated microSD cards.

<h2 id="the-new-apt-3.0-solver">The new APT 3.0 solver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>A crucial but often entirely transparent feature of a modern package
management system like Debian’s APT is its solver – basically the set of
rules and instruction on how to handle dependencies when installing a
package. APT is currently in the process of radically changing its
solver, the first bits of which can be found in APT 2.9.3, referred to
as solver3. Many of the changes and improvements get a little into the
weeds and will mostly be transparent to users, but there is one feature
the new solver will enable that many of you will be incredibly excited
about. One of the core new capabilities of solver3 is the implication
graph. As part of the solving phase, we also construct an implication
graph, albeit a partial one: The first package installing another
package is marked as the reason (A -&gt; B), the same thing for
conflicts (not A -&gt; not B). ↫ Julian Andres Klode Seems rather
innocuous at first sight, but here’s what the implication graph will
make possible: The implication graph building allows us to implement an
apt why command, that while not as nicely detailed as aptitude, at least
tells you the exact reason why a package is installed. It will only show
the strongest dependency chain at first of course, since that is what we
record. ↫ Julian Andres Klode If you’ve ever dealt with packaging issues
– probably when running -testing or similar unstable distributions that
use APT, a command that tells you exactly why a package is installed is
an absolute godsend. Sure, aptitude exists, but aptitude takes you out
of your current CLI workflow, whereas this will be much easier to
quickly run. There’s more features solver3 will enable, but this one is
definitely one of my favourite low-level additions to APT in a long,
long time.</p>

details some of the “AI” features coming to Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google I/O, the company’s developer conference, started today, but
for the first time since I can remember, Android and Chrome OS have been
relegated to day two of the conference. The first day was all about
“AI”, most of which I’m not even remotely interested in, except of
course where it related to Google’s operating system offerings. And the
company did have a few things to say about “AI” on Android, and the
general gist is that yeah, they’re going to be stuffing it into every
corner of the operating system. Google’s “AI” tool Gemini will be
integrated deeply into Android, and you’ll be able to call up an overlay
wherever you are in the operating system, and do things like summarise a
PDF that’s on screen, summarise a YouTube video, generate images on the
fly and drop them into emails and conversations, and so on. A more
interesting and helpful “AI” addition is using it to improve TalkBack,
so that people with impaired vision can let the device describe images
on the screen for them. Google claims TalkBack users come across about
90 images without description every day (!), so this is a massive
improvement for people with impaired vision, and a genuinely helpful and
worthwhile “AI” feature. Creepier is that Google’s “AI” will also be
able to listen along with your phone calls, and warn you if an ongoing
conversation is a scamming attempt. If the person on the other end of
the line claiming to be your bank asks you to move a bunch of money
around to keep it safe, Gemini will pop up and warn you it’s a scam,
since banks don’t ask you such things. Clever, sure, but also absolutely
terrifying and definitely not something I’ll be turning on. Google
claims all of these features take place on-device, so privacy should be
respected, but I’m always a bit unsure about such things staying that
way in the future. Regardless, “AI” is coming to Android in a big way,
but I’m just here wondering how much of it I’ll be able to turn off.</p>

Workstation Pro and Fusion pro go free for personal use</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>After Broadcom acquired VMware, there’s been a steady stream of
worrying or outright bad news for people using VMware products at home,
for personal use, as enthusiasts. The biggest blow to the enthusiast
market was the end of perpetual licensing, forcing people into
subscriptions instead. Finally, though it seems we’re getting some good
news. The most exciting part is that Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro will
now have two license models. We now provide a Free Personal Use or a
Paid Commercial Use subscription for our Pro apps. Users will decide
based on their use case whether a commercial subscription is required.
This means that everyday users who want a virtual lab on their Mac,
Windows or Linux computer can do so for free simply by registering and
downloading the bits from the new download portal located at
support.broadcom.com. ↫ Michael Roy on the VMware blog This is
definitely good news for us enthusiasts, and it means I won’t have to
buy a cheap VMware license off eBay every few years anymore, so I’m
quite satisfied here. However, with VMware under Broadcom focusing more
and more on the enterprise and squeezing every last penny out of those
customers, one has to wonder if this ‘free for personal use’ is just a
prelude to winding down the development of enthusiasts’ tools
altogether. It wouldn’t be the first time that a product going free for
personal use was a harbinger of worse things yet to come.</p>

‘Glowing’ Plants Could Help Scientists Predict Flash Drought</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>An unusual boost in plant productivity can foreshadow severe soil
water loss. NASA satellites are following the clues. Flaring up rapidly
and with little warning, the drought that gripped much of the United
States in the summer of 2012 was one of the most extensive the country
had seen since the yearslong Dust Bowl of […]</p>

<h2 id="its-fun-to-do-silly-things">It’s fun to do silly things</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I spend my time doing things online. I design and code websites for clients, I make websites for friends, and I start—and almost always shut down—all sorts of weird side projects. It’s easy to take this online life too seriously. If you go online you’ll immediately find people discussing business strategies and ways to monetise everything they do. Which is fine but also exhausting. The web is so caught up in the hustler mentality that it’s forgetting that some things can just be hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I interviewed 37 people for my P&amp;B series at this point and if I’m
not mistaken, all 37 of them are just happy to have a blog they pay for
and have no plans to monetise it whatsoever. It’s a hobby, they enjoy
doing it and that’s absolutely fine.
</p>
<p>
In a few days, I’ll renew the domain for [theforest.link]. That site has
so far generated 0<span
class="math inline">.<em>I</em><em>s</em><em>p</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>n</em><em>d</em>50</span>
just for the domain at this point. But should I care? Should I monetise
this? Hell no. Carl and I built it because it’s fun, because the idea of
helping people discover some new random wacky website is fun.
</p>
<p>
The other day I was doing some design admin on my
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a> because I wanted to
update a few of the graphics in there. And while I was doing that I had
this completely stupid idea of creating a new membership tier called
<em>The “I have F** you money” Club</em>. Do I expect anyone to actually
subscribe? Obviously not, I did it because it’s silly, because I hope
someone will laugh at the stupidity of it all. I did it because it’s fun
to do silly things.
</p>
<p>
Did you make anything silly recently? If you did show it to me! Send me
an email, I want to see it.

id="google-is-experimenting-with-running-chrome-os-on-android">Google is
experimenting with running Chrome OS on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Now that Android – since version 13 – ships with the Android
Virtualisation Framework, Google can start doing interesting things with
it. It turns out the first interesting thing Google wants do with it is
run Chrome OS inside of it. Even though AVF was initially designed
around running small workloads in a highly stripped-down build of
Android loaded in an isolated virtual machine, there’s technically no
reason it can’t be used to run other operating systems. As a matter of
fact, this was demonstrated already when developer Danny Lin got Windows
11 running on an Android phone back in 2022. Google itself never
officially provided support for running anything other than its custom
build of Android called “microdroid” in AVF, but that’s no longer the
case. The company has started to offer official support for running
Chromium OS, the open-source version of Chrome OS, on Android phones
through AVF, and it has even been privately demoing this to other
companies. At a privately held event, Google recently demonstrated a
special build of Chromium OS — code-named “ferrochrome” — running in a
virtual machine on a Pixel 8. However, Chromium OS wasn’t shown running
on the phone’s screen itself. Rather, it was projected to an external
display, which is possible because Google recently enabled display
output on its Pixel 8 series. Time will tell if Google is thinking of
positioning Chrome OS as a platform for its desktop mode ambitions and
Samsung DeX rival. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It seems that
Google is in the phase of exploring if there are any OEMs interested in
allowing users to plug their Android phone into an external display and
input devices and run Chrome OS on it. This sounds like an interesting
approach to the longstanding dream of convergence – one device for all
your computing needs – but at the same time, it feels quite convoluted
to have your Android device emulate an entire Chrome OS installation.
What a damning condemnation of Android as a platform that despite years
of trying, Google just can’t seem to make Android and its applications
work in a desktop form factor. I’ve tried to shoehorn Android into a
desktop workflow, and it’s quite hard, despite third parties having made
some interesting tools to help you along. It really seems Android just
does not want to be anywhere else but on a mobile touch display.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>As Nintendo Switch unlocks and homebrew software develops, people are
inclined to explore the possibilities and whether or not they actually
provide a good experience. Our new prime example seems to be a full
install of Windows 11 Arm on the Switch. As noted by <span
class="citation" data-cites="PatRyk">@PatRyk</span> on Twitter, who
actually set this up, the experience is pretty grueling! The initial
installation took three hours, and even basic system tasks were
unresponsive. ↫ Christopher Harper at Tom’s Hardware Silly, sure, but
efforts like these all contribute to emulation efforts, which will
eventually be important once Nintendo drops support for this machine and
they become increasingly harder to get. Give it a decade or so and we’ll
need the Switch emulators to keep playing Switch games.</p>

Here’s my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly
did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a
double team, to free up one of the Knicks’ assassins. Or maybe he’ll be
more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or

nicely, having seen him interviewed on MSNBC a few days ago. He had good
PR training somewhere, it’s probably not just from the genes, he is a
freaking Kennedy, his mother was a wife of a Kennedy, and clearly raised
him well. I’m voting for Biden of course. I’m not that crazy. But people
are tired of Biden, I understand why – and they want a president they
can look up to, not one that reminds them of their 80-something
grandfather. And people are also understandably fed up with Trump.
Before it’s over we will come to think of him not as a spoiler but as a

<h2 id="ea-is-prototyping-in-game-ads-even-as-we-speak">EA is
prototyping in-game ads even as we speak</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has a long, storied history of trying to wring more
money out of gamers after they’ve purchased a game — now, it appears,
the company’s hard at work on its next generation of in-game ads. EA CEO
Andrew Wilson admitted as much on the company’s Q4 earnings call: when
an analyst asked about “the market opportunity for more dynamic ad
insertion across more traditional AAA games,” he said the company’s
already working on it. “We have teams internally in the company right
now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of
our game experiences,” said Wilson. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge Ads in
games are definitely not new – we’ve seen countless games built entirely
around brands, like Tapper for Budweiser, Pepsiman, or Cool Spot for
7-Up – and banner ads and product placement in various games has been a
thing for decades, too. It seems like EA wants to take this several
steps further and use things like dynamic ad insertion in games, so that
when you’re playing some racing game, you’ll get an ad for your local
Hyundai dealer, or an ad for a gun store when you’re playing GTA in the
US. Either way, it’s going to make games worse, which is perfectly in
line with EA’s mission.</p>

public data file now available, featuring new experimental formats</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
This year’s public data file is now available, featuring over 156
million metadata records deposited with Crossref through the end of
April 2024 from over 19,000 members. A full breakdown of Crossref
metadata statistics is available
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/06members/53status.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Like last year, you can download all of these records in one go via
Academic Torrents or directly from Amazon S3 via the “requester pays”
method.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Download the file:</strong> The torrent download can be
initiated

In January, Martin Eve
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">announced</a>
that we had been experimenting with alternative file formats meant to
make our public data files easier to use by broader audiences. This
year’s file will be published alongside the tools that can be used on
the public data file to produce two experimental formats:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/packer" target="_blank">JSON-lines</a>
and
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/dois2sqlite" target="_blank">SQLite</a>
(and a bonus
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/rustsqlitepacker" target="_blank">Rust
version</a>). You can read more about our thinking behind this work in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">Martin’s
blog post</a>, and we are keen to hear your thoughts on these
alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Our annual public data file is meant to facilitate individuals and
organizations interested in working with the entirety of our metadata
corpus. Starting with the majority of our metadata records in one file
should be much easier than starting from scratch with our API, but
because Crossref metadata is always openly available, you can use
<a href="https://api.crossref.org/" target="_blank">the API</a> to keep
your local copy up to date with new and updated records.
</p>
<p>
If you’re curious about what you’ll get with the public data file, we’ve
also published a sample version so that you can take a peek before
committing to downloading the ~212 gb file. This file includes a random
sample of JSON files and is available exclusively via torrent

<h2 id="ibm-introduces-entry-level-power10-server-and-tower">IBM
introduces entry-level Power10 server and tower</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Each S1012 node has a single Power10 processor, which can have 1, 4,
or 8 cores activated, which suggests that it is the same single chip
module (SCM) implementation of the Power10 processor that was used in
the Power S1022s entry machine. The Power S1012 node has four ISDIMM
memory slots (using the differential signaling created by Big Blue for
its Power10 memory) with a maximum capacity of 256 GB. The node has four
half-height, half-length PCI-Express 5.0 slots and room for four
NVM-Express U.2 drive bays that come in a maximum 1.6 TB capacity each
for a total of 6.4 TB of storage. The eight-core version of the Power10
SCM is only available in the rack configuration, while the one-core and
four-core versions are available in rack or tower configurations. The
four-core and eight-core versions can run IBM i, AIX, or Linux, but the
one-core version can only run IBM i and it has its main memory capped at
the same 64 GB that other single-core Power Systems machines have been
subjected to. We have suggested that 128 GB or even 256 GB is more
appropriate given modern workloads, but Big Blue is standing its ground
here. If you need more memory than 64 GB, then this machine is not for
you. ↫ Timothy Prickett Morgan at IT Jungle I understand full well that
these machines are by no means meant for people like you and I, sitting
at home playing with our toys. That being said, I still wish there was
some way for IBM to offer unique hardware like this – perhaps in a more
standard, paired-down configuration – so more people than just
enterprises could explore and use them. It wouldn’t make any economic
sense for IBM to do so, and even in a more standard, paired-down
configuration they’d probably still be ungodly expensive, but when I
look at this unique tower, with its POWER10 hardware and the ability to
run AIX, desires are stirred within me that are banned in at least 46
countries. Such a machine would surely be wasted on someone like me, who
would just be shoehorning whatever desktop tasks he could into it, but
what a grand ol’ time we would have. There is absolutely, positively,
unequivocally zero percent chance IBM would ever send one of these over
for review to someone like me, but I wonder if I should try anyway. I’ve
got nothing to lose. Does anyone here work at IBM? Perhaps IBM wants to
sponsor OSNews? How about like 12 weeks of free sponsorships in exchange
for a tower model of the Power S1012? I also have two POWER9 machines to
compare it to! It’s the only way you’ll ever get a Power S1012
screenfetch screenshot go viral on nerd social media, and we all know
that deep down, that’s all you IBM folks really want.</p>

id="macrelix-a-unix-like-environment-that-runs-in-classic-mac-os">MacRelix:
a Unix-like environment that runs in classic Mac OS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>MacRelix is a Unix-like environment that runs in classic Mac OS.
MacRelix natively supports classic 68K and PPC Mac OS, as well as Mac OS
X on PPC via Carbon. ↫ MacRelix website The creator of MacRelix, Josh
Juran, published an article in 2019 detailing the origins of the
project. As a Mac OS developer, he was so unhappy with both CodeWarrior
and Apple’s Macintosh Programmer’s Workshop (MPW), that he set out to
create what would become MacRelix in 1999. Reading through the
limitations and roadblocks he experienced with CodeWarrior and MPW, it’s
not hard to see why he got frustrated – CodeWarrior’s targets were
apparently a mess and a half to deal with. Then came target
multiplication. Whereas the initial CodeWarrior developer releases
shipped with each combination of language (C and Pascal) and
architecture (68K and PPC) supported in a separate application, a later
version of the IDE unified these, allowing the developer to have a
single project file per project. To allow the same project to be built
for both 68K and PPC architectures, the project data model included
targets: One target would compile for 68K and link against 68K
libraries, another would do the same for PPC. Targets could also be used
to select an optimized build versus one for debugging. Combining both
dichotomies yields four targets: 68K debug, 68K optimized, PPC debug,
and PPC optimized. Then if your project involves multiple executables,
like a code resource or shared library in addition to an application,
you now have eight targets. Or, if you support one of, say, 68020
optimization, profiling, or a third executable, make that twelve. Or,
for all of them, twenty-seven. ↫ Josh Juran Changing an option in your
application required you to change it in every single target, too, which
I can easily see is incredibly frustrating. MPW, for its part, was a
massive improvement, he argues, but while it was clearly inspired by
UNIX, it didn’t seem to actually implement any of the features and
characteristics of UNIX. However, very much unlike Unix, the MPW Shell
had only a single thread of execution — only one program could be
running at once. Not only that, but there was no way for MPW’s compiled
plugins (called tools) to invoke other tools or scripts — not even via
system() (which blocks the calling program until the called program
exits). Therefore, Make couldn’t actually do anything, but only printed
out the commands for the user to run manually. You could code in Perl
instead of the built-in language, but then your scripts couldn’t run
other programs — only MPW shell scripts could do that. ↫ Josh Juran The
limitations Juran was experiencing with these two tools pushed him to
create his own solution, which went well beyond what MPW offered, even
in 2019 when this article was published. Nowadays, MacRelix has pipes,
signals, system calls, TCP sockets, and more. It works on both 68K and
PowerPC Mac systems and builds as Carbon to run natively in OS X. It can
be used on any Mac OS version from System 7 to Mac OS X 10.6 “Snow
Leopard” (after which Apple removed the Rosetta PowerPC emulator). I
haven’t implemented fork() yet, but I know how to do it. In addition to
a Unix-like file system interface (which even handles long names by
storing them in Desktop database comment fields)), MacRelix has a /proc
filesystem (with human readable stack crawls) and also maps various
parts of Mac OS (e.g. the ROM image in /sys/mac/rom). ↫ Josh Juran I had
never heard of MacRelix, but it seems like an amazing tool Juran put a
lot of thought, effort, and love into. Sadly, with the number of PowerPC
Mac OS X users being vanishingly small, and the number of classic Mac OS
users even smaller so, the future of MacRelix seems uncertain. I wonder
what parts of it can be salvaged and upgraded to work on ARM macOS or
even Intel macOS, because I think the ideas and concepts are incredibly
cool. A related project by Juran is something called FORGE, a portable
windowing API that used a virtual file system, meaning that instead of
using functions as objects, it uses files. Juran mentions the example of
a window title – which is a file, and if you want to change the title of
that window you just change the file, which will be instantly reflected
in the GUI. Here’s a Hello World example: Even though I’m not a
programmer, this little tidbit of code makes perfect sense to me, and I
understood it instantly. Of course, anything more complex will quickly
leave my wheelhouse, but intuitively, I really like this. FORGE exists
as a prototype inside MacRelix, so you can play with this concept while
using MacRelix.</p>

been a great season, but we’re tired. We’re headed to the beach, we’ll
see you in October Knicks fans. Thanks for your support.” I would nod my

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/i-made-switch-aperture-photos&quot;&gt;migrate my photo library from Apple&#39;s now-defunct Aperture to Photos&lt;/a&gt;, so I could take advantage of Apple&#39;s iCloud Photo Library (don&#39;t worry, I still have three full complete local backups, plus a separate cloud backup besides Apple&#39;s iCloud originals).&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
One pain point is RAW support. As camera manufacturers add new models,
their proprietary RAW codecs are updated, and software vendors like
Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft have to update photo editing tools to work
with the new camera models.
</p>
<p>
I don’t envy them this task, but as Photos was Apple’s official
successor to Aperture (a pale shadow to be sure, but it has its merits
as a semi-decent library organizer), they’ve <em>generally</em> done
well supporting new camera models. The compatibility list for
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105094">macOS Sonoma, iPadOS
17, and iOS 17</a> is a testament to that effort.

<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>This article is a partial-rebuttal/partial-confirmation to KGOnTech’s
Apple Vision Pro’s Optics Blurrier &amp; Lower Contrast than Meta Quest
3, prompted by RoadToVR’s Quest 3 Has Higher Effective Resolution, So
Why Does Everyone Think Vision Pro Looks Best? which cites KGOnTech. I
suppose it’s a bit late, but it’s taken me a while to really get a good
intuition for how visionOS renders frames, because there is a metric
shitton of nuance and it’s unfortunately very, very easy to make
mistakes when trying to quantify things. This post is divided into two
parts: Variable Rasterization Rate (VRR) and how visionOS renders frames
(including hard numbers for internal render resolutions and such), and a
testbench demonstrating why photographing the visual clarity of Vision
Pro (and probably future eye tracked headsets) may be more difficult
than a DSLR pointed into the lenses (and how to detect the pitfalls if
you try!). ↫ Shiny Quagsire I did it. I think I managed to find an
article that isn’t just over my head, but also over most of your heads.

<h2 id="the-emacs-window-management-almanac">The Emacs window management
almanac</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Window management in Emacs gets a bad rap. Some of this is deserved,
but mostly this is a consequence of combining a very flexible and
granular layout system with rather coarse controls. This leaves the door
open to creating and using tools for handling windows that employ and
provide better metaphors and affordances. As someone who’s spent an
unnecessary amount of time trying different approaches to window
management in Emacs over the decades, I decided to summarize them here.
Almanac might be overstating it a bit – this is a primer to and a
collection of window management resources and tips. ↫ Karthik
Chikmagalur I honestly had no idea Emacs was this… Advanced, complex,
and feature-laden. I mean, I thought Emacs’ complexity was just a meme,
but reading this article it seems the memes don’t do it justice.</p>

The probably appropriate response to an Apple ad is “meh, whatever” and that was—and still is—my reaction. The ad is uninspiring but there’s one creative aspect of it that bothers me: I don’t understand the connection between the hydraulic press and the visual images of destroying everything to the alleged capabilities of the iPad. Like, I get what they’re trying to communicate but the visual metaphor they decided to use makes no sense to me. That’s the part I just don’t get.

I just put one idea on my blog for a day and leave it at that because I
think the idea is important enough on its own, and that any explanation
would dilute it. Yesterday’s one sentence
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751">comment</a> was
based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their
executive editor in a recent
<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space">interview</a>,
who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not
reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion
leaders, to determine what they cover, that’s marketing, not journalism.
Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over
another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is
not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my
readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept
this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their
responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the
tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What do about the
climate?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-do-about-the-climate">
2024-05-12 What do about the climate?
</h1>
<p>
The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way
out of this uncertainty? What should or
<a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?
</p>
<p>
Before we even start, let me just say that I’m never interested in
debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It’s real, it’s
here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.
</p>
<p>
The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green,
on all levels of government. And by “green” I mean the most radical
green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends
on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a
one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have
no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something
about local politics, and so on.
</p>
<p>
On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we’re not
sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn’t help much against the
climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many
plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean?
How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The
oil spills? And here’s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop!
I need to stop because there’s no “thinking it through” when things are
so complex unless you’re a scientist working on it. I hope the
scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the
research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and
individuals know what to tackle first.
</p>
<p>
This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly
wrong. They don’t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used
to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid
of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting
involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric
vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency
vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also:
get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing
something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then
medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build
railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special
permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society
with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are
precious.
</p>
<p>
The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I
fear.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.
</p>

The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate
Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there’s an answer if anybody is
claiming that we don’t know what to do. But also: there’s your answer if
you’re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top
need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what
little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a
very small number of people that have actually read this report, let
alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.
</p>
<p>
This is why a public “chain of trust” needs to lead from interviews with
public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social
media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with
people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance,
hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders
trust in people.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of
choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or
for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we
need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a>
right.
</p>
<p>
(We don’t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we
cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to
go.)

DeskTop currently testing 1.4 alpha releases</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Disassembly and enhancements for Apple II DeskTop (a.k.a. Mouse
Desk), a “Finder”-like GUI application for 8-bit Apples and clones with
128k of memory, utilizing double hi-res monochrome graphics (560×192),
an optional mouse, and the ProDOS 8 operating system. ↫ Apple II DeskTop
GitHub page The goal of this project is to reverse-engineer Apple II
DeskTop, and fix bugs and enhance it in the process. I didn’t actually
know that the Apple IIgs initially shipped with this instead of the 16
bit GS/OS, which is the operating system I personally associate with the
IIgs. Apple II DeskTop was largely 8 bit, and built on top of ProDOS 16,
and didn’t really take full advantage of the IIgs hardware. It wasn’t
until version 4.0 of the system software that the IIgs switched over to
GS/OS. The latest release is v1.4-alpha9, released a few days ago. Apple
II DeskTop is still entirely compatible with Apple II machines and
clones from before the IIgs, as well, and it runs in emulators, too. We
actually already covered this project a few years ago, but a reminder
that this exists never hurt anyone.</p>

using Arduino</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-12, from: Lloyd Rochester Blog</p>
<p>Hello World on SSD1306 using Arduino After looking through numerous
libraries and examples to control the SSD1306 with Arduino, I’ve found
nothing simple. There are some really powerful libraries with lots of
support. In this post I’ll post the simplest possible “Hello World”
example on an SSD1306 using an Arduino Due. Note, if you need to draw
shapes, lines, movement you’ll have to extend this example. Code Used in
Arduino IDE.</p>
