And before that a few oddly empowered crazy-ass people at Netscape had an idea that bloggers had the answer, not Google. I don't really know who they were, they communicated through their actions, not via email or the phone. Same kind of thing happened with XML-RPC, except there I knew the people at Microsoft who momentarily bent the corporate rules to make something happen quickly and simply in the market.

The real story of RSS is that in a moment when the NYT had a spirit of adventure, they backed RSS and as a result news adopted a technology that was pioneered by bloggers, not the tech industry. If that partnership had flourished and developed we might now have a good alternative to the tech billionaires.

## Exploiting Mistyped URLs

date: 2024-06-10, updated: 2024-06-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589334.3645510">Hyperlink Hijacking: Exploiting Erroneous URL Links to Phantom Domains</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Web users often follow hyperlinks hastily, expecting them to be correctly programmed. However, it is possible those links contain typos or other mistakes. By discovering active but erroneous hyperlinks, a malicious actor can spoof a website or service, impersonating the expected content and phishing private information. In &#8220;typosquatting,&#8221; misspellings of common domains are registered to exploit errors when users mistype a web address. Yet, no prior research has been dedicated to situations where the linking errors of web publishers (i.e. developers and content contributors) propagate to users. We hypothesize that these &#8220;hijackable hyperlinks&#8221; exist in large quantities with the potential to generate substantial traffic. Analyzing large-scale crawls of the web using high-performance computing, we show the web currently contains active links to more than 572,000 dot-com domains that have never been registered, what we term &#8216;phantom domains.&#8217; Registering 51 of these, we see 88% of phantom domains exceeding the traffic of a control domain, with up to 10 times more visits. Our analysis shows that these links exist due to 17 common publisher error modes, with the phantom domains they point to free for anyone to purchase and exploit for under 20, representing a low barrier to entry for potential attackers...</p></blockquote>

## HTTP/3 in curl mid 2024

date: 2024-06-10, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

Time for another checkup. Where are we right now with HTTP/3 support in curl for users? I think curl&#8217;s situation is symptomatic for a lot of other HTTP tools and libraries. HTTP/3 has been and continues to be a much tougher deployment journey than HTTP/2 was. curl supports four alternative HTTP/3 solutions You can enable &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/06/10/http-3-in-curl-mid-2024/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">HTTP/3 in curl mid 2024</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## June 9, 2024

date: 2024-06-10, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Yesterday the Washington Post published an article by Beth Reinhard examining the philosophy and the power of Russell Vought, the hard-right Christian nationalist who is drafting plans for a second Trump term. Vought was the director of the Office of Management and Budget from July 2020 to January 2021 during the Trump administration. In January 2021 he founded the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank, and he was a key player in the construction of Project 2025, the plan to gut the nonpartisan federal government and replace it with a dominant president and a team of loyalists who will impose religious rule on the United States.

<p>Had another crap night&rsquo;s sleep BUT as I was lying there at 4:30am with my hand on my belly, I felt definite movement 🥰 Like, a foot or something running along the underside of the surface. Not the first time I&rsquo;ve thought I felt something, but the first time I&rsquo;m sure I did. It was wild the emotional reaction I had, too – just suddenly filled with love for this defenceless little creature inside me. A very strong feeling!</p>

## What’s Friendship

date: 2024-06-09, from: Om Malik blog

Sometimes, when you read something so perfect, you have to savor it, share it, and save it! ….what could be easier than friendship? In theory, nothing. It is a relationship that consists almost entirely in shared history, loyalty, and an ongoing pleasure in each other’s company. Friendship asks only that you be yourself.  In philosophical &#8230;

## Wikipedia vs ChatGPT

date: 2024-06-09, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>I started replying to a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@timbray@cosocial.ca/112582969576496746">post by Tim Bray</a> in a thread on Mastodon, but quickly hit the character limit, so I moved my act over here. </i></p>
<p>ChatGPT gets rid of a huge problem with Wikipedia. </p>
<p>It often only represents a story from one point of view.</p>
<p>So the story of the Mac is a story of Apple, not the developers.</p>
<p>Same with the story of RSS. I'm sure you know the story they tell, but there's a whole other story, about how Netscape and blogging got together with Salon, Wired, Red Herring and  Motley Fool, and eventually brought the NYT and NPR on board, and that created a powerful standard supported by the entire publishing industry, that led to social media and podcasting. It really has very little do with the attempts of the tech industry to undermine it, other than their attempts failed to do that, yet if you read the Wikipedia page you'd get the idea that the bigco's heroically fought back against what exactly it's not clear. </p>
<p>I can't contribute to that page, based on the rules of Wikipedia, so your idea that I could just work harder to get the story right, well it's not ethical for me to do that. The best I can do is write about it on my blog (as I'm doing now) and hope that someone goes in there and fights with whoever is in charge of keeping the story as it is. (Although Tim, not you, it would be unethical for you too.)</p>
<p>Wikipedia also has served as a way for people to take credit for things other people did. Notoriously, Ben Hammersley claiming he chose the name for podcasting, for which there is absolutely no support. If ChatGPT made a mistake like that people would be howling. I'm sure Wikipedia is filled with junk like that. Why wouldn't it be. </p>
<p>And btw, I still point to Wikipedia pages from my blog posts over all other sources, because it has the potential of getting better, while other sources don't. </p>
<p>But ChatGPT is Wikipedia plus everything else and it has software far in advance of search engines for uncovering alternate angles. </p>
<p>ChatGPT gets all angles of a story, if they have been covered on the open web. I don't know why it's better at finding stuff, and also understanding my queries even though they're not rigorously specified, my understanding of the technology is nil, but as a user, I love the way I can explore history, and get a lot more than just the result of a weird culture that you have to spend years politicing through to be able to contribute. ChatGPT has managed to route around that outage.</p>
<p>It's also an amazing programming partner, and I imagine that it would work just as well for visual artists if they used it to try out prototypes of ideas, esp if new ways of training it are explored, which of course they are being. </p>
<p>Having known each other for 20+ years, I suppose that's a big difference between us, you seek out those kinds of political frays, I get very impatient with them and move on. </p>
<p>Also, I'm not here to debate. I don't like online debates. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

It happened again, but this time it offered to open an app that helps me find the big stuff. I don't know when this app came to be, but it's very helpful.  In a few minutes I was able to free up 100GB of space used for all kinds of frivolous purposes, like backups of every mobile device that's ever come within wifi distance of this machine (or so it seems). I'm sure there's a way to get it to store some of the frivolous stuff on the 16TB external drive, but I sure don't know how to do it nor do I want to know. My head is so overloaded with other BS from JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, my own software, etc etc. My brain has been out of space a lot longer than this Mac's has. I desperately want to move my act to Linux and reclaim all the memory I'm using to store stuff about the Mac, which isn't really doing me much good, I use the Mac as if it was a Linux machine. However, I remain a happy shareholder, that's my revenge, and why I bought the stock in the first place. I was so unhappy with what Apple was doing at the time (1998) but I could see that it would make <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/beaucoups">beaucoups</a> money, so I hedged. I figured at least they'd make me rich while completely annihilating all I had done to make the platform great. My inner greedy capitalist has his revenge. I would still rather have seen Apple keep <a href="http://frontier.userland.com">Frontier</a> running and have lost some of the profit I made from the Apple stock. Anyway, as usual I ramble. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Pedestrian bridges and plantings

date: 2024-06-09, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Seemingly nothing makes me happier to see than infrastructure and plants, so I was ecstatic to *finally* walk across this pedestrian bridge at Microsoft campus, which has appeared done for the past year from the street level, where I glowered up at it and cursed pedestrian facilities not being opened when they&#8217;re walkable.

I bet you could do a nice AI that would create a graph of people who are connected to other people through far more criteria than networks like LinkedIn or Facebook could. It could take into account all of those connections and others. Kind of like a current-day geneology of relationships.
