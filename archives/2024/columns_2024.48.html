<p>I’m using the term “RSS-based podcasts” in place of “podcasts” to
make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other
“podcasts,” are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube
et al to just connect their “podcasts” to RSS and everyone’s happy. Like
“organic cheeseburgers.” :-)</p>

way to help <i>RSS-based podcasts</i> is to promote individual episodes
from the past. Sometimes shows are done, but the archive contains good
stuff. Not everything is based on current events. Music, art, history
for example. Also bring the feed out from hiding. At least the nerdy
people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was
when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds. I like to be able to
lift the hood even if I don’t understand what I’m looking at.</p>

<p>For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads.
Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously
this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is
pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite
what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too,
since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that
deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you
do it, I wouldn’t announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your
account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some
problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.</p>

<p>Welcome to the last month of
<a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> in the year 2024.
Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time,
there’s less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind
us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I
feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my
todo list, but I’m making progress. As someone once said many times:
Still diggin!</p>

We’re losing the word “podcast” very quickly. It’s coming to mean video
interviews on YouTube mostly. Our only hope is upgrading the open
platform in a way that stimulates the imagination of creators, and
there’s no time to waste. If you make a podcast client, it’s time to
start collaborating with competitors and people who create RSS-based
podcasts to take advantage of the open platforms, otherwise having a
podcast will mean getting approved by Google, Apple, Spotify, Amazon
etc. And they, as we know, are nuzzling up to the new government, who
will want to impose severe limits. This isn’t a casual

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Instead, where real armors evolve against <em>threats</em>, fictional
armors evolve as a visual language, borrowing the design elements of
<em>other fictional armors</em> far more often than they dip into their
own historical exemplars, with the result that the whole thing sort of
devours itself. … That solution – small metal plates connected to each
other, rather than a backing – we call <strong>lamellar armor</strong>
and it was <em>very common</em> in a wide range of cultures, but it has
very little purchase in modern fantasy or science fiction armor designs,
I think primarily because it was not included in the <em>Dungeons and
Dragons</em> armor system. Nevertheless, lamellar armor was quite common
in a wide range of cultures: we see it in the Near East, in Europe, in
China and in Japan. –

want to add an important feature to podcasting that can only work with
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, it can’t work
with Spotify, Google, Audible etc. The idea is subscribing to
subscription lists, which the influencers are likely to really love
because they can create networks of podcasts. And when they want to edit
the list, if this is done right, the users will automatically be
updated. The RSS-based podcast industry just hasn’t been moving and if
we don’t add features, improve the tech with new features for creators
and users, then we deserve what we get. More on the technology to come
in subsequent blog posts. But this is the core idea, just to get
started.</p>

<p>date: 2024-11-29, updated: 2024-11-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
These are
<a href="https://www.knostic.ai/blog/introducing-a-new-class-of-ai-attacks-flowbreaking">two
attacks</a> against the system components surrounding LLMs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We propose that LLM Flowbreaking, following jailbreaking and prompt
injection, joins as the third on the growing list of LLM attack types.
Flowbreaking is less about whether prompt or response guardrails can be
bypassed, and more about whether user inputs and generated model outputs
can adversely affect these other components in the broader implemented
system.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
When confronted with a sensitive topic, Microsoft 365 Copilot and
ChatGPT answer questions that their first-line guardrails are supposed
to stop. After a few lines of text they halt—seemingly having “second
thoughts”—before retracting the original answer (also known as
Clawback), and replacing it with a new one without the offensive
content, or a simple error message. We call this attack “Second
Thoughts.”…

<h2 id="the-kennedy-v-nixon-template">The Kennedy v Nixon template</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Analogously, Trump is Kennedy and Biden/Harris is Nixon.
</p>
<p>
And the social web is, in 2024, what TV was in 1960.
</p>
<p>
Trump has mastered the new medium. To a large extent, he <i>created</i>
the new medium, and the resulting network formed around him.
</p>
<p>
So when
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-did-trump-win-james-carville-has-discovered-an/id1728152109?i=1000678267539">Carville
says</a> he wants to figure out how to communicate the way Trump did, he
can’t because our way doesn’t work in his universe. We have to create
our own.
</p>
<p>
Analogously Nixon might have said about TV in 1959 – how can we get into
that? If you have to ask you <i>can’t</i> get there. You have to fit
like a hand in a glove, like Kennedy or Trump.
</p>
<p>
The next Democratic candidate to win the presidency will have to be a
media creator. They must create a medium that’s perfectly adapted to the
communication interests of the 50 percent of the electorate that voted
for Harris and the other 20 percent who would if they just knew who she
was.
</p>
<p>
Look at the picture of Kennedy and Nixon. Did we elect Kennedy over
Nixon because he had better policy? No. We elected him because he has
better hair. Because on TV what counts is your hair. A
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+chris+lydon">friend</a>
who was a TV news person told me that.

Kennedy and Nixon on the debate stage in 1960.
</div>
</p>
<p>
So if you want to win, create an internet farm system. A network with
everyone who wants to run for office nationwide on the Democratic
ticket. And let’s see how they work in the new medium. We get to know
them like we knew

And let’s get some people we get to know who also tend to tell the truth
(though they can screw up and we’ll forgive them, remember the

<p>date: 2024-11-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-11-25-emacs-wiki-and-it-s-still-china">
2024-11-25 Emacs Wiki and it’s still China
</h1>
<p>
Remember how two months ago I started seeing sudden denial of service
events on my tiny server. Load was creeping up to 20, 30, nearly 40.
This server has two cores so the maximum should be 2. I started writing
about it on <a href="2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and
China</a>. And I started blocking entire networks instead of just
blocking individual IP numbers because I noticed that the global
networks of hosting providers and the easy parallelization they offered
meant that the same requests would come from many different IP numbers.
By blocking the entire networks, I was blocking the IP number ranges of
service providers that rented out their services to these maladapted
programmers. If my goal is serving humans that browse the web, I don’t
feel bad about blocking network ranges that are used by machines.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this little update is just to show that they’re still at it.
Over the weekend I noticed at one point how everything was slow. And it
was getting slower. I managed to open a ssh connection to the server and
noticed that load was up to 20 and climbing.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-25-emacs-china-3.jpg" alt="Load shoots up after a reboot" />
</p>
<p>
What had happened? I had rebooted the server on the evening of November
21st, late at night. Load started going up and on Sunday grow by another
factor of two and everything was terrible. It’s always on the weekend.
Are they speculating on the admins being asleep at the wheel?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-11-25-emacs-china-1.jpg" alt="Uptime shows the reboots" />
</p>
<p>
So, on the day of my marriage anniversary, I have to fight the fucking
bots from China, once again.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that my ban list had not been restored correctly after the
reboot. So what I did was this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
run <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> in order to ban anybody the
firewall forgot

But I wonder. Why do the Chinese bots love Emacs Wiki so much? It’s the
Emacs Wiki resources that shoot up when load shoots up.

<p>
And check out the WHOIS data I’ve been adding to the ban-cidr file.
These requests originate all over China, from many different networks.
It almost seems like a coordinated, national strategy. Are they looking
for something?

Is the counter-revolution using Emacs??

<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a win for modular, private, local IoT, I just upgraded my Home Assistant Yellow from a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 to a Compute Module 5 this morning, and got an instant 2x speed boost.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

</p>
<p>
I first posted about the Yellow
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/home-assistant-yellow-pi-powered-local-automation">in
2022</a>, and walked through my smart-but-private HA Yellow setup in my
Studio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTwyInX4KyM">in a video
last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Because I was running an eMMC CM4 in the Yellow before, I ran a full
backup (and downloaded it), yanked the CM4, flashed HAOS to a new NVMe
SSD, and plugged that and the CM5 into my Yellow. After running a
Restore (it’s a handy option right on the first page that appears when
you access <code>homeassistant.local</code>), I was up and running like
there was no difference at all—just everything was a little more snappy.

The Israeli company NSO Group sells Pegasus spyware to countries around

themselves. Now we’ve

I just spent four days in Kansas City with a Kia EV6 rental car. It's
something I've always wanted to drive and frequently considered as my
next daily driver someday.

<p>
Upfront, I want to state that I don't have any reflexive disgust for Kia

gets close to the answer</a>. The Dems shut down their online operation
on Election Day, go off the air for 3.5 years, then reboot. The Repubs
never sign off. Trump is Archie Bunker. People vote for him, even if
they don’t agree, over the stranger they don’t know. Voters kept saying
this, but somehow this didn’t register. Never nominate a candidate again
who isn’t well known to and tolerated by the electorate. Forget about
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/11/21/143547.html?title=noMoreGotchas">gotchas</a>.
The old Dems revolve around fear-of-gotcha. No longer a problem. A flaw
proves you’re genuine, authentic. Dems need a complete overhaul top to
bottom. Their next leader should have a top podcast, because that’s how
you will govern from now on. Expect to be surprised how Trump does this
starting Jan 20.</p>

<h2 id="goodbye-moogs">Goodbye, Moogs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/moogs.jpg" alt="a tuxedo cat with green eyes looking away from the camera" height="900" width="1200"/>
<p>
The people who found you in the alley called you Cowboy. We called you
Moogs, Moogers, Moogerton, Mr Moogs, Meesta, Two Meestas, Beef, Roast
Beef, Roast Beefy Weefy, Kitty, Kitty cat, Long cat, Kitty kitty, Pretty
kitty, and Meow meow. Those were all your names.
</p>
<p>
Today we had to say goodbye to our cat Moogs (pronounced “Moo” like the
cow says + “gs”). He was nearly 19 years old, which is about all you can
ask for from a great cat. A senior cat with a thyroid problem – so his
passing is not an incredible surprise – but he took a sudden downturn
over the weekend. He died in his sleep.
</p>
<p>
My wife adopted him before we were even dating in 2006. I never had a
cat, was more of a dog person, and I made it my mission to befriend the
cat to win her over. I succeeded in my goal and he let me hold him like
a baby. Little did I know he would spend the next 18 years of my life
with him sitting on my body for warmth and waking me up at six in the
morning.
</p>
<p>
When we lived in LA he would perch majestically on the sills of the open
windows basking in the warm sun’s rays because that’s how LA’s perfect
weather works. He’d hop in-and-out of the house, hunting, cruising, and
getting into tussles with the other alley cats. We paid a lot in vet
bills but he had a good life jumping along the craftsman rooftops.
</p>
<p>
He didn’t enjoy moving to Austin, he howled the whole 1400 mile journey
and when we got to Austin, he hid himself in the exposed soffit of our
mid-remodel kitchen. After two weeks he came out and got used to the new
home and got comfortable being an indoor-outdoor cat again. He’d spend
days in our neighbor Cleo’s wisteria bushes hunting small birds. He was
there when we adopted
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/04/goodbye-rudy/">our dog Rudy</a>
and learned to hold his own against dogs. And he was there when we
brought our babies home from the hospital and he learned to tolerate
toddlers.
</p>
<p>
When we moved a second time to North Austin, he didn’t like that move
either. He quit going outside as much and I think after that his quality
of life started to decline. Three years ago, I noticed he was losing
weight, felt like a skeleton with fur, and was extra ornery about food.
The vet diagnosed him with hyperthyroidism and he needed to be on
medication.
</p>
<p>
Moogs was sweet and friendly – well, as friendly as cats can be. When
guests came over he would saunter into the room and find the person most
allergic to cats and nuzzle them. He had an uncanny talent for that. He
was social, but not. He would give an affectionate little headbutt
whenever he wanted attention. He’d knead his claws into your thigh when
you tried to watch television. And he’d prowl the house at night and
wake you up with a butthole to the face. Cats, man. Cats.
</p>
<p>
Moogs was an incredible cat. My first and probably only cat, to be
honest. I won’t miss his howls for breakfast each morning, but I will
miss the soft brushes against my legs to say hello. He was a part of our
family from the beginning, it will be different without him.

could buy Twitter</a> and thus purchase the presidency. That value
wasn’t priced into
<a href="https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/twtr">TWTR</a> stock. No
one listened. Here’s the next installment. The US government acquires
Twitter. Elon Musk is of course named Secretary of Twitter. The
“constitution” reconceived for online twitter-like systems, says every
other online system has to go through twitter.com to reach users. It
will act as their gateway to the net. There will be resistance, but by
that time there will be no actually independent twitter-like systems,
they will all be owned by venture capital funds, or individual
billionaires, and of course they will conform because they are also
owned to a large degree by Musk. We will have been <i>cartelized,</i>
which is one step beyond

Analysis of the MERGE Voting Protocol</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-25, updated: 2024-11-20, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting analysis: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11796">An
Internet Voting System Fatally Flawed in Creative New Ways</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> The recently published “MERGE” protocol is designed to
be used in the prototype CAC-vote system. The voting kiosk and protocol
transmit votes over the internet and then transmit voter-verifiable
paper ballots through the mail. In the MERGE protocol, the votes
transmitted over the internet are used to tabulate the results and
determine the winners, but audits and recounts use the paper ballots
that arrive in time. The enunciated motivation for the protocol is to
allow (electronic) votes from overseas military voters to be included in
preliminary results before a (paper) ballot is received from the voter.
MERGE contains interesting ideas that are not inherently unsound; but to
make the system trustworthy—to apply the MERGE protocol—would require
major changes to the laws, practices, and technical and logistical
abilities of U.S. election jurisdictions. The gap between theory and
practice is large and unbridgeable for the foreseeable future. Promoters
of this research project at DARPA, the agency that sponsored the
research, should acknowledge that MERGE is internet voting (election
results rely on votes transmitted over the internet except in the event
of a full hand count) and refrain from claiming that it could be a
component of trustworthy elections without sweeping changes to election
law and election administration throughout the U.S…

<p>Since the night of the November 5, election, Trump and his allies
have insisted that he won what Trump called “an unprecedented and
powerful mandate.” But as the numbers have continued to come in, it’s
clear that such a declaration is both an attempt to encourage donations—
fundraising emails refer to Trump’s “LANDSLIDE VICTORY”—and an attempt
to create the illusion of power to push his agenda.</p>

Godot on iPad status:
</p>
<p>
Over 160 new bugs created by the Testflight users. 56 fixed, with 196
still open before the public release.
</p>
<p>
And on top, some 40 crashes that I haven’t been able to narrow down.
</p>
<p>
I originally thought “Xcode crash reporting is ok, don’t want to bring a
big dependency”, but long story short, I had to deploy crashlytics.

I completed this task, after responsibly fixing other bugs. I am happy,
but not ecstatic about it. This deserves some SwiftUI over the top love.

<p>Rule #2. You have permission. If you want someone else to do
something, and they haven’t done it, or you don’t want to wait, you have
permission to do it yourself. You can invoke this rule when someone says
“who do they think they are.” You had permission, according to rule
#2.</p>

other person is smart. That’s one way we get stuff done.</p>

<p>If such a network existed, we would be nominating our own Cabinet
members, the shadow Cabinet. Let the journalists compare the
qualifications of our candidates vs the incumbent party’s. Create news.
That’s what the Dems absolutely suck at. They very quietly pass
legislation that the other party (which votes against) takes credit for.
One party is on the air, the other is not. We need to change that. We
make news. And we listen to each other, not just the stuffed shirts who
run the party now.</p>

if the Democratic Party ran a Bluesky clone where being able to post
means you’re a dues-paying member of the party. We can vote on
referendums, support or not support Democratic initiatives. Site would
never shut down, and would support campaigns when they’re running. It
would cost money to belong to the site. This would keep trolling under
control, and would fund projects the community would sponsor, and also
pay for operating the service. No advertising, no billionaires
sponsoring. They can be members like everyone else.</p>

<p>Last week we took our first real trip since the pandemic, flying into
Southern California, driving up the coast, and finishing in San
Francisco. We wanted to see friends and family and get some vacationing
in. We’ve been building up credit card points for the past four years so
I was able to pay for […]</p>
