Romantasy is a subgenre getting considerable attention and India Holton
enters the field with a new series, that is a lot of fun. The first
book, <strong>The Ornithologist‚Äôs Field Guide to Love</strong>,
introduces two academics, Beth Pickering and Devon Lock¬≠ley, who
specialize in the study and, if necessary, capture of thaumaturgic
birds. These

In my previous article on Japanese science fiction, published
in¬†Locus¬†in 2016, I likened my experience of living in Japan to Urashima
Taro‚Äôs rise from his present world (eighth century) to the world of the
future, with its fast-forward jumble of pop-culture iconography. This
sense of Japan and its current state in science fiction is even more
relevant in the wake of COVID, as these changes have only accelerated.

<p>‚ÄúThe streaming bubble finally popped, and I think the tip of the
spear that popped it was the double strikes we had last year and now
we‚Äôre calling it the great contraction. It‚Äôs a really tough time for
up-and-coming writers to break in. It‚Äôs tough for everyone, even
up-and-coming agents and managers, anyone coming out to Hollywood to
pursue a career. It‚Äôs one of the toughest times ever, so you need to be
patient,‚Äù says literary manager Jeff Portnoy, of Bellevue Productions. ¬†
<br> <br>On today‚Äôs podcast, guest host Lee Jessup, Hollywood‚Äôs leading
screenwriting career coach and judge of the Big Break screenwriting
competition, interviews Jeff Portnoy, literary manager for Bellevue
Productions. They discuss the current state of the industry and how it‚Äôs
affecting writers.¬† <br> <br>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been encouraging a lot of new
writers to focus on features at the moment and explaining how bleak the
TV staffing market is right now. So if they have hopes of getting
staffed, it‚Äôs very difficult right now. Typically, if we had a client
who wants to write in the TV space, we‚Äôd help them get a TV agent and
we, the agents and I, would go out and try to get them staffed. But
agents aren‚Äôt really signing anyone below mid level right now, so
they‚Äôre not taking on those up-and-coming writers,‚Äù says Portnoy.¬† <br>
<br>But there is hope considering business trends are always cyclical.
Portnoy shares this advice about writing spec features in this climate:
‚ÄúYou want to stand out and that comes down to your ideas. The execution
has to be great. It‚Äôs about choosing ideas that really stand out in a
pack ‚Äì the words I like to use are loud, bold, audacious. Managers,
agents, producers ‚Äì we see thousands of loglines a month and if we see a
logline that‚Äôs loud, audacious and bold, it‚Äôs going to stand out.‚Äù <br>

podcast.¬†</p>

<em><span style="font-weight: bold;">Warning - spoilers

great prestige TV, but that‚Äôs exactly what <em>The Penguin</em> is
doing. Written and helmed by showrunner Lauren LeFranc, <em>The
Penguin</em> follows Oswald ‚ÄúOz‚Äù Cobb (Colin Farrell) in the weeks after
the events of Matt Reeves‚Äôs 2022 <em>The Batman</em>, as he rises
through Gotham‚Äôs criminal underworld to become the
Penguin.<br><br>Despite being rooted in the superhero genre‚Äîone recently
declared ‚Äúdead‚Äù after a string of box office bombs and underperforming

Sometimes you‚Äôre reading a book and suddenly ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat the
hell am I reading?‚Äù This can be a bad thing or an excellent thing. In
the case of Scott R. Jones‚Äôs <strong>Drill</strong>, it‚Äôs the latter.
Slightly surreal, angry, smart, Lovecraftian, chaotic, and written with
the kind of prose that dances between

through strategies for navigating situations where your circle of

<p>‚ÄúI think [ <em>Here</em>] has some of the imagination of <em>Forrest
Gump</em>, but it‚Äôs not <em>Forrest Gump</em>. It‚Äôs a different animal.
I mean, it has the same kind of humanity to it, which is what I‚Äôm pretty
good at,‚Äù says Eric Roth about his latest film <em>Here</em>, co-written
and directed by Robert Zemeckis and reuniting actors Tom Hanks and Robin
Wright.¬† <br> <br>On today‚Äôs podcast, we speak with Oscar winning
screenwriter Eric Roth about the challenges of writing the screenplay
for <em>Here</em> that mostly takes place in one room, with a fixed
camera that never moves. The movie explores the ordinary lives of
multiple generations of families in a way that many will find relatable,
heartbreaking and, at times, claustrophobic.¬† <br> <br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure
[the characters in <em>Here</em>] are extraordinary or not, but they
show the length and breadth of what people can and can‚Äôt do and when
they‚Äôre trapped. I think when it works that way dramatically, it‚Äôs quite
lovely and quite beautiful. I don‚Äôt want to use the word profound, but I
think the [movie] is profound to a certain extent because it is just
about the regularity of life. And that, from dinosaurs to the future,
it‚Äôs going to keep going. Hopefully people will find great joy in how
they‚Äôre living and I‚Äôm sure great pain too, but I think that‚Äôs just sort
of the circle of life,‚Äù he says.¬† <br> <br>We also discuss some of his
other films like <em>Forrest Gump</em>, for which he won an Oscar, and
<em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>.¬† <br> <br>He shared this advice
about using subtext in screenplays. ‚ÄúI think that I‚Äôm always trying to
find a way to enhance the scene with not only subtext, but with some
kind of metaphor and make it possibly more interesting as to getting to
the root of people‚Äôs feelings without them having to vomit out what
they‚Äôre saying you know. It‚Äôs not easy, but I think as I‚Äôve gotten more
successful and more accomplished at it,‚Äù he says.¬† <br> <br>To hear more
of Eric Roth‚Äôs advice for screenwriters, listen to the podcast.¬†</p>
