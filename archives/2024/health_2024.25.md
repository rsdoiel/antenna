## Overexpression of LAG-3: a potential indicator of low immune function in tuberculosis

date: 2024-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) persists as a global health challenge, with its treatment hampered by the side effects of long-term combination drug therapies and the growing issue of drug resistance. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is critical. This study focuses on the role of immune checkpoint molecules (ICs) and functions of CD8+ T cells in the search for new potential targets against TB.MethodsWe conducted differential expression genes analysis and CD8+ T cell functional gene analysis on 92 TB samples and 61 healthy individual (HI) samples from TB database GSE83456, which contains data on 34,603 genes. The GSE54992 dataset was used to validated the findings. Additionally, a cluster analysis on single-cell data from primates infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and those vaccinated with BCG was performed.ResultsThe overexpression of LAG-3 gene was found as a potentially important characteristic of both pulmonary TB (PTB) and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Further correlation analysis showed that LAG-3 gene was correlated with GZMB, perforin, IL-2 and IL-12. A significant temporal and spatial variation in LAG-3 expression was observed in T cells and macrophages during TB infection and after BCG vaccination.ConclusionLAG-3 was overexpressed in TB samples. Targeting LAG-3 may represent a potential therapeutic target for tuberculosis.

## Host specificity and zoonotic Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes in wild rodents from the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and Liaoning Province of China

date: 2024-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionWild rodents can serve as reservoirs or carriers of E. bieneusi, thereby enabling parasite transmission to domestic animals and humans. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of E. bieneusi in wild rodents from the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and Liaoning Province of China. Moreover, to evaluate the potential for zoonotic transmission at the genotype level, a genetic analysis of the isolates was performed.MethodsA total of 486 wild rodents were captured from two provinces in China. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the vertebrate cytochrome b (cytb) gene in the fecal DNA of the rodents to detect their species. The genotype of E. bieneusi was determined via PCR amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA. The examination of genetic characteristics and zoonotic potential requires the application of similarity and phylogenetic analysis.ResultsThe infection rates of E. bieneusi in the four identified rodent species were 5.2% for Apodemus agrarius (n = 89), 4.5% for Cricetulus barabensis (n = 96), 11.3% for Mus musculus (n = 106), and 38.5% for Rattus norvegicus (n = 195). Infection was detected at an average rate of 17.4% among 486 rodents. Of the 11 identified genotypes, nine were known: SHR1 (detected in 32 samples), D (30 samples), EbpA (9 samples), PigEbITS7 (8 samples), HNR-IV (6 samples), Type IV (5 samples), HNR-VII (2 samples), HNH7 (1 sample), and HNPL-V (1 sample). Two novel genotypes were also discovered, NMR-I and NMR-II, each comprising one sample. The genotypes were classified into group 1 and group 13 via phylogenetic analysis.DiscussionBased on the initial report, E. bieneusi is highly prevalent and genetically diverse in wild rodents residing in the respective province and region. This indicates that these animals are crucial for the dissemination of E. bieneusi. Zoonotic E. bieneusi-carrying animals present a significant hazard to local inhabitants. Therefore, it is necessary to increase awareness regarding the dangers presented by these rodents and reduce their population to prevent environmental contamination.

## The role of bacterial genital infections in spontaneous preterm delivery: a case-control study

date: 2024-06-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSpontaneous preterm delivery is defined as the beginning of the birth process before the 37th week of pregnancy. The presence of microorganisms in the fetal membranes is accompanied by an increase in the production of prostaglandin, one of the important factors associated with the prevalence of preterm birth. The invasion of microorganisms leads to the production of protease, coagulase, and elastase, which directly stimulate the onset of childbirth. We investigated the role of genital infections in women with preterm birth.MethodsThe present case-control study was conducted in the west of Iran on 100 women with spontaneous preterm delivery (following 24 weeks of gestation and before 36 weeks and 6 days) as the case group and 100 women with normal delivery as controls. A questionnaire was applied to collect the data. Polymerase chain reaction and pathological examination of the placenta were performed.ResultsThe average age in women with normal delivery (30.92 ± 5.10) in women with spontaneous preterm delivery (30.27 ± 4.93). The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycoplasma genitalium infections was zero in both groups. The highest prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis was 19 (19%) in the case group and Ureaplasma parvum 15 (15%) in the control group. Also, Placental inflammation was zero in controls and 7(7%) in the patient group. There was a significant relationship between Gardnerella vaginalis bacteria and spontaneous preterm delivery.ConclusionThe results of our study showed that except for Gardnerella vaginalis bacteria, there is no significant relationship between the above bacterial infections and spontaneous preterm birth. Moreover, despite the significant reduction in the prevalence of many sexually transmitted infections in this research, it is still suggested to increase the awareness of people, including pregnant women, about the ways it can be transmitted by gynecologists and health and treatment centers.
