## ‘It’s not a candy’: Medical staff allege LA County CHS medication-assisted treatment practices are unsafe for patients

date: 2024-10-18, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

A family medicine physician at Los Angeles County Correctional Health Services found himself in a difficult position last November. Dr. Yang, who asked to be referred to only by his last name out of concerns about retaliation, was troubled by a new CHS policy increasing the use of opiate medications, namely Suboxone, as a treatment for opioid use disorder.&#160;
The new CHS policy requires that all inmates entering the reception area be screened for opioid use disorder and, if they meet the criteria for it, immediately be prescribed Suboxone.
