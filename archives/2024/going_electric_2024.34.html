As sales of electric vehicles continue to grow in 2024, many new and
prospective customers have questions about qualifying for a
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ev-federal-tax-credit/">federal tax

is a simple yes or no question, but the amount you may qualify for
varies by household due to a number of different factors. Luckily, we
have compiled everything you need to know about tax credits for your new
or current electric vehicle into one place.
