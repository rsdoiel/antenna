I implemented <a href="oddmu/oddmu-hashtags.1">a new subcommand for
Oddmu</a>. I was mostly curious to see whether Administration had alread
overtaken role-playing games, that is, RPG. I am happy to report that
administration issues are still far from the top of the list. <em>Homo

<h2 id="the-nyt-is-weird">The NYT is weird</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Someone in charge at the NYT needs to take a step back and view events,
and the NYT role in those events, from the point of view of an ordinary
non-NYT-employed citizen, bewildered at the enormous risks journalists
are taking with the system of government of the United States.
</p>
<p>
In the context of who we are as a country, what the Repubs do and say is
to be very mild about it ‚Äúweird.‚Äù What word would you prefer the
Democrats use? Imagine
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William
Safire</a> were here, the great linguist columnist of the NYT, wrote
that column. (Safire was a
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/ab14f5b9-2b55-406f-9b78-057313c03d63">Republican</a>
btw.)
</p>
<p>
And to the Democrats, no matter what the NYT says, keep using the term.
This is where you get to speak out about what they‚Äôre doing over there,
and how it‚Äôs not journalism. One of the rare things you agree with Trump
on.
</p>
<p>
Podcast: <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/31/theNYTIsWeird.m4a">3
minutes</a>.
</p>
<p>
PS: Safire went to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_High_School_of_Science">Bronx
Science</a>! I did not know that. (So did I.) I love the idea of writers
who aren‚Äôt scared of tech stuff.
</p>
<p>
PPS: Even Richard Nixon would think today‚Äôs so-called Republicans were
weird.
</p>
<p>
PPPS: The NYT is totally unmoored, a word I bet Safire would like.

<p>People who get their sense of self-esteem from having procreated are
placing a heavy burden on their children. What if the child doesn‚Äôt live
up to their expectations? How will they treat the child then! Creating a
new human is not an accomplishment. Treating that new life as a full
person starting at birth, and through their whole life, <i>that‚Äôs</i> an
accomplishment. For a man to father a child just means they have a
functioning reproductive system. It‚Äôs not anything to be proud or to
expect to be rewarded or respected for.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://this.how/podcast0/">Podcast0</a> project is
teaching me how to read the archive of my own blog. Until now I had not
carefully read the story I tell on my blog more than a few days after it
happened. Here‚Äôs I‚Äôm learning to reconstruct the summer of 2004, one of
the most creative periods of my life, at least that‚Äôs viewable in such a
public and preserved way. Am I the first to do this for any blog? If you
know of an example of historic research done using the archive of a
blog, please send me a note. I‚Äôd love to learn about what you learned!
Also because of its longevity and continuity, I offer
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/25.html">this blog</a> as some
kind of record of what happened in the last 30 years or so. I see it as
a complete work of writing, a kind of

<p>
I keep a solid line between my personal life and blogging, learned the
hard way. When I started blogging in 1994, I didn‚Äôt have such a solid
line, and found that I couldn‚Äôt have a personal life if I made it
public. But now I want to reveal something. I am ‚Äúchildless‚Äù which is a
term I find pretty insulting, as if being child<i>ful</i> is the only
normal state of being.
</p>
<p>
I find, in general childful people are not great friends or family
members. They want special privileges and they often get them. If
childful vs childless is going to be an issue in this campaign, I say ‚Äì
bring it on. We should have this discussion.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm often tempted to offer advice to the parents, but I won‚Äôt offer it
unless asked, except this. If you have children, there‚Äôs a good chance
one or more of them will not have children, and you should love them the
same, and provide models of acceptance while they‚Äôre growing up, by
bringing childless people into your home, so the kids know that this is
one of the legitimate choices in life, offering proof that you won‚Äôt
love them any less if they go down that path. And here‚Äôs the hard part,
imho, for people with children ‚Äì <i>keep that promise. </i>
</p>
<p>
BTW, people say it‚Äôs seflish to not have children, but I don‚Äôt agree, in
fact I think it‚Äôs the opposite. There was a point in human evolution
where the struggle to survive for our species was fed by procreation,
but some time in the last hundred years we crossed a line, where
increasing human population worked against species survival. Our
understanding of the meaning of procreating, like so much else about our
civilization, has not yet caught up with the current reality.

The reason for this has to do with the inclusion of a &lt;code&gt;curl-minimal&lt;/code&gt; package in some distros, which conflicts with &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; if you try installing the full package.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

Unfortunately, the fix for this is a little strange, and so only ends up
in Ansible‚Äôs

<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-5-can-overclock-314-ghz">3.14

<p>
In March, Raspberry Pi introduced new firmware that unlocked frequencies
above 3,000 MHz for overclocking. This summer,

Today‚Äôs phones are able to receive updates six to eight years after

That might not cut it in the auto world, where the average age of cars

<p>
The new tool the research project is unleashing on deepfakes, called
‚ÄúMISLnet‚Äù, evolved from years of data derived from detecting fake images
and video with tools that spot changes made to digital video or images.
These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames,
manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames.

<p>
Such tools work because a digital camera‚Äôs algorithmic processing
creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships
between values are very different in user-generated or images edited
with apps like Photoshop‚Ä¶

2024-07-27 Tired of programming
</h1>
<p>
My summer break has begun, and I am tired.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to work on some sort of editor. I contributed some lines to
Anvil, an Acme-inspired editor, and then I figured I should go back to
text editing because writing acceptable GUI editing is just sooo much
effort. So now I‚Äôm trying to use ed again‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm experimenting with using
<code>rlwrap</code> around <code>ed</code> and it‚Äôs not so bad if you‚Äôre
just writing, like writing an email. But really writing, organizing,
moving things around‚Ä¶ it really doesn‚Äôt work all that well. I had
imagined a sort of conversational UI ‚Äì which I guess ed has? ‚Äì if ed is
your grumpiest of companions! ‚Äì and I guess I was looking at my Oddmu
site generator and Markdown file server and thinking: what sort of
editor would I need to maintain this? What sort of minimal SVG editing
capabilities would be nice to have? That was my starting point. Then I
dropped the graphics because writing that seemed like a pain. Then I
started thinking about the GUI components: using fonts with Harfbuzz,
Unicode support, hyphenation (per language), spell-checking (per
language), and on and on. It‚Äôs too much.
</p>
<p>
But where does that leave me? Adding a few features to ed? Am I in fact
reinventing vi, badly?
</p>
<p>
<a href="2024-06-01-editor">2024-06-01 Fonts are important</a>,
<a href="2024-06-13-anvil">2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple
cursors</a>, <a href="2024-07-24-ed">2024-07-24 My ed, wondering</a>
</p>
<p>
I wanted to work on a local Gridmapper variant, written in Common Lisp.
I already have a working prototype in Common Lisp and I already have a
Javascript web application in production. This is a single file, a
stand-alone SVG+Javascript web application. It works online and offline.
Thus, my entire tinkering with CL right now has as its goal to produce a
native application that would work without a browser.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I start working on native GUI stuff, like working with SDL2 or
Cairo or similar libraries, my eyes start bleeding. Vanilla JS and the
browser really is a pretty nice virtual machine available to many of us.
Having spent a day trying to get SDL2, SDL2 gfx and Cairo sorted out for
this Common Lisp app I‚Äôm looking at really makes me want to drop it all
for another two years and focus on JavaScript instead. It can‚Äôt be that
bad! Javascript gives me the DOM and SVG and all that, practically for
free‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
And three different bindings Common Lisp bindings for SDL2 in various
states of neglect is draining. Switching from one to the other is tricky
since the first one had many idiomatic helpers functions that the other
is lacking. But the first one is lacking a gfx port. Then again, I guess
I can add circle drawing using lines.
</p>
<p>
Everything takes so long. So damn long.

<p>
A while ago I started collecting links with quotes instead of relying on
browser bookmarks or third parties. I remember at one point my bookmarks
were just HTML files generated by the browser. Good times! And there was
Delicious, a service now defunct, I guess. So now I keep
<a href="Bookmarks">bookmarks on this site</a>. It‚Äôs great.
</p>
<p>
I wondered whether I should write a tool that monitors those pages, and
when new items get added, a feed is updated. Just a little program‚Ä¶ it
doesn‚Äôt seem hard. So I gave it try. I like documentation first, these
days so I began with a man page for it. Good, good. Then I though that
perhaps I should use the same Markdown parser as Oddmu uses. So I needed
to write this tool in Go. How hard can it be? It‚Äôs a bit harder than
writing it in Perl. Oh, and I needed to parse the RSS file, too. Or use
SQLite to store data. It keeps getting harder.
</p>
<p>
Well, I spent some time on it and now I‚Äôm tired again. This too, takes
too long!
</p>
<p>
I feel defeated. Am I too impatient?
</p>
<p>
I should read a book.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-27</strong>. In an attempt to overcome my sadness, I
decided to spice up my shell life‚Ä¶
</p>
<pre><code># hipster shell
alias ls='echo Using exa instead;exa'
alias du='echo Using dust instead;dust'
alias top='echo Using htop instead;htop'
alias find='echo Using fd instead;fd'
alias grep='echo Using rg instead;rg'
alias files='echo Using yazi instead;yazi'
alias cal='echo Using khal instead;khal'
alias screenshot='grimshot'
alias copy='wl-copy'
alias paste='wl-paste'
</code></pre>
<p>
I set up <code>khal</code> and <code>khard</code> which required me to
set up <code>vdirsyncer</code> to sync the remote calendars (and
contacts) to local copies. This is also good for backup, I guess.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you know of other such tools.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-29</strong>. I overcame my block and wrote the
bookmarks-to-feed program in Perl:
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bookmark-feed.git">bookmark-feed</a>.
üîñ ü§ù <img loading="lazy" src="/pics/rss.svg" alt="RSS" />
</p>
<p>
I installed a daily cron job:
</p>
<pre><code>47  23  *  *   *     /usr/bin/nice /home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/bookmark-feed /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*_Bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*-bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/bookmarks.rss
</code></pre>
<p>
The readable variant is this: <code>bookmark-feed markdown-files‚Ä¶
feed-file</code>. The files it looks at once a day are my
<a href="Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>. The feed it generates is
<a href="/wiki/bookmarks.rss">bookmarks.rss</a>. The database it uses is
<a href="/wiki/bookmarks.db">bookmarks.db</a>.
</p>
<p>
It doesn‚Äôt do expiration from the database but uses only the last 40
items for the feed.
</p>
<p>
When populating the database, all I had was the timestamp of the
Markdown pages, so the existing bookmarks are all relatively unsorted ‚Äì
they are sorted by the timestamp of the most recent addition to the
whole category, which pretty weird.

<p>There have been some changes both on the hardware and the software
side. The hardware part was quite important yet simple: the current CPU
module has a WiFi chip without any cooling. As the CPU is relatively hod
(at least for the ARM) the WiFi part is hot, too - and it seems to work
bad when hot. So the quick fix is to add a small thermal pad (about 2 mm
thick) so the chip will be connected to the heatsink. The long-term
solution would be to use a cooler CPU.</p>

Twitter broke the API, it was a quick way for me to channel items from
my blog to almost all the people who follow me on the social web. Now it
isn‚Äôt even one of the services I use that I can post to with my writing
tool (those are Bluesky, Mastodon, WordPress). None of them are anything
like the aggregator of people that Twitter was, and I can‚Äôt even reach
it from my writing tool. I really want to solve this problem, but I
absolutely can‚Äôt do this on my own. No time, patience, and it‚Äôs not my
job to do all that coding. As observed the other day, my time should be
spent on writing tools for the web and directly related products. This
is the kind of project that should be handled as an open source
thing.</p>
