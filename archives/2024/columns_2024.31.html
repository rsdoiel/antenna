<p>Here’s a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/29/twowaysofsupport.png">perfect
illustration</a> how ChatGPT can improve customer relations. I bought an
iPhone that I now don’t need, and it’s arriving today via FedEx. I
wanted to know whether I should just refuse delivery, or accept it and
then return it. Obviously it’s easier for me to refuse. I asked ChatGPT
and it gave me a detailed reply. Apple’s chatbot saw it as a “technical”
question and wasn’t prepared to help. Sales support is one of those
applications where cost is totally justified. A human helper would cost
a lot more I imagine than a LLM chat system. I tried calling
1-800-CALL-APPLE and talked to a human who was very nice, but couldn’t
find anything in her manual about refusing delivery.</p>

<a href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/new-ai-algorithm-flags-deepfakes-with-98-accuracy-better-than-any-other-tool-out-there-right-now">latest</a>
in what will be a continuing arms race between creating and detecting
videos:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The new tool the research project is unleashing on deepfakes, called
“MISLnet”, evolved from years of data derived from detecting fake images
and video with tools that spot changes made to digital video or images.
These may include the addition or movement of pixels between frames,
manipulation of the speed of the clip, or the removal of frames.
</p>
<p>
Such tools work because a digital camera’s algorithmic processing
creates relationships between pixel color values. Those relationships
between values are very different in user-generated or images edited
with apps like Photoshop…

<h1 id="2024-07-27-tired-of-programming">
2024-07-27 Tired of programming
</h1>
<p>
My summer break has begun, and I am tired.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to work on some sort of editor. I contributed some lines to
Anvil, an Acme-inspired editor, and then I figured I should go back to
text editing because writing acceptable GUI editing is just sooo much
effort. So now I’m trying to use ed again… I’m experimenting with using
<code>rlwrap</code> around <code>ed</code> and it’s not so bad if you’re
just writing, like writing an email. But really writing, organizing,
moving things around… it really doesn’t work all that well. I had
imagined a sort of conversational UI – which I guess ed has? – if ed is
your grumpiest of companions! – and I guess I was looking at my Oddmu
site generator and Markdown file server and thinking: what sort of
editor would I need to maintain this? What sort of minimal SVG editing
capabilities would be nice to have? That was my starting point. Then I
dropped the graphics because writing that seemed like a pain. Then I
started thinking about the GUI components: using fonts with Harfbuzz,
Unicode support, hyphenation (per language), spell-checking (per
language), and on and on. It’s too much.
</p>
<p>
But where does that leave me? Adding a few features to ed? Am I in fact
reinventing vi, badly?
</p>
<p>
<a href="2024-06-01-editor">2024-06-01 Fonts are important</a>,
<a href="2024-06-13-anvil">2024-06-13 Anvil Editor and multiple
cursors</a>, <a href="2024-07-24-ed">2024-07-24 My ed, wondering</a>
</p>
<p>
I wanted to work on a local Gridmapper variant, written in Common Lisp.
I already have a working prototype in Common Lisp and I already have a
Javascript web application in production. This is a single file, a
stand-alone SVG+Javascript web application. It works online and offline.
Thus, my entire tinkering with CL right now has as its goal to produce a
native application that would work without a browser.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I start working on native GUI stuff, like working with SDL2 or
Cairo or similar libraries, my eyes start bleeding. Vanilla JS and the
browser really is a pretty nice virtual machine available to many of us.
Having spent a day trying to get SDL2, SDL2 gfx and Cairo sorted out for
this Common Lisp app I’m looking at really makes me want to drop it all
for another two years and focus on JavaScript instead. It can’t be that
bad! Javascript gives me the DOM and SVG and all that, practically for
free…
</p>
<p>
And three different bindings Common Lisp bindings for SDL2 in various
states of neglect is draining. Switching from one to the other is tricky
since the first one had many idiomatic helpers functions that the other
is lacking. But the first one is lacking a gfx port. Then again, I guess
I can add circle drawing using lines.
</p>
<p>
Everything takes so long. So damn long.

</p>
<p>
A while ago I started collecting links with quotes instead of relying on
browser bookmarks or third parties. I remember at one point my bookmarks
were just HTML files generated by the browser. Good times! And there was
Delicious, a service now defunct, I guess. So now I keep
<a href="Bookmarks">bookmarks on this site</a>. It’s great.
</p>
<p>
I wondered whether I should write a tool that monitors those pages, and
when new items get added, a feed is updated. Just a little program… it
doesn’t seem hard. So I gave it try. I like documentation first, these
days so I began with a man page for it. Good, good. Then I though that
perhaps I should use the same Markdown parser as Oddmu uses. So I needed
to write this tool in Go. How hard can it be? It’s a bit harder than
writing it in Perl. Oh, and I needed to parse the RSS file, too. Or use
SQLite to store data. It keeps getting harder.
</p>
<p>
Well, I spent some time on it and now I’m tired again. This too, takes
too long!
</p>
<p>
I feel defeated. Am I too impatient?
</p>
<p>
I should read a book.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Programming">#Programming</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-27</strong>. In an attempt to overcome my sadness, I
decided to spice up my shell life…
</p>
<pre><code># hipster shell
alias ls='echo Using exa instead;exa'
alias du='echo Using dust instead;dust'
alias top='echo Using htop instead;htop'
alias find='echo Using fd instead;fd'
alias grep='echo Using rg instead;rg'
alias files='echo Using yazi instead;yazi'
alias cal='echo Using khal instead;khal'
alias screenshot='grimshot'
alias copy='wl-copy'
alias paste='wl-paste'
</code></pre>
<p>
I set up <code>khal</code> and <code>khard</code> which required me to
set up <code>vdirsyncer</code> to sync the remote calendars (and
contacts) to local copies. This is also good for backup, I guess.
</p>
<p>
Let me know if you know of other such tools.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-29</strong>. I overcame my block and wrote the
bookmarks-to-feed program in Perl:
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bookmark-feed.git">bookmark-feed</a>.
🔖 🤝 <img loading="lazy" src="/pics/rss.svg" alt="RSS" />
</p>
<p>
I installed a daily cron job:
</p>
<pre><code>47  23  *  *   *     /usr/bin/nice /home/alex/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.40.0/bin/bookmark-feed /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*_Bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/*-bookmarks.md /home/alex/alexschroeder.ch/wiki/bookmarks.rss
</code></pre>
<p>
The readable variant is this: <code>bookmark-feed markdown-files…
feed-file</code>. The files it looks at once a day are my
<a href="Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a>. The feed it generates is
<a href="/wiki/bookmarks.rss">bookmarks.rss</a>. The database it uses is
<a href="/wiki/bookmarks.db">bookmarks.db</a>.
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t do expiration from the database but uses only the last 40
items for the feed.
</p>
<p>
When populating the database, all I had was the timestamp of the
Markdown pages, so the existing bookmarks are all relatively unsorted –
they are sorted by the timestamp of the most recent addition to the
whole category, which pretty weird.

<p>There have been some changes both on the hardware and the software
side. The hardware part was quite important yet simple: the current CPU
module has a WiFi chip without any cooling. As the CPU is relatively hod
(at least for the ARM) the WiFi part is hot, too - and it seems to work
bad when hot. So the quick fix is to add a small thermal pad (about 2 mm
thick) so the chip will be connected to the heatsink. The long-term
solution would be to use a cooler CPU.</p>

Twitter broke the API, it was a quick way for me to channel items from
my blog to almost all the people who follow me on the social web. Now it
isn’t even one of the services I use that I can post to with my writing
tool (those are Bluesky, Mastodon, WordPress). None of them are anything
like the aggregator of people that Twitter was, and I can’t even reach
it from my writing tool. I really want to solve this problem, but I
absolutely can’t do this on my own. No time, patience, and it’s not my
job to do all that coding. As observed the other day, my time should be
spent on writing tools for the web and directly related products. This
is the kind of project that should be handled as an open source
thing.</p>
