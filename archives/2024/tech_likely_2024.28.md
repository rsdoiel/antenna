**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If you've lived much at all you know what Joni says is true. I got there when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I'd never see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn't even take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It's why we're playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden's presidency, because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about Biden's flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The problem isn't that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were to win, we'll be right back here in another four years, and at that time we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever happens this year, what's waiting for us is for most of us to wake up from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It's all falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start working together, intelligently, or else it's over.

## It's that time

date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the corruption of American journalism. Most of the time we can turn our attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House, and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the journalists, get away with it again.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the press on our democratic process that I'm pretty depressed about the future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said he'd never do it. If they tried to force him, he'd get a gun and shoot them. This isn't the first time I've heard that, and I called bullshit. You're never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won't do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally -- and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn't believe you are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can't get back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone number). I've been through all these miserable processes. And none of them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where we're headed, again.

## Design and build the next version of OSNews

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

Despite being live since 1997, OSNews has had fairly few redesigns in the grand scheme of things. If my memory serves me correctly, we&#8217;ve had a grand total of 6 designs, and we&#8217;re currently on version 6, introduced about 5 years ago because of unpleasant reasons. It&#8217;s now 2024, and for a variety of reasons, we&#8217;re looking to work towards version 7 of our almost 30 year old website, and we need help. I have a very clear idea of what I want OSNews 7 to be like &#8211; including mockups. The general goals are making the site visually simpler, reducing our dependency on WordPress extensions, and reducing the complexity of our theme and website elements to make it a bit easier for someone like me to change small things without breaking anything. Oh and a dark mode that works. Note that we&#8217;re not looking to change backends or anything like that &#8211; WordPress will stay. If you have the WordPress, design, and developer skills to make something like this a reality, and in the process shape the visual identity of one of the oldest continuously running technology news websites in the world, send me an email.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the <a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an incredible <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a> to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news sites. It's more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the full story. Maybe it was a  mistake calling this a blogroll. I'm trying to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for themselves. In any case I'm thinking about what to do next with FeedLand, which is what's behind the blogroll software. It hasn't lived up to my hopes, and I don't think it's likely to. I may be done writing software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years, between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of writing for others was not a success. So I'm thinking about how to wind down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a bit. It's that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Getting the most out of TWM, X11’s default window manager

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

Graham&#8217;s TWM page has been around for like two decades or so and still isn&#8217;t even remotely as old as TWM itself, and in 2021 they published an updated version with even more information, tips, and tricks for TWM. The Tab Window Manager finds its origins in the lat 1980s, and has been the default window manager for the X Windowing System for a long time, now, too. Yet, few people know it exists &#8211; how many people even know X has a default window manager? &#8211; and even fewer people know you can actually style it, too. OK, so TWM is fairly easy to configure but alot of people, upon seeing the default config, scream &#8216;Ugh, thats awful!&#8217; and head off to the ports tree or their distro sources in search of the latest and greatest uber desktop environment. There are some hardcore TWM fans and mimimalists however who stick around and get to liking the basic feel of TWM. Then they start to mod it and create their own custom dekstop. All part of the fun in Unix :). ↫ Graham&#8217;s TWM page I&#8217;ll admit I have never used TWM properly, and didn&#8217;t know it could be themed at all. I feel very compelled to spend some time with it now, because I&#8217;ve always liked the by-now classic design where the right-click desktop menu serves as the central location for all your interactions with the system. There are quite a few more advanced, up-to-date forks of TWM as well, but the idea of sticking to the actual default X window manager has a certain charm. I almost am too afraid to ask, because the answer on OSNews to these sorts of questions is almost always &#8220;yes&#8221; &#8211; do we have any TWM users in the audience? I&#8217;m extremely curious to find out if TWM actually has a reason to exist at this point, or if, in 2024, it&#8217;s just junk code in the X.org source repository, because I&#8217;m looking at some of these screenshots and I feel a very strong urge to give it a serious go.

## A brief summary of click-to-raise and drag-and-drop interaction on X11 and Wayland

date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News

The goal is to be able to drag an icon from a background window without immediately raising that window and obscuring the drop target window when using the click-to-focus mode. This is a barebones description of what needs to happen. It assumes familiarity with code, protocols, etc. as needed. ↫ Quod Video The articles describes how to get there using both X and Wayland, and it&#8217;s clear there&#8217;s still quite a bit of work to do. At least on my KDE Wayland setups, the way it works now is that when I click to drag an icon from a lower Dolphin window to a higher one, it brings the lower window forward, but then, when I hover for a bit over the other window, it brings it back up. Of course, this only works if the destination window remains at least partially visible, which might not always be the case. For usability&#8217;s sake, there needs to be an option to start a drag operation from one window to the next without altering the Z-order.

## the arc of Hume’s history

date: 2024-07-08, from: Ayjay blog

I’ve been reading David Hume’s massive and magnificent History of England, and it’s generally fascinating — though there are, it must be said, extended passages in which he’s just dutifully relating what his researches have been able to discover about events which are not as well-attested as he would like.

## 2024-07-08 Neufchâtel

<h1 id="2024-07-08-neufchâtel">2024-07-08 Neufchâtel</h1>

<p>We met a friend and went for a walk in the late afternoon: from La Neuveville up the Combe du Pulouvi. I took some flower pictures.</p>

<p>At the new Jeunes Rives. It looked very nice but we did see a big dead fish, belly up. That dampened our enthusiasm somewhat.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-07-neuchatel-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We began our walk around four.</p>

<p>And waterfalls…</p>

## Dear journalism

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn't lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.</p>
<p>What you need to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>We all knew this would happen.</li>
<li>We all saw it happen, we don't need you to tell us.</li>
<li>We're going with him anyway.</li>
</ol>
<p>The plan is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election -- VP Harris steps up.</li>
<li>Now everyone can relax.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak">decloaked</a>, an even bigger story.</p>
<p>BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that they all want Trump to lose? It's logical that they would, but I thought they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous <a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">View From Nowhere</a>. Has that pretense accidentally been dropped?</p>

<p>On Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sarajw@front-end.social/112746718207413752">Sara Joy writes</a>: "Let Biden run. Let Kamala and lots of other younger Dems take on lots of events. Support him from underneath. If and when he falters, the party is there to prop him up, take up the slack, or step in."</p>
<p>I had a similar idea.</p>
<p>Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.</p>
<p>Let all the great next generation democrats shine. </p>
<p>Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.</p>
<p>Joe Biden dials in via satellite.</p>
<p>"Listen, I'm an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren't they wonderful!"</p>
<p>He puts on his robe and slippers, sits in a rocking chair with a dog at his feet and his grandchildren playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">yahtzee</a> and checkers...</p>
<p>And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn't spill his beer, so you know they have his back.</p>
<p>Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Collect them all!</p>
<p>You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.</p>
<p>Some would be very rare.</p>
<p>Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack, Michelle and Bill would have a concert. </p>
<p>Hosted by Mayor Pete!</p>
<p>Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.</p>
<p>Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit. </p>
<p>And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers. </p>
<p>Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and the freedom fighters. </p>
<p>All the heroes of America, standing up for America. </p>
<p>The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course Lynne Cheney.</p>
<p>We don't need no freaking monarch, they all sing.</p>
<p>No we don't! shouts the people. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJBaIUZwmTs&t=43s">On video</a>, the Dead sing "I'm Uncle Sam, how do you do!"</p>
<p>Shake the hand that shook the hand of PT Barnum and Charlie Chan.</p>
<p>We all march together to victory.</p>

<p>I should add that once you have this volume of photos, Apple Photos really shines - for searching events, people, locations, themes, memories;  and also to search text of screenshots and memes.</p>

<p>Two things I just learned:</p><p>- the iCloud storage is in addition to your AppleOne subscription, so I don’t need to buy the 6 TB tier yet, I only have to buy the additional 2TB to extent the 2TB I have from AppleOne.</p><p>- you can share the storage with your family (our family is 5, not sure if Apple Storage is Utah-friendly)</p>

<p>I wonder how your photo library compares to mine?   </p><p>I always loved photos, but taking pictures and videos of the kids took this to another level.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I'm glad Biden is attacking journalists, he has a much bigger voice than I do. If I had his influence I'd be saying the same things, though I wouldn't be as kind. It's time to put the journalists back where they belong, covering news, not trying to run the country.

It's time to stop caring what journalists think.

<p>We were looking after this little guy (the dog, Patches) for the weekend. He and Gidget got along so well! Very happy to sleep in close proximity and be chill. I think Gidget is happy to be the only pet again after Viv returned him home, though 😂</p>
