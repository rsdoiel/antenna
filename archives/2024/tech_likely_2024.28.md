## Microsoft quietly updates official lightweight Windows 11 Validation OS ISOs for 24H2

date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News

Microsoft has again quietly updated its Validation OS ISOs. In case you are not familiar with it, Validation OS is an official lightweight variant of Windows and it is designed for hardware vendors to test, validate and repair hardware defects. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin I had no idea this variant of Windows existed, but it kind of makes sense when you think about it. OEMs or other companies making devices that run or work with Windows may need to test, reboot, test, reboot, and so on, endlessly, and having a lightweight and fast version of Windows that doesn&#8217;t load any junk you don&#8217;t need &#8211; or just loads straight into your company&#8217;s hardware testing application &#8211; is incredibly valuable. According to Microsoft, the Windows Validation OS boots to a command line that allows you to run Win32 applications. This has made me wonder if I can use it for the one thing I am forced to use Windows for: playing League of Legends (I cobbled together a spare parts machine solely for this purpose). My guess is that either the Validation OS will lack certain components or frameworks League of Legends requires, or is so different from regular Windows that it will trip Riot Games&#8217; rootkit, or both. Still, I&#8217;m curious. I might load this up on a spare hard drive and what&#8217;s possible.

## GitHub is starting to feel like legacy software

date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News

The corporate branding, the new “AI-powered developer platform” slogan, makes it clear that what I think of as “GitHub”—the traditional website, what are to me the core features—simply isn’t Microsoft’s priority at this point in time. I know many talented people at GitHub who care, but the company’s priorities just don’t seem to value what I value about the service. This isn’t an anti-AI statement so much as a recognition that the tool I still need to use every day is past its prime. Copilot isn’t navigating the website for me, replacing my need to the website as it exists today. I’ve had tools hit this phase of decline and turn it around, but I’m not optimistic. It’s still plenty usable now, and probably will be for some years to come, but I’ll want to know what other options I have now rather than when things get worse than this. ↫ Misty De Meo Apparently, GitHub is in the middle of a long, drawn-out process where it&#8217;s rewriting its frontend using React. De Meo was trying to use a particular feature of GitHub &#8211; the blame view, which also works through the command line but is apparently much harder to parse there &#8211; and realised the browser search feature just couldn&#8217;t find the line of code they absolutely knew for sure was there. After scrolling for a while, the browser search feature suddenly found the line of code. I’d heard rumblings that GitHub’s in the middle of shipping a frontend rewrite in React, and I realized this must be it. The problem wasn’t that the line I wanted wasn’t on the page—it’s that the whole document wasn’t being rendered at once, so my browser’s builtin search bar just couldn’t find it. On a hunch, I tried disabling JavaScript entirely in the browser, and suddenly it started working again. GitHub is able to send a fully server-side rendered version of the page, which actually works like it should, but doesn’t do so unless JavaScript is completely unavailable. ↫ Misty De Meo Seem like a classic case of people being told to develop something in too little time, with the wrong tools, while management is breathing down their necks and pulling engineers away to work on buzzwords like &#8220;AI&#8221;.

## One hundred

date: 2024-07-14, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>It’s the number of people who have taken a few minutes out of their busy lives to write something on my <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook">guestbook</a>. One hundred doesn’t seem a lot in the grand scheme of things, especially on the web. If you have one hundred followers you might as well have zero. One hundred views on a YouTube video? That’s nothing. You need at least one hundred thousand to be part of the conversation. And yet, I find one hundred signatures in a guestbook to be a lot. Can you imagine having one hundred people in front of you, all saying something to you, one after the other? It would feel overwhelming. The internet has messed up many things, including the sense of scale. But this more humane scale is why I love the personal web. You can still recognise the names of the people who interact with you, you can still remember details about them. I’m grateful for every single one of those one hundred signatures. If yours is one of them, thank you.</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## 2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux

date: 2024-07-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-07-14-yvonand-tour-du-vallon-des-vaux">2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux</h1>

<p>On the last day, we decided to go for a walk nearby instead of getting on the train immediately.
We took the train to Yvonand and turned towards the hills, spending most of our time in the forest.
This is <a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/route-129">route 129</a>.</p>

<p>When leaving the fields around Yvonand and entering the woods, the autobahn arches high above.
If only it were a fantastic train and not a triumph for car culture.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This small rivulet must have cut the canyon.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This bridge marks the beginning of the way up, if I remember.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once you leave the forest, you&rsquo;re on the plateau above.
We ate lunch at the Hotel de Ville in Chavannes-le-Chêne.</p>

<p>Gewöhnliche Wegwarte<br>
Cichorium intybus</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-14-yvonand-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s a weird one from the night before: Apparently the square in front of the castle is bathed in blue light at night, as if a train station bathroom trying to keep drug addicts away.</p>

<p>Somewhat creepy.</p>

The shownotes pages now have a player. Still have a little more work to do on it. I like this because it's a lightweight project, which is something I need while the world is boiling over.

## Morning coffee notes

date: 2024-07-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>BTW, I'm intermittently locked out of my <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa">Threads</a> account. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png">They say</a> it has to do with automated stuff they don't explain. I don't have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network, it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don't see me over there, this is why.</p>
<p>How I found out about Trump's assassination. By accident, I was watching CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to season 6 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty">Line of Duty</a>, which isn't very great. I couldn't focus on the show. I got my iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting that <i>he</i> hadn't been killed, and somehow I knew that "he" was Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his fist, looking right into the camera. He's 100 percent television actor. Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn't cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed killing him. He's thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies about being a victim, really is a victim, and we'll never hear the end of it. And it didn't take long before a random Republican asshole was saying this was Biden's fault for saying Trump would end democracy, which he has said he will, promised to do, and <i>we saw him try to do it</i> on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides. It didn't take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate. This was Biden's fault they all agree. Occam's Razor says this is over. We aren't going to vote in November. The deal is done because the journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I've yet to hear another explanation from them.</p>
<p>If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph, they'd nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That's how our journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the dictator. This is what it's like after that happened. People inside big companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize. Now their malaise becomes ours. </p>
<p>BTW, if Biden steps aside don't expect the Repubs won't sue saying it's illegal, so guess what -- not only don't you get Biden, you don't even get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the arguments already written.</p>

<p>My opinion about yesterday’s assassination as a political tool is that using F-16s to kill 100 Palestinians was unjustifiable.</p><p>The Lancet now puts the death toll in Gaza at about 10% of the population.</p><p>And Gaza having the most children amputees in the world in nine months is depraved.</p>
