<p>If you’ve lived much at all you know what Joni says is true. I got
there when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close
relative that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that
I’d never see her again and found it impossible, but it was true
nonetheless. No way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only
thought after we cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in,
that I didn’t even take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so
used to it being a constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late,
that I was saying goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life.
Forever. It’s why we’re playing such a dangerous game of chicken with
Biden’s presidency, because the stakes are so incredibly high. A
mathematical approach to this problem says imho that everyone should
shut the fuck up about Biden’s flaws and get us organized so we can
handle any eventuality. The problem isn’t that Biden might die, the
problem is that even if he were to win, we’ll be right back here in
another four years, and at that time we will have to grapple with an
even more dire situation. Whatever happens this year, what’s waiting for
us is for most of us to wake up from the dream that there are any
constants in our lives. It’s all falling apart, in every way. The only
thing that matters is we start working together, intelligently, or else
it’s over.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the
corruption of American journalism. Most of the time we can turn our
attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House,
and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the
journalists, get away with it again.

<p>I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the
press on our democratic process that I’m pretty depressed about the
future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who
moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I
asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said
he’d never do it. If they tried to force him, he’d get a gun and shoot
them. This isn’t the first time I’ve heard that, and I called bullshit.
You’re never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won’t
do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath
and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally –
and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a
social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn’t believe you
are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can’t get
back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone
number). I’ve been through all these miserable processes. And none of
them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who
demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where
we’re headed, again.</p>

<p>I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the
<a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an
incredible
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a>
to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news
sites. It’s more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site
updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge
next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the
full story. Maybe it was a mistake calling this a blogroll. I’m trying
to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and
use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for
themselves. In any case I’m thinking about what to do next with
FeedLand, which is what’s behind the blogroll software. It hasn’t lived
up to my hopes, and I don’t think it’s likely to. I may be done writing
software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years,
between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of
writing for others was not a success. So I’m thinking about how to wind
down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using
it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a
bit. It’s that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few
years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span

We met a friend and went for a walk in the late afternoon: from La
Neuveville up the Combe du Pulouvi. I took some flower pictures.

<p>
At the new Jeunes Rives. It looked very nice but we did see a big dead
fish, belly up. That dampened our enthusiasm somewhat.

<p>I have spent the weekend struggling mightily with a new manuscript
and have had little time to study the news. The most notable event from
the day is that in a stunning upset, French voters have rejected members
of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party in legislative
elections. After the first round of votes, National Rally candidates
appeared to be comfortably ahead, but left-wing and centrist candidates
combined forces to prevent splitting the vote, and voters then flooded
the polls to elect the candidates that coalition fielded.</p>

You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn’t
lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.
</p>
<p>
What you need to know:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We all knew this would happen.
</li>
<li>
We all saw it happen, we don’t need you to tell us.
</li>
<li>
We’re going with him anyway.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The plan is this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election – VP
Harris steps up.
</li>
<li>
Now everyone can relax.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak">decloaked</a>, an even
bigger story.

<p>
BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that
they all want Trump to lose? It’s logical that they would, but I thought
they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous

On Mastodon,

Joy writes</a>: “Let Biden run. Let Kamala and lots of other younger
Dems take on lots of events. Support him from underneath. If and when he
falters, the party is there to prop him up, take up the slack, or step
in.”
</p>
<p>
I had a similar idea.
</p>
<p>
Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.
</p>
<p>
Let all the great next generation democrats shine.
</p>
<p>
Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.
</p>
<p>
Joe Biden dials in via satellite.
</p>
<p>
“Listen, I’m an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright
young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren’t
they wonderful!”

He puts on his robe and slippers, sits in a rocking chair with a dog at
his feet and his grandchildren playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">yahtzee</a> and
checkers…
</p>
<p>
And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn’t
spill his beer, so you know they have his back.
</p>
<p>
Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of
the Democratic Party.
</p>
<p>
Collect them all!
</p>
<p>
You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.
</p>
<p>
Some would be very rare.
</p>
<p>
Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack,
Michelle and Bill would have a concert.
</p>
<p>
Hosted by Mayor Pete!
</p>
<p>
Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.
</p>
<p>
Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift
wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit.
</p>
<p>
And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers.
</p>
<p>
Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and
the freedom fighters.
</p>
<p>
All the heroes of America, standing up for America.
</p>
<p>
The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course
Lynne Cheney.
</p>
<p>
We don’t need no freaking monarch, they all sing.
</p>
<p>
No we don’t! shouts the people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJBaIUZwmTs&t=43s">On
video</a>, the Dead sing “I’m Uncle Sam, how do you do!”
</p>
<p>
Shake the hand that shook the hand of PT Barnum and Charlie Chan.
</p>
<p>
We all march together to victory.

glad Biden is attacking journalists, he has a much bigger voice than I
do. If I had his influence I’d be saying the same things, though I
wouldn’t be as kind. It’s time to put the journalists back where they
belong, covering news, not trying to run the country.</p>

for This Moment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: James Fallows, Substack</p>
<p>‘We’ll teach them how to say goodbye.’ A dramatic way for Joe Biden
to demonstrate his strength, and the nation’s. An imagined speech, with
120 days to go until the election.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: Shady Characters blog</p>
<p>
In the second of this mini-series of post-deadline catch-ups
(<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2024/06/miscellany-101/">the
first dealt with punctuation</a>), I’ve collected some links on the
subject of books.

First is a recent exhibition at Harvard’s Houghton Library, called
“<a href="https://library.harvard.edu/exhibits/marks-books">Marks in
Books</a>”, that has, sadly, run its course. But
<a href="https://glammr.us/@overholt/111777818440458959">John
Overholt</a>, a curator of early books and manuscripts at Houghton,
writes to say that the exhibit was adapted from a 1984 exhibition on the
same subject and that
<a href="https://nrs.lib.harvard.edu/urn-3:fhcl.hough:40935393">the
catalogue of that earlier incarnation</a> is available online.

We were looking after this little guy (the dog, Patches) for the
weekend. He and Gidget got along so well! Very happy to sleep in close
proximity and be chill. I think Gidget is happy to be the only pet again
after Viv returned him home, though 😂
