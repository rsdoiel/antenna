you listened to my audio blog posts in the summer of 2004, I recommend
subscribing to the <a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">new
podcast0 feed</a>. I just listened to
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/blogs/gems/crimson1/coffeeNotesJuly11.mp3">the
show</a> from this day 20 years ago. It was quite a throwback, lots of
questions about what I was talking about, I‚Äôve forgotten a lot of it. It
took a full hour to prepare the feed. I can tell this is going to be
quite a flashback experience. Maybe it‚Äôll get me in the mode to do some
serious innovating, because we were on fire and didn‚Äôt know it, in so
many ways, back in the summer of 2004.</p>

<p>
About a week ago, my home Internet (AT&amp;T Fiber) went from the ~1
Gbps I pay for down to about 100 Mbps
(<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/monitor-your-internet-raspberry-pi">see
how I monitor my home Internet with a Pi</a>). It wasn‚Äôt too
inconvenient, and I considered waiting it out to see if the speed
recovered at some point, because latency was fine.
</p>
<p>
But as you can see around 7/7 on that graph, the 100 Mbps went down to
about <em>eight</em>, and that‚Äôs the point where my wife starts noticing
how slow the Internet is. Action level.
</p>
<p>
So I fired up AT&amp;T‚Äôs support chat. I‚Äôm a programmer, I can usually
find ways around the wily ways of chatbots.
</p>
<p>
Except AT&amp;T‚Äôs AI-powered chatbot seems to have a fiendish tendency
to equate ‚ÄòWiFi‚Äô with ‚ÄòInternet‚Äô, no doubt due to so many people
thinking they are one and the same.

<p>Lou asked about people‚Äôs most impactful books. There are so many ways

The way the twitter-alikes do discourse is not the only possible way,
and imho, and, as I‚Äôve said
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/12/17/howSpamWillLikelyEnterTheT.html">before</a>
(in 2007!), most of what passes for discourse on twitter is actually
spam, and that goes for Masto, Threads, Bluesky and Facebook (aka

2024-07-09 Murten
</h1>
<p>
We‚Äôre spending two nights in Murten or Morat. The lake is small with a
circumference of about 25km. <a href="2018-murten/index">A few years
ago</a> we ran around it ‚Äì but today we ran about six or seven
kilometres before turning back. 13km is enough, these days. We‚Äôre both
out of shape, sadly.
</p>
<p>
Just after sunset, looking out over the lake.

<p>

</p>
<p>
Working on a half-enclosed patio until late into the night. There was
drunken shouting to be heard until midnight, on a Monday. I did not know
that this sleepy town was so rowdy!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The town itself looks unchanged from our last visit in 2018.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We ran over to the eastern side of the lake, a protected wetland.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Our destination was this village at the foot of

rather small mountain.

It got rather hot so by the time we arrived in Sugiez, I was so very
tired. My wife took this picture.

<p>
Canals connect the lake of Murten, the lake of Neuch√¢tel and the lake of
Bienne. So many motorboats with proud men and underdressed women going
up and down the channel. üôÑ

<strong>2024-07-10</strong> I was interested in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Morat">Battle of
Morat</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On 22 June 1476, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, laid siege to the
place in an action known as the Battle of Morat. The town hung on for 13
days but finally was saved by the Bernese army. The enemy‚Äôs army was
destroyed completely ‚Äî some 10,000 Burgundians were killed. Since then,
Murten celebrates the victory every year on June 22. ‚Äì

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I was impressed with a black and white image of the battle on the
Wikipedia page but felt it didn‚Äôt have enough resolution. I started
looking for a better scan. e-rara, ‚Äúthe platform for digitized rare
books from Swiss institutions‚Äù has
<a href="https://doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-5076">the book</a>!

In the common room of our place in Murten, I found a very nice
reproduction of an image from the Lucerne Chronicle and took a photo
using my phone.

All these cruelties of war. The guy that climbed a tree and gets
stabbed. The decapitated corpses, some of them stripped naked. The
people hanging from the tree. The soldiers drowning. Ooof!
</p>
<p>
Apparently the
<a href="https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/de/list/one/kol/S0023-2">Lucerne
Chronicles</a> can be found in e-codices, Virtual Manuscript Library of
Switzerland. ‚ÄúThe goal of e-codices is to provide free access to all

of a virtual library.‚Äù The book is in the public domain and yet the site
says <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY NC

</p>
<p>
When I looked at page 107, I didn‚Äôt see the image above, however. Some
more investigation is required.
</p>
<p>
Actually, I did find it! Pages 218‚Äì219 are the ones I was looking for. I
downloaded the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù pages, stitched them together in Gimp, saved them
using 80% quality (üò•) and uploaded them.

<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
I kind of like what Nancy Pelosi is doing.
</p>
<p>
She‚Äôs got a unique role to play, as a master of Washington and national
politics.
</p>
<p>
She stepped down as Democratic leader in the House to let a new
generation lead, yet maintained here position as sort of overseeing and
giving her blessings to how they go forward.
</p>
<p>
She also helped organize the Jan 6 committee, which in the end was the
only real official judgement of Trump on the insurrection before the
election.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt know how she and Biden get along.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs much better to have her leading this discussion than the children
who write the NYT these days. Playing with powerful tools/weapons they
don‚Äôt understand, at best, being manipulated by vicious fascists at
worst.
</p>
<p>
I trust Pelosi in this situation, we‚Äôre lucky to have her.

<p>
The Blast-RADIUS attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker between the
RADIUS client and server to forge a valid protocol accept message in
response to a failed authentication request. This forgery could give the
attacker access to network devices and services without the attacker
guessing or brute forcing passwords or shared secrets. The attacker does
not learn user credentials.

</p>
<p>
After a break since June 20, we now resume my original ‚Äúaudio blog‚Äù from
the summer of 2004, twenty years ago.
</p>
<p>
I was just beginning to figure out how this new medium worked, and
rather than record my own thoughts, as with the previous two episodes, I
published audio from another source, my meditation teacher, Jeru Kabbal.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the next episode, tomorrow, an interview with Steve
Gillmor, one of the earliest podcast pioneers ‚Äì we‚Äôll have an original
audio blog post. That‚Äôs when the pulse really starts.

I‚Äôve been making mistakes in 2024 on almost every episode. This time I
got the title wrong, it‚Äôs Sunrise of the Soul. Rather than change it,
and take a chance of the episode showing up twice in some podcast
clients, I‚Äôm just leaving it as-is. Trying to get a feel for how most of
the clients work. Do they refresh posts, if the descriptions change (as
this one is)? I don‚Äôt know.
</p>
<p>
Do the clients strip out the HTML or do they support some of it? I
wonder if links make it through to most clients?

don‚Äôt live in Queensland, so we can still name our baby ‚ÄúDown With

<p><img src="https://www.jayeless.net/media/2024/07/naming-rules.png" alt="Restrictions on Baby Names: To protect children against careless and harmful names, the government had set out rules in registering baby names in Australia. The rules state that a child‚Äôs name must: not be obscene or offensive or contrary to public interest; (no racial slurs or infringements on the rights of another; be short and easy to write (In NSW, under 50 characters); not include symbols without phonetic significance such as N@talie, Da!sy, J#ke) or use numerals; not include or resemble an official title or military rank recognised in Australia such as King, Lady, Father, Prince, Sir or Admiral.√Ç  This was after a law was passed sometime in 1995 prohibiting the use of titles as part of the baby‚Äôs given name. use English letters only; not be similar to a recognised body, organisation or trademark; and In Queensland, the name can‚Äôt include a statement, like Save Mother Earth or Down with Capitalism."></p>

it is a problem, but no one has the ability to build a consensus among
voters. I think it‚Äôs possible to put together an online version of the
Democratic Party, something that never goes away, is available to rally
the electorate at any moment. That‚Äôs the way to neutralize the power of

Wikipedia has a pretty good history of the early days of the

Window System</a>. In
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/x-window-system-at-40.html"><i>The
X Window System At 40</i></a> I detailed my contributions to the early
development of X. To my amazement 40 years after Bob Scheifler‚Äôs initial
release it is still valiantly resisting obsolescence. I contributed to
the design, implementation, testing, release engineering and
documentation of X11 starting a bit over 39 years ago. At least my
design for how X handles keyboards is still the way it works.<br />
<br /> All this while I was also working on a competitor, Sun‚Äôs NeWS ‚Äî
which didn‚Äôt survive the test of time.<br />
<h3>
Nearly Three-and-a-Half Decades
</h3>
One of the things I really enjoyed about working on NeWS was that the
PostScript environment it implemented was object-oriented, a legacy of
PostScript‚Äôs origins at Xerox PARC. Owen Densmore and I developed
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.1987.tb00537.x"><i>A
User‚ÄêInterface Toolkit in Object‚ÄêOriented PostScript</i></a> that made
developing NeWS applications very easy, provided you were comfortable
with an object-oriented programming paradigm.<br /> <br /> I think it
was sometime in 1988 while working on the SunOS 4.0 kernel that I
realized that the BSD Vnode interface was in a loose sense
object-oriented. It defines the interface between the file system and
the rest of the kernel. An instance of BSD‚Äôs type <tt>vnode</tt>
consisted of some instance data and a pointer to an ‚Äúops vector‚Äù that
defined its class via an array of methods (function pointers). But it
wasn‚Äôt object-oriented enough to, for example, implement inheritance
properly.<br /> <br /> This flaw had led to some inelegancies as the
interface had evolved through time, but what interested me more was the
potential applications that would be unleashed if the interface could be
made properly object-oriented. Instead of being implemented from
scratch, file systems could be implemented by sub-classing other file
systems. For example, a read-only file system such as a CD-ROM could be
made writable by ‚Äústacking‚Äù a cache file system on top, as shown in
Figure 11. I immediately saw the possibility of significant improvements
in system administration that could flow from stacking file
systems.<br /> <br />

I started building a prototype by performing major surgery on a copy of
the code that would become SunOS 4.1. By late 1989 it worked well enough
to demonstrate the potential of the idea, so I published 1990‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/StackingVnodes.pdf"><i>Evolving
the Vnode Interface</i></a>. The paper describes a number of Vnode
modules that can be stacked together to implement interesting functions.
Among them was cache-fs, which layered a writable local file system
above a local or remote read-only file system:<br />
<blockquote>
This simple module can use any file system as a file-level cache for any
other (read-only) file system. It has no knowledge of the file systems
it is using; it sees them only via their opaque vnodes. Figure 11 shows
it using a local writable ufs file system to cache a remote read-only
NFS file system, thereby reducing the load on the server. Another
possible configuration would be to use a local writable ufs file system
to cache a CD-ROM, obscuring the speed penalty of CD.
</blockquote>
Over the next quarter-century the idea of stacking vnodes and the
related idea of ‚Äúunion mounts‚Äù from
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/compsystems/1995/sum_pike.pdf">Rob
Pike and Plan 9</a> churned around until, in October 2014,
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e9be9d5e76e34872f0c37d72e25bc27fe9e2c54c">Linus
Torvalds added overlayfs to the 3.18 kernel</a>. I covered the details
of this history in 2015‚Äôs
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/02/it-takes-longer-than-it-takes.html"><i>It
takes longer than it takes</i></a>. In it I quoted from Valerie Aurora‚Äôs
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324291/">excellent</a>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/325369/">series</a> of
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327738/">articles</a> about the
architectural and implementation difficulties involved in adding union
mounts to the Linux kernel. I concurred with her statement that:<br />
<blockquote>
The consensus at the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327601/">2009
Linux file systems workshop</a> was that stackable file systems are
conceptually elegant, but difficult or impossible to implement in a
maintainable manner with the current VFS structure. My own experience
writing a stacked file system (an in-kernel chunkfs prototype) leads me
to agree with these criticisms.
</blockquote>
I
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/02/it-takes-longer-than-it-takes.html">wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Note that my original paper was only incidentally about union mounts, it
was a critique of the then-current VFS structure, and a suggestion that
stackable vnodes might be a better way to go. It was such a seductive
suggestion that it took nearly two decades to refute it!
</blockquote>
Nevertheless, the example I used in
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/StackingVnodes.pdf"><i>Evolving
the Vnode Interface</i></a> of a use for stacking vnodes was what
persisted. It took a while for the fact that overlayfs was an official
part of the Linux kernel to percolate through the ecosystem, but after
six years I was able to write
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/12/blatant-self-promotion.html#more"><i>Blatant
Self-Promotion</i></a> about the transformation it wrought on Linux‚Äôs
packaging and software distribution, inspired by Liam Proven‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/03/nixos_linux_os_design/"><i>NixOS
and the changing face of Linux operating systems</i></a>. He writes
about less radical ideas than NixOS:<br />
<blockquote>
So, instead of re-architecting the way distros are built, vendors are
reimplementing similar functionality using simpler tools inherited from
the server world: containers, squashfs filesystems inside single files,
and, for distros that have them, copy-on-write filesystems to provide
rollback functionality.<br /> <br /> The goal is to build operating
systems as robust as mobile OSes: periodically, the vendor ships a
thoroughly tested and integrated image which end users can‚Äôt change and
don‚Äôt need to. In normal use, the root filesystem is mounted read-only,
and there‚Äôs no package manager.
</blockquote>
Since then this model has become universal. Distros ship as a bootable
ISO image, which uses overlayfs to mount a writable temporary file
system on top. This is precisely how my 1989 prototype was intended to
ship SunOS 4.1. The technology has spread to individual applications
with systems such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)">Snaps</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpak">Flatpak</a>.<br />
<h3>
Three Decades
</h3>
The opportunity we saw when we started Nvidia was that the PC was
transitioning from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Standard_Architecture">ISA
bus</a> to version 1 of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect">PCI
bus</a>. The ISA bus‚Äô bandwidth was completely inadequate for 3D games,
but the PCI bus had considerably more. Whether it was enough was an open
question. We clearly needed to make the best possible use of the limited
bandwidth we could get.<br /> <br /> Nvidia‚Äôs first chip had three key
innovations:<br />
<ol>
<li>
Rendering objects with quadric patches not triangles. A realistic model
using quadric patches needed perehaps a fifth of the data for an
equivalent triangle model.
</li>
<li>
I/O virtualization with applications using a write-mostly,
object-oriented interface. Read operations are neccessarily synchronous,
whereas write operations are asynchronous. Thus the more writes per read
across sthe bus, the better the utilization of the available bus
bandwidth.
</li>
<li>
A modular internal architecture based on an on-chip token-ring network.
Thie goal was that each functional unit be simple enough to be designed
and tested by a three-person team.

The first two of these enabled us to get Sega‚Äôs arcade games running at
full frame rate on a PC. Curtis Priem and I designed the second of
these, and it is the one that has lasted:<br />
<ul>
<li>
I/O virtualization allowed multiple processes direct access to the
graphics hardware, with no need to pass operations through the operating
system. I explained the importance of this a decade ago in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/hardware-io-virtualization.html"><i>Hardware
I/O Virtualization</i></a>, using the example of Amazon building their
own network interface cards. Tne first chip appeared on the bus as
having 128 wide FIFOs. The operating system could map one of them into
each process wanting access to the chip, allowing applications direct
access to the hardware but under the control of the operating system.
</li>
<li>
The interface was write-mostly because the application could read from
the FIFO the number of free slots, that is the number of writes before
the bus would stall.
</li>
<li>
The interface was object-oriented because the data and the offset in the
FIFO formed an invocation of a method on an instance of a (virtual)
class. Some classes were implemented in hardware, others trapped into
the kernel and were implemented by the driver, but the application just
created and used instances of the available classes without knowing
which was which. The classes were arranged in a hierarchy starting with
class CLASS. Enumerating the instances of class CLASS told the
application which classes it could use. Enumerating the instances of
each of those classes told the application how many of each type of
resource it could use.
</li>
</ul>
The importance of the last of these was that it decoupled the hardware
and software release schedules. Drivers could emulate classes that had
yet to appear in hardware, the applications would use the hardware once
it was available. Old software would run on newer hardware, it would
just see some classes it didn‚Äôt know how to use. One of our frustrations
with Sun was the way software and hardware release schedules were
inextricably interlinked.<br />

changing libraries role from purchasing a copy of the journal to renting

built the prototype, and after using it to demonstrate the feasibility
of the concept, also used it to show vulnerabilities in the initial
protocol. In 2003 I was part of the team that solved these problems, for
which we were awarded the Best Paper award at the Symposium on Operating

Tuesday I look for Jon Stewart‚Äôs opening for the Daily Show on YouTube.
It‚Äôs always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he
says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing
President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the
people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice.
</p>
<p>
If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized
after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There‚Äôs never
been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on
organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue
about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren‚Äôt any
smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that‚Äôs been the
real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we‚Äôve gotten the
tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And
now we‚Äôre at the last moment before it‚Äôs all flushed away and the NYT et
al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less.
</p>
<p>
Be warned I get really angry at the end and raise my voice. I don‚Äôt
think I‚Äôve ever done that in a podcast, and I‚Äôm not sure I like it. But

We spent two nights in Neuenburg or Neuch√¢tel. They came under Prussian
control in 1707 because the locals were looking for a government that
was far away and wouldn‚Äôt meddle in their affairs. It became a republic
and a canton of Switzerland in 1848.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the death in 1707 of Marie d‚ÄôOrleans-Longueville, duchess de Nemours
and Princess of Neuch√¢tel, the people had to choose her successor from
among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince first and foremost
to be a Protestant, and also to be strong enough to protect their
territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices.
Louis XIV actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but
the Neuch√¢telois people passed them over in favour of King Frederick I
of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion
through the Houses of Orange and Nassau. With the requisite stability
assured, Neuch√¢tel entered its golden age, with commerce and industry
(including watchmaking and lace) and banking undergoing steady
expansion. ‚Äì

<p>On July 9, 1868, Americans changed the U.S. Constitution for the
fourteenth time, adapting our foundational document to construct a new
nation without systematic Black enslavement. In 1865 the Thirteenth
Amendment to the Constitution had prohibited slavery on the basis of
race, but it did not prevent the establishment of a system in which
Black Americans continued to be unequal. Backed by President Andrew
Johnson, who had taken over the presidency after actor John Wilkes Booth
had murdered President Abraham Lincoln, white southern Democrats had
done their best to push their Black neighbors back into subservience. So
long as southern states had abolished enslavement, repudiated
Confederate debts, and nullified the ordinances of secession, Johnson
was happy to readmit them to full standing in the Union, still led by
the very men who had organized the Confederacy and made war on the
United States.</p>

Guys, we have one of those Brother printers that are supposed to be so
solid and reliable, but it is not cooperating today. Keeps sending
itself to sleep mid-job and ‚Äúgoing offline‚Äù so I have to physically walk
to it and turn it back on. ‚ÄúPrinting‚Äù blank pages. When told to print a
three-page document (ONCE), it prints TWO copies of page 1 &amp; 2 then
skips page 3. That ‚Äújust buy this Brother printer everyone has, it‚Äôs
fine‚Äù article lied to me.

Wordle Kitty has become the Editor in Chief of the NY Times! That‚Äôs
pretty cool right. But she‚Äôs still cute. And she‚Äôs working late tonight,
trying to come up with the perfect cover story. She figured it out! She
put a picture of herself on the front page, with a huge headline saying
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs great!‚Äù In the picture she‚Äôs smart and cute and really adorable,
and she‚Äôs smiling and wearing a button that says ‚ÄúHi Mom!‚Äù

<h1 id="2024-06-28-connecting-the-laptop-to-the-server-via-nncp">
2024-06-28 Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP
</h1>
<p>
First, install the <code>nncp</code> package on both systems. In
addition to that, install the <code>openbsd-inetd</code> package on the
server. (In the following passages, I‚Äôm connected as <code>root</code>
to the server.)
</p>
<p>
Generate new configs on the systems that are missing
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>
<p>
Examine the file using a text editor. Each system needs to know the
public keys of the other.
</p>
<p>
So, on the laptop, I need to add to add the public keys of the server. I
also want to specify that I‚Äôm going to call the node on a regular basis
and that files sent to me from that node should be saved in my
‚Äúincoming‚Äù directory. I also want to accept mail.
</p>
<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/sibirocobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;12 * * * *&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
And on the server, I need to add the public keys of the laptop. I also
want to save incoming files from the laptop. And I want to accept mail.
</p>
<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
Note how the laptop calls the server but the server does not call the
laptop!
</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs make sure those directories exist:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/incoming
ssh sibirocobombus mkdir incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Let‚Äôs create a file and send it from the laptop to the server using
<code>nncp-file</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>echo Hello &gt; hello.txt
sudo -u nncp nncp-file hello.txt sibirocobombus:
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the log using <code>nncp-log</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log | tail -n 1
2024-06-28T21:36:02Z File hello.txt (282 B) is sent to sibirocobombus:hello.txt
</code></pre>
<p>
Let‚Äôs connect to the server and check:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Nothing has arrived!
</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs call the server using <code>nncp-call</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:07:36Z ERROR Calling sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): dial tcp [2a02:418:6a04:178:209:50:237:1]:5400: connect: connection refused
</code></pre>
<p>
Oops. It‚Äôs not running? That‚Äôs right, I need to run
<code>nncp-daemon</code> on the server side.
</p>
<p>
Add the following to <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> on the server to
accept NNCP connections on port 5400:
</p>
<pre><code>5400 stream  tcp nowait  nncp    /usr/local/bin/nncp-daemon  nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>
<p>
Reload it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload openbsd-inetd
</code></pre>
<p>
Try again on the laptop:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z We have got for sibirocobombus: 1 packets, 486 B

</code></pre>
<p>
Back to the server:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log

</code></pre>
<p>
Strange! That id listed there matches my laptop‚Äôs <code>noisepub</code>.
Checking the <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> on the server again, I see
that pasted the wrong pubkeys‚Ä¶ ü§¶ Fix that and try again‚Ä¶
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus

<p>
Looking good! Check for the file on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
It‚Äôs not there!
</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs investigate on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log

</code></pre>
<p>
This looks good, so we have the packet! And we can confirm this using
<code>nncp-stat</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-stat

</code></pre>
<p>
What needs to happen now is ‚Äútossing‚Äù using <code>nncp-toss</code>. This
is, ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù the packet and thereby delivering it.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-toss

<p>
That‚Äôs right, the incoming file should be writable by more people‚Ä¶
</p>
<pre><code>chgrp nncp /home/alex/incoming

<p>
Try again!
</p>

<p>
ü•≥
</p>
<p>
I need to think about
<a href="https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/Administration.html">admin
issues</a>, clearly.
</p>
<p>
I need to set up regular <code>nncp-call</code> on the laptop; I need to
set up regular <code>nncp-toss</code> on the server.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice to switch from <code>inetd</code> to
<code>systemd</code> perhaps? Surely they have written a replacement for
it. They have written replacements for everything! üò¨

you‚Äôve lived much at all you know what Joni says is true. I got there
when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative
that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I‚Äôd never
see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No
way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we
cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn‚Äôt even
take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a
constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying
goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It‚Äôs why we‚Äôre
playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden‚Äôs presidency,
because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to
this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about
Biden‚Äôs flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The
problem isn‚Äôt that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were
to win, we‚Äôll be right back here in another four years, and at that time
we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever
happens this year, what‚Äôs waiting for us is for most of us to wake up
from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It‚Äôs all
falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start
working together, intelligently, or else it‚Äôs over.</p>

This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the
corruption of American journalism. Most of the time we can turn our
attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House,
and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the
journalists, get away with it again.

<p>I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the
press on our democratic process that I‚Äôm pretty depressed about the
future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who
moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I
asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said
he‚Äôd never do it. If they tried to force him, he‚Äôd get a gun and shoot
them. This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve heard that, and I called bullshit.
You‚Äôre never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won‚Äôt
do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath
and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally ‚Äì
and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a

<p>I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the
<a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an
incredible
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a>
to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news
sites. It‚Äôs more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site
updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge
next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the
full story. Maybe it was a mistake calling this a blogroll. I‚Äôm trying
to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and
use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for
themselves. In any case I‚Äôm thinking about what to do next with
FeedLand, which is what‚Äôs behind the blogroll software. It hasn‚Äôt lived
up to my hopes, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely to. I may be done writing
software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years,
between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of
writing for others was not a success. So I‚Äôm thinking about how to wind
down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using
it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a
bit. It‚Äôs that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few
years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span

<p>I have spent the weekend struggling mightily with a new manuscript
and have had little time to study the news. The most notable event from
the day is that in a stunning upset, French voters have rejected members
of Marine Le Pen‚Äôs far-right National Rally party in legislative
elections. After the first round of votes, National Rally candidates
appeared to be comfortably ahead, but left-wing and centrist candidates
combined forces to prevent splitting the vote, and voters then flooded
the polls to elect the candidates that coalition fielded.</p>

You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn‚Äôt
lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.
</p>
<p>
What you need to know:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We all knew this would happen.
</li>
<li>
We all saw it happen, we don‚Äôt need you to tell us.
</li>
<li>
We‚Äôre going with him anyway.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The plan is this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election ‚Äì VP
Harris steps up.
</li>
<li>
Now everyone can relax.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak">decloaked</a>, an even
bigger story.

BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that
they all want Trump to lose? It‚Äôs logical that they would, but I thought
they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous
