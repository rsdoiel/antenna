Conversations: Secretary of State Antony Blinken</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-12, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>On February 4, 2021, in a speech at the State Department, President
Joe Biden talked about the importance of diplomacy and the different
actions he had taken in the two weeks since taking office. Then he said:
“There’s no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy.
Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American
working families in mind. Advancing a foreign policy for the middle
class demands urgent focus on our domestic…economic renewal.”</p>

<h1 id="2024-07-12-sending-files-via-nncp">
2024-07-12 Sending files via NNCP
</h1>
<p>
Let’s assume that you want to send me a file via NNCP. What do you need
to do?
</p>
<p>
You need to add my server to your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file, in
the <code>neigh</code> section.
</p>
<p>
In the following examples, you want to change “alex” to your own
username.
</p>
<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       CCAIPFSAZWYICBQ5BIURX4UMEJIXVSZFIING7HRUFTDOFV5XISVQ
      exchpub:  NGEIDPDVZ2I6CTRKCBT734VV4W2YFVTV6YFBU5UGB6IHBA3QDJUQ
      signpub:  VXBMWXS74IGAYQCLJY4UPAXXQXPT3K53QI5XCFHOAKL4I2FQNLKQ
      noisepub: MGGBAOHRHEWEC6CGT47GA2DOQXQFZUAKJ66PD734Y5WNWP364UXQ
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/sibirocobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        rsmtp: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;, &quot;-bS&quot;]
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;12 * * * *&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
What does it mean?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you know how to contact my server via the <code>.addrs.internet</code>
key – you need this, but you can specify <code>campaignwiki.org</code>
instead, if your prefer
</li>
<li>
you allow my server to save incoming files in a directory via the
<code>.incoming</code> key – you only need this if you want to receive
files (the directory must exist and the <code>nncp</code> group must be
allowed to write to it)
</li>
<li>
you allow my server to send mail to local users via the
<code>.exec.rsmtp</code> key – this is not necessary if you don’t want
to receive mail
</li>
<li>
you connect to my server every now and then via the
<code>calls[0].cron</code> entry – this is not necessary if you don’t
mind using <code>nncp-call</code> every now and then
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that my server allows sending mail but doesn’t have an “incoming”
directory. Basically, you need to get the public keys for my laptop from
me, and set that up as well.
</p>
<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       R23WEIHB52TMA4EKGJPKUDBFSYP2HG4HHW2HGJ3RJATCCRLYDUZQ

      via:      [&quot;sibirocobombus&quot;]
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/melanobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        rsmtp:  [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;, &quot;-bS&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
What does it mean?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you know how to contact my laptop via my server using the
<code>.via[0]</code> key – you need this and the name needs to match the
name you used for my server
</li>
<li>
you allow the laptop to save incoming files in a directory via the
<code>.incoming</code> key – you only need this if you want to receive
files (the directory must exist and the <code>nncp</code> group must be
allowed to write to it)
</li>
<li>
you allow the laptop to send mail to local users via the
<code>.exec.rsmtp</code> key – this is not necessary if you don’t want
to receive mail
</li>
</ol>
<p>
You also need to send me two things:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
your system’s public keys so that I can set up similar entries on my
laptop and my server
</li>
<li>
your system’s internet address – unless only you can call my server
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If your system doesn’t have a public internet address, no problem. My
server will enqueue stuff for your system without ever sending it. It
will wait for you there until your system calls. You would do this as
follows:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
Now, to send me a README file, you’d run:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-file README melanobombus:
2024-07-12T18:12:15Z Tx README 486 B/486 B 100% (73 KiB/sec)
2024-07-12T18:12:15Z File README (282 B) is sent to melanobombus:README
</code></pre>
<p>
At this point, the file is in the queue.
</p>
<p>
You need to <code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus</code> to
actually send the files unless you have set up regular calls via the
<code>calls[0].cron</code> key in your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>. My
server will receive the packets encrypted and addressed to my laptop and
enqueue it again. The next time my laptop calls my server, it’ll get
them.
</p>
<p>
You probably want to let me know about the channel via another channel,
be it IRC, regular mail – or mail via NNCP!

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In 1994, Hewlett-Packard released a miracle machine: the HP 200LX
pocket-size PC. In the depths of the device, among the MS-DOS
productivity apps built into its fixed memory, there lurked a
first-person maze game called <i>Lair of Squid</i>.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
In <i>Lair of Squid</i>, you’re trapped in an underwater labyrinth,
seeking a way out while avoiding squid roaming the corridors. A
collision with any cephalopod results in death. To progress through each
stage and ascend to the surface, you locate the exit and provide a
hidden, scrambled code word. The password is initially displayed as
asterisks, with letters revealed as you encounter them within the maze.

Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP</h2>

<h1 id="2024-06-28-connecting-the-laptop-to-the-server-via-nncp">
2024-06-28 Connecting the laptop to the server via NNCP
</h1>
<p>
First, install the <code>nncp</code> package on both systems. In
addition to that, install the <code>openbsd-inetd</code> package on the
server. (In the following passages, I’m connected as <code>root</code>
to the server.)
</p>
<p>
Generate new configs on the systems that are missing
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>
<p>
Examine the file using a text editor. Each system needs to know the
public keys of the other.
</p>
<p>
So, on the laptop, I need to add to add the public keys of the server. I
also want to specify that I’m going to call the node on a regular basis
and that files sent to me from that node should be saved in my
“incoming” directory. I also want to accept mail.
</p>
<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/sibirocobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;12 * * * *&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
And on the server, I need to add the public keys of the laptop. I also
want to save incoming files from the laptop. And I want to accept mail.
</p>
<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
Note how the laptop calls the server but the server does not call the
laptop!
</p>
<p>
Let’s make sure those directories exist:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/incoming
ssh sibirocobombus mkdir incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s create a file and send it from the laptop to the server using
<code>nncp-file</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>echo Hello &gt; hello.txt
sudo -u nncp nncp-file hello.txt sibirocobombus:
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the log using <code>nncp-log</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log | tail -n 1
2024-06-28T21:36:02Z File hello.txt (282 B) is sent to sibirocobombus:hello.txt
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s connect to the server and check:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Nothing has arrived!
</p>
<p>
Let’s call the server using <code>nncp-call</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:07:36Z ERROR Calling sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): dial tcp [2a02:418:6a04:178:209:50:237:1]:5400: connect: connection refused
</code></pre>
<p>
Oops. It’s not running? That’s right, I need to run
<code>nncp-daemon</code> on the server side.
</p>
<p>
Add the following to <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> on the server to
accept NNCP connections on port 5400:
</p>
<pre><code>5400 stream  tcp nowait  nncp    /usr/bin/nncp-daemon    nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>
<p>
Reload it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload openbsd-inetd
</code></pre>
<p>
Try again on the laptop:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z We have got for sibirocobombus: 1 packets, 486 B
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z ERROR SP with sibirocobombus (nice MAX): reading: EOF
2024-06-28T22:14:13Z ERROR Connection to sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): EOF
</code></pre>
<p>
Back to the server:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log
2024-06-28T22:15:25Z ERROR SP nice MAX: waiting for first message: unknown peer: ...
2024-06-28T22:15:25Z Connected to unknown
</code></pre>
<p>
Strange! That id listed there matches my laptop’s <code>noisepub</code>.
Checking the <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> on the server again, I see
that pasted the wrong pubkeys… 🤦 Fix that and try again…
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:19:31Z We have got for sibirocobombus: 1 packets, 486 B

</code></pre>
<p>
Looking good! Check for the file on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s not there!
</p>
<p>
Let’s investigate on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log
2024-06-28T22:19:31Z Packet QAROTFMX25ZPQOT5DEQQC7JE7EN3UD2FZIJNI6JKH75EC2DMSSZQ (486 B) (nice B): 0%
2024-06-28T22:19:31Z melanobombus has got for us: 1 packets, 486 B

</code></pre>
<p>
This looks good, so we have the packet! And we can confirm this using
<code>nncp-stat</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-stat

    nice:   B | Rx:      486 B,   1 pkts | Tx:        0 B,   0 pkts
self
</code></pre>
<p>
What needs to happen now is “tossing” using <code>nncp-toss</code>. This
is, “processing” the packet and thereby delivering it.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-toss
2024-06-28T22:24:28Z ERROR Tossing file melanobombus/QAROTFMX25ZPQOT5DEQQC7JE7EN3UD2FZIJNI6JKH75EC2DMSSZQ (6 B): hello.txt: mktemp: open /home/alex/incoming/nncpfile17dd4b56c39f64d4: permission denied
</code></pre>
<p>
That’s right, the incoming file should be writable by more people…
</p>
<pre><code>chgrp nncp /home/alex/incoming
chmod g+w /home/alex/incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Try again!
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-toss

</code></pre>
<p>
It worked:
</p>
<pre><code>ls -l /home/alex/incoming/
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 nncp nncp 6 29. Jun 00:26 hello.txt

cat /home/alex/incoming/hello.txt 
Hello
</code></pre>
<p>
🥳
</p>
<p>
I need to think about
<a href="https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/Administration.html">admin
issues</a>, clearly.
</p>
<p>
I need to set up regular <code>nncp-call</code> on the laptop; I need to
set up regular <code>nncp-toss</code> on the server.
</p>
<p>
It would be nice to switch from <code>inetd</code> to
<code>systemd</code> perhaps? Surely they have written a replacement for
it. They have written replacements for everything! 😬

<p>date: 2024-07-12, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Why journalists don’t bother trying to take Trump down, but do with the
Democrat.
</p>
<p>
Simple. Trump has routed around journalism as we have begged the Dems to
by going direct to the people.
</p>
<p>
The journos have no power over Trump and they know it.
</p>
<p>
They have total power over the Dems, and they know that too.
</p>
<p>
If by some miracle the journos let us (voters) determine the president,
we must <i>never</i> let them have this power again.

<h2 id="from-vallorbe-to-orbe">2024-07-12 From Vallorbe to Orbe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-12, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-12-from-vallorbe-to-orbe">
2024-07-12 From Vallorbe to Orbe
</h1>
<p>
We walked and ran from Vallorbe to Orbe, through the
<a href="https://yverdonlesbainsregion.ch/en/itineraire/the-gorge-of-orbe/">Gorge
of Orbe</a>, nearly 17km. Both my wife and I took some pictures along
the way.
</p>
<p>
When we left Vallorbe, the river was calm and slow. There were a lot of
flowers.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The yellow flowers in the foreground:
</p>
<p>
Tüpfel-Hartheu<br> Hypericum perforatum
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-18.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
In the other direction, the railway bridge can be seen.
</p>
<p>
Schmalblättriges Weidenröschen<br> Epilobium angustifolium
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-17.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, there is a pedestrian passage beneath the railway.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And here we’re underneath one of these arches, looking back at Vallorbe.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Later, the gorge got a lot narrower. We crossed over the river just for
bit because there was a nice lookout on the other side. Two friendly
teenagers took pictures of us.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The water was pretty turbulent up here. We’re just above the falls of
the Day, though: Le Saut du Day. The small lookout is built right there,
overlooking the falls.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-19.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We walked down along the falls and noticed some weird constructions on
the other side.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-23.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And on our side, there was this foreboding entrance. As it turns out,
however, it leads into a passage underneath the waterfall!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-21.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The sign had an explanation of how there used to be a hydro power plant
here. The electricity was used to create explosives. When the canton
gave itself the electricity monopoly, the chemical plant was forced to
buy the electricity at regular prices and since those were 4–5 times as
much, the chemical plant was forced to close down.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-22.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We continued on our way, with one last look back.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-30.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Down below the river was calm again.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-24.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The occasional steps are there to break the speed of the flow, I guess?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-8.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The trail started climbing up and down along the river. When the cliffs
were to risky to navigate, they had drilled small tunnels. Using
explosives, I presume.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-9.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We saw many nice flowers along the way.
</p>
<p>
Further up, along some meadows:
</p>
<p>
Dornige Hauhechel (Artengruppe)<br> Ononis spinosa agg.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-27.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Fuchsschwanz-Klee<br> Trifolium rubens
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-28.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Deeper in the shade of the trees:
</p>
<p>
Nesselblättrige Glockenblume<br> Campanula trachelium
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-29.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
At one point there was a very cool draft coming out of the bushes above
us and we found an entrance to a big tunnel! It had warning signs for
speleologists, particularly regarding heat and noise – because of the
bats that like to sleep and hibernate in here. We didn’t see any bats in
our 4–5m delve, however. The floor was very wet.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-25.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-26.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Later, we came upon the pressurized water pipes that still feed a hydro
power plant. These pipes are huge!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-10.jpg" alt="" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Before arriving at Orbe, there was another lake and more dams.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-12.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And finally, Orbe. An old town with houses and small gardens.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-13.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The main road of Orbe.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-16.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And tiny back-alleys with occasional connections for the upper floors.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-11-vallorbe-14.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
A great view over the flat lands. Incidentally, the remaining distance
to Yverdon-les-bains where our hotel is, doesn’t make for great running
in the summer heat. Also we were dead tired! 😅

<h2 id="the-nsa-has-a-long-lost-lecture-by-adm.-grace-hopper">The NSA
Has a Long-Lost Lecture by Adm. Grace Hopper</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-12, updated: 2024-07-11, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
The NSA has a video recording of a 1982 lecture by Adm. Grace Hopper
titled “Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People.” The
agency is (so far)
<a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/jul/10/grace-hopper-lost-lecture-found-nsa/">refusing</a>
to release it.
</p>
<p>
Basically, the recording is in an obscure video format. People at the
NSA can’t easily watch it, so they can’t redact it. So they won’t do
anything.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
With digital obsolescence threatening many early technological formats,
the dilemma surrounding Admiral Hopper’s lecture underscores the
critical need for and challenge of digital preservation. This challenge
transcends the confines of NSA’s operational scope. It is our shared
obligation to safeguard such pivotal elements of our nation’s history,
ensuring they remain within reach of future generations. While the
stewardship of these recordings may extend beyond the NSA’s typical
purview, they are undeniably a part of America’s national heritage…

<h2 id="exim-config-for-uucp-nncp-and-msmtp">2024-07-11 Exim config for
UUCP, NNCP and MSMTP</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-12, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-11-exim-config-for-uucp-nncp-and-msmtp">
2024-07-11 Exim config for UUCP, NNCP and MSMTP
</h1>
<p>
My laptop doesn’t have a static IP number. My mail service provider is
not a smart host for my laptop. That’s why I’ve been using
<code>msmtp</code> to send email from the command line.
</p>
<p>
My <code>~/.mailrc</code> used to contain the following:
</p>
<pre><code>set sendmail=&quot;/usr/bin/msmtp&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
I removed this line because I want to send mails by UUCP or NNCP,
depending on the domain used. It is only when none of these work that I
want to fall back to <code>msmtp</code>.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, I need to add something to my <code>exim</code> configuration.
When reading the <code>exim</code> config, it’s important to understand
that all the additions come in pairs: a router and a transport.
</p>
<p>
I use Debian.
</p>
<h2 id="mail-and-ed">
mail and ed
</h2>
<p>
I use <code>mail</code> to read mail and <code>ed</code> to write mail.
At least when I’m doing this particular admin hobby project. 😂
</p>
<p>
As people will use a variety of domain names to send mail to me, I have
to decide which ones <code>mail</code> should recognize as being “me”.
That’s why <code>~/.mailrc</code> contains the following:
</p>
<pre><code>alternates alex@sibirocobombus,alex@campaignwiki.org,alex@campaignwiki
</code></pre>
<p>
To read MIME-encoded mail, I use <code>munpack -t</code> which comes
with the <code>mpack</code> package.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-exim4-update-exim4-conf-conf">
/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf
</h2>
<p>
This is the file generated by <code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure
exim4-config</code>.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, it specifies that my laptop only delivers local mail. UUCP,
NNCP and <code>msmtp</code> are all exceptions to that.
</p>
<p>
This config file also specifies that the <code>exim</code> configuration
is split into many small files. This makes it easy for me to add new
files.
</p>
<p>
When I make changes, I must always run <code>sudo
update-exim4.conf</code>.
</p>
<p>
The config files are concatenated in sort order, which is why the file
names start with numbers. All of the routers must sort before
<code>200_exim4-config_primary</code> because it stops all processing.
It does that because this config file says that my laptop only delivers
local mail.
</p>
<pre><code>dc_eximconfig_configtype='local'
dc_other_hostnames='melanobombus'
dc_local_interfaces='127.0.0.1 ; ::1'
dc_readhost='alexschroeder.ch'
dc_relay_domains=''
dc_minimaldns='false'
dc_relay_nets=''
dc_smarthost=''
CFILEMODE='644'
dc_use_split_config='true'
dc_hide_mailname='false'
dc_mailname_in_oh='true'
dc_localdelivery='mail_spool'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-110-exim4-config-uucp">
/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/110_exim4-config_uucp
</h2>
<p>
The domains that get mail via UUCP are listed in
<code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>uucp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: uucp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver = accept
    require_files = +/usr/bin/uux
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/uucp
    transport = rsmtp
</code></pre>
<p>
Example <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin   sibirocobombus!dwalin
campaignwiki    sibirocobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
That is, <code>dwalin</code> can only be reached via
<code>sibirocobombus</code> and <code>campaignwiki</code> is the same as
<code>sibirocobombus</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>sibirocobombus</code> is defined in <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code>.
</p>
<p>
Note that mail to the <code>sibirocobombus</code> domain itself doesn’t
get sent via UUCP!
</p>
<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-111-exim4-config-nncp">
/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/111_exim4-config_nncp
</h2>
<p>
The domains that get mail via NNCP are listed in
<code>/etc/exim4/nncp</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>nncp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: nncp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver=accept
    require_files = +/usr/bin/nncp-exec
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/nncp
    transport = nncp
</code></pre>
<p>
Example <code>/etc/exim4/nncp</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>sibirocobombus          sibirocobombus
erebor                  erebor
</code></pre>
<p>
Compare this to the previous entry. Mail to the
<code>sibirocobombus</code> domain is sent via NNCP!
</p>
<p>
Both <code>sibirocobombus</code> and <code>erebor</code> must be defined
in <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-112-exim4-config-msmtp">
/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/112_exim4-config_msmtp
</h2>
<p>
This relies on the fact that the sender is a local user.
</p>
<pre><code>msmtp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: msmtp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver=accept
    user = ${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}
    domains = ! +local_domains
    require_files = +/usr/bin/msmtp
    transport = msmtp
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-transport-40-exim4-config-uucp">
/etc/exim4/conf.d/transport/40_exim4-config_uucp
</h2>
<pre><code>rsmtp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: rsmtp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver=pipe
    command = /usr/bin/uux - -r -a${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}} -gC $domain_data!rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 100
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-transport-41-exim4-config-nncp">
/etc/exim4/conf.d/transport/41_exim4-config_nncp
</h2>
<pre><code>nncp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: nncp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver=pipe
    user=nncp
    command = /usr/bin/nncp-exec -noprogress -quiet $domain_data rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-transport-42-exim4-config-msmtp">
/etc/exim4/conf.d/transport/42_exim4-config_msmtp

<pre><code>msmtp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: msmtp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver = pipe
    command = /usr/bin/msmtp --read-recipients --file=/home/${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}/.config/msmtp/config
    return_fail_output
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that this ensures that <code>msmtp</code> is run for each user,
using their own config files.
</p>
<p>
My config is stored in <code>~/.config/msmtp/config</code> and it must
necessarily be non-interactive.

<p>Yesterday, Raw Story reported that Ivan Raiklin, Trump’s
self-declared “Secretary of Retribution” has compiled a “Deep State
target list” of 350 people he wants to see arrested and punished for
“treason” if Trump is reelected. The list includes Democratic and
Republican elected officials, journalists he considers to be Trump’s
enemies, U.S. Capitol Police officers, and witnesses against Trump in
his impeachment trials and the hearings concerning the events of January

All the graphs in this post are 7-day moving averages, to filter out
some of the noise. The first shows what the halvening did to the hash
rate. Before the halvening it was around 620EH/s. Except for a spike up
to 657EH/s on 26<sup>th</sup> May, after the BTC “price” hit nearly
$71.5K, it has hovered around 580EH/s. Since power is the biggest cost,
the miners’ costs have dropped up to 6.5% since the halvening.<br />

The second graph is much more dramatic. It shows miners’ revenue
dropping from around $70M/day before the the halvening to around
$30M/day after, a drop of 57%. So with costs down 6.5% and revenue down
57% their margins have taken a huge hit.<br /> <br /> Back in May I

<blockquote>
Lets start back in October when the Bitcoin “price” was in the high
$20Ks. This was a problem, because only the most efficient miners could
make a profit at that “price”.
</blockquote>
Mysteriously, that was when Tether’s money printer started running at
full speed, and the “price” got pumped up to around $70K. If I’m right
that only the most efficient miners could make money with the “price” in
the high $20Ks, and if their (income - costs) has dropped 50%, the most
efficient miners need the “price” to be in the mid-$50Ks. Mysteriously,
the mid-$50Ks is where the “price” has dropped to, down 21% since its
last peak on June 5<sup>th</sup>.<br /> <br />

That the hash rate was broadly flat after the halvening is interesting.
Before the pre-halvening pump started, with the BTC “price” roughly
flat, there was a slow but steady increase in the hash rate reflecting
Bitmain’s shipments of new, efficient chips displacing a smaller
contribution from older chips being turned off. Bitmain’s shipments
continued, but once the block reward was halved many more of the less
efficient chips should have been turned off, and the hash rate reduced.
This didn’t happen, and I can see two possible explanations:<br />
<ul>
<li>
It may be that mining power is highly skewed, with the vast majority
coming from the latest chips running on low-cost power which are still
profitable after the halvening. Then the shutdown of a huge number of
older chips sucked in by the pre-halvening pump would have had only a
small reduction in the total hash rate.
</li>
<li>
It may be that miners are burning their excess profit from the
pre-halvening pump by staying in the market rather than
<a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/">pivoting to AI</a>, each hoping to be
among the survivors from the eventual cull.
</li>

Another feature of the halvening was a massive spike in transaction fees
to over $40/transaction. The third graph shows this spike, and a smaller
one around the peak in the BTIC “price”. But it also shows that right
now no-one wants to transact, because the average fee is now $1.72. So
the miners are once again almost entirely dependent upon inflating the
currency with block rewards.<br /> <br />

<p>The last graph shows the total cost of a transaction. It shows that
the fee spike around the “price” peak made little difference, The
current average cost per transaction is $48.57, of which $1.72 is the
fee. So the system is 96.5% supported by inflation; there is currently
no risk of the dangers associated with

<p>Honestly? Brilliant analysis 😄 The best Romances are self-aware and
revel in going pedal-to-the-metal on tropes. And she’s right about
Romance having a sensibility that’s different than “chick lit” or
literary “romances” (that don’t follow the genre’s conventions). (Except
for the mean last line — there are a lot of not-awful Romance novels 🤨)

<p>
About a week ago, my home Internet (AT&amp;T Fiber) went from the ~1
Gbps I pay for down to about 100 Mbps
(<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/monitor-your-internet-raspberry-pi">see
how I monitor my home Internet with a Pi</a>). It wasn’t too
inconvenient, and I considered waiting it out to see if the speed
recovered at some point, because latency was fine.
</p>
<p>
But as you can see around 7/7 on that graph, the 100 Mbps went down to
about <em>eight</em>, and that’s the point where my wife starts noticing
how slow the Internet is. Action level.
</p>
<p>
So I fired up AT&amp;T’s support chat. I’m a programmer, I can usually
find ways around the wily ways of chatbots.
</p>
<p>
Except AT&amp;T’s AI-powered chatbot seems to have a fiendish tendency
to equate ‘WiFi’ with ‘Internet’, no doubt due to so many people
thinking they are one and the same.

2024-07-09 Murten
</h1>
<p>
We’re spending two nights in Murten or Morat. The lake is small with a
circumference of about 25km. <a href="2018-murten/index">A few years
ago</a> we ran around it – but today we ran about six or seven
kilometres before turning back. 13km is enough, these days. We’re both
out of shape, sadly.
</p>
<p>
Just after sunset, looking out over the lake.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Working on a half-enclosed patio until late into the night. There was
drunken shouting to be heard until midnight, on a Monday. I did not know
that this sleepy town was so rowdy!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The town itself looks unchanged from our last visit in 2018.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We ran over to the eastern side of the lake, a protected wetland.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Our destination was this village at the foot of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Vully">Mont Vully</a>. A
rather small mountain.
</p>
<p>

<p>
It got rather hot so by the time we arrived in Sugiez, I was so very
tired. My wife took this picture.

</p>
<p>
Canals connect the lake of Murten, the lake of Neuchâtel and the lake of
Bienne. So many motorboats with proud men and underdressed women going
up and down the channel. 🙄
</p>
<p>

The first sunflowers are out! My wife took this picture.

<strong>2024-07-10</strong> I was interested in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Morat">Battle of
Morat</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On 22 June 1476, Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, laid siege to the
place in an action known as the Battle of Morat. The town hung on for 13
days but finally was saved by the Bernese army. The enemy’s army was
destroyed completely — some 10,000 Burgundians were killed. Since then,
Murten celebrates the victory every year on June 22. –
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murten">Murten</a>, Wikipedia
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I was impressed with a black and white image of the battle on the
Wikipedia page but felt it didn’t have enough resolution. I started
looking for a better scan. e-rara, “the platform for digitized rare
books from Swiss institutions” has
<a href="https://doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-5076">the book</a>!

In the common room of our place in Murten, I found a very nice
reproduction of an image from the Lucerne Chronicle and took a photo
using my phone.

All these cruelties of war. The guy that climbed a tree and gets
stabbed. The decapitated corpses, some of them stripped naked. The
people hanging from the tree. The soldiers drowning. Ooof!
</p>
<p>
Apparently the
<a href="https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/de/list/one/kol/S0023-2">Lucerne
Chronicles</a> can be found in e-codices, Virtual Manuscript Library of
Switzerland. “The goal of e-codices is to provide free access to all
medieval and a selection of modern manuscripts of Switzerland by means
of a virtual library.” The book is in the public domain and yet the site
says <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">CC BY NC
4.0</a>.
</p>
<p>
When I looked at page 107, I didn’t see the image above, however. Some
more investigation is required.
</p>
<p>
Actually, I did find it! Pages 218–219 are the ones I was looking for. I
downloaded the “large” pages, stitched them together in Gimp, saved them
using 80% quality (😥) and uploaded them.

<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I kind of like what Nancy Pelosi is doing.
</p>
<p>
She’s got a unique role to play, as a master of Washington and national
politics.
</p>
<p>
She stepped down as Democratic leader in the House to let a new
generation lead, yet maintained here position as sort of overseeing and
giving her blessings to how they go forward.
</p>
<p>
She also helped organize the Jan 6 committee, which in the end was the
only real official judgement of Trump on the insurrection before the
election.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know how she and Biden get along.
</p>
<p>
It’s much better to have her leading this discussion than the children
who write the NYT these days. Playing with powerful tools/weapons they
don’t understand, at best, being manipulated by vicious fascists at
worst.
</p>
<p>
I trust Pelosi in this situation, we’re lucky to have her.

</p>
<p>
After a break since June 20, we now resume my original “audio blog” from
the summer of 2004, twenty years ago.
</p>
<p>
I was just beginning to figure out how this new medium worked, and
rather than record my own thoughts, as with the previous two episodes, I
published audio from another source, my meditation teacher, Jeru Kabbal.
</p>

Starting with the next episode, tomorrow, an interview with Steve
Gillmor, one of the earliest podcast pioneers – we’ll have an original
audio blog post. That’s when the pulse really starts.

I’ve been making mistakes in 2024 on almost every episode. This time I
got the title wrong, it’s Sunrise of the Soul. Rather than change it,
and take a chance of the episode showing up twice in some podcast
clients, I’m just leaving it as-is. Trying to get a feel for how most of
the clients work. Do they refresh posts, if the descriptions change (as
this one is)? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Do the clients strip out the HTML or do they support some of it? I
wonder if links make it through to most clients?

<p>“El Puerto de Santa María, locally known as El Puerto and
historically in English as Port Saint Mary, is a municipality of Spain
located on the banks of the Guadalete River in the province of Cádiz,
Andalusia. As of 2016, the city has a population of c. 88,184, of which
some 50,000 live in the urban center, and the remainder in the
surrounding areas.”</p>

Was originally doing some research to make sure Australian bureaucrats
can handle names with hyphens in them, and found this. Good thing we
don’t live in Queensland, so we can still name our baby “Down With
Capitalism”!

The rules state that a child’s name must: not be obscene or offensive or contrary to public interest; (no racial slurs or infringements on the rights of another; be short and easy to write (In NSW, under 50 characters); not include symbols without phonetic significance such as N@talie, Da!sy, J#ke) or use numerals; not include or resemble an official title or military rank recognised in Australia such as King, Lady, Father, Prince, Sir or Admiral.Â  This was after a law was passed sometime in 1995 prohibiting the use of titles as part of the baby’s given name. use English letters only; not be similar to a recognised body, organisation or trademark; and In Queensland, the name can’t include a statement, like Save Mother Earth or Down with Capitalism."></p>

<p>date: 2024-07-10, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>In this morning’s Talking Points Memo, David Kurtz observed that
“much of political journalism is divorced from policy and the substance
of politics.” It’s all about a horse race, he wrote, while complex
questions, competing public interests, and the history of an issue get
distilled to “whether it’s good or bad politically.”</p>

bugs me that there’s all this focus on Biden, when what we really need
is to organize as voters so we can be ready to deal with whatever
happens. That’s the real problem. The press can point out a problem, and
it is a problem, but no one has the ability to build a consensus among
voters. I think it’s possible to put together an online version of the
Democratic Party, something that never goes away, is available to rally
the electorate at any moment. That’s the way to neutralize the power of
the media moguls who have us wrapped around their fingers.</p>

<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/x-window-system-at-40.html"><i>The
X Window System At 40</i></a> I detailed my contributions to the early
development of X. To my amazement 40 years after Bob Scheifler’s initial
release it is still valiantly resisting obsolescence. I contributed to
the design, implementation, testing, release engineering and
documentation of X11 starting a bit over 39 years ago. At least my
design for how X handles keyboards is still the way it works.<br />
<br /> All this while I was also working on a competitor, Sun’s NeWS —
which didn’t survive the test of time.<br />
<h3>
Nearly Three-and-a-Half Decades
</h3>
One of the things I really enjoyed about working on NeWS was that the
PostScript environment it implemented was object-oriented, a legacy of
PostScript’s origins at Xerox PARC. Owen Densmore and I developed
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.1987.tb00537.x"><i>A
User‐Interface Toolkit in Object‐Oriented PostScript</i></a> that made
developing NeWS applications very easy, provided you were comfortable
with an object-oriented programming paradigm.<br /> <br /> I think it
was sometime in 1988 while working on the SunOS 4.0 kernel that I
realized that the BSD Vnode interface was in a loose sense
object-oriented. It defines the interface between the file system and
the rest of the kernel. An instance of BSD’s type <tt>vnode</tt>
consisted of some instance data and a pointer to an “ops vector” that
defined its class via an array of methods (function pointers). But it
wasn’t object-oriented enough to, for example, implement inheritance
properly.<br /> <br /> This flaw had led to some inelegancies as the
interface had evolved through time, but what interested me more was the
potential applications that would be unleashed if the interface could be
made properly object-oriented. Instead of being implemented from
scratch, file systems could be implemented by sub-classing other file
systems. For example, a read-only file system such as a CD-ROM could be
made writable by “stacking” a cache file system on top, as shown in
Figure 11. I immediately saw the possibility of significant improvements
in system administration that could flow from stacking file
systems.<br /> <br />

</table>
I started building a prototype by performing major surgery on a copy of
the code that would become SunOS 4.1. By late 1989 it worked well enough
to demonstrate the potential of the idea, so I published 1990’s
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/StackingVnodes.pdf"><i>Evolving
the Vnode Interface</i></a>. The paper describes a number of Vnode
modules that can be stacked together to implement interesting functions.
Among them was cache-fs, which layered a writable local file system
above a local or remote read-only file system:<br />
<blockquote>
This simple module can use any file system as a file-level cache for any
other (read-only) file system. It has no knowledge of the file systems
it is using; it sees them only via their opaque vnodes. Figure 11 shows
it using a local writable ufs file system to cache a remote read-only
NFS file system, thereby reducing the load on the server. Another
possible configuration would be to use a local writable ufs file system
to cache a CD-ROM, obscuring the speed penalty of CD.
</blockquote>
Over the next quarter-century the idea of stacking vnodes and the
related idea of “union mounts” from
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/compsystems/1995/sum_pike.pdf">Rob
Pike and Plan 9</a> churned around until, in October 2014,
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e9be9d5e76e34872f0c37d72e25bc27fe9e2c54c">Linus
Torvalds added overlayfs to the 3.18 kernel</a>. I covered the details
of this history in 2015’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/02/it-takes-longer-than-it-takes.html"><i>It
takes longer than it takes</i></a>. In it I quoted from Valerie Aurora’s
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324291/">excellent</a>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/325369/">series</a> of
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327738/">articles</a> about the
architectural and implementation difficulties involved in adding union
mounts to the Linux kernel. I concurred with her statement that:<br />
<blockquote>
The consensus at the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327601/">2009
Linux file systems workshop</a> was that stackable file systems are
conceptually elegant, but difficult or impossible to implement in a
maintainable manner with the current VFS structure. My own experience
writing a stacked file system (an in-kernel chunkfs prototype) leads me
to agree with these criticisms.
</blockquote>
I
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/02/it-takes-longer-than-it-takes.html">wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Note that my original paper was only incidentally about union mounts, it
was a critique of the then-current VFS structure, and a suggestion that
stackable vnodes might be a better way to go. It was such a seductive
suggestion that it took nearly two decades to refute it!
</blockquote>
Nevertheless, the example I used in
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/StackingVnodes.pdf"><i>Evolving
the Vnode Interface</i></a> of a use for stacking vnodes was what
persisted. It took a while for the fact that overlayfs was an official
part of the Linux kernel to percolate through the ecosystem, but after
six years I was able to write

about less radical ideas than NixOS:<br />
<blockquote>
So, instead of re-architecting the way distros are built, vendors are
reimplementing similar functionality using simpler tools inherited from
the server world: containers, squashfs filesystems inside single files,
and, for distros that have them, copy-on-write filesystems to provide
rollback functionality.<br /> <br /> The goal is to build operating
systems as robust as mobile OSes: periodically, the vendor ships a
thoroughly tested and integrated image which end users can’t change and
don’t need to. In normal use, the root filesystem is mounted read-only,
and there’s no package manager.
</blockquote>
Since then this model has become universal. Distros ship as a bootable
ISO image, which uses overlayfs to mount a writable temporary file
system on top. This is precisely how my 1989 prototype was intended to
ship SunOS 4.1. The technology has spread to individual applications
with systems such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)">Snaps</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpak">Flatpak</a>.<br />
<h3>
Three Decades
</h3>
The opportunity we saw when we started Nvidia was that the PC was
transitioning from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Standard_Architecture">ISA
bus</a> to version 1 of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect">PCI
bus</a>. The ISA bus’ bandwidth was completely inadequate for 3D games,
but the PCI bus had considerably more. Whether it was enough was an open
question. We clearly needed to make the best possible use of the limited
bandwidth we could get.<br /> <br /> Nvidia’s first chip had three key
innovations:<br />
<ol>
<li>
Rendering objects with quadric patches not triangles. A realistic model
using quadric patches needed perehaps a fifth of the data for an
equivalent triangle model.
</li>
<li>
I/O virtualization with applications using a write-mostly,
object-oriented interface. Read operations are neccessarily synchronous,
whereas write operations are asynchronous. Thus the more writes per read
across sthe bus, the better the utilization of the available bus
bandwidth.
</li>
<li>
A modular internal architecture based on an on-chip token-ring network.
Thie goal was that each functional unit be simple enough to be designed
and tested by a three-person team.

The first two of these enabled us to get Sega’s arcade games running at
full frame rate on a PC. Curtis Priem and I designed the second of
these, and it is the one that has lasted:<br />
<ul>
<li>
I/O virtualization allowed multiple processes direct access to the
graphics hardware, with no need to pass operations through the operating
system. I explained the importance of this a decade ago in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/hardware-io-virtualization.html"><i>Hardware
I/O Virtualization</i></a>, using the example of Amazon building their
own network interface cards. Tne first chip appeared on the bus as
having 128 wide FIFOs. The operating system could map one of them into
each process wanting access to the chip, allowing applications direct
access to the hardware but under the control of the operating system.
</li>
<li>
The interface was write-mostly because the application could read from
the FIFO the number of free slots, that is the number of writes before
the bus would stall.
</li>
<li>
The interface was object-oriented because the data and the offset in the
FIFO formed an invocation of a method on an instance of a (virtual)
class. Some classes were implemented in hardware, others trapped into
the kernel and were implemented by the driver, but the application just
created and used instances of the available classes without knowing
which was which. The classes were arranged in a hierarchy starting with
class CLASS. Enumerating the instances of class CLASS told the
application which classes it could use. Enumerating the instances of
each of those classes told the application how many of each type of
resource it could use.
</li>
</ul>
The importance of the last of these was that it decoupled the hardware
and software release schedules. Drivers could emulate classes that had
yet to appear in hardware, the applications would use the hardware once
it was available. Old software would run on newer hardware, it would
just see some classes it didn’t know how to use. One of our frustrations
with Sun was the way software and hardware release schedules were
inextricably interlinked.<br />

preserved paper academic journals and how their move to the Web was
changing libraries role from purchasing a copy of the journal to renting
access to the publisher’s copy, and I came up with the overall
peer-to-peer archtecture (and the acronym). With help from Mark Seiden I
built the prototype, and after using it to demonstrate the feasibility
of the concept, also used it to show vulnerabilities in the initial
protocol. In 2003 I was part of the team that solved these problems, for
which we were awarded the Best Paper award at the Symposium on Operating

Tuesday I look for Jon Stewart’s opening for the Daily Show on YouTube.
It’s always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he
says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing
President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the
people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice.
</p>
<p>
If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized
after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There’s never
been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on
organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue
about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren’t any
smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that’s been the
real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we’ve gotten the
tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And
now we’re at the last moment before it’s all flushed away and the NYT et
al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less.
</p>
<p>
Be warned I get really angry at the end and raise my voice. I don’t
think I’ve ever done that in a podcast, and I’m not sure I like it. But
the rage is real.

<p>
We spent two nights in Neuenburg or Neuchâtel. They came under Prussian
control in 1707 because the locals were looking for a government that
was far away and wouldn’t meddle in their affairs. It became a republic
and a canton of Switzerland in 1848.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the death in 1707 of Marie d’Orleans-Longueville, duchess de Nemours
and Princess of Neuchâtel, the people had to choose her successor from
among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince first and foremost
to be a Protestant, and also to be strong enough to protect their
territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices.
Louis XIV actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but
the Neuchâtelois people passed them over in favour of King Frederick I
of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion
through the Houses of Orange and Nassau. With the requisite stability
assured, Neuchâtel entered its golden age, with commerce and industry
(including watchmaking and lace) and banking undergoing steady
expansion. –

Neuveville up the Combe du Pulouvi. I took some flower pictures.

<p>On July 9, 1868, Americans changed the U.S. Constitution for the
fourteenth time, adapting our foundational document to construct a new
nation without systematic Black enslavement. In 1865 the Thirteenth
Amendment to the Constitution had prohibited slavery on the basis of
race, but it did not prevent the establishment of a system in which
Black Americans continued to be unequal. Backed by President Andrew
Johnson, who had taken over the presidency after actor John Wilkes Booth
had murdered President Abraham Lincoln, white southern Democrats had
done their best to push their Black neighbors back into subservience. So
long as southern states had abolished enslavement, repudiated
Confederate debts, and nullified the ordinances of secession, Johnson
was happy to readmit them to full standing in the Union, still led by
the very men who had organized the Confederacy and made war on the
United States.</p>

itself to sleep mid-job and “going offline” so I have to physically walk
to it and turn it back on. “Printing” blank pages. When told to print a
three-page document (ONCE), it prints TWO copies of page 1 &amp; 2 then
skips page 3. That “just buy this Brother printer everyone has, it’s

you’ve lived much at all you know what Joni says is true. I got there
when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative
that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I’d never
see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No
way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we
cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn’t even
take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a
constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying
goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It’s why we’re
playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden’s presidency,
because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to
this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about
Biden’s flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The
problem isn’t that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were
to win, we’ll be right back here in another four years, and at that time
we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever
happens this year, what’s waiting for us is for most of us to wake up
from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It’s all
falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start
working together, intelligently, or else it’s over.</p>

This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the
corruption of American journalism. Most of the time we can turn our
attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House,
and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the
journalists, get away with it again.

<p>I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the
press on our democratic process that I’m pretty depressed about the
future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who
moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I
asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said
he’d never do it. If they tried to force him, he’d get a gun and shoot
them. This isn’t the first time I’ve heard that, and I called bullshit.
You’re never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won’t
do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath
and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally –
and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a
social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn’t believe you
are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can’t get
back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone
number). I’ve been through all these miserable processes. And none of
them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who
demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where
we’re headed, again.</p>

<p>I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the
<a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an
incredible
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a>
to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news
sites. It’s more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site
updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge
next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the
full story. Maybe it was a mistake calling this a blogroll. I’m trying
to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and
use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for
themselves. In any case I’m thinking about what to do next with
FeedLand, which is what’s behind the blogroll software. It hasn’t lived
up to my hopes, and I don’t think it’s likely to. I may be done writing
software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years,
between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of
writing for others was not a success. So I’m thinking about how to wind
down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using
it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a
bit. It’s that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few
years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span

<p>I have spent the weekend struggling mightily with a new manuscript
and have had little time to study the news. The most notable event from
the day is that in a stunning upset, French voters have rejected members
of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party in legislative
elections. After the first round of votes, National Rally candidates
appeared to be comfortably ahead, but left-wing and centrist candidates
combined forces to prevent splitting the vote, and voters then flooded
the polls to elect the candidates that coalition fielded.</p>

You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn’t
lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.
</p>
<p>
What you need to know:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We all knew this would happen.
</li>
<li>
We all saw it happen, we don’t need you to tell us.
</li>
<li>
We’re going with him anyway.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The plan is this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election – VP
Harris steps up.
</li>
<li>
Now everyone can relax.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak">decloaked</a>, an even
bigger story.

<p>
BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that
they all want Trump to lose? It’s logical that they would, but I thought
they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous

Dems take on lots of events. Support him from underneath. If and when he
falters, the party is there to prop him up, take up the slack, or step
in.”
</p>
<p>
I had a similar idea.
</p>
<p>
Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.

<p>
Let all the great next generation democrats shine.

<p>
Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.
</p>
<p>
Joe Biden dials in via satellite.
</p>
<p>
“Listen, I’m an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright
young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren’t
they wonderful!”

his feet and his grandchildren playing

checkers…

<p>
And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn’t
spill his beer, so you know they have his back.
</p>
<p>
Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of
the Democratic Party.
</p>
<p>
Collect them all!
</p>
<p>
You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.
</p>
<p>
Some would be very rare.
</p>
<p>
Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack,
Michelle and Bill would have a concert.
</p>
<p>
Hosted by Mayor Pete!
</p>
<p>
Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.
</p>
<p>
Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift
wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit.
</p>
<p>
And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers.
</p>
<p>
Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and
the freedom fighters.
</p>
<p>
All the heroes of America, standing up for America.
</p>
<p>
The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course
Lynne Cheney.
</p>
<p>
We don’t need no freaking monarch, they all sing.
</p>
<p>
No we don’t! shouts the people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJBaIUZwmTs&t=43s">On
video</a>, the Dead sing “I’m Uncle Sam, how do you do!”
</p>
<p>
Shake the hand that shook the hand of PT Barnum and Charlie Chan.
</p>
<p>
We all march together to victory.

<h2 id="miscellany-102-books">Miscellany № 102: books!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: Shady Characters blog</p>
<p>
In the second of this mini-series of post-deadline catch-ups
(<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2024/06/miscellany-101/">the
first dealt with punctuation</a>), I’ve collected some links on the
subject of books.
</p>

First is a recent exhibition at Harvard’s Houghton Library, called
“<a href="https://library.harvard.edu/exhibits/marks-books">Marks in
Books</a>”, that has, sadly, run its course. But
<a href="https://glammr.us/@overholt/111777818440458959">John
Overholt</a>, a curator of early books and manuscripts at Houghton,
writes to say that the exhibit was adapted from a 1984 exhibition on the
same subject and that
<a href="https://nrs.lib.harvard.edu/urn-3:fhcl.hough:40935393">the
catalogue of that earlier incarnation</a> is available online.

We were looking after this little guy (the dog, Patches) for the
weekend. He and Gidget got along so well! Very happy to sleep in close
proximity and be chill. I think Gidget is happy to be the only pet again
after Viv returned him home, though 😂
