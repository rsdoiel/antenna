Wikipedia has a pretty good history of the early days of the

Window System</a>. In
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/x-window-system-at-40.html"><i>The
X Window System At 40</i></a> I detailed my contributions to the early
development of X. To my amazement 40 years after Bob Scheifler’s initial
release it is still valiantly resisting obsolescence. I contributed to
the design, implementation, testing, release engineering and
documentation of X11 starting a bit over 39 years ago. At least my
design for how X handles keyboards is still the way it works.<br />
<br /> All this while I was also working on a competitor, Sun’s NeWS —
which didn’t survive the test of time.<br />
<h3>
Nearly Three-and-a-Half Decades
</h3>
One of the things I really enjoyed about working on NeWS was that the
PostScript environment it implemented was object-oriented, a legacy of
PostScript’s origins at Xerox PARC. Owen Densmore and I developed
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.1987.tb00537.x"><i>A
User‐Interface Toolkit in Object‐Oriented PostScript</i></a> that made
developing NeWS applications very easy, provided you were comfortable
with an object-oriented programming paradigm.<br /> <br /> I think it
was sometime in 1988 while working on the SunOS 4.0 kernel that I
realized that the BSD Vnode interface was in a loose sense
object-oriented. It defines the interface between the file system and
the rest of the kernel. An instance of BSD’s type <tt>vnode</tt>
consisted of some instance data and a pointer to an “ops vector” that
defined its class via an array of methods (function pointers). But it
wasn’t object-oriented enough to, for example, implement inheritance
properly.<br /> <br /> This flaw had led to some inelegancies as the
interface had evolved through time, but what interested me more was the
potential applications that would be unleashed if the interface could be
made properly object-oriented. Instead of being implemented from
scratch, file systems could be implemented by sub-classing other file
systems. For example, a read-only file system such as a CD-ROM could be
made writable by “stacking” a cache file system on top, as shown in
Figure 11. I immediately saw the possibility of significant improvements
in system administration that could flow from stacking file
systems.<br /> <br />

</table>
I started building a prototype by performing major surgery on a copy of
the code that would become SunOS 4.1. By late 1989 it worked well enough
to demonstrate the potential of the idea, so I published 1990’s
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/StackingVnodes.pdf"><i>Evolving
the Vnode Interface</i></a>. The paper describes a number of Vnode
modules that can be stacked together to implement interesting functions.
Among them was cache-fs, which layered a writable local file system
above a local or remote read-only file system:<br />
<blockquote>
This simple module can use any file system as a file-level cache for any
other (read-only) file system. It has no knowledge of the file systems
it is using; it sees them only via their opaque vnodes. Figure 11 shows
it using a local writable ufs file system to cache a remote read-only
NFS file system, thereby reducing the load on the server. Another
possible configuration would be to use a local writable ufs file system
to cache a CD-ROM, obscuring the speed penalty of CD.
</blockquote>
Over the next quarter-century the idea of stacking vnodes and the
related idea of “union mounts” from
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/compsystems/1995/sum_pike.pdf">Rob
Pike and Plan 9</a> churned around until, in October 2014,
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e9be9d5e76e34872f0c37d72e25bc27fe9e2c54c">Linus
Torvalds added overlayfs to the 3.18 kernel</a>. I covered the details
of this history in 2015’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/02/it-takes-longer-than-it-takes.html"><i>It
takes longer than it takes</i></a>. In it I quoted from Valerie Aurora’s
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/324291/">excellent</a>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/325369/">series</a> of
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327738/">articles</a> about the
architectural and implementation difficulties involved in adding union
mounts to the Linux kernel. I concurred with her statement that:<br />
<blockquote>
The consensus at the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/327601/">2009
Linux file systems workshop</a> was that stackable file systems are
conceptually elegant, but difficult or impossible to implement in a
maintainable manner with the current VFS structure. My own experience
writing a stacked file system (an in-kernel chunkfs prototype) leads me
to agree with these criticisms.
</blockquote>
I
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2015/02/it-takes-longer-than-it-takes.html">wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Note that my original paper was only incidentally about union mounts, it
was a critique of the then-current VFS structure, and a suggestion that
stackable vnodes might be a better way to go. It was such a seductive
suggestion that it took nearly two decades to refute it!
</blockquote>
Nevertheless, the example I used in
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/StackingVnodes.pdf"><i>Evolving
the Vnode Interface</i></a> of a use for stacking vnodes was what
persisted. It took a while for the fact that overlayfs was an official
part of the Linux kernel to percolate through the ecosystem, but after
six years I was able to write
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/12/blatant-self-promotion.html#more"><i>Blatant
Self-Promotion</i></a> about the transformation it wrought on Linux’s
packaging and software distribution, inspired by Liam Proven’s
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/03/nixos_linux_os_design/"><i>NixOS
and the changing face of Linux operating systems</i></a>. He writes
about less radical ideas than NixOS:<br />
<blockquote>
So, instead of re-architecting the way distros are built, vendors are
reimplementing similar functionality using simpler tools inherited from
the server world: containers, squashfs filesystems inside single files,
and, for distros that have them, copy-on-write filesystems to provide
rollback functionality.<br /> <br /> The goal is to build operating
systems as robust as mobile OSes: periodically, the vendor ships a
thoroughly tested and integrated image which end users can’t change and
don’t need to. In normal use, the root filesystem is mounted read-only,
and there’s no package manager.
</blockquote>
Since then this model has become universal. Distros ship as a bootable
ISO image, which uses overlayfs to mount a writable temporary file
system on top. This is precisely how my 1989 prototype was intended to
ship SunOS 4.1. The technology has spread to individual applications
with systems such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)">Snaps</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatpak">Flatpak</a>.<br />
<h3>
Three Decades
</h3>
The opportunity we saw when we started Nvidia was that the PC was
transitioning from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Standard_Architecture">ISA
bus</a> to version 1 of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect">PCI
bus</a>. The ISA bus’ bandwidth was completely inadequate for 3D games,
but the PCI bus had considerably more. Whether it was enough was an open
question. We clearly needed to make the best possible use of the limited
bandwidth we could get.<br /> <br /> Nvidia’s first chip had three key
innovations:<br />
<ol>
<li>
Rendering objects with quadric patches not triangles. A realistic model
using quadric patches needed perehaps a fifth of the data for an
equivalent triangle model.
</li>
<li>
I/O virtualization with applications using a write-mostly,
object-oriented interface. Read operations are neccessarily synchronous,
whereas write operations are asynchronous. Thus the more writes per read
across sthe bus, the better the utilization of the available bus
bandwidth.
</li>
<li>
A modular internal architecture based on an on-chip token-ring network.
Thie goal was that each functional unit be simple enough to be designed
and tested by a three-person team.

The first two of these enabled us to get Sega’s arcade games running at
full frame rate on a PC. Curtis Priem and I designed the second of
these, and it is the one that has lasted:<br />
<ul>
<li>
I/O virtualization allowed multiple processes direct access to the
graphics hardware, with no need to pass operations through the operating
system. I explained the importance of this a decade ago in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/hardware-io-virtualization.html"><i>Hardware
I/O Virtualization</i></a>, using the example of Amazon building their
own network interface cards. Tne first chip appeared on the bus as
having 128 wide FIFOs. The operating system could map one of them into
each process wanting access to the chip, allowing applications direct
access to the hardware but under the control of the operating system.
</li>
<li>
The interface was write-mostly because the application could read from
the FIFO the number of free slots, that is the number of writes before
the bus would stall.
</li>
<li>
The interface was object-oriented because the data and the offset in the
FIFO formed an invocation of a method on an instance of a (virtual)
class. Some classes were implemented in hardware, others trapped into
the kernel and were implemented by the driver, but the application just
created and used instances of the available classes without knowing
which was which. The classes were arranged in a hierarchy starting with
class CLASS. Enumerating the instances of class CLASS told the
application which classes it could use. Enumerating the instances of
each of those classes told the application how many of each type of
resource it could use.
</li>
</ul>
The importance of the last of these was that it decoupled the hardware
and software release schedules. Drivers could emulate classes that had
yet to appear in hardware, the applications would use the hardware once
it was available. Old software would run on newer hardware, it would
just see some classes it didn’t know how to use. One of our frustrations
with Sun was the way software and hardware release schedules were
inextricably interlinked.<br />

<p>Last October I celebrated the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/lockss-program-turns-25.html"><i>LOCKSS
Program Turns 25</i></a>. Vicky Reich explained to me how libraries
preserved paper academic journals and how their move to the Web was
changing libraries role from purchasing a copy of the journal to renting
access to the publisher’s copy, and I came up with the overall
peer-to-peer archtecture (and the acronym). With help from Mark Seiden I

<p>
We’re spending two nights in Murten or Morat. The lake is small with a
circumference of about 25km. <a href="2018-murten/index">A few years
ago</a> we ran around it – but today we ran about six or seven
kilometres before turning back. 13km is enough, these days. We’re both
out of shape, sadly.
</p>
<p>
Just after sunset, looking out over the lake.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Working on a half-enclosed patio until late into the night. There was
drunken shouting to be heard until midnight, on a Monday. I did not know
that this sleepy town was so rowdy!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The town itself looks unchanged from our last visit in 2018.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We ran over to the eastern side of the lake, a protected wetland.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Our destination was this village at the foot of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Vully">Mont Vully</a>. A
rather small mountain.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-07-09-murten-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
It got rather hot so by the time we arrived in Sugiez, I was so very
tired.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Canals connect the lake of Murte, the lake of Neuchâtel and the lake of
Bienne. So many motorboats with proud men and underdressed women going
up and down the channel. 🙄

Tuesday I look for Jon Stewart’s opening for the Daily Show on YouTube.
It’s always funny, great comedy, whether or not you agree with what he
says, and I usually do agree. But not when it comes to him pushing
President Biden out, without any idea of what comes next, and how the
people, even some people who love his show, feel about having no voice.
</p>
<p>
If the voters organize, using the tools we have now, and stay organized
after the election, we could elect anyone to be president. There’s never
been a more clear opportunity to win a landslide. It depends on
organization, and elites not grabbing the steering wheel with no clue
about what comes next, and driving us off a cliff.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been close to elites at times, and I can tell you, they aren’t any
smarter than you, they just have more power. I think that’s been the
real problem. We have failed to stay a democracy as we’ve gotten the
tools to really be a democracy in ways we never could have before. And
now we’re at the last moment before it’s all flushed away and the NYT et
al (including our hero Stewart) are making it more certain, not less.
</p>
<p>
Be warned I get really angry at the end and raise my voice. I don’t
think I’ve ever done that in a podcast, and I’m not sure I like it. But
the rage is real.

<p>
We spent two nights in Neuenburg or Neuchâtel. They came under Prussian
control in 1707 because the locals were looking for a government that
was far away and wouldn’t meddle in their affairs. It became a republic
and a canton of Switzerland in 1848.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the death in 1707 of Marie d’Orleans-Longueville, duchess de Nemours
and Princess of Neuchâtel, the people had to choose her successor from
among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince first and foremost
to be a Protestant, and also to be strong enough to protect their
territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices.
Louis XIV actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but
the Neuchâtelois people passed them over in favour of King Frederick I
of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion
through the Houses of Orange and Nassau. With the requisite stability
assured, Neuchâtel entered its golden age, with commerce and industry
(including watchmaking and lace) and banking undergoing steady
expansion. –

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We met a friend and went for a walk in the late afternoon: from La
Neuveville up the Combe du Pulouvi. I took some flower pictures.
</p>
<p>
At the new Jeunes Rives. It looked very nice but we did see a big dead
fish, belly up. That dampened our enthusiasm somewhat.

contested notions of masculinity (is it about going off to kill people
abroad, or staying home to play sport?)… honestly, he has me convinced,

<p>On July 9, 1868, Americans changed the U.S. Constitution for the
fourteenth time, adapting our foundational document to construct a new
nation without systematic Black enslavement. In 1865 the Thirteenth
Amendment to the Constitution had prohibited slavery on the basis of
race, but it did not prevent the establishment of a system in which
Black Americans continued to be unequal. Backed by President Andrew
Johnson, who had taken over the presidency after actor John Wilkes Booth
had murdered President Abraham Lincoln, white southern Democrats had
done their best to push their Black neighbors back into subservience. So
long as southern states had abolished enslavement, repudiated
Confederate debts, and nullified the ordinances of secession, Johnson
was happy to readmit them to full standing in the Union, still led by
the very men who had organized the Confederacy and made war on the
United States.</p>

Guys, we have one of those Brother printers that are supposed to be so
solid and reliable, but it is not cooperating today. Keeps sending
itself to sleep mid-job and “going offline” so I have to physically walk
to it and turn it back on. “Printing” blank pages. When told to print a
three-page document (ONCE), it prints TWO copies of page 1 &amp; 2 then
skips page 3. That “just buy this Brother printer everyone has, it’s
fine” article lied to me.

</h1>
<p>
First, install the <code>nncp</code> package on both systems. In
addition to that, install the <code>openbsd-inetd</code> package on the
server. (In the following passages, I’m connected as <code>root</code>
to the server.)
</p>
<p>
Generate new configs on the systems that are missing
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>
<p>
Examine the file using a text editor. Each system needs to know the
public keys of the other.
</p>
<p>
So, on the laptop, I need to add to add the public keys of the server. I
also want to specify that I’m going to call the node on a regular basis
and that files sent to me from that node should be saved in my
“incoming” directory. I also want to accept mail.
</p>
<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/sibirocobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;12 * * * *&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
And on the server, I need to add the public keys of the laptop. I also
want to save incoming files from the laptop. And I want to accept mail.
</p>
<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       ...
      exchpub:  ...
      signpub:  ...
      noisepub: ...
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming&quot;
      exec: {
        sendmail: [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
Note how the laptop calls the server but the server does not call the
laptop!
</p>
<p>
Let’s make sure those directories exist:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/incoming
ssh sibirocobombus mkdir incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s create a file and send it from the laptop to the server using
<code>nncp-file</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>echo Hello &gt; hello.txt
sudo -u nncp nncp-file hello.txt sibirocobombus:
</code></pre>
<p>
Check the log using <code>nncp-log</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-log | tail -n 1
2024-06-28T21:36:02Z File hello.txt (282 B) is sent to sibirocobombus:hello.txt
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s connect to the server and check:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus ls incoming
</code></pre>
<p>
Nothing has arrived!
</p>
<p>
Let’s call the server using <code>nncp-call</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
2024-06-28T22:07:36Z ERROR Calling sibirocobombus (alexschroeder.ch:5400): dial tcp [2a02:418:6a04:178:209:50:237:1]:5400: connect: connection refused
</code></pre>
<p>
Oops. It’s not running? That’s right, I need to run
<code>nncp-daemon</code> on the server side.
</p>
<p>
Add the following to <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> on the server to
accept NNCP connections on port 5400:
</p>
<pre><code>5400 stream  tcp nowait  nncp    /usr/local/bin/nncp-daemon  nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>
<p>
Reload it:
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload openbsd-inetd
</code></pre>
<p>
Try again on the laptop:
</p>

you’ve lived much at all you know what Joni says is true. I got there
when my grandmother died in 1977, when I was 22, my first close relative
that I lost, and I tried to come to grips with the idea that I’d never
see her again and found it impossible, but it was true nonetheless. No
way to escape it. When my mother died, in 2018, I only thought after we
cleared her house to be sold, the house I grew up in, that I didn’t even
take pictures of it before it was emptied. I was so used to it being a
constant, I forgot to realize until it was too late, that I was saying
goodbye to everything I knew for my entire life. Forever. It’s why we’re
playing such a dangerous game of chicken with Biden’s presidency,
because the stakes are so incredibly high. A mathematical approach to
this problem says imho that everyone should shut the fuck up about
Biden’s flaws and get us organized so we can handle any eventuality. The
problem isn’t that Biden might die, the problem is that even if he were
to win, we’ll be right back here in another four years, and at that time
we will have to grapple with an even more dire situation. Whatever
happens this year, what’s waiting for us is for most of us to wake up
from the dream that there are any constants in our lives. It’s all
falling apart, in every way. The only thing that matters is we start
working together, intelligently, or else it’s over.</p>

This is the time, every four years, when we have to confront the
corruption of American journalism. Most of the time we can turn our
attention elsewhere, until we get a Bush or Trump in the White House,
and then we have to own up to the fact that we let them, the
journalists, get away with it again.

<p>I admit that after the debate and the interminable attacks from the
press on our democratic process that I’m pretty depressed about the
future. I was talking with a friend over the weekend, a fellow NYer who
moved up to the mountains as I did, about the political situation, and I
asked if he would be prepared to sign a loyalty oath to Trump. He said
he’d never do it. If they tried to force him, he’d get a gun and shoot
them. This isn’t the first time I’ve heard that, and I called bullshit.
You’re never going to do that. I know this guy, I know myself. I won’t
do it either. And I think I probably will have to sign the loyalty oath
and so will you. There are so many ways to turn your life off, legally –
and without recourse. Think about what happens when you lose access to a
social media account. Or when a credit rating agency doesn’t believe you
are who you are. Or when someone hijacks your phone and you can’t get
back control of it (and try to use anything without a working phone
number). I’ve been through all these miserable processes. And none of
them were legal, or controlled by the US government. A president who
demands loyalty of you will get it. And that is certainly exactly where
we’re headed, again.</p>

<p>I find the <a href="https://blogroll.social/">blogroll</a> on the
<a href="http://scripting.com/">home page</a> of my blog to be an
incredible
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/08/blogrollScreenShot.png">way</a>
to catch up on what people I follow are posting to their blogs and news
sites. It’s more like a feed reader than a blogroll because when a site
updates it moves to the top of the list and when you click the wedge
next to the title you get the five most recent posts with links to the
full story. Maybe it was a mistake calling this a blogroll. I’m trying
to come up with a better place to put it so more people would see it and
use it and might think it would be nice to have a place like that for
themselves. In any case I’m thinking about what to do next with
FeedLand, which is what’s behind the blogroll software. It hasn’t lived
up to my hopes, and I don’t think it’s likely to. I may be done writing
software for others, I was writing only for myself for a few years,
between 2017 and 2021, and I really liked that. The experiment of
writing for others was not a success. So I’m thinking about how to wind
down FeedLand, keep it available for the people who are already using
it, but close it to new membership. Just thinking out loud here for a
bit. It’s that time, to consider what I want to do with the next few
years, assuming, praise Murphy, I have them to play with. <span

<p>I have spent the weekend struggling mightily with a new manuscript
and have had little time to study the news. The most notable event from
the day is that in a stunning upset, French voters have rejected members
of Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party in legislative
elections. After the first round of votes, National Rally candidates
appeared to be comfortably ahead, but left-wing and centrist candidates
combined forces to prevent splitting the vote, and voters then flooded
the polls to elect the candidates that coalition fielded.</p>

You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn’t
lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.
</p>
<p>
What you need to know:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We all knew this would happen.
</li>
<li>
We all saw it happen, we don’t need you to tell us.
</li>
<li>
We’re going with him anyway.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The plan is this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election – VP
Harris steps up.
</li>
<li>
Now everyone can relax.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Hot tip for journos: The Supreme Court
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decloak">decloaked</a>, an even

they all want Trump to lose? It’s logical that they would, but I thought
they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous
<a href="https://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/">View
From Nowhere</a>. Has that pretense accidentally been dropped?

On Mastodon,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@sarajw@front-end.social/112746718207413752">Sara
Joy writes</a>: “Let Biden run. Let Kamala and lots of other younger
Dems take on lots of events. Support him from underneath. If and when he
falters, the party is there to prop him up, take up the slack, or step
in.”
</p>
<p>
I had a similar idea.
</p>
<p>
Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.
</p>
<p>
Let all the great next generation democrats shine.
</p>
<p>
Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.
</p>
<p>
Joe Biden dials in via satellite.
</p>
<p>
“Listen, I’m an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright
young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren’t
they wonderful!”
</p>
<p>
He puts on his robe and slippers, sits in a rocking chair with a dog at
his feet and his grandchildren playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">yahtzee</a> and
checkers…
</p>
<p>
And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn’t
spill his beer, so you know they have his back.
</p>
<p>
Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of
the Democratic Party.
</p>
<p>
Collect them all!
</p>
<p>
You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.
</p>
<p>
Some would be very rare.
</p>
<p>
Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack,
Michelle and Bill would have a concert.
</p>
<p>
Hosted by Mayor Pete!
</p>
<p>
Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.
</p>
<p>
Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift
wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit.
</p>
<p>
And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers.
</p>
<p>
Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and
the freedom fighters.
</p>
<p>
All the heroes of America, standing up for America.
</p>
<p>
The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course
Lynne Cheney.
</p>
<p>
We don’t need no freaking monarch, they all sing.
</p>
<p>
No we don’t! shouts the people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJBaIUZwmTs&t=43s">On
video</a>, the Dead sing “I’m Uncle Sam, how do you do!”
</p>
<p>
Shake the hand that shook the hand of PT Barnum and Charlie Chan.
</p>
<p>
We all march together to victory.
</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: Chris Heilmann’s blog</p>
<p>Over the last few years something magical has happened without much

translate text content for us. Having spent a lot of time traveling
around conferences, I amassed a lot of people I follow who do not speak

glad Biden is attacking journalists, he has a much bigger voice than I
do. If I had his influence I’d be saying the same things, though I
wouldn’t be as kind. It’s time to put the journalists back where they
belong, covering news, not trying to run the country.</p>

In the second of this mini-series of post-deadline catch-ups
(<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2024/06/miscellany-101/">the
first dealt with punctuation</a>), I’ve collected some links on the
subject of books.

<p>
First is a recent exhibition at Harvard’s Houghton Library, called
“<a href="https://library.harvard.edu/exhibits/marks-books">Marks in
Books</a>”, that has, sadly, run its course. But
<a href="https://glammr.us/@overholt/111777818440458959">John
Overholt</a>, a curator of early books and manuscripts at Houghton,
writes to say that the exhibit was adapted from a 1984 exhibition on the
same subject and that
<a href="https://nrs.lib.harvard.edu/urn-3:fhcl.hough:40935393">the
catalogue of that earlier incarnation</a> is available online.

We were looking after this little guy (the dog, Patches) for the
weekend. He and Gidget got along so well! Very happy to sleep in close
proximity and be chill. I think Gidget is happy to be the only pet again
after Viv returned him home, though 😂
