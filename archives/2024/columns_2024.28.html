<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: Matt Haughey blog</p>
<p>
It's pretty incredible that
<a href="https://www.metafilter.com/?ref=a.wholelottanothing.org" rel="noreferrer">MetaFilter</a>
turns 25 years old today. Barely anything on the internet sticks around
for this long.
</p>
<p>
MetaFilter predates LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube. It's older than
Wikipedia and Blogger. Other similar sites sprang up after it like Digg,
then reddit, then Quora, but

2024-07-14 Yvonand: Tour du Vallon des Vaux
</h1>
<p>
On the last day, we decided to go for a walk nearby instead of getting
on the train immediately. We took the train to Yvonand and turned
towards the hills, spending most of our time in the forest. This is
<a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/route-129">route
129</a>.
</p>
<p>
When leaving the fields around Yvonand and entering the woods, the
autobahn arches high above. If only it were a fantastic train and not a
triumph for car culture.
</p>
<p>

This small rivulet must have cut the canyon.
</p>
<p>

<p>
This bridge marks the beginning of the way up, if I remember.

<p>

</p>
<p>
Once you leave the forest, you’re on the plateau above. We ate lunch at
the Hotel de Ville in Chavannes-le-Chêne.

</p>
<p>
And here’s a weird one from the night before: Apparently the square in
front of the castle is bathed in blue light at night, as if a train
station bathroom trying to keep drug addicts away.
</p>
<p>
Somewhat creepy.

The shownotes pages now have a player. Still have a little more work to

BTW, I’m intermittently locked out of my
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa">Threads</a>
account.
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png">They
say</a> it has to do with automated stuff they don’t explain. I don’t
have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried
changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network,
it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no
energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don’t see me over
there, this is why.
</p>
<p>
How I found out about Trump’s assassination. By accident, I was watching
CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few
minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to
season 6 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty">Line of
Duty</a>, which isn’t very great. I couldn’t focus on the show. I got my
iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting
that <i>he</i> hadn’t been killed, and somehow I knew that “he” was
Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump
asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his
fist, looking right into the camera. He’s 100 percent television actor.
Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn’t
cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed
killing him. He’s thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my
first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies
about being a victim, really is a victim, and we’ll never hear the end
of it. And it didn’t take long before a random Republican asshole was
saying this was Biden’s fault for saying Trump would end democracy,
which he has said he will, promised to do, and <i>we saw him try to do
it</i> on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the
temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides.
It didn’t take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate.
This was Biden’s fault they all agree. Occam’s Razor says this is over.
We aren’t going to vote in November. The deal is done because the
journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I’ve
yet to hear another explanation from them.
</p>
<p>
If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph,
they’d nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That’s how our
journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the
dictator. This is what it’s like after that happened. People inside big
companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize.
Now their malaise becomes ours.
</p>
<p>
BTW, if Biden steps aside don’t expect the Repubs won’t sue saying it’s
illegal, so guess what – not only don’t you get Biden, you don’t even
get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with
just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for
appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the
arguments already written.

<p>This is on my bucket list to see performed live, but the closeup

watching the musicians get into it — the bass player was really going to
town. The coordination of dozens of people to play complex music
together is one […]</p>

<h2 id="todays-violence">Today’s violence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: Robert Reich’s blog</p>
<p>Friends, My first thought on hearing about the attempted shooting of
Donald Trump at a rally today in Pennsylvania was “I hope to god he’s
okay.” I thought this for the usual reasons we human beings hope that
other humans are safe from harm. But I had another reason in the case of
Donald Trump.</p>
