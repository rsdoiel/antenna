Schneier</a> has a new blog moderation policy. Everyone should have
<a href="https://this.how/commentGuidelines/">one</a>. He’s a bit of a
troll himself. Once he gave a talk at an O’Reilly conference, and while
I was in the audience, accused me of designing
<a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> to get around firewalls. I
happen to know that’s not true, and in fact you can <i>easily</i> spec a
firewall rule that keeps out XML-RPC calls, that was a design goal. So I
waited my turn, and explained. He just stood there, offered no apology
or retraction or explanation. Now that’s fucked up Bruce. From that
point on I never believed any of his proclamations. And I rarely forget
people who openly trash my rep like that. Tech is so fucked up that way.
People like Schneier take advantage of the fact that people don’t
understand the terminology so they get away with hurling insults
randomly like that.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in North Korea, Russian president Vladimir Putin and North
Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a security partnership between their
countries that said they would “provide mutual assistance in case of
aggression.” The two authoritarian leaders essentially resurrected a
1961 agreement between North Korea and the Soviet Union. According to
the North Korean News Agency, the agreement also calls for the two
countries to work together toward a “just and multipolar new world
order.”</p>

<p>
I’m so sick of these frigid overnight lows we’ve been having every day.
Our whole flat drops down to about 10° overnight and stays there all day
except for the rooms we run heaters in. It’s so constraining, feeling
like only one room at a time is even hospitable to human life…
</p>
<p>
Not sure whether Gidget is also sick of the frigid temperatures, or
whether she’s relishing the opportunity to insist on hours and hours of
cuddles. Because she’s definitely been doing that. Hard to get housework
done or whatever when it’s <em>so</em> cold out there and I could sit
still, under covers, with a cat on my lap instead.

<p>Why did the Podcast 2.0 people reinvent
<a href="http://home.rsscloud.co/">rssCloud</a>? That’s the kind of
bullshit Google does. We don’t do that in the open formats and protocols
world. What really pains me is they claim to follow
<a href="https://this.how/standards/">my</a> Rules for Standards-makers.
Imho they do not. Two rules apply.
<a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000">Rule #1</a> says the
only reason we do this is interop. It’s called Rule #1 for a reason. And
the <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way</a> rule
a little further down the page. I’ve seen this happen twice where people
say they abide by the <a href="https://this.how/standards/">RFSM</a> but
then do exactly the opposite of what it says to do. We have to do this
better people. Come on. Also come up with something more humble than the
name you’ve chosen. We’ve been down this path. The only way it ends is
in

<p>Now that I’m publishing a podcast feed designed to be read in
commercial podcast clients, I’m learning for the first time how they
work. For example, they seem to list shows not in the order they
discovered them, as I do in my products, rather in order of pubDate. So
when I set the dates on the shows from 2004 to their actual dates, that
would have worked if I hadn’t made a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/19.html#a151601">mistake</a> in
GMT-encoding the dates. Stupid programmer (me). Now they will show up
first in the lists forever unless I switch to that form of dates. This
so totally sucks. I wish there were something in RSS to say “Hey readers
dump your cache now, let’s start over, because I fcuked up.” It wouldn’t
have mattered anyway, I’m sure none of them would listen, right?</p>

Mundango</a>
</p>
<p>
I’ve got something for you. Lately I’ve been getting a lot of joy from
life’s small moments; like texting an old friend, seeing a cool bug, or
a watching the cardinals zip through my backyard. To nudge my brain
towards absorbing more of these mundane pleasures, I built a little
game.
</p>
<p>
Mundango is a game about finding life’s normal things. Each day you get
a new game of moments to capture and enjoy. It’s up to you how you play.
You can play it like Pokémon Go and try to catch ’em all or you can
visit the board at the end of the day for a bit of reflection. Me? I
plunk on it when I’ve got a few spare minutes throughout the day.
</p>
<p>
I’ve got a couple feature requests on deck but it’s at a point where I’d
love more feedback.
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@davatron5000/112611154594927376">The
activities were crowdsourced on Mastodon</a> so if you have some more
suggestions of small simple moments that bring you joy, I’d love to hear
them. Or if you have general ideas about what would this more
interesting (e.g., a turtle mascot), let me know.

there are side-effects, but both make possible great feats that weren’t
possible before, and both have come about just in the last year or

place</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-20, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I started to write the code to hook up my linkblogger to Threads, but it
led me to the same website with all my broken Facebook apps, the ones
that stopped working when they shut down the API after the 2016
election. A reminder that this is still Facebook. And while I don’t
blame them for shutting down the APIs, the whole experience left a
really bad feeling.
</p>
<p>
So I backed out of the project to give it some more thought. Do I really
want to go down this road?
</p>
<p>
And of course I had the cute little kitten illustrate.

</p>
<p>
A cute little kitten is sitting at a desk with a laptop, preparing to
write an app. The laptop screen shows code for the Threads API from
Meta. The kitten has a surprised and concerned expression as she looks
at the developer site on another screen, which shows a Facebook logo and
reminds her of the events of 2016. In the background, a calendar shows
the year 2024. The scene is set in a cozy room with soft lighting and a
few toys scattered around, giving it a homely feel.

<p>People of my generation (born 1955) are at the point in our lives
when we would feel better if we got credit for our accomplishments, good
intentions, the ways we made the world better, but it’s dawning on us
that we didn’t make as much of a difference as we hoped to, and what
little we did accomplish will largely go unrecognized. Even worse, none
of it, even in the short term, made much of a difference. 😂Threads API

<p>
Interesting summary of various ways to
<a href="https://keymaterial.net/2024/06/15/reconstructing-public-keys-from-signatures/">derive
the public key</a> from digitally signed files.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Normally, with a signature scheme, you have the public key and want to
know whether a given signature is valid. But what if we instead have a
message and a signature, assume the signature is valid, and want to know
which public key signed it? A rather delightful property if you want to
attack anonymity in some proposed “everybody just uses cryptographic
signatures for everything” scheme.

<p>
So I think my Plex Media Server is basically kaput. The computer got
unplugged somehow, and when I tried rebooting it, the unattended
upgrades have broken the Linux install to the point that not even
“recovery mode” works any more. I thought Linux Mint was supposed to be
kind of idiot-proof but clearly not, lol. Next time I think I’ll try
Debian Stable… because clearly what I need is something
<strong>stable</strong>! Geez.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I cancelled my Spotify subscription a few months ago so I guess
I’m resorting to YouTube Music now. The experience of using this instead
of Plexamp will surely boot my arse into gear to re-setup the Plex
server sooner rather than later 😐

<p>Today is the federal holiday honoring Juneteenth, the celebration of
the announcement in Texas on June 19th, 1865, that enslaved Americans
were free. That announcement came as late as it did because, while
General Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to
General Ulysses S. Grant of the U.S. Army on April 9, 1865, it was not
until June 2 that General Edmund Kirby Smith surrendered the
Trans-Mississippi Department, the last major army of the Confederacy, to
the United States, in Galveston, Texas. Smith then fled to Mexico.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-19, updated: 2024-06-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of toxicity in the comments section of this blog.
Recently, we’re having to delete more and more comments. Not just spam
and off-topic comments, but also sniping and personal attacks. It’s
gotten so bad that I need to do something.
</p>
<p>
My options are limited because I’m just one person, and this website is
free, ad-free, and anonymous. I pay for a part-time moderator out of
pocket; he isn’t able to constantly monitor comments. And I’m unwilling
to require verified accounts.
</p>
<p>
So starting now, we will be pre-screening comments and letting through
only those that 1) are on topic, 2) contribute to the discussion, and 3)
don’t attack or insult anyone. The standard is not going to be “well, I
guess this doesn’t technically quite break a rule,” but “is this
actually contributing.”…

<p>Technical note. I made a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/19/datesoff.png">mistake</a>
in converting local time to GMT in the code that builds the feed. My
times were off by four hours. So I corrected them. And now instead of
three items in the feed, according to my own feed software, there are
now six. I bet all the
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298">other</a>
systems will do the same thing because the guid is a function of the
creation date of the item, and they changed. Oh well. At least the
<a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">RSS version</a> only has
three items. I think I should change how the guid works.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I loved being my own DJ with Napster, and none of the execs or
journalists figured out that this was the appeal of getting all the
music out from behind the incredibly obsolete and brutal paywall that
the music industry had concocted. They didn’t give a shit about the
users except they wanted our money, there was no love in the connection
between the creativity of the artists and the creativity of the users.
We supposedly didn’t have any.
</p>
<p>
I’m like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Chapman">Emmett
Chapman</a>, an accomplished musician who created a new kind of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Stick">musicial
instrument</a> for himself and others to use. That’s what I do with
software. I play the tools I make. But what I really get off on is the
music the users make. I was thinking about my father yesterday, it would
have been his 95th birthday. He died at 80, so there’s been plenty of
time to process his life as I knew it. The best connection he and I had
was silent. I inherited my love for outliners from him, yet that love
was latent probably for hundreds of generations in our family. I had the
skill and creativity to create such a tool, and finally the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">technology</a>
existed, and he let his son turn his mind upside down and inside out.
For that he would say Every day is Father’s Day. That may be my greatest
accomplishment.
</p>
<p>
I was chatting with my brother yesterday, ChatGPT came up, and I thought
(and said) I bet dad would have loved ChatGPT. Then I thought of our
uncle Ken, on my mother’s side, and said he would have shit his pants
over ChatGPT. Ken spent literally hours every day with the meager
reference tools he owned in his off the grid cottage near St Augustine.
The way I love ChatGPT is the way he would have loved it. I’m absolutely
sure of it. My paternal grandfather would have loved it, and I expect my
great uncle
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt">Arno</a> who was a
pioneer of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">zettlekasten</a>
would have also lost his shit over ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
Which leads me to the art of a user of ChatGPT (which really needs a
shorter name). People’s first reaction is that by creating art with
ChatGPT I’m stealing. Bollocks. I’m creating. I’m not even going to
validate that with a rebuttal. I am proving it with the
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Patriotic+Kitten%22">Patriotic

<h2 id="the-feedland-stack">The FeedLand stack</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
One of the cool things about the way I designed FeedLand internally is
that there are various levels of feed stuff. If you want to start over
at any level, you can, and today I’m doing exactly that. But first
here’s the stack:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
At the lowest level is the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/reallysimple">reallysimple
package</a>, which reads any feed and returns a consistent JavaScript
object, so the database code only ever sees one kind of feed. All the
differences between RSS and Atom are flattened, and features from the
source <a href="https://source.scripting.com/">namespace</a> are
included, where they are present.
</li>
<li>
Above that level is the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedlanddatabase">feedlanddatabase
package</a>, which has a Node API that does all the stuff with the SQL
database that FeedLand runs off. So if all you want to do is add feeds,
subscribe to them, add a user, subscribe to a reading list, build a
river, all that stuff is at this level. This is the level at which I’m
going to start building today.
</li>
<li>
Next level up is the
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedland">feedland package</a>,
which implements the REST interface, and handles all the runtime stuff
that the FeedLand client needs.
</li>
<li>
And the final level is the one the user interacts with, it runs in the
browser, and makes the REST calls to the feedland server. All the
rendering of the objects coming out of the database via the REST
interface happens here.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In an
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/16.html#a112207">application</a>
I’m working on, I found myself reimplementing features of FeedLand, and
I stopped myself and said, nooooo use the API that’s already there. The
advantages are many, including I will be able to use FeedLand to manage
the data structures. So that’s what I’m doing. Wish me luck.

Hacking of Culture and the Creation of Socio-Technical Debt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-19, updated: 2024-06-18, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Culture is increasingly mediated through algorithms. These algorithms
have splintered the organization of culture, a result of states and tech
companies vying for influence over mass audiences. One byproduct of this
splintering is a shift from imperfect but broad cultural narratives to a
proliferation of niche groups, who are defined by ideology or aesthetics
instead of nationality or geography. This change reflects a material
shift in the relationship between collective identity and power, and
illustrates how states no longer have exclusive domain over either.
Today, both power and culture are increasingly corporate…

<p>I’m highly motivated to support the newly released Threads API, but a
quick look indicates that it’s a fairly large project. All I want to do
is cross-post, along with Masto and Bluesky. I did both those a loooong
time ago. But I really want my links to go to threads, and also create a
thread-writer for it like the one I did for Twitter and Bluesky. There’s
no shortage of really interesting projects now, so I think I’m going to
have to wait to do this for a while. If anyone makes a really simple
Hello World for Threads for Node.js that would make my day. <span

power. I have a more general story: The political and economic systems
of governance that were created in the mid-18th century are poorly
suited for the 21st century. They don’t align incentives well. And they
are being hacked too effectively.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the cost of these hacked systems has never been
greater, across all human history. We have become too powerful as a
species. And our systems cannot keep up with fast-changing disruptive
technologies…

<p>Leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) met for their fiftieth summit in
Italy from June 13 to June 15. Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
the United Kingdom, and the United States formed the G7 in 1975 as a

<h2 id="twenty-years-ago-today">Twenty years ago today</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I was talking with a friend over the weekend about the origins of
podcasting, and how, in June of 2004, I finally decided to do an audio
post, to get my feet wet, and to prove all you needed was a laptop and a
little software and you could be doing radio almost as easily as writing
a blog post.
</p>
<p>
That was
<a href="http://scripting.com/2004/06/11.html#When:9:13:45AM">June 11,
2004</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then it hit me, it’s June <i>2024</i> now, it’s been <i>twenty freaking
years</i>.
</p>
<p>
In hindsight, that podcast was the start of the bootstrap that saw a
dozen shows by September and then hundreds and thousands, and now here
we are, podcasting has been through quite a few bursts of growth and
it’s still as open as it was back in June 2004.
</p>
<p>
<b>Anyone with a laptop can do a podcast</b>. That was the goal. You
don’t need anyone’s permission. That was a breakthrough in radio. Prior
to that, you had to get a lot of approval, and every step made it less
real and less interesting, imho.
</p>
<p>
My partner in this at the time was
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Adam+Curry">Adam
Curry</a>. Sometime in that period he started
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Source_Code">The Daily
Source Code</a>, and then we did a podcast together for a few months
called <a href="http://secrets.scripting.com/">Trade Secrets</a>. My own
podcast was called <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning
Coffee Notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
So I thought, why not do a Serial-like podcast over the next few months,
with the actual programs from 2004, along with the Trade Secrets shows.
I think I have them all archived. And it would be great if Adam did the
same with his shows, starting when they started. And Dawn &amp; Drew,
Dave Slusher. This can go on forever if you like. (I promise mine
won’t.)
</p>
<p>
So here’s the URL for the podcast.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml</a>
</p>
<p>
I’m sure there will be a lot of cringeworthy moments, but what the heck.
I’ll hopefully have the feed up before the end of the day, and I’ll
register it with Apple so will hopefully be transcripts.
</p>
<p>
I hope I can count on you to spread the word, this is how the podcasting
bootstrap happened. If you want to learn how two weird geek hippie types
like Adam and myself, can have an idea, and then by constantly trying
out new approaches, eventually it sticks and becomes a new medium that’s
still thriving twenty years later.
</p>
<p>
It should be quite a story! :-)
</p>
<p>
Here’s a picture of myself and Adam at Gnomedex in the summer of 2004.
And that’s the laptop I used to make all these podcasts. I was living in
Seattle at the time.

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@lkh" title="@lkh@social.sdfeu.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="lkh">@lkh</span></a>,
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="kyonshi">@kyonshi</span></a> and I have
been trying to connect our servers using old tech for quite a while.
</p>
<h2 id="uucp">
UUCP
</h2>
<p>
The latest effort has been in connecting our servers using <em>Unix to
Unix copy</em> (UUCP). The benefit is that once you have that, you can
also have <em>remote command execution over UUCP</em> using
<code>uux</code> and it is as terrifying as it sounds.
</p>
<p>
Let’s see whether I can reconstruct my setup.
</p>
<p>
I use Debian.
</p>
<p>
lkh has a “travelling laptop” that is mostly offline, but sometimes it’s
online. That’s when he wants to exchange stuff with us. The laptop is
called Dwalin.
</p>
<p>
My server is Campaign Wiki.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for peering between news servers via UUCP is available
via <code>man 8 send-uucp</code>.
</p>
<h3 id="var-spool-uucp-ssh-authorized-keys">
/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys
</h3>
<p>
This allows Dwalin to connect via ssh.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins public key, ssh executes the remote
# uucico and hands over my login:
restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Udwalin -l&quot; ssh-rsa another-long-string-of-stuff uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-passwd">
/etc/uucp/passwd
</h3>
<p>
This is where Dwalin’s password is stored. This is important because
there’s no actual Dwalin user on my system.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me this.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins login on campaignwiki
Udwalin some-long-string-of-stuff
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-sys">
/etc/sys
</h3>
<p>
I kept the defaults and added Dwalin.
</p>
<pre><code># dwalins system entry, no Port or
# credentials are given, since dwalin
# is expected to always call in.
system dwalin
called-login Udwalin
local-send /
local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
time any
forward ANY
protocol i
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-uucp-config">
/etc/uucp/config
</h3>
<p>
This is where I set my own node name.
</p>
<p>
lkh sent me some spool related entries. I’m not sure whether I needed
them.
</p>
<pre><code>nodename campaignwiki

spool     /var/spool/uucp
pubdir    /var/spool/uucppublic
lockdir   /var/spool/uucp/Lock
logfile   /var/spool/uucp/Log     # The UUCP log file
statfile  /var/spool/uucp/Stats   # The UUCP statistics file
debugfile /var/spool/uucp/Debug   # The UUCP debugging file
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it">
Testing it
</h3>
<p>
In our case, lkh’s Dwalin is connected to kyonshi’s Erebor system and
here’s me sending a file to Erebor via Dwalin (since I’m not connected
to Erebor directly):
</p>
<pre><code>uucp some-local-file 'dwalin!ereborbbs.duckdns.org!~/'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="news">
News
</h2>
<p>
Yes, we want to exchange news. That means we need to install INN.
</p>
<p>
Look at the requisites:
</p>
<pre><code>perldoc /usr/lib/news/bin/send-uucp.pl
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-send-uucp-cf">
/etc/news/send-uucp.cf
</h3>
<p>
This define the sites to send news to, how to compress them and how big
the batches should be.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin      gzip        1048576
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-newsfeeds">
/etc/news/newsfeeds
</h3>
<p>
Determine the newsgroups to send to Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code># newsfeed entry for dwalin
dwalin\
    :casa.*,campaignwiki.*,erebor.*\
    :Tf,Wnb,B4096/1024:
</code></pre>
<h3 id="var-lib-news-active">
/var/lib/news/active
</h3>
<p>
Add the new newsgroups. We don’t do control messages.
</p>
<p>
Use <code>ctlinnd</code> to control the INN daemon.
</p>
<pre><code>ctlinnd newgroup erebor.talk y
ctlinnd newgroup erebor.test y
</code></pre>
<h3 id="var-lib-news-newsgroups">
/var/lib/news/newsgroups
</h3>
<p>
Give the new newsgroups a tag line.
</p>
<p>
Add the following:
</p>
<pre><code>erebor.talk             General talk for EreborBBS
erebor.test             Testing connectivity with EreborBBS
</code></pre>
<h3 id="etc-news-readers-conf">
/etc/news/readers.conf
</h3>
<p>
Make sure the users connecting via NNTP can read the new groups, too.
This is not necessary if you read news via the local spool, I think.
</p>
<p>
Add <code>erebor.*</code> to the “readonly” section.
</p>
<pre><code>auth &quot;foreignokay&quot; {
    auth: &quot;ckpasswd -f /var/lib/news/newsusers&quot;
    default: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;

Oh yes, we do.

<p>
Debian comes with Exim. Exim uses Perl’s “taint” mechanism wherein
user-supplied values cannot be used for commands. They must be untainted
by a lookup. For example, a user supplied sender name like “alex” is
tainted, but if you look it up in <code>/etc/passwd</code> it becomes
untainted. Perl keeps track of this for you, if you want to. Once you
run into the error, however, you need to figure out where you could be
looking up the values you have. Is the local part a user on the system,
is the domain a local domain? I spent way too much time on this.

A new router for UUCP mail that has to come before
<code>200_exim4-config_primary</code>. If it comes after the primary,
then it won’t work because the primary router ends with
<code>no_more</code> and as the comment at the end of the file says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <code>no_more</code> above means that all later routers are for
domains in the local_domains list

<p>
This router only accepts mail destined for domains listed in the new
file <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>### uucp

This is a file that translates the domain names I use for recipients to

</p>
<p>
It only works for Dwalin:
</p>
<pre><code>dwalin   dwalin
</code></pre>
<p>
This means that a mail for <code>lkh@dwalin</code> gets recognised as
such (because of the first column) and it will be sent to the UUCP
system <code>dwalin</code> (because of the second column).
</p>
<p>
The UUCP system <code>dwalin</code> is correct because
<code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> has a section for <code>system dwalin</code>
(see above).

<p>
This was the biggest problem for me. The examples I saw for the
<code>-a</code> argument to <code>uux</code> used
<code>$sender_address</code>, resulting in an error about the third
argument to <code>uux</code> being tainted. You can see these error
messages in the exim main log (followed by a log entry showing that exim
sends me a en error message):

</code></pre>
<p>
I guess the examples I had seen would only work for older Exim versions
that didn’t do taint checking.
</p>
<p>
The code I’m using means that I’m looking up the sender local part
(“alex” or “root”) in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and if a match is found,
the untainted key is returned (instead of the value from the password
list).
</p>
<p>
You can test these expressions on the command-line:
</p>
<pre><code>exim -d+all -be '${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}'
</code></pre>
<h3 id="testing-it-2">

<p>
As an ordinary user, use <code>mail</code> on the command line to send
mail to <code>lkh@dwalin</code>.
</p>
<p>
Poor <code>lkh</code>. So many test mails.
</p>
<p>
As <code>root</code>, check the exim log:
</p>
<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus:~# tail /var/log/exim4/mainlog

<h2 id="using-llms-to-exploit-vulnerabilities">Using LLMs to Exploit
Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-17, updated: 2024-06-11, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research: “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01637">Teams
of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</a>.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> LLM agents have become increasingly sophisticated,
especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Researchers have shown that
LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a
description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems.
However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities
that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities).
</p>
<p>
In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world,
zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior agents struggle with exploring many
different vulnerabilities and long-range planning when used alone. To
resolve this, we introduce HPTSA, a system of agents with a planning
agent that can launch subagents. The planning agent explores the system
and determines which subagents to call, resolving long-term planning
issues when trying different vulnerabilities. We construct a benchmark
of 15 real-world vulnerabilities and show that our team of agents
improve over prior work by up to 4.5×…

<h2 id="imagine-rss-as-a-cover-story">Imagine RSS as a cover story</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> has never been
on the cover of a magazine, so you can’t say ChatGPT is stealing this
from anyone. In fact I’m offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press
has chosen to focus on the idea that it’s plagiarizing journalists. The
ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If they’re doing
their jobs, they’re reporting facts that exist whether or not they wrote
a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a local paper
that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series">NLCS</a>.
I don’t owe a news org anything if I wrote that the Mets won, because I
read the news on their site. The news doesn’t belong to them.
</p>
<p>
The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn’t so
far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no
billionaires involved, so they didn’t consider it newsworthy I guess.
Some day we’re going to have to accept that we have to make our own
news, in the sense of Scoop Nisker’s famous line – “If you don’t like
the news go out and make some of your own.” So here we go. I asked
ChatGPT to imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story.

Imagine RSS as the cover story.
</div>
</p>
<p>
PS: Does the concept of a cover story even exist now that we rarely read
printed magazines?

written a crawler for the network of blogrolls via
<a href="https://opml.org/blogroll.opml">connective links</a> in HTML
and/or RSS feeds. When I started the project, I had no idea what I’d
find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don’t know the extent
of it, but there’s a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I’m
thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the
blogrolls, and see what we get from that. And I’m beginning to see the
utility of <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> as a feed
operating system, which is what I wanted it to be. It’s not just a feed
reader. It’s able to do things most feed readers don’t do, maybe none
do. We don’t have a good grasp of the depth of the feed products either.
I will of course share the results when they are shareable.</p>

<p>Three movies I’ve watched in the last few days: 1. Fight Club. 2. The
Matrix. 3. The Devil’s Advocate. I had seen all of them before. But they
go together. And they’re all about the same thing, about choosing to
live in a dream, or to live the life you’re actually living. All three
are excellent movies that I watched straight through from beginning to
end, which is really unusual for me these days.</p>

you’re voting for when you go MAGA and what you could get if you sit
this one out or cast a protest vote of some kind.</p>

<p>I spent so much time in my friend Mike’s house growing up that I knew
his parents as Mama and Papa. His father, Kenneth Edward Nyboe, was born
in 1924 in New York City but spent his summers in Maine, where he knew
my mother and my aunt and where he met, and secretly married, my aunt’s
friend Helen Bryant just before he shipped overseas to be in the tank
corps with Patton’s Third Army in World War II.</p>
