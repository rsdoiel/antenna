## How one company is working with PGA TOUR Pros like Peter Malnati to inspire communities to Be Bright

date: 2024-10-31, updated: 2024-10-31, from: Marianas Variety

(BPT) - Murals aren’t just large-scale works of art — though they function all on their own to beautify public spaces. They also serve as powerful platforms for cultural expression and highlight the vibrancy of their communities. According to research from nonprofit Americans for the Arts, art in public spaces (like murals) can positively impact a community's economic growth and stability, attachment and cultural identity, social cohesion and cultural understanding, and public health and belonging. A new mural recently revealed in Knoxville, Tennessee, aims to do just that.

## How AI is advancing hearing aids, in real time

date: 2024-10-31, updated: 2024-10-31, from: Marianas Variety

(BPT) - Hearing loss is often called a “silent epidemic” because it can develop slowly and go unnoticed for years. According to the National Council on Aging, more than 60 million Americans over the age of 12 experience some degree of hearing loss, and nearly one in three of them is 65 or older. In reality, this number is higher — these are just the ones we know about. There's a silent legion of people who struggle to hear the TV and understand conversations in background noise yet don't take the next step of getting their hearing checked. If you’re one of these people, you’re putting yourself at increased risk for depression, social withdrawal, and worse.

## VOTE or else you know WHAT!

date: 2024-10-28, updated: 2024-10-29, from: Marianas Variety

THE Truth is WE the People need to “get-out &amp; VOTE” even though this is a midterm election it is still critical to our very future and quality of life. Statistical data has proven that “the lower the voter turnout can be equated to the very quality of government” as it is directly tied to having an accountable government.  If WE don’t hold those in office accountable on election day then WE have not done OUR job, as citizens have a fiduciary DUTY to “be informed &amp; vote.” So, if you are one who gets in the voting booth and doesn’t know WHO someone is, it can be a good sign not to vote for them or a bad sign that you didn’t do your homework as a voter.

## It’s all politics at the Vatican in ‘Conclave’

date: 2024-10-28, updated: 2024-10-29, from: Marianas Variety

(AP) — In Edward Berger’s “Conclave,” the selection of the pope is no holy affair. Instead, it’s a petty, political campaign carried out in secrecy, where gossip flows, agendas are malleable and loyalties are fleeting. All are there to serve God, they say. But we all know how helpful that has been in conflicts throughout history. “Conclave” might not have much new or interesting to say about the Catholic Church, but it is a deliriously fun watch in the way that tense, smart thrillers with an ensemble of great actors can be.

## Steves: Taking in the splendor of Granada

date: 2024-10-27, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>It&#8217;s sunset, and I&#8217;m at the place to be in Granada &#8212; the breathtaking San Nicol&#0225;s viewpoint overlooking the fortress of the Alhambra. Here, at the edge of the city&#8217;s exotic Moorish quarter, lovers, widows, and tourists jostle for the best view of the hill-capping, floodlit fortress, the last stronghold of the Moorish kingdom in Spain. For more than 700 years, Spain, the most Catholic of countries, lived under Muslim rule, until the Christians retook the land in 1492.</p>
