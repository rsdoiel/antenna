<h2 id="unix-like-things">Unix-like things</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-26, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I sent a
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1816831709351977372">tweet</a>
to Eric Raymond, lightly edited here, basically following up on a thread
that started in <a href="http://scripting.com/2001/02/20.html">2001</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s good to see you tweeting. A long time ago you
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070517142407/http://www.xmlrpc.com/stories/storyReader$1265">said</a>
XML-RPC, something I worked on, is Unix-like.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
XML-RPC, in particular, is very much in the Unix spirit. It’s
deliberately minimalist but nevertheless quite powerful, offering a way
for the vast majority of RPC applications that can get by on passing
around boolean/integer/float/string datatypes to do their thing in a way
that is lightweight and easy to to understand and monitor. This simple
type ontology acts as a valuable check on interface complexity.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It’s very true, my design goal for my whole 50+ year career has been to
factor my code so well so it was as clean as Unix is, from top to bottom
</p>
<p>
The virtue of relentless factoring is you can build higher if each layer
of the stack lets through the functionality that’s needed, and no more.
Ideally there should be one way of doing something. and it should work
pretty well.
</p>
<p>
I realized that the web, RSS and podcasting are also a Unix-like things.
</p>
<p>
Because they can be made to do anything, but are simple, not a lot to
understand.
</p>
<p>
But – there’s been this huge proliferation of languages and frameworks,
and incredibly complex and underspecified formats.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile core functions like storage combined with identity for end
users, has not been implemented, because of course if the users had
their own networked data independent of any platform vendor there would
be no lockin. that’s 2024 version of the cathedral, to follow your
analogy.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, seeing you here made me think of this, I’ve wanted to say this
to you for a long to you and now I have. ;-)

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I am originally from Pennsylvania, went to school in Arizona, and ended
up in Dallas, Texas by way of Florida, Washington DC, and Bosnia and
Herzegovina. I studied Psychology and planned on pursuing graduate
studies in organizational psychology, but ended up in software fairly
quickly, within about a year of graduating. I was a developer for over a
decade, and then a CTO for almost another decade. I’m currently looking
for an opportunity where I can provide value to a business doing good in
the world.
</p>
<p>
I used to make music but haven’t done much of that for about 10 years. I
ride my bicycle as often as possible, usually a few times a week. And I
write on my blog!
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve always been interested in the ideas around Personal Knowledge
Management, so when I first saw Blogger and started blogging in 2001 I
thought of it as a public notebook. It still serves that purpose. It was
originally danielsjourney.com (still have the domain). I eventually
changed to daniel.industries.
</p>
<p>
My peak readership was during the blogging boom of the 2000s, which
coincided with my move to Bosnia, which people seemed to be interested
in.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
I use Notion for “capture” and have about 18 ideas in there. I have
additional less-formed ideas tagged in my Logseq notes. I have 19 posts
in a drafts folder with another 516 stashed in there from private
writing websites I participated in a years ago. In theory, I will
someday get the good ones imported into the canonical notebook, but at
this rate, it might never happen.
</p>
<p>
I try to write and publish in one sitting, otherwise the post might
never get finished. I’m not afraid of editing a post after I’ve
published it, though. It’s my history, I can rewrite it if I want.
</p>
<p>
I also have <a href="https://daniel.industries/writing/">writing</a>
(for stories and articles) and
<a href="https://daniel.industries/music/">music</a> sections on the
site. I plan on adding a “projects” page as well.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://daniel.industries/blog/">The blog</a> currently has
3417 posts. I posted much more early on (2001-2008), before Twitter and
(some) maturity that came with age and experience…and I had a lot more
time for it back then.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
It’s less about my physical environment and more about my mental and
emotional environment. The other reason I’ve blogged less in the last 14
years is that my life allows for less quiet time for thinking. I will
have good ideas and make interesting connections while riding my bike,
or in the shower, or right before falling asleep, but as my life has
become more full with family and responsibilities, I find not many of
those ideas make it onto a page anywhere (yet alone become coherent
enough to go on the website).
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with a Ruby Rakefile I
brought with me from back when I used a gem called “Octopress” (which
has been abandoned), which adds quality-of-life command line tools for
managing posts, building, and publishing. I’ve also written a “backlink”
plugin for Jekyll (see
<a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2023/01/29/really-basic-backlinks-in-jekyll/">Really
Basic Backlinks in Jekyll</a>).
</p>
<p>
While I have used Jekyll for over 10 years, before that I used Blogger,
Moveable Type, WordPress, LiveJournal, and multiple versions of my own
PHP CMS system (see
<a href="https://daniel.industries/2017/12/26/swim-stock-take-part-2/">SWIM
Stock-take Part 2</a>). But I’ve been a static site generator person for
a long time. I think 11ty is probably better at this point, but so far I
haven’t felt the need to move off Jekyll.
</p>
<p>
See
<a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2024/02/29/to-find-an-alternative-to-wordpress-just-go-back-to-the-beginning/">To
Find an Alternative to Wordpress, Just Go Back to the Beginning</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve hosted on DreamHost since forever. I’ve had my domains with Hover
for a long time.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
Static site generators seem to be all the rage these days, for good
reason. Having everything as a flat file you can manage via source
control and easily move around, search, mass update from your text
editor of choice…it’s better than having everything locked into a
database in the cloud (or even on your computer), even if the product
allows for easy exports. See
<a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2018/08/14/web-artifact-permanence/">Web
Artifact Permanence</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
The hosting is somewhere between <span class="math inline">$100-200 per
year (I was kept at a lower price for a while, and I think that is over
soon). I could host on GitHub or similar for free, but I have a handful
of sites I host on DreamHost, so it is just easier to manage them all in
one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was bullish on tools that would allow individual artists to
monetize their work without the need for middlemen, I even ran a
nonprofit from 2003-2005 (see &lt;a
href="https://www.daniel.industries/2016/03/15/goodbye-integration-research/"&gt;Goodbye
Integration Research Dot Org&lt;/a&gt;) that was working on exactly that
problem. I was excited when &lt;a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9NjntTUJ1Q"&gt;Jack Conte first
talked about Patreon at XOXO&lt;/a&gt; (I was there in person--and it is
still a good talk). Now we're there, and Patreon has to enshittify to
appease investors, and Substack has to harbor fascists and pop modals in
my face all the time, and I'm not so sure about the entire idea. I think
it is better to just have something you can sell. It's hard. I think if
you don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to monetize your online work, that's
better. There are too many pseudo-intellectual influencers out there,
and too few Kottkes, &lt;a
href="https://www.themarginalian.org/"&gt;Popovas&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a
href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/"&gt;Westenbergs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us just hanging out in our digital living rooms on the
cozy web are doing ok without having to perform for our
audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a
href="https://www.daniel.industries/2017/05/13/on-blogging/"&gt;On
Blogging&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping a personal blog in 2017 feels relatively futile. But
while everyone else is &lt;del&gt;storing&lt;/del&gt; throwing their
stories, artifacts, thoughts, and meanings into the stream for others to
consume on their phones while taking a dump or bored at lunch or while
consuming some other media entirely, those of us who store our work on
&lt;em&gt;actual domains&lt;/em&gt; do it for ourselves--and our legacy.
And while permalinks may--and do--rot faster than last week's bananas,
the content is still &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...or &lt;a
href="https://www.daniel.industries/2016/09/05/rebels-episode-2/"&gt;Rebels:
Episode 2&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating content on the internet and actually owning all of
that content and retaining complete control over that content is still
one of the most culturally radical things one can do. Sure, the
marketers of the world will tell you you’re wasting your time, but that
is only if your horizon for meaningful impact in the world has shortened
to the amount of time a news story remains in your social network
feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nazhamid.com/"&gt;Naz Hamid&lt;/a&gt; is a
web OG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/"&gt;Ludicity&lt;/a&gt;
is getting a lot of attention lately for their hot takes full of
humanity, and for good reason&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://labnotes.org/"&gt;Labnotes by Assaf
Arkin&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best weekly link list blogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thisisindexed.com/"&gt;Indexed&lt;/a&gt;
has been consistently posting witty drawings on index cards since
2006&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jaredigital.com/"&gt;Jared
Christensen&lt;/a&gt; for music and design thoughts since
2003&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...rapid-fire style, for the sake of time: Tim Bray, Rands in
Repose, Robin Rendle, Robin Sloan, Surfing Complexity, John Cutler, Uses
This, Tom Critchlow, Ribbonfarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should interview &lt;a
href="https://maggieappleton.com/"&gt;Maggie
Appleton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://saner.ai/"&gt;Saner.ai&lt;/a&gt; is a
writing/PKM-focused AI tool that actually works and is being actively
developed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://omnivore.app/home"&gt;Omnivore&lt;/a&gt;
is a free and OSS read later (and RSS reader) app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://huffduffer.com/"&gt;Huffduffer&lt;/a&gt;
lets you create a custom podcast feed for yourself from any audio file
on the internet.&lt;/li&gt;

<h2 id="openai-beta-tests-searchgpt-search-engine">OpenAI beta tests
SearchGPT search engine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Normally I’m not that interested in reporting on news coming from
OpenAI, but today is a little different – the company launched
SearchGPT, a search engine that’s supposed to rival Google, but at the
same time, they’re also kind of not launching a search engine that’s
supposed to rival Google. What? We’re testing SearchGPT, a prototype of
new search features designed to combine the strength of our AI models
with information from the web to give you fast and timely answers with
clear and relevant sources. We’re launching to a small group of users
and publishers to get feedback. While this prototype is temporary, we
plan to integrate the best of these features directly into ChatGPT in
the future. If you’re interested in trying the prototype, sign up for
the waitlist. ↫ OpenAI website Basically, before adding a more
traditional web-search like feature set to ChatGPT, the company is first
breaking them out into a separate, temporary product that users can
test, before parts of it will be integrated into OpenAI’s main ChatGPT
product. It’s an interesting approach, and with just how stupidly
popular and hyped ChatGPT is, I’m sure they won’t have any issues
assembling a large enough pool of testers. OpenAI claims SearchGPT will
be different from, say, Google or AltaVista, by employing a
conversation-style interface with real-time results from the web.
Sources for search results will be clearly marked – good – and
additional sources will be presented in a sidebar. True to the
ChatGPT-style user interface, you can keep “talking” after hitting a
result to refine your search further. I may perhaps betray my still
relatively modest age, but do people really want to “talk” to a machine
to search the web? Any time I’ve ever used one of these chatbot-style
user interfaces -including ChatGPT – I find them cumbersome and
frustrating, like they’re just adding an obtuse layer between me and the
computer, and that I’d rather just be instructing the computer directly.
Why try and verbally massage a stupid autocomplete into finding a link
to an article I remember from a few days ago, instead of just typing in
a few quick keywords? I am more than willing to concede I’m just out of
touch with what people really want, so maybe this really is the future
of search. I hope I can just always disable nonsense like this and just
throw keywords at the problem.</p>

threads, one core: how simultaneous multithreading works under the
hood</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Simultaneous multithreading (SMT) is a feature that lets a processor
handle instructions from two different threads at the same time. But
have you ever wondered how this actually works? How does the processor
keep track of two threads and manage its resources between them? In this
article, we’re going to break it all down. Understanding the nuts and
bolts of SMT will help you decide if it’s a good fit for your production
servers. Sometimes, SMT can turbocharge your system’s performance, but
in other cases, it might actually slow things down. Knowing the details
will help you make the best choice. ↫ Abhinav Upadhyay Some light

id="intel-raptor-lake-faults-excessive-voltage-from-microcode-fix-coming-in-august">Intel:
Raptor Lake faults excessive voltage from microcode, fix coming in
August</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>In what started last year as a handful of reports about instability
with Intel’s Raptor Lake desktop chips has, over the last several
months, grown into a much larger saga. Facing their biggest client chip
instability impediment in decades, Intel has been under increasing
pressure to figure out the root cause of the issue and fix it, as claims
of damaged chips have stacked up and rumors have swirled amidst the
silence from Intel. But, at long last, it looks like Intel’s latest saga
is about to reach its end, as today the company has announced that
they’ve found the cause of the issue, and will be rolling out a
microcode fix next month to resolve it. ↫ Ryan Smith at AnandTech It
turns out the root cause of the problem is “elevated operating
voltages”, caused by a buggy algorithm in Intel’s own microcode. As
such, it’s at least fixable through a microcode update, which Intel says
it will ship sometime mid-August. AnandTech, my one true source for
proper reporting on things like this, is not entirely satisfied, though,
as they state microcode is often used to just cover up the real root
cause that’s located much deeper inside the processor, and as such,
Intel’s explanation doesn’t actually tell us very much at all. Quite
coincidentally, Intel also experienced a manufacturing flaw with a small
batch of very early Raptor Lake processors. An “oxidation manufacturing
flaw” found its way into a small number of early Raptor Lake processors,
but the company claims it was caught early and shouldn’t be an issue any
more. Of course, for anyone experiencing issues with their expensive
Intel processors, this will linger in the back of their minds, too. Not
exactly a flawless launch for Intel, but it seems its main only
competitor, AMD, is also experiencing issues, as the company has delayed
the launch of its new Ryzen 9000 chips due to quality issues. I’m not at
all qualified to make any relevant statements about this, but with the
recent launch of the Snapdragon Elite X and Pro chips, these issues
couldn’t come at a worse time for Intel and AMD.</p>

<p>We’re at a huge fork in the road. One fork – goodbye USA, the other
way, we’re stronger than ever. We’re in a good spot imho because Trump’s
tank is empty. He’s old, tired, fat, addled, fetid, rotten. You have to
work really hard not to see that. If it works, Biden will have
stabilized the country, and Harris will erect the guardrails that make
sure no one follows in Trump’s path, and the Supreme Court gets back
into its proper place. They’ve been overthrowing our society, economy
and political system. That all has to be reversed before it does too
much damage, and prevented in the future. I want to know why the court
can’t be expanded, and if Harris will put that in her platform.</p>

<p>Software-wise I realized recently that everything that takes me away
from creating really nice writing and publishing tools is a waste. I
have to get off track because there are huge holes in the web as a
runtime platform. And every year it gets worse as new incompatible
languages are added, new incompatible stacks built. As a result we have
to re-do everything all the time, and never get a chance to create new
user experience. The market fragments, which is exactly what the tech
companies want. It keeps their products from becoming commodities. And
like it or not, the politicians and corporations don’t want us writing
too much, they just want us working, donating to their campaigns, paying
taxes, buying their crap, and not getting all agitated about things they
don’t care about.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-24-gridmapper-local">
2024-07-24 Gridmapper Local
</h1>
<p>
I was wondering whether I should get back to Gridmapper, but not using
Javascript and the web but using Common Lisp. I spent some time on this
<a href="2022-07-20_Gridmapper_CL">two years ago</a>. Of course by now I
have forgotten everything – like how to build it!
</p>
<p>
This is the Makefile that seems to work, given that I have both
<code>gridmapper.asd</code> and <code>gridmapper.lisp</code> in the
current directory.
</p>
<pre><code>SHELL = /bin/sh
LISP ?= sbcl --non-interactive
PWD   = $(shell pwd)

build:
    $(LISP) --eval '(asdf:load-asd &quot;$(PWD)/gridmapper.asd&quot;)' \
    --eval '(asdf:load-system :gridmapper)' \
    --eval '(asdf:make :gridmapper)' \
    --eval '(quit)'
</code></pre>
<p>
Surely there is a better way to do this?
</p>
<p>
If I replace <code>(asdf:load-system :gridmapper)</code> with
<code>(ql:quickload :gridmapper)</code> it no longer gives me a warning
about <code>cl-colors.asd</code> which I don’t know anything about. I
guess the warning is still preferable because it means no dependency on
Quicklisp? I have no idea. The
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/gridmapper-local.git">README</a>
comes with a long explanation of what to install and how to do it, in
order to build Gridmapper – including the use of Quicklisp.
</p>
<p>
The hairiest part is that I need access to a function that isn’t
exported from the Cairo package. So now I’m accessing the private
function (using two colons):
</p>
<pre><code>;; Sorry for the ugly hack… cairo_format_stride_for_width is not exported.
(cairo::cairo_format_stride_for_width :CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32 (surface-width surface)))))
</code></pre>
<p>
Two years ago, there was a different solution to this that apparently no
longer works. 🤷
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Common_Lisp">#Common Lisp</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-25</strong>. Another option would be to switch to a
different binding of the SDL2 library, of course.
<code>hu.dwim.sdl</code> sounds like the package I need? Sadly, there is
no documentation. The SDL2 symbols are translated by the rules given
into Common Lisp symbols. Given my lack of understanding, that makes it
difficult. Furthermore, the binding I’ve been using until now came with
hand-written convenience methods such as <code>with-rects</code> that
don’t exist in this other binding. There is some porting to do. And
given all of that… I must confess that it makes me tired.
</p>
<p>
Using the browser as a universal user-interface is a pretty cool idea!
Even if the application itself is a stand-alone program that can act as
a web-server (like <a href="Oddmu">Oddmu</a>), all the hard parts are
abstracted away: line-breaks, hyphenation, spell-checking when writing.
Perhaps using the canvas is hard? But using the DOM and SVG is something
I’ve done countless times and by now I know my way around.
</p>
<p>
Sigh.
</p>
<p>
I suspect something like the following is required for every symbol that
I want to use:
</p>
<pre><code>(defun render-fill-rect (&amp;rest args) (apply 'HU.DWIM.SDL.FFI::|SDL_RenderFillRect| args))
</code></pre>
<p>
And then take a look at the arguments. The other SDL2 binding already
has this.
</p>
<p>
<code>rect.lisp</code> defines these:
</p>
<pre><code>(defun make-rect (x y w h)
  &quot;Allocate and return a new SDL_Rect filled in with the arguments.&quot;
  (c-let ((rect sdl2-ffi:sdl-rect))
    (setf (rect :x) x
          (rect :y) y
          (rect :w) w
          (rect :h) h)
    rect))

(define-struct-accessors (rect sdl2-ffi:sdl-rect)
  :x :y (width :w) (height :h))
</code></pre>
<p>
<code>render.lisp</code> defines this:
</p>
<pre><code>(defun render-fill-rect (renderer sdl-rect)
  &quot;Use this function to fill a rectangle on the current rendering target with
the drawing color. &quot;
  (check-rc (sdl2-ffi.functions:sdl-render-fill-rect renderer sdl-rect)))
</code></pre>
<p>
So I am between a rock and a hard place. The SDL2 bindings I had were
pretty good. They don’t come with bindings for SDL2/gfx so I would I
need to do the missing legwork myself. Which I could do.
</p>
<p>
Or I could stick with Javascript and the web.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, the situation for the Cairo library doesn’t appear to be much
better. The function <code>format-stride-for-width</code> is not
exported and I suspect nobody is actively working on the library.
<a href="https://github.com/rpav/cl-cairo2/issues/25">My issue</a> has
no reaction since Jul 20, 2022.

<h2 id="freebsd-as-a-platform-for-your-future-technology">FreeBSD as a
platform for your future technology</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Choosing an operating system for new technology can be crucial for
the success of any project. Years down the road, this decision will
continue to inform the speed and efficiency of development. But should
you build the infrastructure yourself or rely on a proven system? When
faced with this decision, many companies have chosen, and continue to
choose, FreeBSD. Few operating systems offer the immediate high
performance and security of FreeBSD, areas where new technologies
typically struggle. Having a stable and secure development platform
reduces upfront costs and development time. The combination of
stability, security, and high performance has led to the adoption of
FreeBSD in a wide range of applications and industries. This is true for
new startups and larger established companies such as Sony, Netflix, and
Nintendo. FreeBSD continues to be a dependable ecosystem and an
industry-leading platform. ↫ FreeBSD Foundation A FreeBSD marketing
document highlighting FreeBSD’s strengths is, of course, hardly a
surprise, but considering it’s fighting what you could generously call
an uphill battle against the dominance of Linux, it’s still interesting
to see what, exactly, FreeBSD highlights as its strengths. It should
come as no surprise that its licensing model – the simple BSD license –
is mentioned first and foremost, since it’s a less cumbersome license to
deal with than something like the GPL. It’s philosophical debate we
won’t be concluding any time soon, but the point still stands. FreeBSD
also highlights that it’s apparently quite easy to upstream changes to
FreeBSD, making sure that changes benefit everyone who uses FreeBSD.
While I can’t vouch for this, it does seem reasonable to assume that
it’s easier to deal with the integrated, one-stop-shop that is FreeBSD,
compared to the hodge-podge of hundreds and thousands of groups whose
software all together make up a Linux system. Like I said, this is a
marketing document so do keep that in mind, but I still found it
interesting.</p>

Participation Reports to encourage best practices in open metadata</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-25, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
We’ve just released an update to our
<a href="http://crossref.org/members/prep" target="_blank">participation
report</a>, which provides a view for our members into how they are each
working towards best practices in open metadata. Prompted by some of the
signatories and organizers of the
<a href="https://barcelona-declaration.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona
Declaration</a>, which Crossref supports, and with the help of our
friends at <a href="https://www.cwts.nl/" target="_blank">CWTS
Leiden</a>, we have fast-tracked the work to include an updated set of
metadata best practices in participation reports for our members. The
reports now give a more complete picture of each member’s activity.
</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-participation">
What do we mean by ‘participation’?
</h2>
<p>
Crossref runs open infrastructure to link research objects, entities,
and actions, creating a lasting and reusable scholarly record. As a
not-for-profit with over 20,000 members in 160 countries, we drive
metadata exchange and support nearly 2 billion monthly API queries,
facilitating global research communication.
</p>
<p>
To make this system work, members strive to provide as much metadata as
possible through Crossref to ensure it is openly distributed throughout
the scholarly ecosystem at scale rather than bilaterally, thereby
realizing the collective benefit of membership. Together, our membership
provides and uses a rich nexus of information— known as
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus">the
research nexus</a>—on which the community can build tools to help
progress knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Each member commits to certain terms, such as keeping metadata current,
updating links for their DOIs to redirect to, linking references and
other objects, and preserving their content in perpetuity. Beyond this,
we also encourage members to register as much rich metadata as is
relevant and possible.
</p>
<p>
Creating and providing richer metadata is a key part of participation in
Crossref; we’ve long encouraged a more complete scholarly record, such
as through <a href="https://metadata2020.org" target="_blank">Metadata
20/20</a>, and through supporting or leading initiatives for specific
metadata, like open citations (I4OC), open abstracts (I4OA), open
contributors (<a href="https://orcid.org" target="_blank">ORCID</a>),
and open affiliations
(<a href="https://ror.org" target="_blank">ROR</a>).
</p>
<h2 id="which-metadata-elements-are-considered-best-practices">
Which metadata elements are considered best practices?
</h2>
<p>
Alongside basic bibliographic metadata such as title, authors, and
publication date(s), we encourage members to register metadata in the
following fields:

</figure>
<p></span></p>
</div>
<h4 id="references">
References
</h4>
<p>
A list of all the references used by a work. This is particularly
relevant for journal articles but the references can include any type of
object, including datasets, versions, preprints, and more. Additionally,
we encourage these to be added into
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/principles-practices/best-practices/relationships/">relationships</a>,
where relevant.
</p>
<h4 id="abstracts">
Abstracts
</h4>
<p>
A description of the work. These are particularly useful for discovery
systems that will promote the work, and are often used in downstream
analyses such as for detecting integrity issues.
</p>
<h4 id="contributor-ids-orcid">
Contributor IDs (ORCID)
</h4>
<p>
All authors should be included in a work’s metadata, ideally alongside
their verified ORCID identifier.
</p>
<h4 id="affiliations--affiliation-ids-ror">
Affiliations / Affiliation IDs (ROR)
</h4>
<p>
Members are able to register contributor affiliations as free text, but
we are encouraging everyone to add ROR IDs for affiliations as the
recommended best practice, as this differentiates and avoids mistyping.
These two fields have newly been added to the participation reports
interface in the most recent update.
</p>
<h4 id="funder-ids-ofr">
Funder IDs (OFR)
</h4>
<p>
Acknowledging the organization(s) that funded the work. We encourage the
inclusion of
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/">Open
Funder Registry</a> identifiers to make the funding metadata more
usable. This will evolve into
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror/">an
additional use case for ROR</a> over time.
</p>
<h4 id="funding-award-numbers--grant-ids-crossref">
Funding award numbers / Grant IDs (Crossref)
</h4>
<p>
A number or identifier assigned by the funding organization to identify
the specific award of funding or other support such as use of equipment
or facilities, prizes, tuition, etc. The
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/grant-linking-system/">Crossref
Grant Linking System</a> includes a unique persistent link that can be
connected with outputs, activities, people, and organizations.
</p>
<h4 id="crossmark">
Crossmark
</h4>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/">Crossmark
service</a> gives readers quick and easy access to the current status of
a record, including any corrections, retractions, or updates, via a
button embedded on PDFs or a web article. Openly adding corrections,
retractions, and errata is critical part of publishing, and the button
provides readers with an easy in-context alert.
</p>
<h4 id="similarity-check-urls">
Similarity Check URLs
</h4>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/">Similarity
Check service</a> helps editors to identify text-based plagiarism
through our collective agreement for the membership to access to
Turnitin’s powerful text comparison tool, iThenticate. Specific
fill-text links are required to participate in this service.
</p>
<h4 id="license-urls">
License URLs
</h4>
<p>
URLs pointing to a license that explains the terms and conditions under
which readers can access content. These links are crucial to denote
intended downstream use.
</p>
<h4 id="text-mining-urls">
Text mining URLs
</h4>
<p>
Full-text URLs that help researchers in meta-science easily locate your
content for text and data mining.
</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-participation-report">
What is a participation report?
</h2>
<p>
Participation reports are are a visualization of the data representing
members’ participation to the scholarly record which is available via
our open REST API. There’s a separate participation report for each
member, and each report shows what percentage of that member’s metadata
records include 11 key metadata elements. These key elements add context
and richness, and help to open up members work to easier discovery and
wider and more varied use. As a member, you can use participation
reports to see for yourself where the gaps in your organization’s
metadata are, and perhaps compare your performance to others.
Participation reports are free and open to everyone - so you can also
check the report for any other members you are interested in.
</p>
<p>
We first
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/321-its-lift-off-for-participation-reports/">introduced</a>
participation reports in 2018. At the time, Anna Tolwinska and Kirsty
Meddings wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Metadata is at the heart of all our services. With a growing range of
members participating in our community—often compiling or depositing
metadata on behalf of each other—the need to educate and express
obligations and best practice has increased. In addition, we’ve seen
more and more researchers and tools making use of our APIs to harvest,
analyze and re-purpose the metadata our members register, so we’ve been
very aware of the need to be more explicit about what this metadata
enables, why, how, and for whom.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
All of that still rings true today. But as the research nexus continues
to evolve, so should the tools that intend to reflect it. For example,
in 2022, we removed the <em>Open references</em> field from
participation reports after
<a href="blog/amendments-to-membership-terms-to-open-reference-distribution-and-include-uk-jurisdiction/">a
board vote to change our policy and update the membership terms</a>
meant that <em>all</em> references deposited with Crossref would be open
by default. And now we’ve expanded the list of fields again, adding
coverage data for contributor affiliation text and ROR identifiers.

<p>
To find out how you measure up when it comes to participation, type the
name of your member organization into the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">search
box</a>. You may be surprised by what you find—we often speak to members
who thought they were registering a certain type of metadata for all
their records, only to learn from their participation report that
something is getting lost along the way.

You can only

<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Not everything made by KDE uses C++. This is probably obvious to some
people, but it’s worth mentioning nevertheless. And I don’t mean this as
just “well duh, KDE uses QtQuick which is written with C++ and QML”. I
also don’t mean this as “well duh, Qt has a lot of bindings to other
languages”. I mean explicitly “KDE has tools written primarily in
certain languages and specialized formats”. ↫ Thiago Sueto If you ever
wanted to contribute to KDE but weren’t sure if your preferred
programming language or tools were relevant, this is a great blog post
detailing how you can contribute if you are familiar with any of the
following: Python, Ruby, Perl, Containerfile/Docker/Podman,
HTML/SCSS/JavaScript, Web Assembly, Flatpak/Snap, CMake, Java, and Rust.
A complex, large project like KDE needs people with a wide variety of
skills, so it’s definitely not just C++. An excellent place to
start.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
In the summer of 1947, I was on vacation in Almelo. Earlier that year,
on the same day as my best friend and inseparable study mate, Brain Jan
Loopstra, I had successfully passed the qualifying exams in mathematics
and physics. The mandatory brief introduction to the three major
laboratories—the Physics Laboratory, the V.d. Waals Laboratory, and the
Zeeman Laboratory—was behind us, and we were about to start our doctoral
studies in experimental physics. For two years, we would be practically
working in one of the aforementioned laboratories.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
One day, I received a telegram in Almelo with approximately the
following content: "Would you like to assist in building an automatic
calculating machine?" For assurance, another sentence was added:
"Mr. Loopstra has already agreed." The sender was "The Mathematical
Center," according to further details, located in Amsterdam. I briefly
considered whether my friend had already confirmed my cooperation, but
in that case, the telegram seemed unnecessary, so I dismissed that
assumption. Both scenarios were equally valid: breaking up our
long-standing cooperation (dating back to the beginning of high school)
was simply unthinkable. Furthermore, the telegram contained two
attractive points: "automatic calculating machine" and "Mathematical
Center," both new concepts to me. I couldn’t deduce more than the name
suggested. Since the cost of a telegram exceeded my budget, I posted a
postcard with my answer and resumed my vacation activities. Those of you
who have been involved in recruiting staff will, I assume, be filled
with admiration for this unique example of recruitment tactics: no fuss
about salary or working hours, not to mention irrelevant details like
pension, vacation, and sick leave. For your reassurance, it should be
mentioned that I was indeed offered a salary and benefits, which, in our
eyes, were quite generous.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
I wasn’t too concerned about how the new job could be combined with the
mandatory two-year laboratory work. I believed that a solution had to be
found for that. And a solution was found: the laboratory work could be
replaced by our work at the Mathematical Center.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Upon returning to Amsterdam, I found out the following: the Mathematical
Center was founded in 1946, with a goal that could roughly be inferred
from its name. One of the departments was the ‘Calculation Department,’
where diligent young ladies, using hand calculators—colloquially known
as ‘coffee grinders’—numerically solved, for example, differential
equations (in a later stage, so-called ‘bookkeeping machines’ were added
to the machinery). The problems dealt with usually came from external
clients. The head of the Calculation Department was Dr. ir. A. van
Wijngaarden. Stories about automatic calculating machines had also
reached the management of the Mathematical Center, and it was clear from
the outset that such a tool—if viable—could be of great importance,
especially for the Calculation Department. However, it was not possible
to buy this equipment; those who wanted to discuss it had to build it
themselves. Consequently, it was decided to establish a separate group
under the Calculation Department, with the task of constructing an
automatic calculating machine. Given the probable nature of this group’s
activities, it was somewhat an oddity within the Mathematical Center,
doomed to disappear, if not after completing the first machine, then
certainly once this kind of tool became a normal trade
object.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
We were not the only group in the Netherlands involved in constructing
calculating machines. As we later discovered, Dr. W.L. v.d. Poel had
already started constructing a machine in 1946.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Our direct boss was Van Wijngaarden, and our newly formed two-man group
was temporarily housed in a room of the Physics Laboratory on Plantage
Muidergracht, where Prof. Clay was in charge. Our first significant act
was the removal of a high-voltage installation in the room, much to the
dismay of Clay, who was fond of the thing but arrived too late to
prevent the disaster. Then we thought it might be useful to equip the
room with some 220V sockets, so we went to Waterlooplein and returned
with a second-hand hammer, pliers, screwdriver, some wire, and a few
wooden (it was 1947!) sockets. I remember wondering whether we could
reasonably submit the exorbitant bill corresponding to these purchases.
Nonetheless, we did.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
After providing our room with voltage, we felt an unpleasant sensation
that something was expected from us, though we had no idea how to start.
We decided to consult the sparse literature. This investigation yielded
two notable articles: one about the ENIAC, a digital (decimal) computer
designed for ballistic problems, and one about a differential analyzer,
a device for solving differential equations, where the values of
variables were represented by continuously variable physical quantities,
in this case, the rotation of shafts. The first article was abominably
written and incomprehensible, and as far as we understood it, it was
daunting, mentioning, for instance, 18,000 vacuum tubes, a number we
were sure our employer could never afford. The second article (by V.
Bush), on the other hand, was excellently written and gave us the idea
that such a thing indeed seemed buildable.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Therefore, it had to be a differential analyzer, and a mechanical one at
that. As we now know, we were betting on the wrong horse, but first, we
didn’t know that, and second, it didn’t really matter. Initially, we
were not up to either task simply because we lacked any electronic
training. We were supposed to master electricity and atomic physics, but
how a vacuum tube looked inside was known only to radio amateurs among
us, and we certainly were not. Our own (preliminary) practicum
contained, to my knowledge, no experiment in which a vacuum tube was the
object of study, and the physics practicum for medical students (the
so-called ‘medical practicum’), where we had supervised for a year as
student assistants, contained exactly one such experiment. It involved a
rectifier, dated by colleagues with some training in archaeology to
about the end of the First World War. The accompanying manual prescribed
turning on the ‘plate voltage’ only tens of seconds after the filament
voltage, and the students had to answer why this instruction was given.
The answers were sometimes very amusing. One such answer I won’t
withhold from you: ‘That is to give the current a chance to go around
once.’<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Our first own experiment with a vacuum tube would not have been out of
place in a slapstick movie. It involved a triode, in whose anode circuit
we included a megohm resistor for safety. Safely ensconced behind a
tipped-over table, we turned on the ‘experiment.’ Unlike in a slapstick
movie, nothing significant happened in our case.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
With the help of some textbooks, and not to forget the ‘tube manuals’ of
some manufacturers of these useful objects, we somewhat brushed up on
our electronic knowledge and managed to get a couple of components,
which were supposed to play a role in the differential analyzer, to a
state where their function could at least be guessed. They were a moment
amplifier and a curve follower. How we should perfect these devices so
that they would work reliably and could be produced in some numbers
remained a mystery to us. The solution to this mystery was never found.
Certainly not by me, as around this time (January 1948), I was summoned
to military service, which couldn’t do without me. During the two years
and eight months of my absence (I returned to civilian life in September
1950), a drastic change took place, which I could follow thanks to
frequent contacts with Loopstra.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
First, the Mathematical Center, including our group, moved to the
current building at 2nd Boerhaavestraat 49. The building looked somewhat
different back then. The entire building had consisted of two
symmetrically built schools. During the war, the building was
requisitioned by the Germans and used as a garage. In this context, the
outer wall of one of the gymnasiums was demolished. Now, one half was
again in use as a school, and the other half, as well as the attic above
both halves, was assigned to the Mathematical Center. The Germans had
installed a munitions lift in the building. The lift was gone, but the
associated lift shaft was not. Fortunately, few among us had suicidal
tendencies. The frosted glass in the toilet doors (an old school!) had
long since disappeared; for the sake of decorum, curtains were hung in
front of them.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Van Wijngaarden could operate for a long time over a hole in the floor
next to his desk, corresponding with a hole in the ceiling of the room
below (unoccupied). Despite his impressive cigar consumption at that
time, I didn’t notice that this gigantic ashtray ever filled
up.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The number of employees in our group had meanwhile expanded somewhat;
all in all, perhaps around five.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The most significant change in the situation concerned our further
plans. The idea of a differential analyzer was abandoned as it had
become clear that the future belonged to digital computers. Upon my
return, a substantial part of such a computer, the ‘ARRA’ (Automatische
Relais Rekenmachine Amsterdam), had already been realized. The main
components were relays (for various logical functions) and tubes (for
the flip-flops that composed the registers). The relays were Siemens
high-speed relays (switching times in the order of a few milliseconds),
personally retrieved by Loopstra and Van Wijngaarden from an English war
surplus. They contained a single changeover contact (break-before-make),
with make and break contacts rigidly set, although adjustable. Logically
appealing were the two separate coils (with an equal number of
windings): both the inclusive and exclusive OR functions were within
reach. The relays were mounted on octal bases by us and later enclosed
in a plastic bag to prevent contact contamination.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
They were a constant source of concern: switching times were unreliable
(especially when the exclusive OR was applied) and contact degradation
occurred nonetheless. Cleaning the contacts (‘polishing the pins’) and
resetting the switching times became a regular pastime, often involving
the girls from the Calculation Department. The setting was done on a
relay tester, and during this setting, the contacts were under
considerable voltage. Although an instrument with a wooden handle was
used for setting, the curses occasionally uttered suggested it was not
entirely effective.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
For the flip-flops, double triodes were used, followed by a power tube
to drive a sufficient number of relays, and a pilot lamp for visual
indication of the flip-flop state. Since the A had three registers, each
30 bits wide, there must have been about 90 power tubes, and we noted
with dismay that 90 power tubes oscillated excellently. After some time,
we knew exactly which pilot lamp socket needed a 2-meter wire to
eliminate the oscillation.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
At a later stage, a drum (initially, the instructions were read from a
plugboard via step switches) functioned as memory; for input and output,
a tape reader (paper, as magnetic tape was yet to be invented) and a
teleprinter were available. A wooden kitchen table served as the control
desk.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Relays and tubes might have been the main logical building blocks, but
they were certainly not the only ones. Without too much exaggeration, it
can be said that the ARRA was a collection of what the electronic
industry had to offer, a circumstance greatly contributed to by our
frequent trips to Eindhoven, from where we often returned with some
‘sample items.’ On the train back, we first reminisced about the
excellent lunch we had enjoyed and then inventoried to determine if we
brought back enough to cover the travel expenses. This examination
usually turned out positive.<o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
It should be noted that the ARRA was mainly not clocked. Each primitive
operation was followed by an ‘operation complete’ signal, which in turn
started the next operation. It is somewhat amusing that nowadays such a
system is sometimes proposed again (but hopefully more reliable than
what we produced) to prevent glitch problems, a concept we were not
familiar with at the time.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
Needless to say, the ARRA was so unreliable that little productive work
could be done with it. However, it was officially put into use. By
mid-1952, this was the case. His Excellency F.J. Th. Rutten, then
Minister of Education, appeared at our place and officially inaugurated
the ARRA with some ceremony. For this purpose, we carefully chose a
demonstration program with minimal risk of failure, namely producing
random numbers à la Fibonacci. We had rehearsed the demonstration so
often that we knew large parts of the output sequence by heart, and we
breathed a sigh of relief when we found that the machine produced the
correct output. In hindsight, I am surprised that this demonstration did
not earn us a reprimand from higher-ups. Imagine: you are the Minister
of Education, thoroughly briefed at the Department about the wonders of
the upcoming computing machines; you attend the official inauguration,
and you are greeted by a group explaining that, to demonstrate these
wonders, the machine will soon produce a series of random numbers. When
the moment arrives, they tell you with beaming faces that the machine
works excellently. I would have assumed that, if not with the truth, at
least with me, they were having a bit of fun. His Excellency remained
friendly, a remarkable display of self-control.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The emotions stirred by this festivity were apparently too much for the
ARRA. After the opening, as far as I recall, no reasonable amount of
useful work was ever produced. After some time, towards the end of 1952,
we decided to give up the ARRA as a hopeless case and do something else.
There was another reason for this decision. The year 1952 should be
considered an excellent harvest year for the Mathematical Center staff:
in March and November of that year, Edsger Dijkstra and Gerrit Blaauw
respectively appeared on the scene. Of these two, the latter is of
particular importance for today’s story and our future narrative. Gerrit
had worked on computers at Harvard, under the supervision of Howard
Aiken. He had also written a dissertation there and was willing to lend
his knowledge and insight to the Mathematical Center. We were not very
compliant boys at that time. Let me put it this way: we were aware that
we did not have a monopoly on wisdom, but we found it highly unlikely
that anyone else would know better. Therefore, the ‘newcomer’ was viewed
with some suspicion. Gerrit’s achievement was all the greater when he
convinced us in a lecture of the validity of what he proposed. And that
was quite something: a clocked machine, uniform building blocks
consisting of various types of AND/OR gates and corresponding
amplifiers, pluggable (and thus interchangeable) units, a neat design
method based on the use of two alternating, separate series of clock
pulses, and proper documentation.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
We were sold on the plan and got to work. A small difficulty had to be
overcome: what we intended to do was obviously nothing more or less than
building a new machine, and this fact encountered some political
difficulties. The solution to this problem was simple: formally, it
would be a ‘revision’ of the ARRA. The new machine was thus also called
ARRA II (we shall henceforth speak of A II), but the double bottom was
perfectly clear to any visitor: the frames of the two machines were
distinctly separated, with no connecting wire between them.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
For the AND/OR gates, we decided to use selenium diodes. These usually
arrived in the form of selenium rectifiers, a sort of firecrackers of
varying sizes, which we dismantled to extract the individual rectifier
plates, about half the diameter of a modern-day dime. The assembly—the
selenium plates couldn’t tolerate high temperatures, so soldering was
out of the question—was as follows: holes were drilled in a thick piece
of pertinax. One end of the hole was sealed with a metal plug; into the
resulting pot hole went a spring and a selenium plate, and finally, the
other end of the hole was also sealed with a metal plug. For connecting
the plugs, we thought the use of silver paint was appropriate, and soon
we were busy painting our first own circuits. Some time later, we had
plenty of reasons to curse this decision. The reliability of these
connections was poor, to put it mildly, and around this time, the
‘high-frequency hammer’ must have been invented: we took a small hammer
with a rubber head and rattled it along the handles of the units, like a
child running its hand along the railings of a fence. It proved an
effective means to turn intermittent interruptions into permanent ones.
I won’t hazard a guess as to how many interruptions we introduced in
this way. At a later stage, the selenium diodes were replaced by
germanium diodes, which were simply soldered.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The AND/OR gates were followed by a triode amplifier and a cathode
follower. ARRA II also got a drum and a tape reader. For output, an
electric typewriter was installed, with 16 keys operable by placing
magnets underneath them. The decoding tree for these magnets provided us
with the means to build an echo-check, and Dijkstra fabricated a routine
where, simultaneously with printing a number, the same number (if all
went well) was reconstructed. I assume we thus had one of the first
fully controlled print routines. Characteristic of ARRA II’s speed was
the time for an addition: 20 ms (the time of a drum
rotation).<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
ARRA II came into operation in December 1953, this time without
ministerial assistance, but it performed significantly more useful work
than its predecessor, despite the technical difficulties outlined
above.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The design phase of ARRA II marks for me the point where computer design
began to become a profession. This was greatly aided by the introduction
of uniform building blocks, describable in a multidimensional binary
state space, making the use of tools like Boolean algebra meaningful. We
figured out how to provide ARRA II with signed multiplicative addition
for integers (i.e., an operation of the form (A,S) := (M) * (±S’) + (A),
for all sign combinations of (A), (S), and (M) before and of the
result), despite the fact that ARRA II had only a counter as wide as a
register. As far as I can recall, this was the first time I devoted a
document to proving that the proposed solution was correct. Undoubtedly,
the proof was in a form I would not be satisfied with today, but still…
It worked as intended, and you can imagine my amusement when, years
later, I learned from a French book on computers that this problem was
considered unsolvable.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
In May 1954, work began on a (slightly modified) copy of ARRA II, the
FERTA (Fokker’s First Calculating Machine Type A), intended for Fokker.
The FERTA was handed over to Fokker in April 1955. This entire affair
was mainly handled by Blaauw and Dijkstra. Shortly thereafter, Blaauw
left the service of the Mathematical Center.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
In June 1956, the ARMAC (Automatic Calculating Machine Mathematical
Center), successor to ARRA II, was put into operation, several dozen
times faster than its predecessor. Design and construction took about 1½
years. Worth mentioning is that the ARMAC first used cores, albeit on a
modest scale (in total 64 words of 34 bits each, I believe). For
generating the horizontal and vertical selection currents for these
cores, we used large cores. To drive these large cores, however, they
had to be equipped with a coil with a reasonable number of windings.
Extensive embroidery work didn’t seem appealing to us, so the following
solution was devised: a (fairly deep) rim was turned from transparent
plastic. Thus, we now had two rings: the rim and the core. The rim was
sawed at one place, and the flexibility of the material made it possible
to interlock the two rings. Then, the coil was applied to the rim by
rotating it from the outside using a rubber wheel. The result was a
neatly wound coil. The whole thing was then encased in Araldite. The
unintended surprising effect was that, since the refractive indices of
the plastic and Araldite apparently differed little, the plastic rim
became completely invisible. The observer saw a core in the Araldite
with a beautifully regularly wound coil around it. We left many a
visitor in the dark for quite some time about how we produced these
things!<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
The time of amateurism was coming to an end. Computers began to appear
on the market, and the fact that our group, which had now grown to
several dozen employees, did not really belong in the Mathematical
Center started to become painfully clear to us. Gradual dissolution of
the group was, of course, an option, but that meant destroying a good
piece of know-how. A solution was found when the Nillmij, which had been
automating its administration for some time using Bull punch card
equipment, declared its willingness to take over our group as the core
of a new Dutch computer industry. Thus it happened. The new company,
N.V. Elektrologica, was formally established in 1956, and gradually our
group’s employees were transferred to Elektrologica, a process that was
completed with my own transfer on January 1, 1959. As the first
commercial machine, we designed a fully transistorized computer, the XI,
whose prototype performed its first calculations at the end of 1957. The
speed was about ten times that of the ARMAC.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
With this, I consider the period I had to cover as concluded. When I
confront my memories with the title of this lecture, it must be said
that ‘designing computers’ as such hardly existed: the activities that
could be labeled as such were absorbed in the total of concerns that
demanded our attention. Those who engaged in constructing calculating
machines at that time usually worked in very small teams and performed
all the necessary tasks. We decided on the construction of racks, doors,
and closures, the placement of fans (the ARMAC consumed 10 kW!), we
mounted power distribution cabinets and associated wiring, we knew the
available fuses and cross-sections of electrical cables by heart, we
soldered, we peered at oscillographs, we climbed into the machine armed
with a vacuum cleaner to clean it, and, indeed, sometimes we were also
involved in design.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
We should not idealize. As you may have gathered from the above, we were
occasionally brought to the brink of despair by technical problems.
Inadequate components plagued us, as did a lack of knowledge and
insight. This lack existed not only in our group but globally the field
was not yet mastered.<o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
<o:p> </o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">
However, it was also a fascinating time, marked by a constant sense of
‘never before seen,’ although that may not always have been literally
true. It was a time when organizing overtime, sometimes lasting all
night, posed no problem. It was a time when we knew a large portion of
the participants in international computer conferences at least by
sight!<o:p></o:p>

<h2 id="on-goals-online-projects-and-the-usefulness-of-money">On goals,
online projects, and the usefulness of money</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I’m currently a &lt;em&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://getkirby.com/partners&quot;&gt;Certified Kirby Partner&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;. Fancy title, I know. What that means is that I paid some money, last summer, to be listed on a website. This upcoming August, I will no longer be a &lt;em&gt;“Certified Kirby Partner”&lt;/em&gt; because I am not going to pay money—again—to be listed on a website. But my certified status is not what I want to write about. It’s just an excuse to talk about the role money plays in achieving goals in the context of online projects.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Most online projects exist to fulfil a goal. Sometimes that goal is
stated, sometimes it’s implied. And money may or may not be an aid in
achieving said goal. I was chatting about online communities with
<a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog">Kev</a> the other day and we both
reached the same conclusion that in order to create something meaningful
in that space it has to be a paid product. Not because you need that to
make it sustainable financially but because a monetary commitment—even a
small one—is a helpful tool to find people who are genuinely interested
in what you’re creating. You’re not likely to spend money on something
you don’t care about. So in that context, money is a helpful tool to
achieve the goal of creating a small community of people who care about
the shared space.
</p>
<p>
That same way of reasoning wouldn’t make sense for something like my
<a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> series. My
goal with that project is to help as many people as possible rediscover
the beauty of having a personal blog and owning your corner of the web,
and to encourage a healthier way to live online. Making it a paid series
wouldn’t help me reach that goal. It would probably be an obstacle. This
is why I started the series knowing it was going to be a cost for me
both in terms of time and in terms of actual money but it was one I was
willing to sustain because I believe it’s important.
</p>
<p>
It’s easy for me to commit to paying money when stated goals and
monetisation schemes are aligned. To bring it back to Kirby, I
absolutely love it both as a tool and as a project. It’s been run
fantastically for more than a decade by a great group of people and I
have nothing but positive things to say about it. I plan to keep using
it and buying licenses for as long as they stay in business. But it’s
also why I won’t pay again to be a <em>“Certified Kirby Partner”</em>.
Because there the stated goals and the monetisation scheme are not
aligned. As they say, money talks.

<h1 id="2024-07-24-my-ed-wondering">
2024-07-24 My ed, wondering
</h1>
<p>
Sometimes I have the urge to write a small editor, something like the
kilo project: so small that it is barely usable. I also imagine it to
have a sort of conversational UI – which I guess ed has? – if ed is your
grumpiest of companions! – or maybe the M-x commands for emacs – and I
guess I‘m looking at <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> as a site generator
and Markdown file server and I wonder: what sort of editor would I need
to maintain this? What sort of minimal SVG editing capabilities would be
nice to have?
</p>
<p>
What if I could use an ed-like “conversational” interface, with better
prompts, wrapped in <code>readline</code> for ‹Up, Return› combos to
repeat things, opening multiple files, switching between them, with
completion or menus, and saving it all in one go.
</p>
<p>
I think I will install <code>rlwrap</code> as a first step and wrap
<code>ed</code> and <code>mail</code> in it.
</p>
<p>
When I read the Wikipedia pages of <code>sam</code> and
<code>acme</code> I get the feeling that the started out at the same
point and then moved towards a different, full-screen, mouse-support
paradigm.
</p>
<p>
What would my ed have, in addition to ed?
</p>
<p>
My ed would have the notion of “units”. Perhaps these can be defined by
a separator marker, a regular expression. A “line” is a unit separated
by a newline, or a “beginning of line” regular expression. A “sentence”
is a unit separated by all sorts of punctuation followed by zero or more
quotes and one or more spaces, and so on. A “block” is a unit separated
by empty lines, or special line beginnings such as header markup or list
item markup. A “section” is a unit separated by line beginnings with
header markup. These unit names and the corresponding separators are
defined in a file, per type, so that they can be changed.
</p>
<p>
File types are associated with file extensions or special matches (such
as looking at the first two lines of a file).
</p>
<p>
My ed would have a config file so that it can be redefined in parts. For
example, every file type has special, system dependent commands to
“render” it, be it compilation, viewing, printing, etc. Perhaps mailcap
could be an interesting option to fall back to.
</p>
<p>
My ed would be line oriented and still offer keyboard navigation using
the arrows or vi-style keys. It would have two panes: the top one would
show the file content and a cursor or the highlighted unit. The bottom
one would be a command line history. The command line history shouldn’t
be a complete file buffer that can be edited, though, because the
temporal ordering seems important to me.
</p>
<p>
The navigation commands can also be used to modify the selection.
Ideally, using arrows to move, shift arrows to select, and typing
commands would all work seamlessly.
</p>
<p>
My ed would have commands that are words or even phrases, and can
defined more of them in files, and edit and “source” them into your
session. It would have understandable errors.
</p>
<p>
My ed would have a snarf buffer or a clipboard to use for cut, copy and
insert. Cutting and copying would work on whole units.
</p>
<p>
My ed would have infinite undo and redo and an auto-save file. Perhaps
the auto-save file would contain the redo script.
</p>
<p>
I’m starting to wonder whether I’m reinventing vi, here. 🤔

<h2 id="what-was-hard-about-the-oddµ-architecture">2024-07-21 What was
hard about the Oddµ architecture?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-24, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-21-what-was-hard-about-the-oddµ-architecture">
2024-07-21 What was hard about the Oddµ architecture?
</h1>
<p>
If you know Go, I think you’ll find the architecture of Oddmu to be very
traditional: There is a list of actions it knows how to handle when it
serves a site on the web and a list of commands it understands when
called from the shell. Everything involving HTML or the RSS feed uses a
Go template.
</p>
<p>
There were two things that were tricky, in hindsight. I didn’t know
enough Go to know how best to do it and so it took me a long time to
figure them out.
</p>
<p>
The first was what data to keep in memory. I didn’t want search to
involve a database so I experimented a lot with different ways of
indexing the content. Trigrams? Full-text? And what about scoring? In
the end, I dropped all of that. The only thing I keep in memory is a map
of page names and page titles as well as a map of hashtags and pages. I
find that searching titles and hashtags is what I do most often. For
everything else, I search the files. This, of course, is much slower but
for a site of ten thousand pages it’s still fast enough. So figuring out
how to do search was hard. Once I had this figured out, I discovered
that keeping maps in memory when there are multiple Go routines being
used by the web server means that I need locks. Both of my maps are in
fact data structures that each contain a map and a lock. This was new to
me and it took me a long time to realize that having the lock was
important. For a while, I didn’t have those locks. 😅
</p>
<p>
The second thing that took me a long time to get right is that I wanted
pages to be served from Oddµ when it runs as a web server and I wanted
to be able to edit files locally and upload them (using rsync, for
example) while it was still running on the server. I didn’t know about
watching the filesystem for changes and had to learn how to do this: a
watcher per directory, spawning new watchers when directories are
created, and updating those maps I keep in memory as files are added,
deleted or edited.
</p>
<p>
Watching the files introduced another complication, however: What if a
user edited a page via the web? I already had code in place that would
update my maps. Now the file system watcher would report the same file
being written to, resulting in two updates. And what about a change to a
file that results in multiple events: create a file, write something to
the file, write some more to the file. Three events resulting in three
updates? The code is therefore complicated.
</p>
<p>
If Oddµ knows that a file is going to change ahead of time, like when a
user on the web saves an edit, the file is added to a map of ignored
files for a second. When the file system watcher sees those changes, no
updates are done because it knows that the edit handler already does it.
</p>
<p>
If Oddµ sees a file change because of somebody editing files directly, a
one second timer is started. If another event for the same file arrives,
the timer is reset to one second. Only when a second has elapsed without
changes does the watcher do the updates to the internal data structures.
That is to say, changes made to the file system regarding page title
changes or hash tag changes take an effect on the web with a one second
delay.
</p>
<p>
So now, with all that in place, think of all the go routines running in
parallel. Every one second timer is a go routine. Every go routine
accessing a map like the map if files to ignore means that this map
needs to be a data structure containing a map and a lock.
</p>
<p>
When I look at that part of the code, I still get dizzy. 😵‍💫

<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bouncepaw">@bouncepaw</span></a> asked
about usability issues, specially in the context of using Oddµ for
picture galleries. In my case, I think the hardest part is finding
particular pictures. Consider <a href="2020-blumen/index">the page of
flowers in 2020</a>. I know that there’s a sanseveria in bloom on that
page, for example. But how can I find it? I can find the page if I
search for “bogenhanf #pictures”, and then I can search for the same
word on the page, and then I have to wait for a bit as the browser
lazy-loads pictures.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, if I could get into the habit of putting the image description
into the Markdown alt text, I could index all the images and their alt
text, providing direct access to the images. I guess I would also have
to add special code to the Markdown renderer that made the alt text
visible for regular visitors (as title attribute or as regular
paragraphs). That’d be interesting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Later</strong>. I have implemented something useful, I hope. If
one of the search terms (excluding hashtags and predicates) matches an
alt-text of an image, that image is included in the result.
</p>
<p>
Of course, almost none of my galleries use the alt-text, so right now
there aren’t many pages that will show results for a query like
“bogenhanf #pictures”.
</p>
<p>
My expectations regarding alt texts and title attributes for images have
changed significantly as I’ve spent time on fedi, so I’m really not sure
what to do about Markdown in this respect. Right now I’m in the habit of
adding neither alt-text nor title attribute, trying to provide enough
text in the paragraphs above or below. With this new search option, that
might have to change, too. As a sighted person, I sort of expect the
title attribute to be the same as the alt text.

<h2 id="new-samsung-phones-block-sideloading-by-default">New Samsung
phones block sideloading by default</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>The assault on a user’s freedom to install whatever they want on what
is supposed to be their phone continues. This time, it’s Samsung adding
an additional blocker to users installing applications from outside the
Play Store and its own mostly useless Galaxy Store. Technically, Android
already blocks sideloading by default at an operating system level. The
permission that’s needed to silently install new apps without prompting
the user, INSTALL_PACKAGES, can only be granted to preinstalled app
stores like the Google Play Store, and it’s granted automatically to
apps that request it. The permission that most third-party app stores
end up using, REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES, has to be granted explicitly by
the user. Even then, Android will prompt the user every time an app with
this permission tries to install a new app. Samsung’s Auto Blocker
feature takes things a bit further. The feature, first introduced in One
UI 6.0, fully blocks the installation of apps from unauthorized sources,
even if those sources were granted the REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES
permission. ↫ Mishaal Rahman I’m not entirely sure why Samsung felt the
need to add an additional, Samsung-specific blocking mechanism, but at
least for now, you can turn it off in the Settings application. This
means that in order to install an application from outside of the Play
Store and the Galaxy Store on brand new Samsung phones – the ones
shipping with OneUI 6.1.1 – you need to both give the regular Android
permission to do so, but also turn off this nag feature. Having two
variants of every application on your Samsung phone wasn’t enough,
apparently.</p>

won’t be deprecating third-party cookies from Chrome after all</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>This story just never ever ends. After delays, changes in plans, more
delays, we now have more changed plans. After years of stalling, Google
has now announced it is, in fact, not going to deprecate third-party
cookies in Chrome by default. In light of this, we are proposing an
updated approach that elevates user choice. Instead of deprecating
third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in Chrome that
lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web
browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time. We’re
discussing this new path with regulators, and will engage with the
industry as we roll this out. ↫ Anthony Chavez Google remains unclear
about what, exactly, users will be able to choose between. The consensus
seems to be that users will be able to choose between retaining
third-party cookies and turning them off, but that’s based on a
statement by the British Competition and Market Authority, and not on a
statement from Google itself. It seems reasonable to assume the CMA
knows what it’s talking about, but with a company like Google you never
know what’s going to happen tomorrow, let alone a few months from now.
While both Safari and Firefox have already made this move ages ago, it’s
taking Google and Chrome a lot longer to deal with this issue, because
Google needs to find different ways of tracking you that are not using
third-party cookies. Google’s own testing with Privacy Sandbox, Chrome’s
sarcastically-named alternative to third-party cookies, shows that it
seems to perform reasonable well, which should definitely raise some
alarm bells about just how private it really is. Regardless, I doubt
this saga will be over any time soon.</p>

I was playing around with CSS aspect-ratio now that it has solid
evergreen support, and wanted to see if I could apply it to Picture tags
(which I use for responsive imagery) in a smart, concise way. I wanted
to accomplish a few goals:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
No content shift on load
</li>
<li>
Display some sort of placeholder while images load
</li>
<li>
Ensure aspect-ratio is respected, especially when inside flexbox rows
and columns
</li>
<li>
(for funsies) styling the alt text on the placeholder when an image
fails to load for a pretty fallback
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I found several little tips and tricks around the web, but ultimately
the secret sauce was flex-basis and flex-grow settings.

Apparently there’s a way to have Oddµ and Eglot cooperate in Emacs using
<a href="https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman">Marksman</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that LSP integration only works in a “project”: a VCS repository,
or in the case of Marksman, a directory containing an (empty)
<code>.marksman.toml</code> file. This latter option is important if
your notes aren’t under version control.
</p>
<p>
After installing the Marksman binary, use something like the following.
This installs Eglot for Go mode, Perl mode and Markdown mode.

<pre><code>;; There is probably a way to put this inside the use-package form but
;; this is how it works for me.

<h2 id="no-southwest-airlines-is-not-still-using-windows-3.1">No,
Southwest Airlines is not still using Windows 3.1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>A story that’s been persistently making the rounds since the
CrowdStrike event is that while several airline companies were affected
in one way or another, Southwest Airlines escaped the mayhem because
they were still using windows 3.1. It’s a great story that fits the
current zeitgeist about technology and its role in society, underlining
that what is claimed to be technological progress is nothing but
trouble, and that it’s better to stick with the old. At the same time,
anybody who dislikes Southwest Airlines can point and laugh at the
bumbling idiots working there for still using Windows 3.1. It’s like a
perfect storm of technology news click and ragebait. Too bad the whole
story is nonsense. But how could that be? It’s widely reported by
reputable news websites all over the world, shared on social media like
a strain of the common cold, and nobody seems to question it or doubt
the veracity of the story. It seems that Southwest Airlines running on
an operating system from 1992 is a perfectly believable story to just
about everyone, so nobody is questioning it or wondering if it’s
actually true. Well, I did, and no, it’s not true. Let’s start with the
actual source of the claim that Southwest Airlines was unaffected by
CrowdStrike because they’re still using Windows 3.11 for large parts of
their primary systems. This claim is easily traced back to its origin –
a tweet by someone called Artem Russakovskii, stating that “the reason
Southwest is not affected is because they still run on Windows 3.1”.
This tweet formed the basis for virtually all of the stories, but it
contains no sources, no links, no background information, nothing. It
was literally just this one line. It turned out be a troll tweet. A
reply to the tweet by Russakovskii a day later made that very lear: “To
be clear, I was trolling last night, but it turned out to be true. Some
Southwest systems apparently do run Windows 3.1. lol.” However, that
linked article doesn’t cite any sources either, so we’re right back
where we started. After quite a bit of digging – that is, clicking a few
links and like 3 minutes of searching online – following the various
reference and links back to their sources, I managed to find where all
these stories actually come from to arrive at the root claim that
spawned all these other claims. It’s from an article by The Dallas
Morning News, titled “What’s the problem with Southwest Airlines
scheduling system?” At the end of last year, Southwest Airlines’
scheduling system had a major meltdown, leading to a lot of cancelled
flights and stranded travelers just around the Christmas holidays. Of
course, the media wanted to know what caused it, and that’s where this
The Dallas Morning News article comes from. In it, we find the
paragraphs that started the story that Southwest Airlines is still using
Windows 3.1 (and Windows 95!): Southwest uses internally built and
maintained systems called SkySolver and Crew Web Access for pilots and
flight attendants. They can sign on to those systems to pick flights and
then make changes when flights are canceled or delayed or when there is
an illness. “Southwest has generated systems internally themselves
instead of using more standard programs that others have used,”
Montgomery said. “Some systems even look historic like they were
designed on Windows 95.” SkySolver and Crew Web Access are both
available as mobile apps, but those systems often break down during even
mild weather events, and employees end up making phone calls to
Southwest’s crew scheduling help desk to find better routes. During
periods of heavy operational trouble, the system gets bogged down with
too much demand. ↫ Kyle Arnold at The Dallas Morning News That’s it.
That’s where all these stories can trace their origin to. These few
paragraphs do not say that Southwest is still using ancient Windows
versions; it just states that the systems they developed internally,
SkySolver and Crew Web Access, look “historic like they were designed on
Windows 95”. The fact that they are also available as mobile
applications should further make it clear that no, these applications
are not running on Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. Southwest pilots and cabin
crews are definitely not carrying around pocket laptops from the ’90s.
These paragraphs were then misread, misunderstood, and mangled in a game
of social media and bad reporting telephone, and here we are. The fact
that nobody seems to have taken the time to click through a few links to
find the supposed source of these claims, instead focusing on cashing in
on the clicks and rage these stories would illicit, is a rather damning
indictment of the state of online (tech) media. Many of the websites
reporting on these stories are part of giant media conglomerates, have a
massive number of paid staff, and they’re being outdone by a dude in the
Arctic with a small Patreon, minimal journalism training, and some
common sense. This story wasn’t hard to debunk – a few clicks and a few
minutes of online searching is all it took. Ask yourself – why do these
massive news websites not even perform the bare minimum?</p>

<p>All the reporters know the Repubs refused to fund border stuff so
they could use it to tag the Dems in the election. So the first thing
the Repubs do is tag VP Harris with the border. The reporter asks a Dem
what they have to say about that. But the reporter <i>knows</i> what the
Repubs did. So why do they even ask the freaking question? They just
play the script the Repubs wrote for them. They are so savvy, but we
heard all that too, so we know how corrupt they are. They don’t care if

<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A 20-minute morning coffee notes rambler
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/07/23/randomMorningCoffeeNotes.m4a">podcast</a>,
started with a narration of how we do linkblogging these days, mostly by
hand, and how Bluesky is being hurt by not having a large-enough
character limit. Another plea for textcasting, some standards for what
we put on the wire over the social web.
</p>
<p>
Also talked about twitter-like systems, and idea borrowed from
algol-like and lisp-like.
</p>
<p>
I talk about what made Unix so great.
</p>
<p>
Eric Raymond once told me that <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>
was very much like Unix, and I said oh yeah, and so is
<a href="http://reallysimple.org/">RSS</a> and the rest. Huge compliment
because the simplicity of Unix is what I strive for, put huge time into.
</p>
<p>
Journos once said Apple is dead, but that was ridiculous because they
had built a product that was just starting to grow and they had planted
the seeds of huge growth in the 80s when they focused on selling to
education, which made sure that kids when they grew up would have good
feelings about Apple, and it totally worked. When the reporters were
calling them dead, they were actually just about to boom in a whole new
way, on the web, which the Mac was perfect for, given the built in
simple networking. And then boom again when Jobs came back. And again
with the iPod and then again with the iPhone. See how reporters miss the
big picture. We shouldn’t give them so much power, they pretend they
know, but they are usually pretty clueless.
</p>
<p>
This podcast is also a demo of how my mind works. I flit around all over
the place but also have learned over the years that if I want to get
anything done I have to focus on one thing for at least a few hours
every day, and string those days together.
</p>
<p>
I want to document this stuff for the benefit of young programmers. I
learned a lot from reading the code of Unix, I always want to pay that
back, the message is to strive for simplicity, keep technical debt to a
minimum, and factor, factor and factor again to reduce technical debt.
Those are the hardest projects, I’m doing one of those right now, but in
the end it’s worth it, because with simplicity you get to build higher.

distribution system for the world will probably have the last laugh.
BTW, if you want to know why we’re so thrilled to have Harris as the
candidate, even though we didn’t want Joe to give in, it’s because no
informed and sane person wants to live in a new Trump term. We tried
that if you recall. The hope you hear now is much greater than the hope
we had when Obama was selling that (though hope was a good word for it).
Today it’s the hope that we won’t be deported or worse.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: O’Reilly Radar</p>
<p>Like almost any question about AI, “How does AI impact software
architecture?” has two sides to it: how AI changes the practice of
software architecture and how AI changes the things we architect. These
questions are coupled; one can’t really be discussed without the other.
But to jump to the conclusion, we can say that […]</p>

<p>
Today I tried to make the
<a href="https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib/blob/master/plugins/ircd/irc2">irc2</a>
plugin work for my IRC server.
</p>
<p>
Mostly fiddling with the regular expressions. Adding an optional comma.
Making it case-insensitive. The usual, I guess.
</p>
<p>
I was positively impressed by Debians pre-packaged Perl modules:
</p>
<pre><code>apt install libpoe-component-irc-perl libpoe-component-sslify-perl
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s the modified plugin for <code>/etc/munin/plugins</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
# -*- perl -*-

=head1 NAME

ircstats  - Plugin to graph data about an IRC network and a single IRC server

=head1 CONFIGURATION

You are right, there is too much code for this in static analyzers, and
(at least) without cfg and dfa it is difficult to make any assumptions.
But do we need recursion (in practice, not theoretically) for operators?
Maybe it's worth adding a {recursive} modifier to allow recursion?

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-dell-unix">A brief history of Dell UNIX</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>“Dell UNIX? I didn’t know there was such a thing.” A couple of weeks
ago I had my new XO with me for breakfast at a nearby bakery café. Other
patrons were drawn to seeing an XO for the first time, including a Linux
person from Dell. I mentioned Dell UNIX and we talked a little about the
people who had worked on Dell UNIX. He expressed surprise that mention
of Dell UNIX evokes the above quote so often and pointed out that Emacs
source still has #ifdef for Dell UNIX. Quick Googling doesn’t reveal
useful history of Dell UNIX, so here’s my version, a summary of the
three major development releases. ↫ Charles H. Sauer I sure had never
heard of Dell UNIX, and despite the original version of the linked
article being very, very old – 2008 – there’s a few updates from 2020
and 2021 that add links to the files and instructions needed to install,
set up, and run Dell UNIX in a virtual machine; 86Box or VirtualBox
specifically. What was Dell UNIX? in the late ’80s, Dell started a the
Olympic project, an effort to create a completely new architecture
spanning desktops, workstations, and servers, some of which would be
using multiple processors. When searching for an operating system for
this project, the only real option was UNIX, and as such, the Olympic
team set out to developer a UNIX variant. The first version was based on
System V Release 3.2, used Motif and the X Window System, a DOS virtual
machine to run, well, DOS applications called Merge, and compatibility
with Microsoft Xenix. It might seem strange to us today, but Microsoft’s
Xenix was incredibly popular at the time, and compatibility with it was
a big deal. The Olympic project turned out to be too ambitious on the
hardware front so it got cancelled, but the Dell UNIX project continued
to be developed. The next release, Dell System V Release 4, was a
massive release, and included a full X Window System desktop environment
called X.desktop, an office suite, e-mail software, and a lot more. It
also contained something Windows wouldn’t be getting for quite a few
years to come: automatic configuration of device drivers. This was
apparently so successful, it reduced the number of support calls during
the first 90 days of availability by 90% compared to the previous
release. Dell SVR4 finally seemed like real UNIX on a PC. We were
justifiably proud of the quality and comprehensiveness, especially
considering that our team was so much smaller than those of our
perceived competitors at ISC, SCO and Sun(!). The reviewers were
impressed. Reportedly, Dell SVR4 was chosen by Intel as their reference
implementation in their test labs, chosen by Oracle as their reference
Intel UNIX implementation, and used by AT&amp;T USL for in house
projects requiring high reliability, in preference to their own ports of
SVR4.0. (One count showed Dell had resolved about 1800 problems in the
AT&amp;T source.) I was astonished one morning in the winter of 1991-92
when Ed Zander, at the time president of SunSoft, and three other
SunSoft executives arrived at my office, requesting Dell help with their
plans to put Solaris on X86. ↫ Charles H. Sauer Sadly, this would also
prove to be the last release of Dell UNIX. After a few more point
release, the brass at Dell had realised that Dell UNIX, intended to sell
Dell hardware, was mostly being sold to people running it on non-Dell
hardware, and after a short internal struggle, the entire project was

Docker on popular RISC-V platforms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">The
state of Docker on popular RISC-V platforms</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been testing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/47&quot;&gt;Milk-V Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; this week, and have tested a number of other RISC-V development boards over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
As with any new CPU architecture, software support and ease of adoption
are extremely important if you want to reach a wider audience. I
wouldn’t expect every developer and SBC hobbyist to be able to compile
the Linux kernel, and the need to compile much of anything these days is
getting rare. So having any instance where one <em>has</em> to know how
to tweak a Makefile or pass in different flags to a compiler is a bit of
a turn-off for platform adoption.
</p>
<p>
So one thing I’ve followed closely is how easy it is for me to get my
own software running on RISC-V boards. It’s one thing to run some
vendor-provided demos. It’s another entirely to take my real-world
applications and infrastructure apps, and get them to work without
hassle.
</p>
<p>
And to that end, Docker and Ansible, two tools I use extensively for
dev/ops work, both run stably—though with plenty of caveats since RISC-V
is still so new.

<h2 id="mismatch">Mismatch</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;My current life situation is not great. For a variety of reasons that aren&#39;t worth listing here. It&#39;s not like everything&#39;s bad. Some aspects of my life are great. But overall, I&#39;d not say I&#39;m in a happy place. Which is fine, or at least it would be fine if the root cause of the problem was known. Because when you know the cause of a problem you can work towards a solution. But up until the other day, I didn&#39;t know why I was feeling this way. And when you&#39;re in that situation, you feel hopeless and you can see things slowly spiralling out of control. But the other day, I had a realisation: a mismatch. That&#39;s why I feel this way. I realised that there&#39;s a mismatch between the way I see myself, the way I perceive myself as a person, and who I actually am. And that mismatch is driving me insane. There are things I know about myself, or at least I think I know about myself, that are important to me. And those things should play a role in the way I live my life. And yet because of this stupid mismatch, those things weren&#39;t playing a role and were superseded by other things I absolutely despise. And this mismatch manifests in subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I am a morning person. I know it. I experimented with it and I know for
a fact that I’m happier, more productive and live a better life when I
wake up early. Not once, when up early, I thought “Why am I already
awake? Shouldn’t I be sleeping?”. That’s just not a thought I have
because I know how much more I enjoy life when I’m up early. But late at
night? That’s a constant thought. I’m sitting there, reading something
online and I constantly think “Why am I here reading this? I should be
sleeping”. And in doing that, in staying up late, the mismatch gathers
strength. It’s a vicious cycle.
</p>
<p>
That’s one example but I’m realising that this is the source of all my
struggles. And it’s not much the fact that I am not the person I’d love
to be—or that I think I am—but the fact that I don’t do the things that
I should be doing in order to become that person. And it fucking sucks.
It sucks because I know that’s going to be incredibly hard to correct
that but at the same time I’m glad that at least now I know where the
problem is and I can work towards a solution.

that shows you where the two houses are. 4.0 miles apart if you take
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway">Utopia
Parkway</a>. A great name for a street, but it’s not a parkway and it’s
nice but definitely not a utopia.
</p>
<p>
People who aren’t from huge cities like New York don’t know that Trump
what our losers look like. They probably have their own loser types. I
think that’s where 99% of the confusion is. They really don’t believe
he’s so bad. Don’t hold that against them, that’s nowhere near as bad as
knowing what he is and being okay with that.
</p>
<p>
He’s a mean bully type. The name-calling is a big clue. Distracts from
<i>his</i> weaknesses, which are very obvious. I don’t believe in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_shaming">body shaming</a>,
because I care about other people’s feelings. If I criticize his
appearance it might reflect poorly on nice people who have his body type
who may not be mean bully losers like Trump.
</p>
<p>
He’s also a really good comedian if you don’t think he wants to have the
power to kill millions of people and control many more people. Last time
he was our president just through incompetence, without trying, he was
responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in the
Covid disaster. He also wanted the army shoot protestors, that’s the
mean part of our former president. Luckily the people who worked for him
told him to fuck off. They saved us from going into a very deep hole
that would have been hard to escape from.
</p>
<p>
I watched the coverage of the aftermath of the assassination attempt,
and listened to the Americans they interviewed, not the actors they put
behind him on stage, to make him look like a badass I guess, these were
just normal people who mostly like Trump, but seem pretty likeable
themselves. The one thing you heard over and over was how If you don’t
like a candidate vote against them don’t shoot them. That’s American and
it’s not fascist at all. I don’t think they know that he wants to make
big changes in how our politics work. People think if he’s bad they can
just vote him out next time. He tells them this will be the last
election if he wins, he actually says that, but somehow it doesn’t seem
to register.
</p>
<p>
<div class="divInlineImage">

<img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/22/massDeportationNow.png">
</center>
Do Trump supporters understand what they support?
</div>
</p>
<p>
Of course the journalists are distorting who Trump supporters are. Trump
is deplorable if you take him at his word. Some of Trump’s followers are
deplorable too, like the ones who rioted at our Capitol and January 6
and the people who are lined up to work in his next administration if he
wins. They are awful people who want to control all of us. They’re
already doing it via the Supreme Court. It’s going to get a lot worse if
we go the wrong way. We shouldn’t accept that we’re horribly divided.
The powerful media people want us to be divided, I don’t know why and I
don’t care, I just know they do, based on their actions.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I know we’re at a high moment, we’re excited, and I’m going to
enjoy the feeling. We all seem to be pulling the same way, at least on
“our side” but I hold out hope that being an American still means
something, that we can be friends, and fellow countrymen, and work
together. I think that’s still our greatest challange and our greatest
opportunity. Yeah I am woke, that means I care about all of us. I think
most of us do no matter who you vote for.

apps (also known as “expensive endpoints”) because they ignored all the
rules. They also didn’t get caught by fail2ban because of they were
using cloud services, of course. And the only thing that helps against
these fuckers is banning the whole network. Time to get working.
</p>
<p>
First, I had to reboot the server via the website of my service
provider.
</p>
<p>
Then I had to figure out which app it was. It’s impossible for me to
find out. All my expensive apps are from a directory called
<code>/home/alex/farm</code>.
</p>
<p>
When I look at the system log file I, find entries like these:
</p>
<pre><code>grep &quot;Out of memory&quot; /var/log/syslog | tail | cut -b 72-

</code></pre>
<p>
This is not helping. Who is 12041? There are large lists of the process
identifiers and some numbers in the log, but the name is always
shortened:
</p>
<pre><code>grep &quot;12041&quot; /var/log/syslog | tail -n 3

</code></pre>
<p>
Useless.
</p>
<p>
By that time, however, the system was slowing down again. I fired up
<code>htop</code> and saw a gazillion instances of the Community Wiki
script. Looking at the <code>/etc/log/apache2/access.log</code> file
shows that bots were requesting the edit pages (!) of all the thousands
of Community Wiki pages.
</p>
<p>
Thanks, idiots.
</p>
<p>
I needed to find where these requests where coming from. My
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/leech-detector">leech-detector</a>
script was as limited to single IP numbers as fail2ban. So the first
order of business was to add some functionality: If given the option
<code>–networks</code>, it now looks up the network range the requests
come from and reports those:
</p>
<pre><code>tail -n 50 /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep communitywiki | bin/admin/leech-detector --networks
</code></pre>
<p>
This is expensive, of course, so I try to cache the
<a href="https://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/index.php/collectors/">Route
View ASN lookups</a> but the cache doesn’t persist between calls. Using
a small number of rows is the correct approach, here.
</p>
<p>
The result is a table like the one below. When I ran it, I used 400 rows
or so.
</p>

If you then start using <code>whois</code> on the numbers, you’ll see:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
117.22.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
59.172.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
114.104.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
220.184.0.0 → Zhejiang Telecom
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think you know where this is going.
</p>
<p>
And so I copying the network IP, calling <code>whois</code>, verifying
that it was Chinese Telecom or related, and added it to my
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> script.
(Note how I’m using <code>netfilter-persistent</code> these days so that
I don’t have to run <code>ban-cidr</code> after every server restart.)
</p>
<p>
And now I’m going to add the ranges above to the script.
</p>
<p>
Some days I feel like I’m slowly starting to ban the whole commercial
cloud service internet because nothing good ever seems to come of it. Do
you feel the same?

<strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Here’s another slight annoyance, for
<code>ngircd</code>. There are a lot of log lines for a day:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21&quot;|wc -l
7436
</code></pre>
<p>
More than half of them come from a single IP hosted by Octopuce:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21.*2001:67c:288:2::231&quot;|wc -l
4347
</code></pre>
<p>
They all have this format:
</p>
<pre><code>Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Accepted connection 16 from &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; on socket 8.
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Using X509 credentials from slot 0
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Shutting down connection 16 (SSL accept error, closing socket) with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; ...
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Client unregistered (connection 16): SSL accept error, closing socket.
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Connection 16 with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; closed (in: 0.0k, out: 0.0k).
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m going to try and use <code>fail2ban</code> for this.
</p>
<p>
Looks like this is happening every 10 seconds:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21.*Shutting down&quot;|tail|cut -d ' ' -f 3
23:58:23
23:58:33
23:58:43
23:58:53
23:59:03
23:59:13
23:59:23
23:59:33
23:59:43
23:59:53
</code></pre>
<p>
So here’s my attempt at a filter,
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/ngircd.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code># Fail2Ban filter for failed ssl connections to the ngIRC daemon

[INCLUDES]
# Read common prefixes. If any customizations available -- read them from
# common.local
before = common.conf

[Definition]
# Example:
# Shutting down connection 16 (SSL accept error, closing socket) with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:44846&quot;
_daemon = ngircd
failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)sShutting down connection [0-9]+ \(SSL accept error, closing socket\) with &quot;&lt;HOST&gt;:[0-9]+&quot; \.\.\.$
ignoreregex = 

[Init]
journalmatch = _SYSTEMD_UNIT=ngircd.service + _COMM=ngircd

# Author: Alex Schroeder
</code></pre>
<p>
And this is the jail, <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ngircd.conf</code> –
and here I want to ban them after four failed connects in a minute.
Remember the default ban lasts 10 minutes. Since this attack is moving
so slowly, I want to increase this ban time to an hour.
</p>
<pre><code>[ngircd]
enabled = true
findtime = 60
maxretry = 4
bantime = 60m
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s give it a try!
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload fail2ban
</code></pre>
<p>
Then again: fail2ban is only for future attacks. The current level of
persistency also deserves its own treatment:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ipset add banlist6 2001:67c:288:2::231
</code></pre>
<p>
There we go.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and as soon as I did that, it switched to 91.194.61.231, but only
once every two or three minutes. Still Octopuce, though.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset add banlist 91.194.60.0/23
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Back to Community Wiki and its enemies,
however.

<h2>
What is Talking Postgres?
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://talkingpostgres.com">Talking Postgres with Claire
Giordano</a> is a monthly podcast where we talk about the human side of
Postgres, databases, and open source. Previously called “Path To Citus
Con”, each of the 17 episodes published so far includes 1 or 2 amazing
guests from the Postgres world. As for the new Talking Postgres name,
it’s been called “a sensible move”, “a great name”, and “more
fitting”—since the episodes are all about Postgres things.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Talking Postgres is available <a href="https://talkingpostgres.com/">via
most podcast apps</a> and also
<a href="https://aka.ms/TalkingPostgres-playlist">on YouTube</a>.
</li>
<li>
Catch up on the past 17 episodes at
<a href="https://talkingpostgres.com">talkingpostgres.com</a>.
</li>
<li>
You can also
<a href="https://talkingpostgres.com/subscribe">subscribe</a> to make
sure you never miss an episode. And yes, there is an RSS feed on the
subscribe page.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Podcast is recorded LIVE on Discord
</h2>
<p>
Usually on the 1st or 2nd Wednesday of the month, we record the podcast
<em>live</em> on Discord. So while most people download and listen to
episodes after they are published, you can also
<a href="https://aka.ms/TalkingPostgres-cal">join the live
recordings</a> on the
<a href="https://aka.ms/open-source-discord">Microsoft Open Source
Discord</a> to be part of the parallel live text chat. The text chat is
quite fun.

<h2 id="metadata-schema-development-plans">Metadata schema development
plans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<h2 id="its-been-a-while-heres-a-metadata-update-and-request-for-feedback">
It’s been a while, here’s a metadata update and request for feedback
</h2>
<p>
In Spring 2023 we sent out a
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/take-our-metadata-priorities-survey-by-may-18/3498" target="_blank">survey</a>
to our community with a goal of assessing what our priorities for
metadata development should be - what projects are our community ready
to support? Where is the greatest need? What are the roadblocks?
</p>
<p>
The intention was to help prioritize our metadata development work.
There’s a lot we want to do, a lot our community needs from us, but we
really want to make sure we’re focusing on the projects that will have
the most immediate impact for now.
</p>
<p>
Several projects were proposed, based on community demand over time. All
are projects we intend to support long-term.
</p>
<h2 id="projects">
Projects
</h2>
<p>
The projects included in the survey were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Alternate names</strong> - We proposed adding a repeatable
‘name’ element to allow for names that aren’t separated by
given/family/surname.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Updates to funding data</strong>
-<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/roring-ahead-using-ror-in-place-of-the-open-funder-registry/" target="_blank">this
update</a> will be released in the near future and includes:
<ul>
<li>
Expand ROR support - Allow members to supply ROR ID instead of funder ID
in funding data and grant records.
</li>
<li>
Include Grant DOIs in funding metadata.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Publication typing in citations</strong> - Support citation type
in citation metadata (for example article, preprint, data, software,
etc.).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Expand contributor role support</strong> - Allow multiple
contributor roles to be provided per contributor and add support for
external vocabularies (like CRediT)
</li>
<li>
<strong>Expand abstract support</strong> - We currently require all
abstracts to be formatted using JATS. We will be adding new abstract
formats, including BITS and ONIX (which have been requested), as well as
a generic abstract format (non-JATS).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Statements</strong> - Add support for free text statements such
as data availability, acknowledgments, funding, and conflict of
interest.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Contributor identifiers</strong> - Accept contributor
identifiers such as ISNI (in addition to ORCID, which is already
supported).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Conference event IDs</strong> - Identifiers for
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/taking-the-con-out-of-conferences/" target="_blank">conference
events</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next">
What’s next?
</h2>
<p>
There is a clear preference for publication types in citations and
abstract markup, expanded support for multilingual metadata, followed by
expanding contributor roles to support multiple roles and the CRediT
taxonomy. The results have helped us prioritize our work and we’re
advancing several projects soon based on our readiness to move forward.
</p>
<p>
First up is <strong>publication typing in citations and
statements</strong> - we hope to be able to make this ready for
registration in the coming months, but want to confirm a few things
first, primarily the list of ‘types’ to apply to citations, so please
review and comment:

updates in need of feedback July 2024</a>
</p>
<p>
We also have been discussing expansions to our <strong>support for
preprints metadata</strong> with our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/preprints/" target="_blank">Preprints
Advisory Group</a> and have a number of preprint-specific updates that
will be rolled out in the coming months as well, including support for
versions and status. These proposed changes are also available for
comment.
</p>
<p>
And finally, we will be expanding <strong>support for contributor
roles</strong> to include multiple roles per contributor, as well as
adding support for the
<a href="https://credit.niso.org/" target="_blank">CRediT</a> taxonomy.
This update is yet to be scheduled but we do have the inputs and output
planning done and welcome any comments on this as well.
</p>
<p>
We will also be continuing work on other projects highlighted in the
survey that aren’t quite ready to go:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Multilingual metadata</strong>: Support for multilingual
metadata in particular is very important and will require a fairly
significant technical effort, so we want to be sure we get this right -
at minimum we need to include repeatable fields flagged with language
metadata for most items, there may be other considerations as well such
as the scope of languages supported.
</p>
<p>
As we develop new metadata segments we’re keeping language metadata in
mind, but I’d like to form a short-term working group to help shape this
update - this group will be focused on the details of supporting
multilingual metadata in our inputs and outputs, so conversations will
be very XML and JSON heavy. If you are interested and available please
contact <a href="mailto:pfeeney@crossref.org">pfeeney@crossref.org</a>.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Abstract markup:</strong> we are currently in the research phase
of this project but will be proposing updates and asking for input this
fall. At the moment support for BITS and ONIX abstracts have been
requested, as well as an agnostic format.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Expansion of name and contributor ID support</strong>: work is
under way for this as well, and I should have inputs and outputs for
feedback in the coming months.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We anticipate more developments and requests for feedback in the future
as we still have other projects from the list above to get to. I’ve
opened up a
‘<a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/metadata-development/15" target="_blank">Metadata
Development</a>’ section in our Community Forum to invite discussion and
will be kicking off a renewed Metadata Interest Group in the fall.

The circular economy – the newest magical word in the sustainable
development vocabulary – promises economic growth without environmental
destruction or waste. However, growth makes a circular economy
impossible, even if we recycle all raw materials and all recycling is
100% efficient. No technology can change that because it’s not a
technological problem. In addition, many modern products are too complex
to recycle.
</p>
<p>
In this series of articles, LOW←TECH MAGAZINE explores how the
circularity of various technologies like bicycles, solar panels, and
wind turbines evolves. Placing the recycling of resources in a
historical context makes clear that we are not moving toward a circular
economy but rather increasingly away from it.

TRAC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p>
Have you ever formed a bad first impression? Way back when I formed a
hasty impression of this language called TRAC. It’s been called a
proto-esoteric language, and for good reason. It’s outlandish, complex,
and confounding. But, after the urging of some listeners, I’ve decided
to give TRAC a second look. What I’ve found is, perhaps, more confusing
than I ever imagined. This episode we are looking at the wild history of
TRAC, how it actually pioneered some good ideas, and why it feels so
alien.

id="openbsd-gets-hardware-accelerated-video-decodingencoding">OpenBSD
gets hardware accelerated video decoding/encoding</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Only yesterday, I mentioned one of the main reasons I decided to
switch back to Fedora from OpenBSD were performance issues – and one of
them was definitely the lack of hardware acceleration for video
decoding/encoding. The lack of such technology means that
decoding/encoding video is done using the processor, which is far less
efficient than letting your GPU do it – which results in performance
issues like stuttering and tearing, as well as a drastic reduction in
battery life. Well, that’s changed now. Thanks to the work of, well,
many, a major commit has added hardware accelerated video
decoding/encoding to OpenBSD. Hardware accelerated video decode/encode
(VA-API) support is beginning to land in #OpenBSD -current. libva has
been integrated into xenocara with the Intel userland drivers in the
ports tree. AMD requires Mesa support, hence the inclusion in base. A
number of ports will be adjusted to enable VA-API support over time, as
they are tested. ↫ Bryan Steele This is great news, and a major
improvement for OpenBSD and the community. Apparently, performance in
Firefox is excellent, and with simply watching video on YouTube being
something a lot of people do with their computers – especially laptops –
anyone using OpenBSD is going to benefit immensely from this work.</p>

<h2 id="networking-netware-386">1989 networking: NetWare 386</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>NetWare 386 or 3.0 was a very limited release, with very few copies
sold before it was superseded by newer versions. As such, it was
considered lost to time, since it was only sold to large corporations –
for a massive almost 8000 dollar price tag – who obviously didn’t care
about software preservation. There are no original disks left, but a
recent “warez” release has made the software available once again. As
always, pirates save the day.</p>

Great wealth is poison, that’s what’s playing out in the

us into the arms of the Nazis. Who knows why, or even if there is a
reason, other than their drive to find meaning in their great wealth.
Their problem, and ours, is that it has no meaning, no human can use the
money they’ve accumulated. These are not human-size fortunes, playing a
game of make-believe, what if we really were as smart as we think our
money says we are. Well you ain’t that smart.

<h2 id="managing-classic-mac-os-resources-in-resedit">Managing Classic
Mac OS resources in ResEdit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Macintosh was intended to be different in many ways. One of them
was its file system, which was designed for each file to consist of two
forks, one a regular data fork as in normal file systems, the other a
structured database of resources, the resource fork. Resources came to
be used to store a lot of standard structured data, such as the
specifications for and contents of alerts and dialogs, menus,
collections of text strings, keyboard definitions and layouts, icons,
windows, fonts, and chunks of code to be used by apps. You could extend
the types of resource supported by means of a template, itself stored as
a resource, so developers could define new resource types appropriate to
their own apps. ↫ Howard Oakley And using ResEdit, a tool developed by
Apple, you could manipulate the various resources to your heart’s
content. I never used the classic Mac OS when it was current, and only
play with it as a retro platform every now and then, so I ever used
ResEdit when it was the cool thing to do. Looking back, though, and
learning more about it, it seems like just another awesome capability
that Apple lost along the way towards modern Apple. Perhaps I should
load up on my old Macs and see with my own eyes what I can do with
ResEdit.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-digital-communities">Thoughts on digital
communities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I had some interesting exchanges recently with &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevquirk.com&quot;&gt;Kev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruk.ca&quot;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://renecoignard.com&quot;&gt;René&lt;/a&gt;, all touching on the topic of communities, both on and offline. Communities, especially here in the digital space, are something I’m very interested in. It’s something I find myself thinking about often and I constantly have ideas for things I should try. But let me ask you a more fundamental question: what even is a community? Always useful to grab a definition as a starting point:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with a shared
socially significant characteristic, such as place, set of norms,
culture, religion, values, customs, or identity. Communities may share a
sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country,
village, town, or neighborhood) or in virtual space through
communication platforms.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is a good definition. We begin by making it clear that we
need <em>“living things”</em> to have a community and considering the
weird AI phase we’re going through that’s probably worth stating. So
bots are out, humans are in.
</p>
<p>
We then move on to what makes a community a community: the sharing of
some <em>“socially significant characteristic”</em>. In the context of
online communities, I like to refer to that as the <em>“what are we here
for”</em> characteristic. At a fundamental level, members of a community
have to share the same motivations to be there in the first place. If
those motivations start to diverge then things quickly fall apart.
</p>
<p>
It’s like politics. You can have different ideas on how things should be
done—and we can debate those forever—but we have to agree that, at a
fundamental level, we do want to move in the same general direction:
make the place better. The devil’s in the details and we can discuss
what better means but there has to be at least some common ground in the
overall direction. Without that, things will fall apart. And things
might fall apart even with a common ground!
</p>
<p>
Back to online communities. I have my place here on the web. I’m happy
with my site, I’m happy with my projects. But I keep thinking that maybe
there’s something else that can be done, that I should be doing. I keep
bouncing around various digital places—mostly forums—and I have yet to
find one that truly feels like the place where I want to be. Some move
too fast, some don’t move at all. Some are narrowly focused on one
thing, others are not focused at all and it’s pure chaos. And I don’t
blame those places or the people who tried to create them. Creating a
community is hard. Figuring out the right mixture of people is
complicated. Figuring out the right amount of people is complicated.
Group dynamics are never easy to navigate.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to know what you think about all this. Are there online places
where you feel at home? Is there something you’re missing? Do you even
care about all this? <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">Let me

<h2 id="google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available">Google
URL Shortener links will no longer be available</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>In 2018, we announced the deprecation and transition of Google URL
Shortener because of the changes we’ve seen in how people find content
on the internet, and the number of new popular URL shortening services
that emerged in that time. This meant that we no longer accepted new
URLs to shorten but that we would continue serving existing URLs. Today,
the time has come to turn off the serving portion of Google URL
Shortener. Please read on below to understand more about how this will
impact you if you’re using Google URL Shortener. ↫ Sumit Chandel and
Eldhose Mathokkil Babu It should cost Google nothing to keep this
running for as long as Google exists, and yet, this, too, has to be
killed off and buried in the Google Graveyard. We’ll be running into
non-resolving Google URL Shortener links for decades to come, both on
large, popular websites a well as on obscure forums and small websites.
You’ll find a solution to some obscure problem a decade from now, but
the links you need will be useless, and you’ll rightfully curse Google
for being so utterly petty. Relying on anything Google that isn’t
directly serving its main business – ads – is a recipe for disaster, and
will cause headaches down the line. Things like Gmail, YouTube, and
Android are most likely fine, but anything consumer-focused is really a
lottery.</p>
