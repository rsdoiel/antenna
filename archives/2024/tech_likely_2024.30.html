2024-07-23 Eglot for Go, Perl and Markdown
</h1>
<p>
Apparently there’s a way to have Oddµ and Eglot cooperate in Emacs using
<a href="https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman">Marksman</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that LSP integration only works in a “project”: a VCS repository,
or in the case of Marksman, a directory containing an (empty)
<code>.marksman.toml</code> file. This latter option is important if
your notes aren’t under version control.
</p>
<p>
After installing the Marksman binary, use something like the following.
This installs Eglot for Go mode, Perl mode and Markdown mode.
</p>
<pre><code>;; There is probably a way to put this inside the use-package form but
;; this is how it works for me.
(add-hook 'go-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'perl-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
(autoload 'eglot-ensure &quot;eglot&quot; &quot;Start Eglot session for current buffer if there isn’t one.&quot;)

<h2 id="no-southwest-airlines-is-not-still-using-windows-3.1">No,
Southwest Airlines is not still using Windows 3.1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>A story that’s been persistently making the rounds since the
CrowdStrike event is that while several airline companies were affected
in one way or another, Southwest Airlines escaped the mayhem because
they were still using windows 3.1. It’s a great story that fits the
current zeitgeist about technology and its role in society, underlining
that what is claimed to be technological progress is nothing but
trouble, and that it’s better to stick with the old. At the same time,
anybody who dislikes Southwest Airlines can point and laugh at the
bumbling idiots working there for still using Windows 3.1. It’s like a
perfect storm of technology news click and ragebait. Too bad the whole
story is nonsense. But how could that be? It’s widely reported by
reputable news websites all over the world, shared on social media like
a strain of the common cold, and nobody seems to question it or doubt
the veracity of the story. It seems that Southwest Airlines running on
an operating system from 1992 is a perfectly believable story to just
about everyone, so nobody is questioning it or wondering if it’s
actually true. Well, I did, and no, it’s not true. Let’s start with the
actual source of the claim that Southwest Airlines was unaffected by
CrowdStrike because they’re still using Windows 3.11 for large parts of
their primary systems. This claim is easily traced back to its origin –
a tweet by someone called Artem Russakovskii, stating that “the reason
Southwest is not affected is because they still run on Windows 3.1”.
This tweet formed the basis for virtually all of the stories, but it
contains no sources, no links, no background information, nothing. It
was literally just this one line. It turned out be a troll tweet. A
reply to the tweet by Russakovskii a day later made that very lear: “To
be clear, I was trolling last night, but it turned out to be true. Some
Southwest systems apparently do run Windows 3.1. lol.” However, that
linked article doesn’t cite any sources either, so we’re right back
where we started. After quite a bit of digging – that is, clicking a few
links and like 3 minutes of searching online – following the various
reference and links back to their sources, I managed to find where all
these stories actually come from to arrive at the root claim that
spawned all these other claims. It’s from an article by The Dallas
Morning News, titled “What’s the problem with Southwest Airlines
scheduling system?” At the end of last year, Southwest Airlines’
scheduling system had a major meltdown, leading to a lot of cancelled
flights and stranded travelers just around the Christmas holidays. Of
course, the media wanted to know what caused it, and that’s where this
The Dallas Morning News article comes from. In it, we find the
paragraphs that started the story that Southwest Airlines is still using
Windows 3.1 (and Windows 95!): Southwest uses internally built and
maintained systems called SkySolver and Crew Web Access for pilots and
flight attendants. They can sign on to those systems to pick flights and
then make changes when flights are canceled or delayed or when there is
an illness. “Southwest has generated systems internally themselves
instead of using more standard programs that others have used,”
Montgomery said. “Some systems even look historic like they were
designed on Windows 95.” SkySolver and Crew Web Access are both
available as mobile apps, but those systems often break down during even
mild weather events, and employees end up making phone calls to
Southwest’s crew scheduling help desk to find better routes. During
periods of heavy operational trouble, the system gets bogged down with
too much demand. ↫ Kyle Arnold at The Dallas Morning News That’s it.
That’s where all these stories can trace their origin to. These few
paragraphs do not say that Southwest is still using ancient Windows
versions; it just states that the systems they developed internally,
SkySolver and Crew Web Access, look “historic like they were designed on
Windows 95”. The fact that they are also available as mobile
applications should further make it clear that no, these applications
are not running on Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. Southwest pilots and cabin
crews are definitely not carrying around pocket laptops from the ’90s.
These paragraphs were then misread, misunderstood, and mangled in a game
of social media and bad reporting telephone, and here we are. The fact
that nobody seems to have taken the time to click through a few links to
find the supposed source of these claims, instead focusing on cashing in
on the clicks and rage these stories would illicit, is a rather damning
indictment of the state of online (tech) media. Many of the websites
reporting on these stories are part of giant media conglomerates, have a
massive number of paid staff, and they’re being outdone by a dude in the
Arctic with a small Patreon, minimal journalism training, and some
common sense. This story wasn’t hard to debunk – a few clicks and a few
minutes of online searching is all it took. Ask yourself – why do these
massive news websites not even perform the bare minimum?</p>

<p>All the reporters know the Repubs refused to fund border stuff so
they could use it to tag the Dems in the election. So the first thing
the Repubs do is tag VP Harris with the border. The reporter asks a Dem
what they have to say about that. But the reporter <i>knows</i> what the
Repubs did. So why do they even ask the freaking question? They just
play the script the Repubs wrote for them. They are so savvy, but we
heard all that too, so we know how corrupt they are. They don’t care if
we know.</p>

<h2 id="podcast-starts-with-linkblogging">Podcast starts with
linkblogging</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A 20-minute morning coffee notes rambler
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/07/23/randomMorningCoffeeNotes.m4a">podcast</a>,
started with a narration of how we do linkblogging these days, mostly by
hand, and how Bluesky is being hurt by not having a large-enough
character limit. Another plea for textcasting, some standards for what
we put on the wire over the social web.
</p>
<p>
Also talked about twitter-like systems, and idea borrowed from
algol-like and lisp-like.
</p>
<p>
I talk about what made Unix so great.
</p>
<p>
Eric Raymond once told me that <a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a>
was very much like Unix, and I said oh yeah, and so is
<a href="http://reallysimple.org/">RSS</a> and the rest. Huge compliment
because the simplicity of Unix is what I strive for, put huge time into.
</p>
<p>
Journos once said Apple is dead, but that was ridiculous because they
had built a product that was just starting to grow and they had planted
the seeds of huge growth in the 80s when they focused on selling to
education, which made sure that kids when they grew up would have good
feelings about Apple, and it totally worked. When the reporters were
calling them dead, they were actually just about to boom in a whole new
way, on the web, which the Mac was perfect for, given the built in
simple networking. And then boom again when Jobs came back. And again
with the iPod and then again with the iPhone. See how reporters miss the
big picture. We shouldn’t give them so much power, they pretend they
know, but they are usually pretty clueless.
</p>
<p>
This podcast is also a demo of how my mind works. I flit around all over
the place but also have learned over the years that if I want to get
anything done I have to focus on one thing for at least a few hours
every day, and string those days together.
</p>
<p>
I want to document this stuff for the benefit of young programmers. I
learned a lot from reading the code of Unix, I always want to pay that
back, the message is to strive for simplicity, keep technical debt to a
minimum, and factor, factor and factor again to reduce technical debt.
Those are the hardest projects, I’m doing one of those right now, but in
the end it’s worth it, because with simplicity you get to build higher.

scary enough. People laugh that Musk paid too much for twitter, but if
the US ends up as an autocracy, the oligarch that owns the entire news

BTW, if you want to know why we’re so thrilled to have Harris as the
candidate, even though we didn’t want Joe to give in, it’s because no
informed and sane person wants to live in a new Trump term. We tried
that if you recall. The hope you hear now is much greater than the hope
we had when Obama was selling that (though hope was a good word for it).

<h2 id="what-was-hard-about-the-oddµ-architecture">2024-07-21 What was
hard about the Oddµ architecture?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-21-what-was-hard-about-the-oddµ-architecture">
2024-07-21 What was hard about the Oddµ architecture?
</h1>
<p>
If you know Go, I think you’ll find the architecture of Oddmu to be very
traditional: There is a list of actions it knows how to handle when it
serves a site on the web and a list of commands it understands when
called from the shell. Everything involving HTML or the RSS feed uses a
Go template.
</p>
<p>
There were two things that were tricky, in hindsight. I didn’t know
enough Go to know how best to do it and so it took me a long time to
figure them out.
</p>
<p>
The first was what data to keep in memory. I didn’t want search to
involve a database so I experimented a lot with different ways of
indexing the content. Trigrams? Full-text? And what about scoring? In
the end, I dropped all of that. The only thing I keep in memory is a map
of page names and page titles as well as a map of hashtags and pages. I
find that searching titles and hashtags is what I do most often. For
everything else, I search the files. This, of course, is much slower but
for a site of ten thousand pages it’s still fast enough. So figuring out
how to do search was hard. Once I had this figured out, I discovered
that keeping maps in memory when there are multiple Go routines being
used by the web server means that I need locks. Both of my maps are in
fact data structures that each contain a map and a lock. This was new to
me and it took me a long time to realize that having the lock was
important. For a while, I didn’t have those locks. 😅
</p>
<p>
The second thing that took me a long time to get right is that I wanted
pages to be served from Oddµ when it runs as a web server and I wanted
to be able to edit files locally and upload them (using rsync, for
example) while it was still running on the server. I didn’t know about
watching the filesystem for changes and had to learn how to do this: a
watcher per directory, spawning new watchers when directories are
created, and updating those maps I keep in memory as files are added,
deleted or edited.
</p>
<p>
Watching the files introduced another complication, however: What if a
user edited a page via the web? I already had code in place that would
update my maps. Now the file system watcher would report the same file
being written to, resulting in two updates. And what about a change to a
file that results in multiple events: create a file, write something to
the file, write some more to the file. Three events resulting in three
updates? The code is therefore complicated.
</p>
<p>
If Oddµ knows that a file is going to change ahead of time, like when a
user on the web saves an edit, the file is added to a map of ignored
files for a second. When the file system watcher sees those changes, no
updates are done because it knows that the edit handler already does it.
</p>
<p>
If Oddµ sees a file change because of somebody editing files directly, a
one second timer is started. If another event for the same file arrives,
the timer is reset to one second. Only when a second has elapsed without
changes does the watcher do the updates to the internal data structures.
That is to say, changes made to the file system regarding page title
changes or hash tag changes take an effect on the web with a one second
delay.
</p>
<p>
So now, with all that in place, think of all the go routines running in
parallel. Every one second timer is a go routine. Every go routine
accessing a map like the map if files to ignore means that this map
needs to be a data structure containing a map and a lock.
</p>
<p>
When I look at that part of the code, I still get dizzy. 😵‍💫

about usability issues, specially in the context of using Oddµ for
picture galleries. In my case, I think the hardest part is finding
particular pictures. Consider <a href="2020-blumen/index">the page of
flowers in 2020</a>. I know that there’s a sanseveria in bloom on that
page, for example. But how can I find it? I can find the page if I
search for “bogenhanf #pictures”, and then I can search for the same
word on the page, and then I have to wait for a bit as the browser
lazy-loads pictures.

<p>
Perhaps, if I could get into the habit of putting the image description
into the Markdown alt text, I could index all the images and their alt
text, providing direct access to the images. I guess I would also have
to add special code to the Markdown renderer that made the alt text
visible for regular visitors (as title attribute or as regular
paragraphs). That’d be interesting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Later</strong>. I have implemented something useful, I hope. If
one of the search terms (excluding hashtags and predicates) matches an
alt-text of an image, that image is included in the result.
</p>
<p>
Of course, almost none of my galleries use the alt-text, so right now
there aren’t many pages that will show results for a query like
“bogenhanf #pictures”.
</p>
<p>
My expectations regarding alt texts and title attributes for images have
changed significantly as I’ve spent time on fedi, so I’m really not sure
what to do about Markdown in this respect. Right now I’m in the habit of
adding neither alt-text nor title attribute, trying to provide enough
text in the paragraphs above or below. With this new search option, that
might have to change, too. As a sighted person, I sort of expect the
title attribute to be the same as the alt text.

<p>
<strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Sometimes I have the urge to write a small
editor, something like the kilo project: so small that it is barely
usable. I also imagine it to have a sort of conversational UI – which I
guess ed has? – if ed is your grumpiest of companions! – or maybe the
M-x commands for emacs – and I guess I‘m looking at Oddmu as a site
generator and Markdown file server and I wonder: what sort of editor
would I need to maintain this? What sort of minimal SVG editing
capabilities would be nice to have?

an AI World</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-23, from: O’Reilly Radar</p>
<p>Like almost any question about AI, “How does AI impact software
architecture?” has two sides to it: how AI changes the practice of
software architecture and how AI changes the things we architect. These
questions are coupled; one can’t really be discussed without the other.
But to jump to the conclusion, we can say that […]</p>

<p>
Today I tried to make the
<a href="https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib/blob/master/plugins/ircd/irc2">irc2</a>
plugin work for my IRC server.
</p>
<p>
Mostly fiddling with the regular expressions. Adding an optional comma.
Making it case-insensitive. The usual, I guess.
</p>
<p>
I was positively impressed by Debians pre-packaged Perl modules:
</p>
<pre><code>apt install libpoe-component-irc-perl libpoe-component-sslify-perl
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s the modified plugin for <code>/etc/munin/plugins</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
# -*- perl -*-

=head1 NAME

ircstats  - Plugin to graph data about an IRC network and a single IRC server

=head1 CONFIGURATION

You are right, there is too much code for this in static analyzers, and
(at least) without cfg and dfa it is difficult to make any assumptions.
But do we need recursion (in practice, not theoretically) for operators?
Maybe it's worth adding a {recursive} modifier to allow recursion?

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-dell-unix">A brief history of Dell UNIX</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>“Dell UNIX? I didn’t know there was such a thing.” A couple of weeks
ago I had my new XO with me for breakfast at a nearby bakery café. Other
patrons were drawn to seeing an XO for the first time, including a Linux
person from Dell. I mentioned Dell UNIX and we talked a little about the
people who had worked on Dell UNIX. He expressed surprise that mention
of Dell UNIX evokes the above quote so often and pointed out that Emacs
source still has #ifdef for Dell UNIX. Quick Googling doesn’t reveal
useful history of Dell UNIX, so here’s my version, a summary of the
three major development releases. ↫ Charles H. Sauer I sure had never
heard of Dell UNIX, and despite the original version of the linked
article being very, very old – 2008 – there’s a few updates from 2020
and 2021 that add links to the files and instructions needed to install,
set up, and run Dell UNIX in a virtual machine; 86Box or VirtualBox
specifically. What was Dell UNIX? in the late ’80s, Dell started a the
Olympic project, an effort to create a completely new architecture
spanning desktops, workstations, and servers, some of which would be
using multiple processors. When searching for an operating system for
this project, the only real option was UNIX, and as such, the Olympic
team set out to developer a UNIX variant. The first version was based on
System V Release 3.2, used Motif and the X Window System, a DOS virtual
machine to run, well, DOS applications called Merge, and compatibility
with Microsoft Xenix. It might seem strange to us today, but Microsoft’s
Xenix was incredibly popular at the time, and compatibility with it was
a big deal. The Olympic project turned out to be too ambitious on the
hardware front so it got cancelled, but the Dell UNIX project continued
to be developed. The next release, Dell System V Release 4, was a
massive release, and included a full X Window System desktop environment
called X.desktop, an office suite, e-mail software, and a lot more. It
also contained something Windows wouldn’t be getting for quite a few
years to come: automatic configuration of device drivers. This was
apparently so successful, it reduced the number of support calls during
the first 90 days of availability by 90% compared to the previous
release. Dell SVR4 finally seemed like real UNIX on a PC. We were
justifiably proud of the quality and comprehensiveness, especially
considering that our team was so much smaller than those of our
perceived competitors at ISC, SCO and Sun(!). The reviewers were
impressed. Reportedly, Dell SVR4 was chosen by Intel as their reference
implementation in their test labs, chosen by Oracle as their reference
Intel UNIX implementation, and used by AT&amp;T USL for in house
projects requiring high reliability, in preference to their own ports of
SVR4.0. (One count showed Dell had resolved about 1800 problems in the
AT&amp;T source.) I was astonished one morning in the winter of 1991-92
when Ed Zander, at the time president of SunSoft, and three other
SunSoft executives arrived at my office, requesting Dell help with their
plans to put Solaris on X86. ↫ Charles H. Sauer Sadly, this would also
prove to be the last release of Dell UNIX. After a few more point
release, the brass at Dell had realised that Dell UNIX, intended to sell
Dell hardware, was mostly being sold to people running it on non-Dell
hardware, and after a short internal struggle, the entire project was
cancelled since it was costing them more than it was earning them. As I
noted, the article contains the files and instructions needed to run
Dell UNIX today, on a virtual machine. I’m definitely going to try that
out once I have some time, if only to take a peek at that X.desktop,
because that looks absolutely stunning for its time.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">The
state of Docker on popular RISC-V platforms</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been testing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/47&quot;&gt;Milk-V Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; this week, and have tested a number of other RISC-V development boards over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
As with any new CPU architecture, software support and ease of adoption
are extremely important if you want to reach a wider audience. I
wouldn’t expect every developer and SBC hobbyist to be able to compile
the Linux kernel, and the need to compile much of anything these days is
getting rare. So having any instance where one <em>has</em> to know how
to tweak a Makefile or pass in different flags to a compiler is a bit of
a turn-off for platform adoption.
</p>
<p>
So one thing I’ve followed closely is how easy it is for me to get my
own software running on RISC-V boards. It’s one thing to run some
vendor-provided demos. It’s another entirely to take my real-world
applications and infrastructure apps, and get them to work without
hassle.
</p>
<p>
And to that end, Docker and Ansible, two tools I use extensively for
dev/ops work, both run stably—though with plenty of caveats since RISC-V
is still so new.

<h2 id="mismatch">Mismatch</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;My current life situation is not great. For a variety of reasons that aren&#39;t worth listing here. It&#39;s not like everything&#39;s bad. Some aspects of my life are great. But overall, I&#39;d not say I&#39;m in a happy place. Which is fine, or at least it would be fine if the root cause of the problem was known. Because when you know the cause of a problem you can work towards a solution. But up until the other day, I didn&#39;t know why I was feeling this way. And when you&#39;re in that situation, you feel hopeless and you can see things slowly spiralling out of control. But the other day, I had a realisation: a mismatch. That&#39;s why I feel this way. I realised that there&#39;s a mismatch between the way I see myself, the way I perceive myself as a person, and who I actually am. And that mismatch is driving me insane. There are things I know about myself, or at least I think I know about myself, that are important to me. And those things should play a role in the way I live my life. And yet because of this stupid mismatch, those things weren&#39;t playing a role and were superseded by other things I absolutely despise. And this mismatch manifests in subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I am a morning person. I know it. I experimented with it and I know for
a fact that I’m happier, more productive and live a better life when I
wake up early. Not once, when up early, I thought “Why am I already
awake? Shouldn’t I be sleeping?”. That’s just not a thought I have
because I know how much more I enjoy life when I’m up early. But late at
night? That’s a constant thought. I’m sitting there, reading something
online and I constantly think “Why am I here reading this? I should be
sleeping”. And in doing that, in staying up late, the mismatch gathers
strength. It’s a vicious cycle.
</p>
<p>
That’s one example but I’m realising that this is the source of all my
struggles. And it’s not much the fact that I am not the person I’d love
to be—or that I think I am—but the fact that I don’t do the things that
I should be doing in order to become that person. And it fucking sucks.
It sucks because I know that’s going to be incredibly hard to correct
that but at the same time I’m glad that at least now I know where the
problem is and I can work towards a solution.

<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>

I grew up in the same part of Queens as Trump, about ten years after he
did. His family was in Jamaica, mine in Flushing. Here’s a

that shows you where the two houses are. 4.0 miles apart if you take
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_Parkway">Utopia
Parkway</a>. A great name for a street, but it’s not a parkway and it’s
nice but definitely not a utopia.
</p>
<p>
People who aren’t from huge cities like New York don’t know that Trump
what our losers look like. They probably have their own loser types. I
think that’s where 99% of the confusion is. They really don’t believe
he’s so bad. Don’t hold that against them, that’s nowhere near as bad as
knowing what he is and being okay with that.
</p>
<p>
He’s a mean bully type. The name-calling is a big clue. Distracts from
<i>his</i> weaknesses, which are very obvious. I don’t believe in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_shaming">body shaming</a>,
because I care about other people’s feelings. If I criticize his
appearance it might reflect poorly on nice people who have his body type
who may not be mean bully losers like Trump.
</p>
<p>
He’s also a really good comedian if you don’t think he wants to have the
power to kill millions of people and control many more people. Last time
he was our president just through incompetence, without trying, he was
responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans in the
Covid disaster. He also wanted the army shoot protestors, that’s the
mean part of our former president. Luckily the people who worked for him
told him to fuck off. They saved us from going into a very deep hole
that would have been hard to escape from.
</p>
<p>
I watched the coverage of the aftermath of the assassination attempt,
and listened to the Americans they interviewed, not the actors they put
behind him on stage, to make him look like a badass I guess, these were
just normal people who mostly like Trump, but seem pretty likeable
themselves. The one thing you heard over and over was how If you don’t
like a candidate vote against them don’t shoot them. That’s American and
it’s not fascist at all. I don’t think they know that he wants to make
big changes in how our politics work. People think if he’s bad they can
just vote him out next time. He tells them this will be the last
election if he wins, he actually says that, but somehow it doesn’t seem
to register.
</p>
<p>
<div class="divInlineImage">

<img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/22/massDeportationNow.png">
</center>
Do Trump supporters understand what they support?
</div>
</p>
<p>
Of course the journalists are distorting who Trump supporters are. Trump
is deplorable if you take him at his word. Some of Trump’s followers are
deplorable too, like the ones who rioted at our Capitol and January 6
and the people who are lined up to work in his next administration if he
wins. They are awful people who want to control all of us. They’re
already doing it via the Supreme Court. It’s going to get a lot worse if
we go the wrong way. We shouldn’t accept that we’re horribly divided.
The powerful media people want us to be divided, I don’t know why and I
don’t care, I just know they do, based on their actions.
</p>
<p>
Anyway I know we’re at a high moment, we’re excited, and I’m going to
enjoy the feeling. We all seem to be pulling the same way, at least on
“our side” but I hold out hope that being an American still means
something, that we can be friends, and fellow countrymen, and work
together. I think that’s still our greatest challange and our greatest
opportunity. Yeah I am woke, that means I care about all of us. I think
most of us do no matter who you vote for.

<p>
Today I couldn’t log into the server. <code>ssh</code> just sat there,
waiting for the server. Some web page loaded a few bytes and stopped. I
knew it: some idiot had once again written a bot that was hitting my web
apps (also known as “expensive endpoints”) because they ignored all the
rules. They also didn’t get caught by fail2ban because of they were
using cloud services, of course. And the only thing that helps against
these fuckers is banning the whole network. Time to get working.
</p>
<p>
First, I had to reboot the server via the website of my service
provider.

<p>
Then I had to figure out which app it was. It’s impossible for me to
find out. All my expensive apps are from a directory called
<code>/home/alex/farm</code>.

This is not helping. Who is 12041? There are large lists of the process
identifiers and some numbers in the log, but the name is always
shortened:
</p>
<pre><code>grep &quot;12041&quot; /var/log/syslog | tail -n 3

<p>
Useless.
</p>
<p>
By that time, however, the system was slowing down again. I fired up
<code>htop</code> and saw a gazillion instances of the Community Wiki
script. Looking at the <code>/etc/log/apache2/access.log</code> file
shows that bots were requesting the edit pages (!) of all the thousands
of Community Wiki pages.
</p>
<p>
Thanks, idiots.
</p>
<p>
I needed to find where these requests where coming from. My
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/leech-detector">leech-detector</a>
script was as limited to single IP numbers as fail2ban. So the first
order of business was to add some functionality: If given the option
<code>–networks</code>, it now looks up the network range the requests
come from and reports those:
</p>
<pre><code>tail -n 50 /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep communitywiki | bin/admin/leech-detector --networks
</code></pre>
<p>
This is expensive, of course, so I try to cache the
<a href="https://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/index.php/collectors/">Route
View ASN lookups</a> but the cache doesn’t persist between calls. Using
a small number of rows is the correct approach, here.
</p>
<p>
The result is a table like the one below. When I ran it, I used 400 rows
or so.

If you then start using <code>whois</code> on the numbers, you’ll see:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
117.22.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
59.172.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
114.104.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
220.184.0.0 → Zhejiang Telecom
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think you know where this is going.
</p>
<p>
And so I copying the network IP, calling <code>whois</code>, verifying
that it was Chinese Telecom or related, and added it to my
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> script.
(Note how I’m using <code>netfilter-persistent</code> these days so that
I don’t have to run <code>ban-cidr</code> after every server restart.)
</p>
<p>
And now I’m going to add the ranges above to the script.
</p>
<p>
Some days I feel like I’m slowly starting to ban the whole commercial
cloud service internet because nothing good ever seems to come of it. Do
you feel the same?

<strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Here’s another slight annoyance, for
<code>ngircd</code>. There are a lot of log lines for a day:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21&quot;|wc -l
7436
</code></pre>
<p>
More than half of them come from a single IP hosted by Octopuce:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21.*2001:67c:288:2::231&quot;|wc -l
4347
</code></pre>
<p>
They all have this format:
</p>
<pre><code>Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Accepted connection 16 from &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; on socket 8.
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Using X509 credentials from slot 0
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Shutting down connection 16 (SSL accept error, closing socket) with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; ...
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Client unregistered (connection 16): SSL accept error, closing socket.
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Connection 16 with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; closed (in: 0.0k, out: 0.0k).
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m going to try and use <code>fail2ban</code> for this.
</p>
<p>
Looks like this is happening every 10 seconds:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21.*Shutting down&quot;|tail|cut -d ' ' -f 3
23:58:23
23:58:33
23:58:43
23:58:53
23:59:03
23:59:13
23:59:23
23:59:33
23:59:43
23:59:53
</code></pre>
<p>
So here’s my attempt at a filter,
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/ngircd.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code># Fail2Ban filter for failed ssl connections to the ngIRC daemon

[INCLUDES]
# Read common prefixes. If any customizations available -- read them from
# common.local
before = common.conf

[Definition]
# Example:
# Shutting down connection 16 (SSL accept error, closing socket) with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:44846&quot;
_daemon = ngircd
failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)sShutting down connection [0-9]+ \(SSL accept error, closing socket\) with &quot;&lt;HOST&gt;:[0-9]+&quot; \.\.\.$
ignoreregex = 

[Init]
journalmatch = _SYSTEMD_UNIT=ngircd.service + _COMM=ngircd

# Author: Alex Schroeder
</code></pre>
<p>
And this is the jail, <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ngircd.conf</code> –
and here I want to ban them after four failed connects in a minute.
Remember the default ban lasts 10 minutes. Since this attack is moving
so slowly, I want to increase this ban time to an hour.
</p>
<pre><code>[ngircd]
enabled = true
findtime = 60
maxretry = 4
bantime = 60m
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s give it a try!
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload fail2ban
</code></pre>
<p>
Then again: fail2ban is only for future attacks. The current level of
persistency also deserves its own treatment:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ipset add banlist6 2001:67c:288:2::231
</code></pre>
<p>
There we go.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and as soon as I did that, it switched to 91.194.61.231, but only
once every two or three minutes. Still Octopuce, though.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset add banlist 91.194.60.0/23
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Back to Community Wiki and its enemies,

<h2>
What is Talking Postgres?
</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://talkingpostgres.com">Talking Postgres with Claire
Giordano</a> is a monthly podcast where we talk about the human side of
Postgres, databases, and open source. Previously called “Path To Citus
Con”, each of the 17 episodes published so far includes 1 or 2 amazing
guests from the Postgres world. As for the new Talking Postgres name,
it’s been called “a sensible move”, “a great name”, and “more
fitting”—since the episodes are all about Postgres things.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Talking Postgres is available <a href="https://talkingpostgres.com/">via
most podcast apps</a> and also
<a href="https://aka.ms/TalkingPostgres-playlist">on YouTube</a>.
</li>
<li>
Catch up on the past 17 episodes at
<a href="https://talkingpostgres.com">talkingpostgres.com</a>.
</li>
<li>
You can also
<a href="https://talkingpostgres.com/subscribe">subscribe</a> to make
sure you never miss an episode. And yes, there is an RSS feed on the
subscribe page.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Podcast is recorded LIVE on Discord
</h2>
<p>
Usually on the 1st or 2nd Wednesday of the month, we record the podcast
<em>live</em> on Discord. So while most people download and listen to
episodes after they are published, you can also
<a href="https://aka.ms/TalkingPostgres-cal">join the live
recordings</a> on the
<a href="https://aka.ms/open-source-discord">Microsoft Open Source
Discord</a> to be part of the parallel live text chat. The text chat is
quite fun.

<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<h2 id="its-been-a-while-heres-a-metadata-update-and-request-for-feedback">
It’s been a while, here’s a metadata update and request for feedback
</h2>
<p>
In Spring 2023 we sent out a
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/take-our-metadata-priorities-survey-by-may-18/3498" target="_blank">survey</a>
to our community with a goal of assessing what our priorities for
metadata development should be - what projects are our community ready
to support? Where is the greatest need? What are the roadblocks?
</p>
<p>
The intention was to help prioritize our metadata development work.
There’s a lot we want to do, a lot our community needs from us, but we
really want to make sure we’re focusing on the projects that will have
the most immediate impact for now.
</p>
<p>
Several projects were proposed, based on community demand over time. All
are projects we intend to support long-term.
</p>
<h2 id="projects">
Projects
</h2>
<p>
The projects included in the survey were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Alternate names</strong> - We proposed adding a repeatable
‘name’ element to allow for names that aren’t separated by
given/family/surname.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Updates to funding data</strong>
-<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/roring-ahead-using-ror-in-place-of-the-open-funder-registry/" target="_blank">this
update</a> will be released in the near future and includes:
<ul>
<li>
Expand ROR support - Allow members to supply ROR ID instead of funder ID
in funding data and grant records.
</li>
<li>
Include Grant DOIs in funding metadata.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Publication typing in citations</strong> - Support citation type
in citation metadata (for example article, preprint, data, software,
etc.).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Expand contributor role support</strong> - Allow multiple
contributor roles to be provided per contributor and add support for
external vocabularies (like CRediT)
</li>
<li>
<strong>Expand abstract support</strong> - We currently require all
abstracts to be formatted using JATS. We will be adding new abstract
formats, including BITS and ONIX (which have been requested), as well as
a generic abstract format (non-JATS).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Statements</strong> - Add support for free text statements such
as data availability, acknowledgments, funding, and conflict of
interest.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Contributor identifiers</strong> - Accept contributor
identifiers such as ISNI (in addition to ORCID, which is already
supported).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Conference event IDs</strong> - Identifiers for
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/taking-the-con-out-of-conferences/" target="_blank">conference
events</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next">
What’s next?
</h2>
<p>
There is a clear preference for publication types in citations and
abstract markup, expanded support for multilingual metadata, followed by
expanding contributor roles to support multiple roles and the CRediT
taxonomy. The results have helped us prioritize our work and we’re
advancing several projects soon based on our readiness to move forward.
</p>
<p>
First up is <strong>publication typing in citations and
statements</strong> - we hope to be able to make this ready for
registration in the coming months, but want to confirm a few things
first, primarily the list of ‘types’ to apply to citations, so please
review and comment:
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1VPXhTPMZzfvAPmTOlNp-bZf9cTLkw0dPZFTuDtDIPls/edit" target="_blank">Metadata
updates in need of feedback July 2024</a>
</p>
<p>
We also have been discussing expansions to our <strong>support for
preprints metadata</strong> with our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/working-groups/preprints/" target="_blank">Preprints
Advisory Group</a> and have a number of preprint-specific updates that
will be rolled out in the coming months as well, including support for
versions and status. These proposed changes are also available for
comment.
</p>
<p>
And finally, we will be expanding <strong>support for contributor
roles</strong> to include multiple roles per contributor, as well as
adding support for the
<a href="https://credit.niso.org/" target="_blank">CRediT</a> taxonomy.
This update is yet to be scheduled but we do have the inputs and output
planning done and welcome any comments on this as well.
</p>
<p>
We will also be continuing work on other projects highlighted in the
survey that aren’t quite ready to go:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Multilingual metadata</strong>: Support for multilingual
metadata in particular is very important and will require a fairly
significant technical effort, so we want to be sure we get this right -
at minimum we need to include repeatable fields flagged with language
metadata for most items, there may be other considerations as well such
as the scope of languages supported.
</p>
<p>
As we develop new metadata segments we’re keeping language metadata in
mind, but I’d like to form a short-term working group to help shape this
update - this group will be focused on the details of supporting
multilingual metadata in our inputs and outputs, so conversations will
be very XML and JSON heavy. If you are interested and available please
contact <a href="mailto:pfeeney@crossref.org">pfeeney@crossref.org</a>.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Abstract markup:</strong> we are currently in the research phase
of this project but will be proposing updates and asking for input this
fall. At the moment support for BITS and ONIX abstracts have been
requested, as well as an agnostic format.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Expansion of name and contributor ID support</strong>: work is
under way for this as well, and I should have inputs and outputs for
feedback in the coming months.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We anticipate more developments and requests for feedback in the future
as we still have other projects from the list above to get to. I’ve
opened up a
‘<a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/metadata-development/15" target="_blank">Metadata
Development</a>’ section in our Community Forum to invite discussion and
will be kicking off a renewed Metadata Interest Group in the fall.

<h2 id="episode-136---getting-on-trac">Episode 136 - Getting On
TRAC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p>
Have you ever formed a bad first impression? Way back when I formed a
hasty impression of this language called TRAC. It’s been called a
proto-esoteric language, and for good reason. It’s outlandish, complex,
and confounding. But, after the urging of some listeners, I’ve decided
to give TRAC a second look. What I’ve found is, perhaps, more confusing
than I ever imagined. This episode we are looking at the wild history of
TRAC, how it actually pioneered some good ideas, and why it feels so
alien.

id="openbsd-gets-hardware-accelerated-video-decodingencoding">OpenBSD
gets hardware accelerated video decoding/encoding</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Only yesterday, I mentioned one of the main reasons I decided to
switch back to Fedora from OpenBSD were performance issues – and one of
them was definitely the lack of hardware acceleration for video
decoding/encoding. The lack of such technology means that
decoding/encoding video is done using the processor, which is far less
efficient than letting your GPU do it – which results in performance
issues like stuttering and tearing, as well as a drastic reduction in
battery life. Well, that’s changed now. Thanks to the work of, well,
many, a major commit has added hardware accelerated video
decoding/encoding to OpenBSD. Hardware accelerated video decode/encode
(VA-API) support is beginning to land in #OpenBSD -current. libva has
been integrated into xenocara with the Intel userland drivers in the
ports tree. AMD requires Mesa support, hence the inclusion in base. A
number of ports will be adjusted to enable VA-API support over time, as
they are tested. ↫ Bryan Steele This is great news, and a major
improvement for OpenBSD and the community. Apparently, performance in
Firefox is excellent, and with simply watching video on YouTube being
something a lot of people do with their computers – especially laptops –
anyone using OpenBSD is going to benefit immensely from this work.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>NetWare 386 or 3.0 was a very limited release, with very few copies
sold before it was superseded by newer versions. As such, it was
considered lost to time, since it was only sold to large corporations –
for a massive almost 8000 dollar price tag – who obviously didn’t care
about software preservation. There are no original disks left, but a
recent “warez” release has made the software available once again. As
always, pirates save the day.</p>

the current president isn’t able to do the job, and if being re-elected

Great wealth is poison, that’s what’s playing out in the
NYT-orchestrated overthrow of the American government. They’re driving
us into the arms of the Nazis. Who knows why, or even if there is a
reason, other than their drive to find meaning in their great wealth.
Their problem, and ours, is that it has no meaning, no human can use the
money they’ve accumulated. These are not human-size fortunes, playing a
game of make-believe, what if we really were as smart as we think our
money says we are. Well you ain’t that smart.

<h2 id="managing-classic-mac-os-resources-in-resedit">Managing Classic
Mac OS resources in ResEdit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Macintosh was intended to be different in many ways. One of them
was its file system, which was designed for each file to consist of two
forks, one a regular data fork as in normal file systems, the other a
structured database of resources, the resource fork. Resources came to
be used to store a lot of standard structured data, such as the
specifications for and contents of alerts and dialogs, menus,
collections of text strings, keyboard definitions and layouts, icons,
windows, fonts, and chunks of code to be used by apps. You could extend
the types of resource supported by means of a template, itself stored as
a resource, so developers could define new resource types appropriate to
their own apps. ↫ Howard Oakley And using ResEdit, a tool developed by
Apple, you could manipulate the various resources to your heart’s
content. I never used the classic Mac OS when it was current, and only
play with it as a retro platform every now and then, so I ever used
ResEdit when it was the cool thing to do. Looking back, though, and
learning more about it, it seems like just another awesome capability
that Apple lost along the way towards modern Apple. Perhaps I should
load up on my old Macs and see with my own eyes what I can do with
ResEdit.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-digital-communities">Thoughts on digital
communities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I had some interesting exchanges recently with &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevquirk.com&quot;&gt;Kev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruk.ca&quot;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://renecoignard.com&quot;&gt;René&lt;/a&gt;, all touching on the topic of communities, both on and offline. Communities, especially here in the digital space, are something I’m very interested in. It’s something I find myself thinking about often and I constantly have ideas for things I should try. But let me ask you a more fundamental question: what even is a community? Always useful to grab a definition as a starting point:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with a shared
socially significant characteristic, such as place, set of norms,
culture, religion, values, customs, or identity. Communities may share a
sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country,
village, town, or neighborhood) or in virtual space through
communication platforms.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is a good definition. We begin by making it clear that we
need <em>“living things”</em> to have a community and considering the
weird AI phase we’re going through that’s probably worth stating. So
bots are out, humans are in.
</p>
<p>
We then move on to what makes a community a community: the sharing of
some <em>“socially significant characteristic”</em>. In the context of
online communities, I like to refer to that as the <em>“what are we here
for”</em> characteristic. At a fundamental level, members of a community
have to share the same motivations to be there in the first place. If
those motivations start to diverge then things quickly fall apart.
</p>
<p>
It’s like politics. You can have different ideas on how things should be
done—and we can debate those forever—but we have to agree that, at a
fundamental, level we do want to move in the same general direction:
make the place better. The devil’s in the details and we can discuss
what better means but there has to be at least some common ground in the
overall direction. Without that, things will fall apart. And things
might fall apart even with a common ground!
</p>
<p>
Back to online communities. I have my place here on the web. I’m happy
with my site, I’m happy with my projects. But I keep thinking that maybe
there’s something else that can be done, that I should be doing. I keep
bouncing around various digital places—mostly forums—and I have yet to
find one that truly feels like the place where I want to be. Some move
too fast, some don’t move at all. Some are narrowly focused on one
thing, others are not focused at all and it’s pure chaos. And I don’t
blame those places or the people who tried to create them. Creating a
community is hard. Figuring out the right mixture of people is
complicated. Figuring out the right amount of people is complicated.
Group dynamics are never easy to navigate.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to know what you think about all this. Are there online places
where you feel at home? Is there something you’re missing? Do you even
care about all this? <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">Let me

<h2 id="google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available">Google
URL Shortener links will no longer be available</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>In 2018, we announced the deprecation and transition of Google URL
Shortener because of the changes we’ve seen in how people find content
on the internet, and the number of new popular URL shortening services
that emerged in that time. This meant that we no longer accepted new
URLs to shorten but that we would continue serving existing URLs. Today,
the time has come to turn off the serving portion of Google URL
Shortener. Please read on below to understand more about how this will
impact you if you’re using Google URL Shortener. ↫ Sumit Chandel and
Eldhose Mathokkil Babu It should cost Google nothing to keep this
running for as long as Google exists, and yet, this, too, has to be
killed off and buried in the Google Graveyard. We’ll be running into
non-resolving Google URL Shortener links for decades to come, both on
large, popular websites a well as on obscure forums and small websites.
You’ll find a solution to some obscure problem a decade from now, but
the links you need will be useless, and you’ll rightfully curse Google
for being so utterly petty. Relying on anything Google that isn’t
directly serving its main business – ads – is a recipe for disaster, and
will cause headaches down the line. Things like Gmail, YouTube, and
Android are most likely fine, but anything consumer-focused is really a
lottery.</p>
