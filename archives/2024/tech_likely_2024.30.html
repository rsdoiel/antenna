<h2 id="bots-again">2024-07-20 Bots again</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-22, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-20-bots-again">
2024-07-20 Bots again
</h1>
<p>
Today I couldn’t log into the server. <code>ssh</code> just sat there,
waiting for the server. Some web page loaded a few bytes and stopped. I
knew it: some idiot had once again written a bot that was hitting my web
apps (also known as “expensive endpoints”) because they ignored all the
rules. They also didn’t get caught by fail2ban because of they were
using cloud services, of course. And the only thing that helps against
these fuckers is banning the whole network. Time to get working.
</p>
<p>
First, I had to reboot the server via the website of my service
provider.
</p>
<p>
Then I had to figure out which app it was. It’s impossible for me to
find out. All my expensive apps are from a directory called
<code>/home/alex/farm</code>.
</p>
<p>
When I look at the system log file I, find entries like these:
</p>
<pre><code>grep &quot;Out of memory&quot; /var/log/syslog | tail | cut -b 72-

</code></pre>
<p>
This is not helping. Who is 12041? There are large lists of the process
identifiers and some numbers in the log, but the name is always
shortened:
</p>
<pre><code>grep &quot;12041&quot; /var/log/syslog | tail -n 3

</code></pre>
<p>
Useless.
</p>
<p>
By that time, however, the system was slowing down again. I fired up
<code>htop</code> and saw a gazillion instances of the Community Wiki
script. Looking at the <code>/etc/log/apache2/access.log</code> file
shows that bots were requesting the edit pages (!) of all the thousands
of Community Wiki pages.
</p>
<p>
Thanks, idiots.
</p>
<p>
I needed to find where these requests where coming from. My
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/leech-detector">leech-detector</a>
script was as limited to single IP numbers as fail2ban. So the first
order of business was to add some functionality: If given the option
<code>–networks</code>, it now looks up the network range the requests
come from and reports those:
</p>
<pre><code>tail -n 50 /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep communitywiki | bin/admin/leech-detector --networks
</code></pre>
<p>
This is expensive, of course, so I try to cache the
<a href="https://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/index.php/collectors/">Route
View ASN lookups</a> but the cache doesn’t persist between calls. Using
a small number of rows is the correct approach, here.
</p>
<p>
The result is a table like the one below. When I ran it, I used 400 rows
or so.
</p>
<table>

<p>
If you then start using <code>whois</code> on the numbers, you’ll see:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
117.22.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
59.172.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
114.104.0.0 → China Telecom
</li>
<li>
220.184.0.0 → Zhejiang Telecom
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I think you know where this is going.
</p>
<p>
And so I copying the network IP, calling <code>whois</code>, verifying
that it was Chinese Telecom or related, and added it to my
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> script.
(Note how I’m using <code>netfilter-persistent</code> these days so that
I don’t have to run <code>ban-cidr</code> after every server restart.)
</p>
<p>
And now I’m going to add the ranges above to the script.
</p>
<p>
Some days I feel like I’m slowly starting to ban the whole commercial
cloud service internet because nothing good ever seems to come of it. Do
you feel the same?

<strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Here’s another slight annoyance, for
<code>ngircd</code>. There are a lot of log lines for a day:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21&quot;|wc -l
7436
</code></pre>
<p>
More than half of them come from a single IP hosted by Octopuce:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21.*2001:67c:288:2::231&quot;|wc -l
4347
</code></pre>
<p>
They all have this format:
</p>
<pre><code>Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Accepted connection 16 from &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; on socket 8.
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Using X509 credentials from slot 0
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Shutting down connection 16 (SSL accept error, closing socket) with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; ...
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Client unregistered (connection 16): SSL accept error, closing socket.
Jul 21 11:39:51 sibirocobombus ngircd[594]: Connection 16 with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:41240&quot; closed (in: 0.0k, out: 0.0k).
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m going to try and use <code>fail2ban</code> for this.
</p>
<p>
Looks like this is happening every 10 seconds:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --unit ngircd.service|grep &quot;Jul 21.*Shutting down&quot;|tail|cut -d ' ' -f 3
23:58:23
23:58:33
23:58:43
23:58:53
23:59:03
23:59:13
23:59:23
23:59:33
23:59:43
23:59:53
</code></pre>
<p>
So here’s my attempt at a filter,
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/ngircd.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code># Fail2Ban filter for failed ssl connections to the ngIRC daemon

[INCLUDES]
# Read common prefixes. If any customizations available -- read them from
# common.local
before = common.conf

[Definition]
# Example:
# Shutting down connection 16 (SSL accept error, closing socket) with &quot;[2001:67c:288:2::231]:44846&quot;
_daemon = ngircd
failregex = ^%(__prefix_line)sShutting down connection [0-9]+ \(SSL accept error, closing socket\) with &quot;&lt;HOST&gt;:[0-9]+&quot; \.\.\.$
ignoreregex = 

[Init]
journalmatch = _SYSTEMD_UNIT=ngircd.service + _COMM=ngircd

# Author: Alex Schroeder
</code></pre>
<p>
And this is the jail, <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ngircd.conf</code> –
and here I want to ban them after four failed connects in a minute.
Remember the default ban lasts 10 minutes. Since this attack is moving
so slowly, I want to increase this ban time to an hour.
</p>
<pre><code>[ngircd]
enabled = true
findtime = 60
maxretry = 4
bantime = 60m
</code></pre>
<p>
Let’s give it a try!
</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload fail2ban
</code></pre>
<p>
Then again: fail2ban is only for future attacks. The current level of
persistency also deserves its own treatment:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ipset add banlist6 2001:67c:288:2::231
</code></pre>
<p>
There we go.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and as soon as I did that, it switched to 91.194.61.231, but only
once every two or three minutes. Still Octopuce, though.
</p>
<pre><code>ipset add banlist 91.194.60.0/23
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-22</strong>. Back to Community Wiki and its enemies,
however.

TRAC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p>
Have you ever formed a bad first impression? Way back when I formed a
hasty impression of this language called TRAC. It’s been called a
proto-esoteric language, and for good reason. It’s outlandish, complex,
and confounding. But, after the urging of some listeners, I’ve decided
to give TRAC a second look. What I’ve found is, perhaps, more confusing
than I ever imagined. This episode we are looking at the wild history of
TRAC, how it actually pioneered some good ideas, and why it feels so
alien.

gets hardware accelerated video decoding/encoding</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Only yesterday, I mentioned one of the main reasons I decided to
switch back to Fedora from OpenBSD were performance issues – and one of
them was definitely the lack of hardware acceleration for video
decoding/encoding. The lack of such technology means that
decoding/encoding video is done using the processor, which is far less
efficient than letting your GPU do it – which results in performance
issues like stuttering and tearing, as well as a drastic reduction in
battery life. Well, that’s changed now. Thanks to the work of, well,
many, a major commit has added hardware accelerated video
decoding/encoding to OpenBSD. Hardware accelerated video decode/encode
(VA-API) support is beginning to land in #OpenBSD -current. libva has
been integrated into xenocara with the Intel userland drivers in the
ports tree. AMD requires Mesa support, hence the inclusion in base. A
number of ports will be adjusted to enable VA-API support over time, as
they are tested. ↫ Bryan Steele This is great news, and a major
improvement for OpenBSD and the community. Apparently, performance in
Firefox is excellent, and with simply watching video on YouTube being
something a lot of people do with their computers – especially laptops –
anyone using OpenBSD is going to benefit immensely from this work.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>NetWare 386 or 3.0 was a very limited release, with very few copies
sold before it was superseded by newer versions. As such, it was
considered lost to time, since it was only sold to large corporations –
for a massive almost 8000 dollar price tag – who obviously didn’t care
about software preservation. There are no original disks left, but a
recent “warez” release has made the software available once again. As
always, pirates save the day.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-hard-about-the-oddµ-architecture">2024-07-21 What was
hard about the Oddµ architecture?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-21-what-was-hard-about-the-oddµ-architecture">
2024-07-21 What was hard about the Oddµ architecture?
</h1>
<p>
If you know Go, I think you’ll find the architecture of Oddmu to be very
traditional: There is a list of actions it knows how to handle when it
serves a site on the web and a list of commands it understands when
called from the shell. Everything involving HTML or the RSS feed uses a
Go template.
</p>
<p>
There were two things that were tricky, in hindsight. I didn’t know
enough Go to know how best to do it and so it took me a long time to
figure them out.
</p>
<p>
The first was what data to keep in memory. I didn’t want search to
involve a database so I experimented a lot with different ways of
indexing the content. Trigrams? Full-text? And what about scoring? In
the end, I dropped all of that. The only thing I keep in memory is a map
of page names and page titles as well as a map of hashtags and pages. I
find that searching titles and hashtags is what I do most often. For
everything else, I search the files. This, of course, is much slower but
for a site of ten thousand pages it’s still fast enough. So figuring out
how to do search was hard. Once I had this figured out, I discovered
that keeping maps in memory when there are multiple Go routines being
used by the web server means that I need locks. Both of my maps are in
fact data structures that each contain a map and a lock. This was new to
me and it took me a long time to realize that having the lock was
important. For a while, I didn’t have those locks. 😅
</p>
<p>
The second thing that took me a long time to get right is that I wanted
pages to be served from Oddµ when it runs as a web server and I wanted
to be able to edit files locally and upload them (using rsync, for
example) while it was still running on the server. I didn’t know about
watching the filesystem for changes and had to learn how to do this: a
watcher per directory, spawning new watchers when directories are
created, and updating those maps I keep in memory as files are added,
deleted or edited.
</p>
<p>
Watching the files introduced another complication, however: What if a
user edited a page via the web? I already had code in place that would
update my maps. Now the file system watcher would report the same file
being written to, resulting in two updates. And what about a change to a
file that results in multiple events: create a file, write something to
the file, write some more to the file. Three events resulting in three
updates? The code is therefore complicated.
</p>
<p>
If if Oddµ knows that a file is going to change ahead of time, like when
a user on the web saves an edit, the file is added to a map of ignored
files for a second. When the file system watcher sees those changes, no
updates are done because it knows that the edit handler already does it.
</p>
<p>
If Oddµ sees a file change because of somebody editing files directly, a
one second timer is started. If another event for the same file arrives,
the timer is reset to one second. Only when a second has elapsed without
changes does the watcher do the updates to the internal data structures.
That is to say, changes made to the file system regarding page title
changes or hash tag changes take an effect on the web with a one second
delay.
</p>
<p>
So now, with all that in place, think of all the go routines running in
parallel. Every one second timer is a go routine. Every go routine
accessing a map like the map if files to ignore means that this map
needs to be a data structure containing a map and a lock.
</p>
<p>
When I look at that part of the code, I still get dizzy. 😵‍💫

<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bouncepaw">@bouncepaw</span></a> asked
about usability issues, specially in the context of using Oddµ for
picture galleries. In my case, I think the hardest part is finding
particular pictures. Consider <a href="2020-blumen/index">the page of
flowers in 2020</a>. I know that there’s a sanseveria in bloom on that
page, for example. But how can I find it? I can find the page if I
search for “bogenhanf #pictures”, and then I can search for the same
word on the page, and then I have to wait for a bit as the browser
lazy-loads pictures.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, if I could get into the habit of putting the image description
into the Markdown alt text, I could index all the images and their alt
text, providing direct access to the images. I guess I would also have
to add special code to the Markdown renderer that made the alt text
visible for regular visitors (as title attribute or as regular
paragraphs). That’d be interesting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Later</strong>. I have implemented something useful, I hope. If
one of the search terms (excluding hashtags and predicates) matches an
alt-text of an image, that image is included in the result.
</p>
<p>
Of course, almost none of my galleries use the alt-text, so right now
there aren’t many pages that will show results for a query like
“bogenhanf #pictures”.
</p>
<p>
My expectations regarding alt texts and title attributes for images have
changed significantly as I’ve spent time on fedi, so I’m really not sure
what to do about Markdown in this respect. Right now I’m in the habit of
adding neither alt-text nor title attribute, trying to provide enough
text in the paragraphs above or below. With this new search option, that
might have to change, too. As a sighted person, I sort of expect the
title attribute to be the same as the alt text.

<h2 id="managing-classic-mac-os-resources-in-resedit">Managing Classic
Mac OS resources in ResEdit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Macintosh was intended to be different in many ways. One of them
was its file system, which was designed for each file to consist of two
forks, one a regular data fork as in normal file systems, the other a
structured database of resources, the resource fork. Resources came to
be used to store a lot of standard structured data, such as the
specifications for and contents of alerts and dialogs, menus,
collections of text strings, keyboard definitions and layouts, icons,
windows, fonts, and chunks of code to be used by apps. You could extend
the types of resource supported by means of a template, itself stored as
a resource, so developers could define new resource types appropriate to
their own apps. ↫ Howard Oakley And using ResEdit, a tool developed by
Apple, you could manipulate the various resources to your heart’s
content. I never used the classic Mac OS when it was current, and only
play with it as a retro platform every now and then, so I ever used
ResEdit when it was the cool thing to do. Looking back, though, and
learning more about it, it seems like just another awesome capability
that Apple lost along the way towards modern Apple. Perhaps I should
load up on my old Macs and see with my own eyes what I can do with
ResEdit.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-digital-communities">Thoughts on digital
communities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I had some interesting exchanges recently with &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevquirk.com&quot;&gt;Kev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ruk.ca&quot;&gt;Peter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://renecoignard.com&quot;&gt;René&lt;/a&gt;, all touching on the topic of communities, both on and offline. Communities, especially here in the digital space, are something I’m very interested in. It’s something I find myself thinking about often and I constantly have ideas for things I should try. But let me ask you a more fundamental question: what even is a community? Always useful to grab a definition as a starting point:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with a shared
socially significant characteristic, such as place, set of norms,
culture, religion, values, customs, or identity. Communities may share a
sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country,
village, town, or neighborhood) or in virtual space through
communication platforms.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is a good definition. We begin by making it clear that we
need <em>“living things”</em> to have a community and considering the
weird AI phase we’re going through that’s probably worth stating. So
bots are out, humans are in.
</p>
<p>
We then move on to what makes a community a community: the sharing of
some <em>“socially significant characteristic”</em>. In the context of
online communities, I like to refer to that as the <em>“what are we here
for”</em> characteristic. At a fundamental level, members of a community
have to share the same motivations to be there in the first place. If
those motivations start to diverge then things quickly fall apart.
</p>
<p>
It’s like politics. You can have different ideas on how things should be
done—and we can debate those forever—but we have to agree that, at a
fundamental, level we do want to move in the same general direction:
make the place better. The devil’s in the details and we can discuss
what better means but there has to be at least some common ground in the
overall direction. Without that, things will fall apart. And things
might fall apart even with a common ground!
</p>
<p>
Back to online communities. I have my place here on the web. I’m happy
with my site, I’m happy with my projects. But I keep thinking that maybe
there’s something else that can be done, that I should be doing. I keep
bouncing around various digital places—mostly forums—and I have yet to
find one that truly feels like the place where I want to be. Some move
too fast, some don’t move at all. Some are narrowly focused on one
thing, others are not focused at all and it’s pure chaos. And I don’t
blame those places or the people who tried to create them. Creating a
community is hard. Figuring out the right mixture of people is
complicated. Figuring out the right amount of people is complicated.
Group dynamics are never easy to navigate.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to know what you think about all this. Are there online places
where you feel at home? Is there something you’re missing? Do you even
care about all this? <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">Let me

<h2 id="google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available">Google
URL Shortener links will no longer be available</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>In 2018, we announced the deprecation and transition of Google URL
Shortener because of the changes we’ve seen in how people find content
on the internet, and the number of new popular URL shortening services
that emerged in that time. This meant that we no longer accepted new
URLs to shorten but that we would continue serving existing URLs. Today,
the time has come to turn off the serving portion of Google URL
Shortener. Please read on below to understand more about how this will
impact you if you’re using Google URL Shortener. ↫ Sumit Chandel and
Eldhose Mathokkil Babu It should cost Google nothing to keep this
running for as long as Google exists, and yet, this, too, has to be
killed off and buried in the Google Graveyard. We’ll be running into
non-resolving Google URL Shortener links for decades to come, both on
large, popular websites a well as on obscure forums and small websites.
You’ll find a solution to some obscure problem a decade from now, but
the links you need will be useless, and you’ll rightfully curse Google
for being so utterly petty. Relying on anything Google that isn’t
directly serving its main business – ads – is a recipe for disaster, and
will cause headaches down the line. Things like Gmail, YouTube, and
Android are most likely fine, but anything consumer-focused is really a
lottery.</p>

<h2 id="why-chatgpt-is-simply-better">Why ChatGPT is simply better</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
One great use for ChatGPT, simple recipes.
</p>
<p>
If you try looking for a recipe on Google they take forever to get to
the point, and pop up all kinds of offers when all you wanted was a
checklist of ingredients and steps.
</p>
<p>
For example,
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/c9b39a6b-ad4b-4931-9f7e-93c6c7685c03">how
to make hard-boiled eggs</a>.
</p>
<p>
Try doing the
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+make+hard+boiled+eggs">same
thing</a> on Google to see what I mean.

Buttigieg</a> should be the Democrats’ official blogger. Every day a new
