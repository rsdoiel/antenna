Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0726 PM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024

Valid 020100Z - 021200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Discussion...
Scattered thunderstorms persist this evening within the moist air
mass over the FL Peninsula, where wind fields aloft are light. Storm
coverage should gradually decrease as the air mass is overturned and
boundary layer cools. 

Elsewhere, isolated lightning flashes cannot be ruled out in
association with the upper trough moving across eastern Ontario and
affecting the lower Great Lakes. Lapse rates and instability remain
weak in this region.

Easterly winds aloft will also carry isolated thunderstorms over far
southern AZ westward along the Mexican border this evening, where
they may persist in association with Gulf of CA moisture. Any
marginally severe threat thus appears most likely across the
international border.

## Tropical Depression Eleven-E Forecast Discussion Number 1

Tropical Depression Eleven-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP112024
300 PM CST Tue Oct 01 2024

The small area of low pressure we have been monitoring for the past 
couple of days has become well-defined on satellite imagery this 
afternoon and was confirmed with recent scatterometer data.  There 
has been enough organized deep convection today to consider this a 
tropical depression, as suggested by the Data-T estimate from 
TAFB, and the initial wind speed is set to 30 kt in accordance with 
the max believable scatterometer values.

The initial motion is an uncertain 360/4 kt.  The depression has 
been moving northward on the eastern end of the monsoon trough, and 
this general track is anticipated through landfall with little 
change seen in the steering flow for the next day or two.  However, 
the model guidance is all over the place, owing to differences in 
the initial depth of the tropical depression and strength of the 
circulation associated with the monsoon trough and Invest 97E.  The 
ECMWF model seems to have the best representation of the initial 
vortex, and the track forecast heavily leans on that model 
solution, especially given its recent successes with cyclones in 
that area.  However, there is considerable spread in the guidance, 
and the tropical storm warning is larger than typical based on that 
uncertainty.

Northeasterly shear is expected to continue to affect the 
depression through landfall, though very warm SSTs and a moist 
mid-level environment should promote some strengthening.  These 
conditions would seem to favor intensification through landfall, 
and the first forecast shows a mid-range tropical storm, above most 
of the model guidance.  At this point, extreme rainfall and flash 
flooding seem to be the biggest threats from this system.

 
KEY MESSAGES:

1. The depression is forecast to become a tropical storm later 
tonight or on Wednesday.   A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect 
for a portion of the coastline of southern Mexico, where tropical 
storm conditions are expected to begin on Wednesday.

2. Tropical Depression Eleven-E will likely bring heavy rainfall to 
portions of southern Mexico and Guatemala this week. Flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain, are possible, 
especially from western Guatemala into portions of the Mexican 
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, and Tabasco.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024

Valid 031200Z - 091200Z

Fire weather concerns are expected to persist into the weekend
across the north/northwestern CONUS with critical fire weather
conditions possible. Latest forecast guidance continues to show the
gradual building of an anomalously strong upper ridge over the
southern/southwestern CONUS through early next week. This will
maintain hot/dry conditions across much of the central and western
CONUS that should continue to promote drying fuels. Additionally,
this will maintain the strongest mid-level flow largely along the
U.S./Canadian border. Fire weather concerns will be possible across
the northern two-thirds of the country as shortwave troughs embedded
within the mean flow (and their associated surface lows/cold fronts)
propagate east along the international border. The most prominent of
these will likely impact the Pacific Northwest into the northern
Plains D4/Friday into D5/Saturday. 

...D3/Friday - Northern Great Basin and southern WY...
Afternoon water-vapor imagery depicts an upper disturbance along and
south of the Aleutian Islands. Long-range guidance continues to show
reasonably good agreement that this feature will undergo some
amplification as it approaches the Pacific Northwest by Friday
afternoon. The combination of surface pressure falls ahead of the
upper wave and increasing westerly flow over the southern Cascades
and northern Sierra Nevada will promote dry and windy conditions
across northern NV into adjacent areas of CA, OR, and ID. 
Similarly, strengthening westerly winds across the northern Rockies
will induce a dry/windy downslope regime through the WY basin.
Ensemble guidance continues to show some spread regarding the exact
timing of the upper wave, which will influence the overlap of the
strongest mid-level winds with peak heating and precludes higher
risk probabilities at this time. 

...D5/Saturday - Southern WY into the central/northern Plains...
A dry cold front is forecast to push southeast from the northern
High Plains into the central Plains through D5/Saturday in tandem
with the passage of the upper-level trough. A regime similar to
yesterday (Monday) appears likely with dry conditions and only
modest temperature reductions behind the front accompanied by very
strong (20-30 mph) winds. With no appreciable rainfall forecast for
the Plains through the weekend, fuels should remain receptive and
will support the fire weather concern. Confidence in reaching
critical-criteria RH reductions is highest across southern WY into
adjacent parts of NE/CO, but the coverage of sub-20% RH across much
of the Plains is somewhat uncertain at this range. Regardless, the
overall synoptic pattern appears favorable for at least a
wind-driven fire weather concern.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR EASTERN MONTANA INTO WESTERN
NORTH DAKOTA...

The previous forecast remains on track with surface observations
showing strengthening winds across central MT and parts of western
ND as a surface low begins to deepen across southern SK. This trend
will continue as the low deepens further across the southern
Canadian Prairies this afternoon. Both the Elevated and Critical
risk areas were expanded eastward with this update based on recent
12 UTC guidance, which suggests the axis of stronger 925-850 mb
winds (and by extension the corridor with the strongest surface
gusts) may be displaced slightly further east than previously
anticipated and centered over the western to central Dakotas by peak
heating. The 12 UTC GGW sounding sampled these stronger winds just
above the nocturnal inversion; elevated to critical fire weather
conditions should begin by around 18 UTC as this inversion is mixed
out. See the previous discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 10/01/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024/

...Synopsis...
A strong area of high pressure will initially dominate the pattern
across the western 2/3rds of the CONUS for the first half of the day
today. However, by midday lee troughing will start to strengthen
across Alberta. This will tighten the pressure gradient across the
northern Rockies and northern High Plains and result in gusty winds
across Montana, the western Dakotas, and into the Nebraska
Panhandle/northeast Colorado. The greatest confidence in 20+ mph
sustained winds and low relative humidity, in the vicinity of dry
fuels, is across eastern Montana and western North Dakota where the
Critical delineation is present. Some strong winds are also possible
across north-central Montana where relative humidity is expected to
be in the low 20s. However, despite conditions that will likely meet
Critical criteria, fuels are not that dry across this region and
thus, an Elevated area is likely sufficient for the threat. 

An additional area of dry and breezy conditions is present across
southern Wyoming, where winds of 15 to 20 mph are possible with
single digit relative humidity. 

Finally, quite substantial dry and breezy conditions, meeting
Critical criteria, are expected across southwest New Mexico and
southeast Arizona. However, fuels in this region are not dry enough
to support a significant fire threat. Therefore, no Elevated or
Critical areas are warranted.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, the main belt of westerlies is expected to
remain near the Canadian border through the period, extending across
more of the Great Lakes with time.  That will occur as a synoptic-
scale trough -- evident in moisture-channel imagery from a low over
westernmost parts of Hudson Bay across northwestern ON to the upper
Mississippi Valley -- ejects northeastward over northern ON, and
James and Hudson Bays, through the period.  This stronger flow will
remain well poleward of thunder potential today near a weakening/
ejecting trough over the Tidewater region, south of a weak front
over FL, and under or south of a weakening synoptic ridge over parts
of CO/NM/AZ.  Vertical shear and lapse rates aloft will be too weak
in any of those areas to support organized severe potential. 
Locally strong gusts may accompany the high-based convection in AZ,
with a deep/well-mixed subcloud layer, but only modest (5-15 kt)
midlevel easterlies.  A cold front sweeping across the Great Lakes,
Ohio Valley, lower Mississippi Valley, and southern Plains, should
encounter a marginally moist/unstable airmass for isolated thunder,
within a band of convection over parts of the eastern Great Lakes.

## SPC Oct 1, 2024 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

0319 AM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024

Valid 041200Z - 091200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Recent model guidance has come into better agreement with regard to
the upper-level pattern this weekend into early next week. As zonal
flow begins to break down this Friday, an upper-level trough will
dig southeastward and strengthen. Though conditional and uncertain,
some severe threat could develop in association with this trough.
After this trough exits the East Coast, ridging aloft and at the
surface is expected to develop in its wake.

On Saturday, a cold front will move through the Upper Midwest. Some
moisture return is possible on the western flank of the surface
ridge, but the quality of this moisture is highly uncertain. Wind
fields would support organized storms in parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley, but predictability remains quite low.

For Sunday, the upper-level trough will continue southeastward with
some intensification expected, especially towards Monday morning. A
similar setup to Saturday will occur in parts of the upper Ohio
Valley region. The strongest shear will likely be post-frontal, but
some stronger storms could develop along the front during the
afternoon. Moisture return ahead of the boundary remains a question
and will be the key to severe potential.

A strong mid-level jet will dig into the Mid-Atlantic Monday
morning. Given the misaligned timing of the trough with diurnal
heating, it is not clear that sufficient buoyancy will be present
for an organized severe threat.

0156 AM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST WYOMING...

...Synopsis...
An elongated mid-level jet will extend along the US/Canada border on
Wednesday. At the surface, a cold front will move through the Plains
with a weak surface low developing in the central Plains Wednesday
night. Ahead of this front, some dry and breezy conditions are
expected from the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle to the Upper Midwest.
However, the majority of this region lacks dry fuels. Therefore, no
Elevated area is justified in this region.

An Elevated area has been drawn similar to the prior Day3 40%
outlook across southern Wyoming where fuels are critically dry.
Sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph are expected, as mid-level flow
strengthens and a deeply-mixed airmass permits some of this stronger
flow to reach the surface. Single-digit relative humidity is also
expected across this region on Wednesday afternoon. Given the
upper-end critical conditions expected, a Critical area has been
added within the broader Elevated, where these conditions are
expected to overlap the driest fuels across southeast Wyoming.
