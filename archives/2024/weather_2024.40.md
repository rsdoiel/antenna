Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0737 AM CDT Mon Sep 30 2024

Valid 301300Z - 011200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today, though a few strong
storms may affect central/eastern North Carolina.

...Synopsis/Discussion...
The main belt of mid/upper-level, midlatitude westerlies will
continue to traverse the northwestern/north-central CONUS and
central/southwestern Canada, buckled cyclonically around a prominent
synoptic trough now located from eastern SK to central MT and
western WY.  This trough should phase with another now over central
mainland Arctic Canada by the end of the period, resulting in a
500-mb low over southeastern Nunavut, with trough trailing over
western Hudson Bay, northwesternmost ON, MN, and IA.  

Strongly difluent flow aloft will take shape southeast of the
trough, across the Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes from
Michigan/Huron on down, the Ohio Valley, and much of the
Appalachians.  As that occurs, a longstanding, filling, weakening
low now over southwestern WV will devolve today to an open-wave
trough, losing amplitude rapidly and drifting eastward over the
central Appalachians through the period.  Part of a basal shortwave
trough/vorticity lobe -- now apparent in moisture-channel imagery
over eastern TN -- will eject eastward across northern NC and
southern VA from this afternoon through tonight.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a quasistationary front across
northern SC to just south of the southern Outer Banks, extending
from a triple-point low near CAE.  This boundary should shift
northward over central/eastern NC through the day.  Meanwhile, a
cold front -- related to the strong northern-stream trough -- was
drawn from central/southern MB across southern ND, central SD,
northwestern NE, and southern WY.  This front should sweep across
most of the Great Plains and upper Mississippi Valley through the
period, reaching northern Lower MI, IL, southwestern MO, southern
OK, and the TX South Plains by 12Z. 

...Central/eastern NC...
Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop
this afternoon over the Piedmont and coastal plain, in an
environment characterized by rich boundary-layer moisture (surface
dewpoints commonly in upper 60 to mid 70s F) very weak ambient
MLCINH easily removed by diurnal heating, but weak mid/upper-level
lapse rates.  This will result in 500-1200 J/kg MLCAPE over most of
the area from he Piedmont to the Sounds, beneath a belt of
sufficiently strong mid/upper flow to yield around 35-45-kt
effective-shear magnitudes.  

Low-level hodographs over central/eastern NC this afternoon, from 
model forecast soundings, reasonably show curvature near the frontal
zone, but with weak speeds in the lowest couple km that
substantially limit SRH and vector shear.  However, above 1 km,
hodographs are somewhat long and straight, suggesting the potential
for low-end supercells amidst the mode common multicellular modes. 
At this time, forecast shear appears too weak to support an
unconditional tornado-threat area, but the scenario will be
monitored for any mesoscale enhancement to shear (especially along
boundaries) that may introduce such a risk.  The gust threat appears
subsevere at this time, though localized gusts approaching severe
limits cannot be ruled out.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast for the remainder of the
period.

...Discussion...
Scattered low-topped convection remains ongoing from WV into VA and
central NC, where weak instability exists. This activity will
continue to diminish with the loss of heating.

To the south, stronger storms exist over the east-central FL
Peninsula near Cape Canaveral. However, this activity is mostly
producing heavy rain and lightning in a weak-shear environment, and
will continue to spread offshore. Additional isolated activity
cannot be ruled out a bit farther south and within the instability
axis.

Elsewhere, high-based convection from northern AZ across UT will
gradually weaken as well with the loss of heating and as the
influence of the upper trough to the north lessens.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2024-09-29, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0314 PM CDT Sun Sep 29 2024

Valid 011200Z - 071200Z

Fire weather concerns may persist through the early parts of the
upcoming work week across parts of the Rockies and High Plains, but
confidence in robust fire weather concerns abates heading into the
later parts of the week. Long-range guidance shows reasonably good
agreement in a gradually building upper ridge over the central CONUS
through the next 7 days. This will maintain relatively dry
conditions across the central Rockies and Plains where fuels are
fairly dry. This upper-air regime will also favor surface low
development primarily across the Canadian Prairies with occasional
cold frontal intrusions into the Plains. Fire weather concerns will
likely emerge as winds increase with each of these dry frontal
passages. 

...D3/Tuesday - High Plains and southern Wyoming...
Breezy pressure gradient winds are anticipated along the central to
northern High Plains D3/Tuesday afternoon amid weak troughing in the
lee of the Canadian Rockies juxtaposed with a strong surface high
over the central Great Plains. Winds generally in the 15-20 mph
range appear most likely per recent ensemble solutions, but some
locations may see winds up to 20-25 mph. Dry conditions will persist
from this weekend into early next week with 15-25% RH expected by
peak heating. Consequently, elevated to locally critical fire
weather conditions appear possible. Fire weather concerns may emerge
across the Wyoming Basin as well within a westerly downslope flow
regime; however, stronger mid-level flow is expected to be displaced
to the north which limits confidence in a robust/sustained fire
weather threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1244 AM CDT Sun Sep 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND NORTHERN NEBRASKA...

...Synopsis...
A southeastward-moving cold front will bring elevated to critical
fire-weather conditions to the central and northern Great Plains. 

Gusty winds of 20-25 MPH will coincide with post-frontal
boundary-layer relative humidity values of 10-15% across much of
South Dakota into Nebraska and northern Kansas. These conditions
will overlap with ERC fuels that exceed the 98th annual percentile,
and warm/dry conditions expected the preceding day. A Critical
highlight area was introduced where the greatest confidence in
persistent dry and windy conditions will occur, though additional
adjustments and expansions may be needed as frontal timing and speed
come into clearer focus.
