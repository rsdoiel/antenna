Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1022 AM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR EASTERN MONTANA INTO WESTERN
NORTH DAKOTA...

The previous forecast remains on track with surface observations
showing strengthening winds across central MT and parts of western
ND as a surface low begins to deepen across southern SK. This trend
will continue as the low deepens further across the southern
Canadian Prairies this afternoon. Both the Elevated and Critical
risk areas were expanded eastward with this update based on recent
12 UTC guidance, which suggests the axis of stronger 925-850 mb
winds (and by extension the corridor with the strongest surface
gusts) may be displaced slightly further east than previously
anticipated and centered over the western to central Dakotas by peak
heating. The 12 UTC GGW sounding sampled these stronger winds just
above the nocturnal inversion; elevated to critical fire weather
conditions should begin by around 18 UTC as this inversion is mixed
out. See the previous discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 10/01/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024/

...Synopsis...
A strong area of high pressure will initially dominate the pattern
across the western 2/3rds of the CONUS for the first half of the day
today. However, by midday lee troughing will start to strengthen
across Alberta. This will tighten the pressure gradient across the
northern Rockies and northern High Plains and result in gusty winds
across Montana, the western Dakotas, and into the Nebraska
Panhandle/northeast Colorado. The greatest confidence in 20+ mph
sustained winds and low relative humidity, in the vicinity of dry
fuels, is across eastern Montana and western North Dakota where the
Critical delineation is present. Some strong winds are also possible
across north-central Montana where relative humidity is expected to
be in the low 20s. However, despite conditions that will likely meet
Critical criteria, fuels are not that dry across this region and
thus, an Elevated area is likely sufficient for the threat. 

An additional area of dry and breezy conditions is present across
southern Wyoming, where winds of 15 to 20 mph are possible with
single digit relative humidity. 

Finally, quite substantial dry and breezy conditions, meeting
Critical criteria, are expected across southwest New Mexico and
southeast Arizona. However, fuels in this region are not dry enough
to support a significant fire threat. Therefore, no Elevated or
Critical areas are warranted.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, the main belt of westerlies is expected to
remain near the Canadian border through the period, extending across
more of the Great Lakes with time.  That will occur as a synoptic-
scale trough -- evident in moisture-channel imagery from a low over
westernmost parts of Hudson Bay across northwestern ON to the upper
Mississippi Valley -- ejects northeastward over northern ON, and
James and Hudson Bays, through the period.  This stronger flow will
remain well poleward of thunder potential today near a weakening/
ejecting trough over the Tidewater region, south of a weak front
over FL, and under or south of a weakening synoptic ridge over parts
of CO/NM/AZ.  Vertical shear and lapse rates aloft will be too weak
in any of those areas to support organized severe potential. 
Locally strong gusts may accompany the high-based convection in AZ,
with a deep/well-mixed subcloud layer, but only modest (5-15 kt)
midlevel easterlies.  A cold front sweeping across the Great Lakes,
Ohio Valley, lower Mississippi Valley, and southern Plains, should
encounter a marginally moist/unstable airmass for isolated thunder,
within a band of convection over parts of the eastern Great Lakes.

For the eastern North Pacific...east of 140 degrees west longitude:<br/>
<br/>
Offshore of Southwestern Mexico:<br/>
An area of low pressure has formed a few hundred miles south of <br/>
Acapulco with disorganized thunderstorm activity.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be conducive for development, and a <br/>
tropical depression is expected to form within a few days. The <br/>
disturbance is forecast to meander near or just offshore of the <br/>
coast of Mexico for much of the week, and then begin moving slowly <br/>
west-northwestward, parallel to the coast of Mexico by this <br/>
weekend. Regardless of development, this system is expected to <br/>
contribute to heavy rainfall across portions of the southwestern <br/>
coast of Mexico that were already adversely affected by substantial <br/>
rainfall last week, and interests there should monitor the progress <br/>
of this disturbance.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent. <br/>

<br/>
South of the Gulf of Tehuantepec (EP96): <br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a small area of low <br/>
pressure near the Gulf of Tehuantepec have changed little in <br/>
organization during the past several hours. Although the system <br/>
does not yet appear to have a well-defined surface circulation, <br/>
environmental conditions are expected to be conducive for <br/>
additional development, and a tropical depression is likely to form <br/>
during the next day or two. This system is forecast to meander near <br/>
southern coast of Mexico, and interests there should monitor the <br/>
progress of this system. Regardless of development, heavy rain is <br/>
possible along portions of the coast of southern Mexico and <br/>

## SPC Oct 1, 2024 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0319 AM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024

Valid 041200Z - 091200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Recent model guidance has come into better agreement with regard to
the upper-level pattern this weekend into early next week. As zonal
flow begins to break down this Friday, an upper-level trough will
dig southeastward and strengthen. Though conditional and uncertain,
some severe threat could develop in association with this trough.
After this trough exits the East Coast, ridging aloft and at the
surface is expected to develop in its wake.

On Saturday, a cold front will move through the Upper Midwest. Some
moisture return is possible on the western flank of the surface
ridge, but the quality of this moisture is highly uncertain. Wind
fields would support organized storms in parts of the upper
Mississippi Valley, but predictability remains quite low.

For Sunday, the upper-level trough will continue southeastward with
some intensification expected, especially towards Monday morning. A
similar setup to Saturday will occur in parts of the upper Ohio
Valley region. The strongest shear will likely be post-frontal, but
some stronger storms could develop along the front during the
afternoon. Moisture return ahead of the boundary remains a question
and will be the key to severe potential.

A strong mid-level jet will dig into the Mid-Atlantic Monday
morning. Given the misaligned timing of the trough with diurnal
heating, it is not clear that sufficient buoyancy will be present
for an organized severe threat.

0156 AM CDT Tue Oct 01 2024

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST WYOMING...

...Synopsis...
An elongated mid-level jet will extend along the US/Canada border on
Wednesday. At the surface, a cold front will move through the Plains
with a weak surface low developing in the central Plains Wednesday
night. Ahead of this front, some dry and breezy conditions are
expected from the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle to the Upper Midwest.
However, the majority of this region lacks dry fuels. Therefore, no
Elevated area is justified in this region.

An Elevated area has been drawn similar to the prior Day3 40%
outlook across southern Wyoming where fuels are critically dry.
Sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph are expected, as mid-level flow
strengthens and a deeply-mixed airmass permits some of this stronger
flow to reach the surface. Single-digit relative humidity is also
expected across this region on Wednesday afternoon. Given the
upper-end critical conditions expected, a Critical area has been
added within the broader Elevated, where these conditions are
expected to overlap the driest fuels across southeast Wyoming.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast for the remainder of the
period.

...Discussion...
Scattered low-topped convection remains ongoing from WV into VA and
central NC, where weak instability exists. This activity will
continue to diminish with the loss of heating.

To the south, stronger storms exist over the east-central FL
Peninsula near Cape Canaveral. However, this activity is mostly
producing heavy rain and lightning in a weak-shear environment, and
will continue to spread offshore. Additional isolated activity
cannot be ruled out a bit farther south and within the instability
axis.

Elsewhere, high-based convection from northern AZ across UT will
gradually weaken as well with the loss of heating and as the
influence of the upper trough to the north lessens.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0314 PM CDT Sun Sep 29 2024

Valid 011200Z - 071200Z

Fire weather concerns may persist through the early parts of the
upcoming work week across parts of the Rockies and High Plains, but
confidence in robust fire weather concerns abates heading into the
later parts of the week. Long-range guidance shows reasonably good
agreement in a gradually building upper ridge over the central CONUS
through the next 7 days. This will maintain relatively dry
conditions across the central Rockies and Plains where fuels are
fairly dry. This upper-air regime will also favor surface low
development primarily across the Canadian Prairies with occasional
cold frontal intrusions into the Plains. Fire weather concerns will
likely emerge as winds increase with each of these dry frontal
passages. 

...D3/Tuesday - High Plains and southern Wyoming...
Breezy pressure gradient winds are anticipated along the central to
northern High Plains D3/Tuesday afternoon amid weak troughing in the
lee of the Canadian Rockies juxtaposed with a strong surface high
over the central Great Plains. Winds generally in the 15-20 mph
range appear most likely per recent ensemble solutions, but some
locations may see winds up to 20-25 mph. Dry conditions will persist
from this weekend into early next week with 15-25% RH expected by
peak heating. Consequently, elevated to locally critical fire
weather conditions appear possible. Fire weather concerns may emerge
across the Wyoming Basin as well within a westerly downslope flow
regime; however, stronger mid-level flow is expected to be displaced
to the north which limits confidence in a robust/sustained fire
weather threat.
