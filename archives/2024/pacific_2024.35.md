## Heat kills thousands in the U.S. every year. Why are the deaths so hard to track?

date: 2024-08-26, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>After a string of scorching days in June 2023, the body of an 88-year-old man was discovered in his home in Maricopa County, Arizona. His air-conditioner, set to 70, was blowing hot air. The temperature inside was nearly 110 degrees. Maybe he had heart problems. Maybe a different organ broke down. Maybe he was taking medications that did not work as they should. Did extreme heat cause or contribute to his death?</p>
