				<p>Petersburg, Alaska, is as pretty a seaside town as any you&#8217;ll find across the filigree of fjords and foggy islands that make up the state&#8217;s maritime coast. Statuary and floral designs evidence its proud Scandinavian heritage, and bald eagles soar across the narrow strait that separates it from a national forest. It doesn&#8217;t have room for the giant cruise ships that disgorge thousands of passengers into Ketchikan and Juneau, but it is perfectly situated for its sustaining industry: fishing.</p>

## OPINION ǀ Why aren't business leaders promoting CNMI's visa-free access?

date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Marianas Variety

IN my previous opinion pieces, I have pointed out that the current CNMI administration hasn’t made any changes to prevent the legal entry of tourists from China. This really got me questioning why the narrative by business groups and certain individuals has been to incorrectly blame the administration for the lack of tourists from China. It has not made much sense to me. I arrived at the conclusion that they were not truly after tourists from China as much as they were after pro-PRC messaging from the administration. I still believe that is the case. It did however get me to wondering why the numbers are down.
