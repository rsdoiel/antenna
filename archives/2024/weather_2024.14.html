...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected today or tonight.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery early this morning shows a mid to upper-level
low over northern CA and an associated large-scale trough over the
West Coast.  A mid-level ridge is downstream over the Great Plains
to the west of a large-scale trough/mid-level low near the East
Coast.  The western U.S. trough/low will gradually pivot east
through Saturday morning across the Desert Southwest and Great
Basin.  Isolated thunderstorms are possible across CA/NV/AZ in
conjunction with increasing large-scale ascent and sporadic pockets
of weak buoyancy.  Isolated thunderstorms are also possible across
the central and northern Rockies and adjacent plains.  Strong gusts
cannot be ruled out with a few thunderstorms, but limited buoyancy
will likely preclude the development of severe thunderstorms through
tonight.

0203 AM CDT Fri Apr 05 2024

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
The second of a two-day fire weather event is anticipated on
Saturday across southern NM/far west TX to southeast CO and
southwest KS. Robust lee cyclogenesis is anticipated across the
central High Plains by 18 UTC Saturday as a progressive upper-level
wave (currently moving onto the CA coast) overspreads the region.
The surface low is forecast to shift east into the Plains through
the afternoon with a trailing surface trough/Pacific front pushing
east across the southern High Plains by late morning. As this
occurs, west/northwesterly post-frontal winds will advect a dry air
mass off the central/southern Rockies into the High Plains.
Downslope warming/drying of this air mass will promote widespread RH
reductions into the 10-20% range across NM, western TX, and portions
of OK/CO/KS. Latest high-res ensemble guidance shows reasonably high
confidence in sub-15% RH within the critical risk area, and the
typically drier/windier solutions hint that single-digit RH minimums
are possible. 

Winds are expected to increase to 20-25 mph (gusting to 40-50 mph)
by early afternoon amid a strengthening surface pressure gradient
and deepening boundary-layer mixing. Sustained winds between 30-35
mph winds possible under the mid-level jet maximum, which should be
located broadly across the northern TX and OK Panhandles. This
region will see the highest potential for extremely critical fire
weather conditions. Consideration was given to introducing an
Extremely Critical risk area, but somewhat low ensemble consensus
for sustained 30+ mph winds (only 10-30% probability) precluded
higher risk headlines. These low probabilities may be associated
with spread regarding the placement and magnitude of the surface low
(up to a 4 mb difference between some solutions). These details
should become better resolved heading into the Day-1 time frame.
Regardless, fuels across the region should be very receptive after
warm, dry, and windy conditions on Friday, which should support the
high-end Critical fire weather risk on Saturday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Thu Apr 04 2024

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track. Additionally,
locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible this afternoon
across portions of the Southeast, that have missed out on
appreciable rainfall over the last 1-2 weeks. This includes parts of
far southern MS, southern AL, and the far western FL Panhandle.
Here, diurnal heating will contribute to 20-30 percent afternoon RH,
coincident with breezy/gusty post-frontal winds (sustained around 15
mph). While these conditions would ordinarily warrant Elevated
highlights, fuels generally do not appear supportive of large-fire
potential.

..Weinman.. 04/04/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 AM CDT Thu Apr 04 2024/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level trough will amplify across the West Coast today.
Ahead of this trough, moderate to strong mid-level flow will
overspread a deeply mixed airmass in Arizona and the Great Basin.
This will result in dry and breezy conditions across a broad region.
However, fuels remain moist in this area and therefore, the fire
weather threat will be minimal.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING FROM ID INTO WESTERN MT...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated, marginally severe hail and wind will be possible this
afternoon/evening from Idaho into western Montana.

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified pattern will persist over the CONUS through
Friday morning, with a deep midlevel trough moving slowly inland
over the Pacific coast, and a separate/deep low making gradual
eastward progress over the Mid-Atlantic/southern New England.  Cold
midlevel temperatures and resulting conditionally unstable
low-midlevel lapse rates will result in weak buoyancy and low-topped
convection/isolated lightning flashes today from the upper OH Valley
into the Mid-Atlantic.  Out west, there will be some potential for a
strong storm or two along the more north-south front across western
ID and up to an east-west frontal segment across western MT. 
Profiles are closer to saturated today compared to yesterday at
BOI/TFX, and associated clouds will tend to slow surface heating
along and east-through-south of the frontal segments.  Still, there
will be enough buoyancy for a low-end wind/hail threat, given strong
deep-layer, south-southwesterly shear/long hodographs.

Mesoscale Discussion 0367
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0905 AM CDT Wed Apr 03 2024

Areas affected...Portions of north FL and extreme southeast GA

Concerning...Tornado Watch 85...

Valid 031405Z - 031530Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 85 continues.

SUMMARY...An isolated damaging wind and tornado threat may continue
across parts of north FL. A local extension in area of Tornado Watch
85 is possible. Or, a new downstream Watch could be issued.

DISCUSSION...A cluster/loosely organized line of convection is
ongoing across north FL and far southeast GA this morning ahead of a
cold front. While the 12Z sounding from JAX showed substantial
capping/inhibition and visible satellite indicates some anvil
shading, continued diurnal heating of the moist low-level airmass
ahead of the line of thunderstorms should help gradually erode most
of the remaining MLCIN. Weak instability will likely be sufficient
to maintain convective structure and intensity given ample low-level
and deep-layer shear present on recent VWPs from KJAX. With around
200-250 m2/s2 of 0-1 km SRH present, embedded updraft rotation
within the line should continue to pose some threat for a few
tornadoes through the rest of the morning and perhaps into the
afternoon, as convection spreads east-southeastward across the north
FL Peninsula. Occasional damaging winds will also remain a concern
as low-level lapse rates gradually steepen. A local extension in
area of Tornado Watch 85, or a new downstream Watch, will need to be
considered for parts of north FL.

1040 AM EDT Wed Apr 3 2024

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  North and central Florida
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Wednesday morning and afternoon from 1040 AM
  until 500 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...A pre-frontal band of thunderstorms will continue to
develop slowly southeastward from north into central Florida through
the afternoon.  Embedded storms will be capable of producing
damaging winds of 60-70 mph, while the potential for a couple of
tornadoes will be greater with any isolated supercells that can form
just ahead of the main line of storms.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
north and south of a line from 60 miles south southwest of Cross
City FL to 25 miles east of St Augustine FL. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 85...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 0.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 25040.

Mesoscale Discussion 0344
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0959 AM CDT Tue Apr 02 2024

Areas affected...Portions of WV

Concerning...Tornado Watch 74...

Valid 021459Z - 021630Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 74 continues.

SUMMARY...A substantial severe wind threat (70-90+ mph gusts), along
with isolated tornadoes, will approach Charleston West Virginia and
vicinity through noon.

DISCUSSION...KHTS recently measured a significant severe wind gust
to 80 kt (92 mph) with a compact but well organized cluster
currently moving quickly eastward across parts of WV. Even though
the airmass across this region remains only weakly unstable, very
strong low-level and deep-layer shear is helping to compensate and
provide convective organization. Recent radar data from KRLX shows
enhanced inbound velocities embedded within the line that suggest
70-90+ mph wind gusts will likely continue to be a threat with this
line as it approaches the Charleston WV metro and vicinity over the
next hour (through noon EDT). In addition to this substantial
severe/damaging wind threat, isolated tornadoes embedded within the
line also appear possible given the strength of the low-level flow
and related shear.
