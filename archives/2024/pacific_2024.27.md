## BC’s Tales of the Pacific ǀ The Globe mutiny: No honor among thieves

IF you steal something that was stolen, have you committed a crime?  I suppose it depends on your motive and what you do with it.  Imagine a mutiny on board a ship, the criminals sail away, then several of the crew mutiny a second time and return the ship to its rightful owner.  In the process nearly everyone ends up dead.  This is the bloody tale of the Globe mutiny.

## A Bad Debater or a Bad President!

date: 2024-06-30, updated: 2024-07-01, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is President Joe Biden had one bad night on the debate stage that drew demands for him to step down and yet when Trump was convicted the first &amp; second time there were no calls for him to step down even when he is still facing 54 more felony charges. Why is Trump being held to a much lower standard by those who support him and even some media outlets? Media outlets have used the sensationalism around Trump to be out-front on the news, but the TRUTH is being lost to “Trump’s reality TV show tactics.” If Biden needs to step down for a bad debate, then what should Trump do, given his convictions and pending State &amp; Federal cases, which are far more serious than a bad debate night.

## Island Intelligencer: Trump verdict and foreign influence ops

date: 2024-06-30, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>International news focused on security issues remains awash with reports on foreign covert influence operations against elections, societal stability and charged political events worldwide. Some targets are far from our homeland (in Europe), some are closer (in South America), and others share our border (Canada, Mexico). The United States is, of course, a target, too. (Remember Russian and Chinese intelligence agencies&#8217; efforts to exploit the Maui fires last fall?)</p>

## Biden’s debate cleanup tour starts at an LGBTQ+ fundraiser in NYC

date: 2024-06-30, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>NEW YORK &#8212; Hundreds of LGBTQ+ donors and activists gathered in midtown Manhattan for a fundraiser supporting President Joe Biden on Friday, but the president&#8217;s debate performance cast an anxious shadow over what normally would have been an energizing political event. As they mingled in a lavender-lit event space at the Manhattan Center, many donors huddled in small groups and fretted over what they had all witnessed on television the night before. The debate was &#8220;definitely the main topic of conversation,&#8221; said one attendee, who declined to be named because he works in Democratic politics.</p>

## Miguel Rojas given another crack at shortstop, but Dodgers minding his workload

date: 2024-06-30, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>SAN FRANCISCO &#8212; The Los Angeles Dodgers&#8217; talent can lead to some quirky things. Miguel Rojas, by all accounts, has been a valuable member of yet another first-place club. After serving as the emergency everyday shortstop for a 100-win club last summer, he willingly ceded the role to a former MVP who hadn&#8217;t played the position regularly since high school in Mookie Betts. Rojas has had one of his finest seasons as a big leaguer at 35 years old.</p>

## Steves: A quick trip to Tallinn

				<p>Stepping off the boat in Tallinn, Estonia &#8212; a short ferry ride from Helsinki (and an overnight sailing from Stockholm, or an easy flight from anywhere in Europe) &#8212; you&#8217;ll likely feel as if you&#8217;ve nevertheless traveled a great cultural distance from Scandinavia. Located about halfway between Stockholm and St. Petersburg, Tallinn is both Nordic- and Russian-influenced, and a visit here is a fun peek into a proudly unique and resilient nation.</p>
