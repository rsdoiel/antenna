## OPINION ǀ GOP misses the mark

date: 2024-07-04, updated: 2024-07-04, from: Marianas Variety

IT'S rather disingenuous for GOP President Diego Benavente to be lecturing about tourism, as he did in a press release this week — especially when the biggest exodus of Japanese hotels, airlines, and other investments happened on his watch, when he was Lt. Governor (2002 - 2006).

date: 2024-07-03, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; Former President Donald Trump had a very good year at the Supreme Court. On Monday, the court ruled that he is substantially immune from prosecution on charges that he tried to subvert the 2020 election.

And in March, the justices allowed him to seek another term despite a constitutional provision barring insurrectionists from holding office.</p>

## OPINION ǀ Truth 57: If it Ain’t Broke, Don’t Fix It — KISS!!!

date: 2024-07-01, updated: 2024-07-01, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is the fact that WE (the CNMI) have done all we can now do about China and it’s time to “pivot” away our focus to things that NEED to be FIXED!  I do want to commend what I see as a real partnership between MVA Managing Director Mr. Conception and the Governor who are obviously working hard together to revive our Tourism Industry. It is also obvious Mr. Conception knows the industry and knows what he is talking about, but even with that said the Governor and MVA need HELP to turn things around. There is all this talk about China when WE KNOW the casino is dead and America’s relationship with China is on-the-ropes and the last I heard, the CNMI is part of America. Instead of working on things like the casino &amp; China that ain’t broke but indeed “dead &amp; even DONE.” WE need to fix the things we can and control it using the KISS Methodology with our Economy Ambrose M. Bennett — for TRUE, so make sure you read my next Op ed on fixing the broken CC &amp; Hotel.

## BC’s Tales of the Pacific ǀ The Globe mutiny: No honor among thieves

date: 2024-06-30, updated: 2024-07-01, from: Marianas Variety

IF you steal something that was stolen, have you committed a crime?  I suppose it depends on your motive and what you do with it.  Imagine a mutiny on board a ship, the criminals sail away, then several of the crew mutiny a second time and return the ship to its rightful owner.  In the process nearly everyone ends up dead.  This is the bloody tale of the Globe mutiny.

## A Bad Debater or a Bad President!

date: 2024-06-30, updated: 2024-07-01, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is President Joe Biden had one bad night on the debate stage that drew demands for him to step down and yet when Trump was convicted the first &amp; second time there were no calls for him to step down even when he is still facing 54 more felony charges. Why is Trump being held to a much lower standard by those who support him and even some media outlets? Media outlets have used the sensationalism around Trump to be out-front on the news, but the TRUTH is being lost to “Trump’s reality TV show tactics.” If Biden needs to step down for a bad debate, then what should Trump do, given his convictions and pending State &amp; Federal cases, which are far more serious than a bad debate night.

				<p>SAN FRANCISCO &#8212; The Los Angeles Dodgers&#8217; talent can lead to some quirky things. Miguel Rojas, by all accounts, has been a valuable member of yet another first-place club. After serving as the emergency everyday shortstop for a 100-win club last summer, he willingly ceded the role to a former MVP who hadn&#8217;t played the position regularly since high school in Mookie Betts. Rojas has had one of his finest seasons as a big leaguer at 35 years old.</p>
