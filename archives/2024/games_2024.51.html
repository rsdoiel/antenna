<p>date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s been a busy year for thrillers so far, with all manner of
small-town crime going down, serial killers on the prowl, and more. But
no matter the subgenre or setting, there have been plenty of excellent
thrillers to keep us entertained. Here’s a list of all the best
thrillers in 2024 so far. They’re […]</p>

RPG books of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, a
major milestone not just for Wizards of the Coast but for the entire
tabletop role-playing game industry. Even as Wizards sought to
simultaneously take a victory lap and secure D&amp;D’s dominance by
releasing new core rulebooks, other publishers looked back to the
hobby’s history to […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Back in May of 2023, I wrote this editorial sharing a frustration
with the board gaming trend of adopting extremely lengthy multi-session
campaigns. With the advent of crowdfunding and the explosion of big-box
narrative-driven games, as well as the success of the legacy format, the
exhausting 20-plus-hour campaign structure really took off. There are
dozens […]</p>

<p>Step Up is more than just the franchise that minted Channing Tatum as
a star. It’s more, even, than a franchise that gave us a gem of a sequel
subhed. It is also the movie that gave us Jon M. Chu, director of Crazy
Rich Asians, In the Heights, and the recent box-office smash hit […]</p>

<p>For Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, screenwriter Philippa
Boyens, Jackson, and Fran Walsh took on the task of translating three
expansive novels into three live-action movies. With the anime movie The
Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, Boyens and her co-writers
took on a radically different challenge: expanding two pages […]</p>

<p>Few things are better than settling down with a good book, but
sometimes the settling is easier said than done. Between a long commute,
making dinner, or just getting some fresh air outside, there are some
times that a traditional book (or even an e-reader) just won’t cut it.
For all those times, there’s no […]</p>

<p>At Polygon, we want to introduce you do at least one thing we think
you’d love every single day. With so many games, movies, shows, and and
internet-based quick bites (or “quibis”) out there to experience, we
know it’s next to impossible to decide how to take a chance on the

<p>date: 2024-12-15, updated: 2024-12-13, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>I have a confession: I’m a rampant roguelike uninstaller. Almost
invariably, I reach a point with games like Balatro, Dead Cells, or
Hades when, watching my playtime balloon, I feel the need to remove the
temptation to play the game. Roguelikes, almost by definition, pursue an
addictive structure that reviewers often describe as the “one […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-15, updated: 2024-12-13, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Mythical Island is the first expansion for Pokémon TCG Pocket, adding
dozens of new cards that are sure to shake up the meta (and demolish
even more friendships). The expansion pack is tropical island-themed,
features twists on cards like Magmar, Exeggcute, and Aerodactyl
alongside newcomers like Snivy and Larvesta. A powerful Mew card,
though, is […]</p>
