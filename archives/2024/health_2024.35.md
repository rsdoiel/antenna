## Unveiling microbial dynamics in lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent nontumor tissues: insights from nicotine exposure and diverse clinical stages via nanopore sequencing technology

date: 2024-08-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundLung is the largest mucosal area of the human body and directly connected to the external environment, facing microbial exposure and environmental stimuli. Therefore, studying the internal microorganisms of the lung is crucial for a deeper understanding of the relationship between microorganisms and the occurrence and progression of lung cancer.MethodsTumor and adjacent nontumor tissues were collected from 38 lung adenocarcinoma patients and used nanopore sequencing technology to sequence the 16s full-length sequence of bacteria, and combining bioinformatics methods to identify and quantitatively analyze microorganisms in tissues, as well as to enrich the metabolic pathways of microorganisms.Resultsthe microbial composition in lung adenocarcinoma tissues is highly similar to that in adjacent tissues, but the alpha diversity is significantly lower than that in adjacent tissues. The difference analysis results show that the bacterial communities of Streptococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Neisseriales were significantly enriched in cancer tissues. The results of metabolic pathway analysis indicate that pathways related to cellular communication, transcription, and protein synthesis were significantly enriched in cancer tissue. In addition, clinical staging analysis of nicotine exposure and lung cancer found that Haemophilus, paralinfluenzae, Streptococcus gordonii were significantly enriched in the nicotine exposure group, while the microbiota of Cardiobactereae and Cardiobacterales were significantly enriched in stage II tumors. The microbiota significantly enriched in IA-II stages were Neisseriaeae, Enterobacteriales, and Cardiobacterales, respectively.ConclusionNanopore sequencing technology was performed on the full length 16s sequence, which preliminarily depicted the microbial changes and enrichment of microbial metabolic pathways in tumor and adjacent nontumor tissues. The relationship between nicotine exposure, tumor progression, and microorganisms was explored, providing a theoretical basis for the treatment of lung cancer through microbial targets.

## Immunogenicity and transmission-blocking potential of quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase in Plasmodium vivax

date: 2024-08-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTransmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) can effectively prevent the community’s spread of malaria by targeting the antigens of mosquito sexual stage parasites. At present, only a few candidate antigens have demonstrated transmission-blocking activity (TBA) potential in P. vivax. Quiescin-sulfhydryl oxidase (QSOX) is a sexual stage protein in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei and is associated with a critical role in protein folding by introducing disulfides into unfolded reduced proteins. Here, we reported the immunogenicity and transmission-blocking potency of the PvQSOX in P. vivax.Methods and findingsThe full-length  recombinant PvQSOX protein (rPvQSOX) was expressed in the Escherichia coli expression system. The anti-rPvQSOX antibodies were generated following immunization with the rPvQSOX in rabbits. A parasite integration of the pvqsox gene into the P. berghei pbqsox gene knockout genome was developed to express full-length PvQSOX protein in P. berghei (Pv-Tr-PbQSOX). In western blot, the anti-rPvQSOX antibodies recognized the native PvQSOX protein expressed in transgenic P. berghei gametocyte and ookinete. In indirect immunofluorescence assays, the fluorescence signal was detected in the sexual stages, including gametocyte, gamete, zygote, and ookinete. Anti-rPvQSOX IgGs obviously inhibited the ookinetes and oocysts development both in vivo and in vitro using transgenic parasites. Direct membrane feeding assays of anti-rPvQSOX antibodies were conducted using four field P. vivax isolates (named isolates #1–4) in Thailand. Oocyst density in mosquitoes was significantly reduced by 32.00, 85.96, 43.52, and 66.03% with rabbit anti-rPvQSOX antibodies, respectively. The anti-rPvQSOX antibodies also showed a modest reduction of infection prevalence by 15, 15, 20, and 22.22%, respectively, as compared to the control, while the effect was insignificant. The variation in the DMFA results may be unrelated to the genetic polymorphisms. Compared to the P.vivax Salvador (Sal) I strain sequences, the pvqsox in isolate #1 showed no amino acid substitution, whereas isolates #2, #3, and #4 all had the M361I substitution.ConclusionsOur results suggest that PvQSOX could serve as a potential P. vivax TBVs candidate, which warrants further evaluation and optimization.

## Comparative analysis of metagenomic and targeted next-generation sequencing for pathogens diagnosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens

date: 2024-08-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAlthough the emerging NGS-based assays, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS), have been extensively utilized for the identification of pathogens in pulmonary infections, there have been limited studies systematically evaluating differences in the efficacy of mNGS and multiplex PCR-based tNGS in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimens.MethodsIn this study, 85 suspected infectious BALF specimens were collected. Parallel mNGS and tNGS workflows to each sample were performed; then, we comparatively compared their consistency in detecting pathogens. The differential results for clinically key pathogens were confirmed using PCR.ResultsThe microbial detection rates of BALF specimens by the mNGS and tNGS workflows were 95.18% (79/83) and 92.77% (77/83), respectively, with no significant difference. mNGS identified 55 different microorganisms, whereas tNGS detected 49 pathogens. The comparative analysis of mNGS and tNGS revealed that 86.75% (72/83) of the specimens were complete or partial concordance. Particularly, mNGS and tNGS differed significantly in detection rates for some of the human herpesviruses only, including Human gammaherpesvirus 4 (P<0.001), Human betaherpesvirus 7 (P<0.001), Human betaherpesvirus 5 (P<0.05) and Human betaherpesvirus 6 (P<0.01), in which tNGS always had higher detection rates. Orthogonal testing of clinically critical pathogens showed a total coincidence rate of 50% for mNGS and PCR, as well as for tNGS and PCR.ConclusionsOverall, the performance of mNGS and multiplex PCR-based tNGS assays was similar for bacteria and fungi, and tNGS may be superior to mNGS for the detection of DNA viruses. No significant differences were seen between the two NGS assays compared to PCR.

## Proven anti-virulence therapies in combating methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections

date: 2024-08-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionDespite years of efforts to develop new antibiotics for eradicating multidrug-resistant (MDR) and multi-virulent Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) infections, treatment failures and poor prognoses in most cases have been common. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic approaches targeting virulence arrays. Our aim is to discover new anti-virulence therapies targeting MRSA and VRSA virulence arrays.MethodologyWe employed phenotypic, molecular docking, and genetic studies to screen for anti-virulence activities among selected promising compounds: Coumarin, Simvastatin, and Ibuprofen.ResultsWe found that nearly all detected MRSA and VRSA strains exhibited MDR and multi-virulent profiles. The molecular docking results aligned with the phenotypic and genetic assessments of virulence production. Biofilm and hemolysin productions were inhibited, and all virulence genes were downregulated upon treatment with sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) of these promising compounds. Ibuprofen was the most active compound, exhibiting the highest inhibition and downregulation of virulence gene products. Moreover, in vivo and histopathological studies confirmed these results. Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease in wound area and improvements in re-epithelialization and tissue organization in the Ibuprofen and antimicrobial treated group compared with the group treated with antimicrobial alone. These findings support the idea that a combination of Ibuprofen and antimicrobial drugs may offer a promising new therapy for MRSA and VRSA infections.ConclusionWe hope that our findings can be implemented in clinical practice to assist physicians in making the most suitable treatment decisions.

## Metagenomic next-generation sequencing promotes pathogen detection over culture in joint infections with previous antibiotic exposure

date: 2024-08-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo investigate the diagnostic value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in detecting pathogens from joint infection (JI) synovial fluid (SF) samples with previous antibiotic exposure.MethodsFrom January 2019 to January 2022, 59 cases with suspected JI were enrolled. All cases had antibiotic exposure within 2 weeks before sample collection. mNGS and conventional culture were performed on SF samples. JI was diagnosed based on history and clinical symptoms in conjunction with MSIS criteria. The diagnostic values, including sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV), and accuracy, were in comparison with mNGS and culture.ResultsThere were 47 of the 59 cases diagnosed with JI, while the remaining 12 were diagnosed with non-infectious diseases. The sensitivity of mNGS was 68.1%, which was significantly higher than that of culture (25.5%, p<0.01). The accuracy of mNGS was significantly higher at 71.2% compared to the culture at 39.0% (p <0.01). Eleven pathogenic strains were detected by mNGS but not by microbiological culture, which included Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus cohnii, Finegoldia magna, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus saprophytics, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter pittii, Brucella ovis, andCoxiella burnetii. Antibiotic therapy was adjusted based on the mNGS results in 32 (68.1%) patients, including 12 (25.5%) and 20 (42.6%) patients, in whom treatment was upgraded and changed, respectively. All JI patients underwent surgery and received subsequent antibiotic therapy. They were followed up for an average of 23 months (20-27 months), and the success rate of treatment was 89.4%. Out of the 33 patients who had positive results for pathogens, reoperation was performed in 1 case (3.03%), while out of the 14 cases with negative results for both mNGS and cultures, reoperation was performed in 4 cases (28.6%).ConclusionsmNGS has advantages over conventional culture in detecting pathogens in SF samples from JI patients previously treated with antibiotics, potentially improving clinical outcomes.
