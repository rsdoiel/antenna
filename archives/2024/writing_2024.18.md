## What Characters Know

date: 2024-04-30, from: John August blog

John and Craig investigate what characters know and how we know they know what they know. It’s something that can be as confusing as that last sentence was, but they offer clear guidance on building informed characters, audience expectations, and how to get everybody on the same page. We also look at how ad breaks [&#8230;]

## Niall Harrison Reviews Jumpnauts by Hao Jingfang

date: 2024-04-30, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Jumpnauts</strong>, Hao Jingfang (trans. Ken Liu) (Saga 978-1-53442-211-7, 368pp, $18.99). March 2024.</p>
<p>Deep in the bowels of Hao Jingfang’s <strong>Jumpnauts</strong>, an alien guide reveals to the human protagonists that what defines civilisational progression, from their elevated perspective, is ‘‘the capacity for information exchange.’’ The development of writing, which allows information to be transmit­ted widely in space and time, was the necessary precondition to reach the ‘‘zeroth rank’’ of  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/04/niall-harrison-reviews-jumpnauts-by-hao-jingfang/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Gary K. Wolfe Reviews The Dead Cat Tail Assassins by P. Djèlí Clark

date: 2024-04-29, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Dead Cat Tail Assassins</strong>, P. Djèlí Clark (Tordotcom 978-1-25076-704-2, $20.99, 224pp, hc) April 2024.</p>
<p>Like Chekhov’s famous gun, it seems to be an un­stated principle among writers as diverse as Rob­ert Ludlum and Octavia E. Butler that a character suffering from total amnesia in the first act is in for some world-shaking revelations by the third. The same is true of P. Djèlí Clark’s <strong>The Dead Cat Tail </strong> <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/04/gary-k-wolfe-reviews-the-dead-cat-tail-assassins-by-p-djeli-clark/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

**@Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky** (date: 2024-04-28, from: Neil Gaiman @ BlueSky)

Big proud happy face. Toby created the version of Dead Boy Detectives that inspired Steve Yockey to make the TV show. (Toby, now's when you point out to DC Comics how much you'd like to write a DBD novel.)

## Paul Di Filippo Reviews A View from the Stars by Cixin Liu

date: 2024-04-28, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>A View from the Stars</strong>, Cixin Liu (Tor 978-1250292117, hardcover, 224pp, $27.99) April 2024</p>
<p>Most authors segregate their fiction from their non-fiction, compiling the two classes of work into separate collections. I always recall one exception I read as a teen, a minor Frederik Pohl volume titled <b>Digits &#38; Dastards</b>, which featured two essays along with the stories. And I suppose that Harlan Ellison’s inclusion of long anecdotal  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/04/paul-di-filippo-reviews-a-view-from-the-stars-by-cixin-liu/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Jake Casella Brookins Reviews Truth of the Aleke by Moses Ose Utomi

date: 2024-04-28, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Truth of the Aleke</strong>, Moses Ose Utomi (Tor­dotcom 978-1-2508-4905-2, $24.99, 112pp, hc) March 2023. Cover by Alyssa Winans.</p>
<p>Among the more fascinating things that Moses Ose Utomi seems to be doing with his Forever Desert series is looking at how worldviews change with experience. The protagonist of <strong>The Lies of the Ajungo</strong>, a young teenage boy, cut through the titular deception with a heroic self-sacrifice.
