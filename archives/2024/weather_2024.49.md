Mesoscale Discussion 2250
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0850 AM CST Thu Dec 05 2024

Areas affected...parts of the Northeast

Concerning...Snow Squall 

Valid 051450Z - 051715Z

SUMMARY...Multiple clusters and loosely banded snow squalls may
persist east into early afternoon, mainly across the southern half
of New York into northern parts of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

DISCUSSION...Near a low-level cyclone centered just north of the
Binghamton area, scattered bursts of heavy snow are ongoing across
parts of southern NY into northeast PA, where surface temperatures
have fallen below freezing along the leading edge of stronger
westerly winds. Upstream, a lake-induced hybrid squall is ongoing
across western NY into northwest PA where more widespread
quarter-mile visibilities have been observed. Per 12Z CAM guidance,
both areas should move east into midday. The western area will be
replaced by a lake-effect snow band this afternoon, connected from
the southern portion of Lake Huron to the eastern part of Lake Erie
within a west-northwesterly flow regime. Surface temperatures will
remain marginal for snow-squall conditions along the
southern/eastern portion of the region (near the I-95 corridor).

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0655 AM CST Thu Dec 05 2024

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Discussion...
An upper trough will continue to shift quickly east-northeastward
today over the Lower Great Lakes and Northeast, with a secondary
speed max/clipper-type wave spreading southeastward over
Manitoba/northern Ontario toward the Upper Great Lakes tonight. Over
the Southwest, an upper low will remain quasi-stationary over the
southern Arizona and northwest Mexico vicinity.

Along the middle Gulf Coast, a few isolated elevated thunderstorms
may still occur early today, but the overall convective potential is
expected to dwindle as a cold front continues south-southeastward
into the northern Gulf of Mexico. Elsewhere, isolated lightning
flashes could occur tonight with a potential increase in elevated
convection across far West Texas/far southern New Mexico in advance
of an upper low over northwest Mexico, and possibly near the Deep
South Texas coast. Severe storms are unlikely in each of these
scenarios as overall buoyancy will be limited.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CST Wed Dec 04 2024

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will continue to advance eastward across the
Northeast on D2 - Thursday as cold upstream air infiltrates the
eastern half of the CONUS. Across the western US, a weak midlevel
trough will remain over the Southwest with upstream surface high
pressure encouraging locally dry/breezy offshore flow across
southern CA. Some locally Elevated fire weather conditions will be
possible, though areas will remain isolated with sparse availability
of fuels. This will preclude the need to add areas at this time.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...20z Update...
No changes are needed to the current D1 Convective Outlook. See
previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 12/02/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1020 AM CST Mon Dec 02 2024/

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A large-scale upper trough will persist over the eastern states
today, while developing slowly eastward towards the western Atlantic
through tonight. Rather cold mid-level temperatures will be present
across the Great Lakes, which may support sporadic lightning flashes
with ongoing lake effect snow bands. The best chance for isolated
lightning appears to be with the band over Lake Huron.

Across deep south TX, the potential for thunderstorms over land
appears lower than earlier, as a stout cap noted on the observed 12Z
BRO sounding will likely inhibit deep convection. While there may
still be some chance for thunderstorms along/near a coastal surface
front, the better lightning potential should tend to remain offshore
through the end of the period.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0125 PM CST Mon Dec 02 2024

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
A few thunderstorms are possible from East Texas into the ArkLaMiss
on Wednesday. No severe thunderstorms are expected.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A strong shortwave trough and accompanying intense jet streak are
forecast to progress quickly southeastward from the Canadian
Prairies/northern Plains through the Upper Midwest, Upper Great
Lakes, and Ohio Valley on Wednesday. By early Thursday morning, the
mid-latitude cyclone associated with this shortwave is forecast to
be over the Lower Great Lakes, with the strong jet streak (i.e. over
120 kt at 500 mb) stretching through its base from IN through the
Mid-Atlantic. Strong height falls and cold mid-level temperatures
will spread eastward with this system, but the cold, dry, and stable
airmass in place across the region will preclude thunderstorm
development. 

Some moderate low-level moisture advection is anticipated from the
TX Coast into the Lower MS Valley, with mid 60s dewpoints likely
extending from the Middle TX Coastal Plain into far southwest LA by
late Wednesday afternoon. Enhanced low/mid-level flow will persist
throughout the day across this region, contributing to a large area
of precipitation from the Middle TX Coast through east and much of
LA and southern AR. A few deeper updrafts are possible embedded
within this larger area of precipitation, with occasional lightning
flashes possible throughout the afternoon and overnight.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1115 AM CST Mon Dec 02 2024

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible along the Texas Coast. No severe
thunderstorms are expected.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
Upper troughing extending from the northern Mid-Atlantic states into
the north-central Gulf of Mexico early Tuesday is forecast to
progress eastward off the East Coast throughout the day. In its
wake, a strong shortwave trough is expected to drop through the
Canadian Prairies into the northern Plains/Upper Midwest late
Tuesday/early Wednesday. 

Strong surface ridging associated with a continental polar airmass
ushered in by lead troughing is also forecast to shift eastward from
the Mid-South into central Appalachians throughout the day. A
reinforcing surge of cold air associated with the Canadian Prairies
shortwave trough will move into the northern/central Plains and
Upper Midwest late Tuesday night through early Wednesday morning. 

This overall pattern will maintain largely stable conditions across
the central and eastern CONUS while also supporting easterly flow
across the Gulf of Mexico, which will result in some modest
low-level moisture advection into TX Gulf Coast. Additionally, low
to mid-level flow will increase across this region late
Tuesday/early Wednesday in response to a deepening surface low and
large-scale mass response. The resulting warm-air advection could
result in a few isolated thunderstorms along the TX Coast, beginning
across south TX early Tuesday before gradually shifting northward
throughout the period.

..Weinman.. 12/02/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0231 AM CST Mon Dec 02 2024/

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level troughing will prevail across the eastern U.S.,
resulting in surface high pressure and associated cool conditions
overspreading much of the CONUS. As such, quiescent fire weather
conditions may be expected over most locales. One exception may be
the southern Florida Peninsula, where dry northwesterly surface flow
(i.e. 5-10 mph winds amid 25-35 percent RH) will be in place for at
least a few hours around afternoon peak heating. However, relatively
weaker surface winds, along with the marginal receptiveness of
fuels, suggest that wildfire spread potential should remain
localized.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0321 PM CST Sun Dec 01 2024

Valid 031200Z - 091200Z

On Day 3/Tuesday, an expansive surface high will shift southeastward
from the Middle MS Valley into the Southeast. On the southeastern
periphery of this feature, a modest pressure gradient will promote
locally breezy northerly surface winds amid a dry antecedent air
mass across portions of southern FL. While locally elevated
fire-weather conditions are possible (given modestly receptive
fuels), the potential for critical conditions appears low. 

Thereafter, fire-weather concerns should be minimal across the CONUS
through the extended forecast period, as northwesterly flow aloft
persists from the northern Rockies into the Southeast -- limiting
the overlap of warm/dry/breezy conditions.
