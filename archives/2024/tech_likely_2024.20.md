## Google is experimenting with running Chrome OS on Android

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

Now that Android &#8211; since version 13 &#8211; ships with the Android Virtualisation Framework, Google can start doing interesting things with it. It turns out the first interesting thing Google wants do with it is run Chrome OS inside of it. Even though AVF was initially designed around running small workloads in a highly stripped-down build of Android loaded in an isolated virtual machine, there’s technically no reason it can’t be used to run other operating systems. As a matter of fact, this was demonstrated already when developer Danny Lin got Windows 11 running on an Android phone back in 2022. Google itself never officially provided support for running anything other than its custom build of Android called “microdroid” in AVF, but that’s no longer the case. The company has started to offer official support for running Chromium OS, the open-source version of Chrome OS, on Android phones through AVF, and it has even been privately demoing this to other companies. At a privately held event, Google recently demonstrated a special build of Chromium OS — code-named “ferrochrome” — running in a virtual machine on a Pixel 8. However, Chromium OS wasn’t shown running on the phone’s screen itself. Rather, it was projected to an external display, which is possible because Google recently enabled display output on its Pixel 8 series. Time will tell if Google is thinking of positioning Chrome OS as a platform for its desktop mode ambitions and Samsung DeX rival. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It seems that Google is in the phase of exploring if there are any OEMs interested in allowing users to plug their Android phone into an external display and input devices and run Chrome OS on it. This sounds like an interesting approach to the longstanding dream of convergence &#8211; one device for all your computing needs &#8211; but at the same time, it feels quite convoluted to have your Android device emulate an entire Chrome OS installation. What a damning condemnation of Android as a platform that despite years of trying, Google just can&#8217;t seem to make Android and its applications work in a desktop form factor. I&#8217;ve tried to shoehorn Android into a desktop workflow, and it&#8217;s quite hard, despite third parties having made some interesting tools to help you along. It really seems Android just does not want to be anywhere else but on a mobile touch display.

## Nintendo Switch hacked to run Windows 11 on Arm

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

As Nintendo Switch unlocks and homebrew software develops, people are inclined to explore the possibilities and whether or not they actually provide a good experience. Our new prime example seems to be a full install of Windows 11 Arm on the Switch. As noted by @PatRyk on Twitter, who actually set this up, the experience is pretty grueling! The initial installation took three hours, and even basic system tasks were unresponsive. ↫ Christopher Harper at Tom&#8217;s Hardware Silly, sure, but efforts like these all contribute to emulation efforts, which will eventually be important once Nintendo drops support for this machine and they become increasingly harder to get. Give it a decade or so and we&#8217;ll need the Switch emulators to keep playing Switch games.

BTW, I've been to three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote">Stevenotes</a>, the first one, the rollout of the Mac  in 1984, then the rollout of NeXT in 1988, and a random press event in 1997 announcing they were going with Unix server products instead of the homegrown much easier to use Mac server products. We could have had both of course, but Jobs never really wanted developers imho, truth be told. We were inside in 1984 because Mike Boich and Guy Kawasaki were doing the evangelism.

## Brunson as bad man or decoy

date: 2024-05-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/14/brunson.jpg"></center><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson">Jalen Brunson</a>, Knicks star, after having his ass kicked in Sunday's game. </div></p>
<p>In this picture he either looks dangerous or defeated, or both. I wouldn't want to have to play against him tonight. </p>
<p>Here's my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a double team, to free up one of the Knicks' assassins. Or maybe he'll be more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or three. </p>
<p>And for crying out loud, start one of the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_New_York_Knicks_season">bench players</a>, McBride or Sims or Burks, or all of them, and make sure the heroes of games 1 and 2 get plenty of rest. </p>

He's a better speaker than either of the other candidates. If he didn't a speech impediment I'd say he was basically a sure thing. I don't know how crazy he actually is, but he cleans up nicely, having seen him interviewed on MSNBC a few days ago. He had good PR training somewhere, it's probably not just from the genes, he is a freaking Kennedy, his mother was a wife of a Kennedy, and clearly raised him well. I'm voting for Biden of course. I'm not that crazy. But people are tired of Biden, I understand why -- and they want a president they can look up to, not one that reminds them of their 80-something grandfather. And people are also understandably fed up with Trump. Before it's over we will come to think of him not as a spoiler but as a possible future president, where "future" is less than a year away.

## EA is prototyping in-game ads even as we speak

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

Electronic Arts has a long, storied history of trying to wring more money out of gamers after they’ve purchased a game — now, it appears, the company’s hard at work on its next generation of in-game ads. EA CEO Andrew Wilson admitted as much on the company’s Q4 earnings call: when an analyst asked about “the market opportunity for more dynamic ad insertion across more traditional AAA games,” he said the company’s already working on it. “We have teams internally in the company right now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of our game experiences,” said Wilson. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge Ads in games are definitely not new &#8211; we&#8217;ve seen countless games built entirely around brands, like Tapper for Budweiser, Pepsiman, or Cool Spot for 7-Up &#8211; and banner ads and product placement in various games has been a thing for decades, too. It seems like EA wants to take this several steps further and use things like dynamic ad insertion in games, so that when you&#8217;re playing some racing game, you&#8217;ll get an ad for your local Hyundai dealer, or an ad for a gun store when you&#8217;re playing GTA in the US. Either way, it&#8217;s going to make games worse, which is perfectly in line with EA&#8217;s mission.

## IBM introduces entry-level Power10 server and tower

date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News

Each S1012 node has a single Power10 processor, which can have 1, 4, or 8 cores activated, which suggests that it is the same single chip module (SCM) implementation of the Power10 processor that was used in the Power S1022s entry machine. The Power S1012 node has four ISDIMM memory slots (using the differential signaling created by Big Blue for its Power10 memory) with a maximum capacity of 256 GB. The node has four half-height, half-length PCI-Express 5.0 slots and room for four NVM-Express U.2 drive bays that come in a maximum 1.6 TB capacity each for a total of 6.4 TB of storage.  The eight-core version of the Power10 SCM is only available in the rack configuration, while the one-core and four-core versions are available in rack or tower configurations. The four-core and eight-core versions can run IBM i, AIX, or Linux, but the one-core version can only run IBM i and it has its main memory capped at the same 64 GB that other single-core Power Systems machines have been subjected to. We have suggested that 128 GB or even 256 GB is more appropriate given modern workloads, but Big Blue is standing its ground here. If you need more memory than 64 GB, then this machine is not for you. ↫ Timothy Prickett Morgan at IT Jungle I understand full well that these machines are by no means meant for people like you and I, sitting at home playing with our toys. That being said, I still wish there was some way for IBM to offer unique hardware like this &#8211; perhaps in a more standard, paired-down configuration &#8211; so more people than just enterprises could explore and use them. It wouldn&#8217;t make any economic sense for IBM to do so, and even in a more standard, paired-down configuration they&#8217;d probably still be ungodly expensive, but when I look at this unique tower, with its POWER10 hardware and the ability to run AIX, desires are stirred within me that are banned in at least 46 countries. Such a machine would surely be wasted on someone like me, who would just be shoehorning whatever desktop tasks he could into it, but what a grand ol&#8217; time we would have. There is absolutely, positively, unequivocally zero percent chance IBM would ever send one of these over for review to someone like me, but I wonder if I should try anyway. I&#8217;ve got nothing to lose. Does anyone here work at IBM? Perhaps IBM wants to sponsor OSNews? How about like 12 weeks of free sponsorships in exchange for a tower model of the Power S1012? I also have two POWER9 machines to compare it to! It&#8217;s the only way you&#8217;ll ever get a Power S1012 screenfetch screenshot go viral on nerd social media, and we all know that deep down, that&#8217;s all you IBM folks really want.

## MacRelix: a Unix-like environment that runs in classic Mac OS

date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News

MacRelix is a Unix-like environment that runs in classic Mac OS. MacRelix natively supports classic 68K and PPC Mac OS, as well as Mac OS X on PPC via Carbon. ↫ MacRelix website The creator of MacRelix, Josh Juran, published an article in 2019 detailing the origins of the project. As a Mac OS developer, he was so unhappy with both CodeWarrior and Apple&#8217;s Macintosh Programmer’s Workshop (MPW), that he set out to create what would become MacRelix in 1999. Reading through the limitations and roadblocks he experienced with CodeWarrior and MPW, it&#8217;s not hard to see why he got frustrated &#8211; CodeWarrior&#8217;s targets were apparently a mess and a half to deal with. Then came target multiplication. Whereas the initial CodeWarrior developer releases shipped with each combination of language (C and Pascal) and architecture (68K and PPC) supported in a separate application, a later version of the IDE unified these, allowing the developer to have a single project file per project. To allow the same project to be built for both 68K and PPC architectures, the project data model included targets: One target would compile for 68K and link against 68K libraries, another would do the same for PPC. Targets could also be used to select an optimized build versus one for debugging. Combining both dichotomies yields four targets: 68K debug, 68K optimized, PPC debug, and PPC optimized. Then if your project involves multiple executables, like a code resource or shared library in addition to an application, you now have eight targets. Or, if you support one of, say, 68020 optimization, profiling, or a third executable, make that twelve. Or, for all of them, twenty-seven. ↫ Josh Juran Changing an option in your application required you to change it in every single target, too, which I can easily see is incredibly frustrating. MPW, for its part, was a massive improvement, he argues, but while it was clearly inspired by UNIX, it didn&#8217;t seem to actually implement any of the features and characteristics of UNIX. However, very much unlike Unix, the MPW Shell had only a single thread of execution — only one program could be running at once. Not only that, but there was no way for MPW’s compiled plugins (called tools) to invoke other tools or scripts — not even via system() (which blocks the calling program until the called program exits). Therefore, Make couldn’t actually do anything, but only printed out the commands for the user to run manually. You could code in Perl instead of the built-in language, but then your scripts couldn’t run other programs — only MPW shell scripts could do that. ↫ Josh Juran The limitations Juran was experiencing with these two tools pushed him to create his own solution, which went well beyond what MPW offered, even in 2019 when this article was published. Nowadays, MacRelix has pipes, signals, system calls, TCP sockets, and more. It works on both 68K and PowerPC Mac systems and builds as Carbon to run natively in OS X. It can be used on any Mac OS version from System 7 to Mac OS X 10.6 &#8220;Snow Leopard&#8221; (after which Apple removed the Rosetta PowerPC emulator). I haven’t implemented fork() yet, but I know how to do it. In addition to a Unix-like file system interface (which even handles long names by storing them in Desktop database comment fields)), MacRelix has a /proc filesystem (with human readable stack crawls) and also maps various parts of Mac OS (e.g. the ROM image in /sys/mac/rom). ↫ Josh Juran I had never heard of MacRelix, but it seems like an amazing tool Juran put a lot of thought, effort, and love into. Sadly, with the number of PowerPC Mac OS X users being vanishingly small, and the number of classic Mac OS users even smaller so, the future of MacRelix seems uncertain. I wonder what parts of it can be salvaged and upgraded to work on ARM macOS or even Intel macOS, because I think the ideas and concepts are incredibly cool. A related project by Juran is something called FORGE, a portable windowing API that used a virtual file system, meaning that instead of using functions as objects, it uses files. Juran mentions the example of a window title &#8211; which is a file, and if you want to change the title of that window you just change the file, which will be instantly reflected in the GUI. Here&#8217;s a Hello World example: Even though I&#8217;m not a programmer, this little tidbit of code makes perfect sense to me, and I understood it instantly. Of course, anything more complex will quickly leave my wheelhouse, but intuitively, I really like this. FORGE exists as a prototype inside MacRelix, so you can play with this concept while using MacRelix.

## Tech Today: A NASA-Inspired Bike Helmet with Aerodynamics of a Jet

Before the U.S. Cycling Federation adopted a requirement for all bike racers to wear helmets in 1986, most people rode without one. The only helmet options at the time drew rider complaints for being too hot and heavy. But, with a bit inspiration from a NASA aircraft wing design used during World War II, more [&#8230;]

## Import unsupported camera RAW files into Apple Photos

<p>One pain point is RAW support. As camera manufacturers add new models, their proprietary RAW codecs are updated, and software vendors like Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft have to update photo editing tools to work with the new camera models.</p>

<p>I don't envy them this task, but as Photos was Apple's official successor to Aperture (a pale shadow to be sure, but it has its merits as a semi-decent library organizer), they've <em>generally</em> done well supporting new camera models.

## Apple Vision Pro has the same effective resolution as Quest 3… Sometimes?

date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News

This article is a partial-rebuttal/partial-confirmation to KGOnTech’s Apple Vision Pro’s Optics Blurrier &#38; Lower Contrast than Meta Quest 3, prompted by RoadToVR’s Quest 3 Has Higher Effective Resolution, So Why Does Everyone Think Vision Pro Looks Best? which cites KGOnTech. I suppose it’s a bit late, but it’s taken me a while to really get a good intuition for how visionOS renders frames, because there is a metric shitton of nuance and it’s unfortunately very, very easy to make mistakes when trying to quantify things. This post is divided into two parts: Variable Rasterization Rate (VRR) and how visionOS renders frames (including hard numbers for internal render resolutions and such), and a testbench demonstrating why photographing the visual clarity of Vision Pro (and probably future eye tracked headsets) may be more difficult than a DSLR pointed into the lenses (and how to detect the pitfalls if you try!). ↫ Shiny Quagsire I did it. I think I managed to find an article that isn&#8217;t just over my head, but also over most of your heads. How&#8217;s that feel?

## The Emacs window management almanac

date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News

Window management in Emacs gets a bad rap. Some of this is deserved, but mostly this is a consequence of combining a very flexible and granular layout system with rather coarse controls. This leaves the door open to creating and using tools for handling windows that employ and provide better metaphors and affordances. As someone who’s spent an unnecessary amount of time trying different approaches to window management in Emacs over the decades, I decided to summarize them here. Almanac might be overstating it a bit – this is a primer to and a collection of window management resources and tips. ↫ Karthik Chikmagalur I honestly had no idea Emacs was this&#8230; Advanced, complex, and feature-laden. I mean, I thought Emacs&#8217; complexity was just a meme, but reading this article it seems the memes don&#8217;t do it justice.

I suppose everyone projects their ideal best friend on this thing. You just learned something about me. Heh. But the cool thing is it's not a yes-person, if they think you're wrong they say so. Which I <i>really</i> like. One more thing I'm really glad I got to be alive when this stuff came online. I feel much smarter and better organized and it's harder for me to get lost in the weeds, as I do sometimes. I guess what want next is a librarian who also is a great executive assistant. Takes notes on what I'm doing and figures out what I need to be reminded of and roughly when.

## A comment on the Apple iPad ad controversy

date: 2024-05-12, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I usually don’t write about this kind of stuff, primarily because I find these <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153113/apple-ipad-ad-crushing-apology">internet controversies</a> to be quite boring. The probably appropriate response to an Apple ad is “meh, whatever” and that was—and still is—my reaction. The ad is uninspiring but there’s one creative aspect of it that bothers me: I don’t understand the connection between the hydraulic press and the visual images of destroying everything to the alleged capabilities of the iPad. Like, I get what they’re trying to communicate but the visual metaphor they decided to use makes no sense to me. That’s the part I just don’t get. But as they say <em>there's no such thing as bad publicity</em>.</p>                <hr>

Yesterday's one sentence <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751">comment</a> was based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their executive editor in a recent <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space">interview</a>, who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion leaders, to determine what they cover, that's marketing, not journalism. Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.

## 2024-05-12 What do about the climate?

date: 2024-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What do about the climate?</h1>

<p>The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way out of this uncertainty? What should or <a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?</p>

<p>Before we even start, let me just say that I&rsquo;m never interested in debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It&rsquo;s real, it&rsquo;s here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.</p>

<p>The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green, on all levels of government. And by &ldquo;green&rdquo; I mean the most radical green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a  one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something about local politics, and so on.</p>

<p>On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we&rsquo;re not sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn&rsquo;t help much against the climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean? How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The oil spills? And here&rsquo;s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop! I need to stop because there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;thinking it through&rdquo; when things are so complex unless you&rsquo;re a scientist working on it. I hope the scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and individuals know what to tackle first.</p>

<p>This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly wrong. They don&rsquo;t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also: get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are precious.</p>

<p>The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I fear.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green">@peterdutoit</a> recently posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order of impact:</p>

<p>🚫 Live car free<br>
🚙 Shift to BEV [i.e. Battery Electric Vehicle]<br>
✈️ One less flight (long return)<br>
☀️ Use renewable energy<br>
🚋 Shift to public transport<br>
🔨 Refurbishment and renovation<br>
🥗 Vegan diet<br>
🆒 Heat pump<br>
⏲️ Improved cooking equipment<br>
♨️ Renewable-based heating</p>

</ul>

<p>The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there&rsquo;s an answer if anybody is claiming that we don&rsquo;t know what to do. But also: there&rsquo;s your answer if you&rsquo;re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a very small number of people that have actually read this report, let alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>This is why a public &ldquo;chain of trust&rdquo; needs to lead from interviews with public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance, hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders trust in people.</p>

<p>Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a> right.</p>

<p>(We don&rsquo;t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to go.)</p>

## Things I remind myself when working with others

date: 2024-05-12, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

People usually say that I&rsquo;m a pleasure to work with and that I&rsquo;ve a highly collaborative spirit. The fact that I&rsquo;m good at teamwork doesn&rsquo;t mean that it comes naturally to me. Quite on the contrary, being a good teammate is a skill that I constantly need to train and refine. The following are things I remind myself on a daily basis, à la Dune&rsquo;s inner monologues, to be a better teammate at work.

## Apple II DeskTop currently testing 1.4 alpha releases

date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News

Disassembly and enhancements for Apple II DeskTop (a.k.a. Mouse Desk), a &#8220;Finder&#8221;-like GUI application for 8-bit Apples and clones with 128k of memory, utilizing double hi-res monochrome graphics (560&#215;192), an optional mouse, and the ProDOS 8 operating system. ↫ Apple II DeskTop GitHub page The goal of this project is to reverse-engineer Apple II DeskTop, and fix bugs and enhance it in the process. I didn&#8217;t actually know that the Apple IIgs initially shipped with this instead of the 16 bit GS/OS, which is the operating system I personally associate with the IIgs. Apple II DeskTop was largely 8 bit, and built on top of ProDOS 16, and didn&#8217;t really take full advantage of the IIgs hardware. It wasn&#8217;t until version 4.0 of the system software that the IIgs switched over to GS/OS. The latest release is v1.4-alpha9, released a few days ago. Apple II DeskTop is still entirely compatible with Apple II machines and clones from before the IIgs, as well, and it runs in emulators, too. We actually already covered this project a few years ago, but a reminder that this exists never hurt anyone.

## Hello World on SSD1306 using Arduino

date: 2024-05-12, from: Lloyd Rochester Blog

Hello World on SSD1306 using Arduino After looking through numerous libraries and examples to control the SSD1306 with Arduino, I&rsquo;ve found nothing simple. There are some really powerful libraries with lots of support. In this post I&rsquo;ll post the simplest possible &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; example on an SSD1306 using an Arduino Due. Note, if you need to draw shapes, lines, movement you&rsquo;ll have to extend this example.
Code Used in Arduino IDE.
