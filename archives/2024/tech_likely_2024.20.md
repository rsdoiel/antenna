## 2024-05-16 IRC forever!

date: 2024-05-16, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-16-irc-forever">2024-05-16 IRC forever!</h1>

<p>You know the joke, right? <a href="https://xkcd.com/1782/">In the far future, somebody, somewhere, still wants to use IRC</a>.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-05-16-irc-1.jpg" alt="XKCD called it, many years ago" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a bot that can connect to both Discord and IRC. It connects to Discord because this is where I found people to game with. Discord comes with audio chat. It catapulted my gaming to a whole new level. So much so that I decided that I&rsquo;d be a paying customer. Still, I want to be prepared for the day when Discord goes down. When it inevitably missteps and becomes untenable. I want to have systems ready to go.</p>

<p>The idea is to have something read that does <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/Chat">chat</a> for us all.</p>

<p>Behind the curtains, I run an IRC server using <a href="https://ngircd.barton.de/">ngIRCd</a>. I was able to configure it and I was able to federate with <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp">@kyonshi</a>&rsquo;s IRC server. IRC has been federated for all these years and it&rsquo;s so incredibly light weight, very much unlike XMPP and Matrix and the other options I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>

<p>There are a number of web-based IRC clients that give it a Discord-like user interface. I personally run two instances of <a href="https://thelounge.chat/">The Lounge</a>, one that&rsquo;s free for all and one with accounts. If you register for an account, you can upload a small amount of files for easy image sharing and the like and it also keeps logs for you (so you don&rsquo;t have to learn how to use an IRC &ldquo;bouncer&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Other options would be <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/">Kiwi IRC</a> or <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/">IRC Cloud</a>, if you want a paid service.</p>

<p>The bot I was talking about is called <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/norn.git">Norn</a>. Right now we have an <code>#﻿open-table</code> or <code>#﻿next-games channel</code> on the Discord servers where people announce their games. As players sign up, the messages get edited. It&rsquo;s not really events, it&rsquo;s not reminders, it&rsquo;s not a calendar, but it&rsquo;s simple and it works. You can search it. But if you&rsquo;re on IRC, it doesn&rsquo;t work so well. So Norn does that.</p>

<p>On one of the Discord server, there&rsquo;s a bot called Wettergoblin (the weather goblin) that keeps track of in-game events. Every channel has its own time-axis and you can get an export of all the events. This is great for coordinating the many games in the same setting, each happening in their own channel. I really wanted something like that but instead of using in-game time, I wanted to use real time. This simplified the requirements for me, so Norn does a bit of that. The Wettergoblin also does in-game weather, keeps a Greyhawk calendar, shows a timeline comparing where the various channels are compared to each other and all of that, which Norn doesn&rsquo;t do.</p>

<p>Norn also acts as a dice bot and as a knowledge repository.</p>

<p>Game dates, sign-ups, in-game events, knowledge base, all of that happens per channel. It&rsquo;s great!</p>

<p>If you look at the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%C3%BCrich/Norn">bilingual help page</a> of the bot on a phone, prepare for a bit of confusion as the German and the English bits are interleaved. On a bigger screen, you&rsquo;d get two columns…</p>

## 2024-05-09 Hoping for the next AI winter

date: 2024-05-16, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-09-hoping-for-the-next-ai-winter">2024-05-09 Hoping for the next AI winter</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://chirp.enworld.org/@taichara" title="@taichara@chirp.enworld.org">@taichara</a> pointed me to a blog post that Creative Commons (CC) wrote in 2023 about the court cases against GitHub, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and the claim that their use of copyrighted works to train the machines is copyright infringement. CC does not agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Creative Commons has argued elsewhere, and others agree, I believe that this type of use should be protected by copyright’s fair use doctrine. In this blog post I will discuss what fair use is, what purpose it serves, and why I believe that using copyrighted works to train generative AI models should be permitted under this law. – <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/02/17/fair-use-training-generative-ai/">Fair Use: Training Generative AI</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess I don&rsquo;t mind that blog post. For one, Fair Use is a very USA thing and I don&rsquo;t live there. Furthermore, the CC licenses don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;this material is fine for AI training&rdquo; – so whether this is fine or not will be decided by the courts. I would only worry if CC turns out to be working on a version 5 of their licenses with an explicit exception for AI training. And even then, we can keep on using version 4 of the license. There is no automatic upgrade option.</p>

<p>This is why I feel fine.</p>

<p>Imagine the Dude from The Big Lebowski saying, &ldquo;Yeah, well, that&rsquo;s just, like, their opinion…&rdquo;</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look as if CC will be changing the license. The courts still get to decide. If the courts decide in favour of free-for-all AI training, then rich people win for the moment. But even then, we can still nationalise their businesses, or prohibit AI training, or raise prices on electricity and water. The fight isn&rsquo;t over. Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>Maybe this is a thing with lawyers. We trust people who share our values and we’d trust somebody when they write something along the lines of “AI training is terrible and AI use is dubious but what can you do, it’s in the hand of the courts, we certainly don’t support it.” But lawyers trust other lawyers who say “we’ll see what the courts say but our understanding is that nobody should stop AI training because that’s the trade-off copyright makes and we support people and corporations exercising their rights.”</p>

<p>The apparent moral support on copyright grounds is revolting, but this approach seems typical to me. They say: The point of the law is this or that. We say: The result of these actions is bad for society and bad for the climate. They are externalising all the costs. The artists and authors who want to produce new works are losing their jobs. The people double-checking the computers and their training are burning out. The communities where these corporations build their computing centres suffer from water scarcity because the water is used to cool the computers. The countries where these corporations build their computing centres need to build more power plants because so much electricity is required to train their models. The move to renewable energies is delayed. Phasing out nuclear power is delayed and more radioactive waste ends up on our lands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture.
This place is not a place of honor&hellip; no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here&hellip; nothing valued is here.
– <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages">Long-term nuclear waste warning messages</a>, Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or we can believe in nuclear fusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>AI models made up of billions of parameters require huge amounts of energy to train. OpenAI&rsquo;s old GPT-3 system reportedly consumed 936 megawatt hours … the average household consumes about 10.5 MWh per year. That means training GPT-3 consumed as much energy as about 90 households consume in a year. – <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/22/google_deepmind_train_alphageometry_system/">Energy breakthrough needed to build AGI, says OpenAI boss Altman</a>, The Register</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, nuclear fusion only seems to be working inside the sun:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1955: At the first Atoms for Peace meeting in Geneva, Homi J. Bhabha predicts that fusion will be in commercial use within two decades. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_nuclear_fusion">Timeline of nuclear fusion</a>, Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And what for? The people who are looking for answers get served bullshit slop that&rsquo;s wrong and hurtful and racist and misogynist. We see this in customer service degrading, in search engines degrading, in websites degrading. The corporations don&rsquo;t mind that they&rsquo;re feeding us slop as long as they are making money.</p>

<p>We are enabling this because these corporations are powerful and rich. They buy our politicians with money and promises of jobs, they don&rsquo;t pay the taxes they ought to pay and then they don&rsquo;t deliver on the jobs, and the jobs they offer are menial and subservient when we&rsquo;d prefer to be creative and free. We thought we&rsquo;d be writing and painting all day while the machines serve us but we end up serving them while they do the writing and painting, badly!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to defend against these corporations because the knowledge required to defeat them is not known to us all. We don&rsquo;t read about it in the media. Instead, they volunteer for all the posts, offer their experts, pay for their own research, write their own glowing press releases and commission promising reports. This is how regulatory capture works.</p>

<p>So yes, we should nationalise them, regulate them, force them to pay for the true cost of resources they use, outlaw their energy waste, force them to label their output, shun them. We should kick them from our company. Like a creeping disease their rot spreads, destroying the technology we built, the search engines, databases, websites, turning it all into AI slop. It is revolting.</p>

<p>And maybe copyright is not the right tool to stop corporations from training their machines on our works. But in the big picture, they are still wrong.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.coop/@eloquence" title="@eloquence@social.coop">@eloquence</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The folks who are calling such training &ldquo;theft&rdquo; might regret what they seem to be implicitly asking for, i.e. much stricter copyright. Copyright law won&rsquo;t prevent Microsoft, Google, OpenAI or Adobe from making shady licensing deals, but they&rsquo;ll prevent the free/open community from keeping up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s true, I don&rsquo;t want to ask for stricter copyright. But I still oppose all the things that are wrong with the current AI bubble.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc" title="@mcc@mastodon.social">@mcc</a> recently wrote about a similar thing: We use free software licenses in order to distribute our software for the benefit of our fellow humans but not necessarily to train the machines of corporations that are responsible for all the slop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like, heck, how am I <em>supposed</em> to rely on my code getting preserved after I lose interest, I die, BitBucket deletes every bit of Mercurial-hosted content it ever hosted, etc? Am I supposed to rely on <em>Microsoft</em> to responsibly preserve my work? Holy crud no.
We <em>want</em> people to want their code widely mirrored and distributed. That was the reason for the licenses. That was the social contract. But if machine learning means the social contract is dead, why would people want their code mirrored? – <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mcc/112209218607258564">mmc</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&rsquo;re using copyright to keep the software free. If AI regurgitating our software from its impenetrable memories circumvents copyright it also circumvents our licenses and therefore pulls the claws and teeth free software has to fight for its freedom.</p>

<p>This is why opposing the current AI bubble is important. No matter how I look at it, the big picture shows that this kind of AI is our enemy. It&rsquo;s just that copyright is the wrong weapon.</p>

<p>This is why we continue fighting all the negatives these corporations bring to the table. And if it turns out that their business model doesn&rsquo;t work unless they bring all these negatives to the table, then I guess that&rsquo;s just that. We are under no obligation to support their business model. In fact, it is our right and our duty to regulate the world in order to improve it for all of us. We&rsquo;ve been doing it for a very long time.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping for the next AI winter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the history of artificial intelligence, an AI winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. The field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or even decades later. – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI winter</a>, Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2024-05-16</strong>. Cory Doctorow also thinks that copyright is the wrong weapon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Creative workers who hope that they can use copyright law to prevent AI from changing the creative labor market are likely to be very disappointed in court … Individual creative workers rarely have any bargaining leverage over the corporations that license our copyrights. … Rather than going to Congress alongside our bosses from the studios and labels and publishers to demand more copyright, we could go to Congress alongside every kind of worker, from fast-food cashiers to publishing assistants to truck drivers to demand the right to sectoral bargaining. – <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/13/spooky-action-at-a-close-up/#invisible-hand">AI &ldquo;art&rdquo; and uncanniness</a></p>

## Dave Goes Microsoft

date: 2024-05-16, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Last Monday was my first day as an official employee of Microsoft where I’ll be working on web components as part of the <a href="https://fluent2.microsoft.design/">Fluent</a> design system team.. As longtime readers already know, I’ve had a long term relationship with Microsoft – from <a href="https://paravelinc.com/work/microsoft/">Paravel’s 2012 responsive redesign of the Microsoft homepage</a> to the five year <a href="https://daverupert.com/tag/davegoeswindows">#davegoeswindows</a> stunt –  it feels like a new chapter in the career story arc to finally acquire one of the famous blue badges. I’m still new and have barely setup my computer but so far my team of peers, the larger group, the project itself, and the other folks across Microsoft I’ve connected with are all great.</p>
<p>Going from a company with two coworkers to a company with 200K coworkers is certainly an adjustment. It’s my first job in 18 years where I’m not working for myself but by far the biggest eye-opener throughout this process was doing tech interviews! I learned a lot about myself; like how after decades of coding in a room by myself, performing in front of someone else isn’t natural for me. Weirdly for me, a live demo in front of thousands of people… no problem. A random generated coding challenge in front of one person… palms sweaty, mom’s spaghetti levels of difficult. I also learned that too much caffeine and the panic-flavored adrenaline of interviewing is a lot of chemistry for my active brain to process.</p>
<p>I eventually figured out how to interview and I had a lot of great conversations with great people at great companies. That said, this experience left me with lingering qualms about the tech interview process. A lot of it comes down to the information asymmetry where the seller (the hiring company) has more information than the buyer (the job candidate) and it’s hard to get any feedback for self-improvement. Even in my limited experience, it’s not uncommon to sink 15+ hours into a take home coding test and interview loop only to receive a terse rejection. Granted there’s promise of a six figure salary at the end of the rainbow, these jobs don’t fall out of the sky so you need to put in work, but I think that situation needs to be a bit more equitable to candidates – a Newtonian dynamic of matching effort.</p>
<p>One question they ask you at interviews is “What are you looking for in your next role?” and while that sparks thousands of ideas, I boiled my needs and wants down to two core concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be a part of a larger team of engineers</strong> - I’d like to work on a larger team of developers. I want to be in a situation where I can actively and passively learn from other engineers who are subject matter experts in different subjects. As a life-long learner, I’d like to take myself out of the “lone developer” paradigm and absorb as much as I can.</li>
<li><strong>Be tangential to the money machine</strong> - When you run your own business there’s a tight coupling between <em>how much you work</em> and <em>how much money you make</em> and you’re constantly aware of that fact. After 18 years of running my own business and two particularly intense years of startup burnout, I’d like to try something different and play a more supportive operational role for a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I found that in Microsoft. There’s a multitude of people I can ping about niche technology choices. There’s even access to a library of research papers. And already I can see how operating in a product support role seems to provide more opportunity for strategy to the broader needs of the organization as opposed to reactivity to the needs <em>du jour</em> that happen in Productland.</p>
<p>I’m sure throughput will be a bit slower without direct access to the publish to production button. I’m sure there’s topics I won’t be able to talk about on this here blog (but I tend not to blog about specific work-related activities here anyways so that won’t change). And I’m sure I’ll have to put a disclaimer here and there that these ideas are my own and not reflective of my employer. Henceforth and furthermore all bad ideas are copyright of Dave Rupert LLC®.</p>
<p>It’s the end of an era for sure but also the beginning of a new one and potentially the beginning of lots of new ones, who knows. Thanks to Trent and Reagan. Thanks to everyone who provided emotional support on this journey. Thanks to esteemed friends who provided referrals. Given the current macroeconomic situation, I feel lucky to have landed somewhere familiar with great opportunities and many Dave Rupert-shaped problems.</p>

The thing that <a href="https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/">Casey Newton predicts</a> for Google and news has already happened for the huge base of reference info for software development. We no longer go to the sources, don't need to, the ChatGPT version is an order of magnitude better. What we do need is people to keep asking and answering questions for each other, so the knowledge can be added into the AI database. We're going somewhere here. It's worth going there, imho, having experienced the before, and only starting to glimpse the now and near-future. But it's as big a step as the move to PCs, then GUIs, web.

The perception of colour is a gift just as definitely granted to one person, and denied to another, as an ear for music; and the very first requisite for true judgment of Saint Mark’s, is the perfection of that colour-faculty which few people ever set themselves seriously to find out whether they possess or not.

I'd like to create a notebook of info I'd like it to have available for people who inquire about a product I'm developing. As I'm working on the code, I develop features that sometimes don't make it into the docs. But when I'm working on the feature, I take lots of notes in my work outline. I'd like to give that outline to a LLM and let it figure out which product I'm talking about by the context it appears in. Maybe all I have to do is publish the notes when the product comes out, and eventually, like a search engine, my favorite AI will crawl it. I wonder if it makes sense to somehow pre-digest it. I wish I had a panel of experts about this stuff, but I guess they'd have to be human, at least at this point in time.

As I look out of the window at yet another rainy day, it occurs to me that we missed an opportunity to get climate change taken seriously.  Here in Britain, &#8216;global warming&#8217; often sounds rather nice. An opportunity to improve domestic vineyards, perhaps, and make wines here like the Romans used to do.  Or to <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/05/16/12067/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## Qualcomm details Linux on Snapdragon X Elite, and it’s looking surprisingly good

date: 2024-05-16, from: OS News

With Qualcomm and Microsoft about to flood the market with devices using the new Snapdragon X Elite, those of us who don&#8217;t want to use Windows felt a bit uneasy &#8211; what&#8217;s Linux support going to look like for this new generation of ARM devices? Well, it seems Qualcomm&#8217;s been busy, and they&#8217;ve published a blog post detailing their work on Linux support for the X Elite. It’s been our priority not only to support Linux on our premium-tier SoCs, but to support it pronto. In fact, within one or two days of publicly announcing each generation of Snapdragon 8, we’ve posted the initial patchset for Linux kernel support. Snapdragon X Elite was no exception: we announced on October 23 of last year and posted the patchset the next day. That was the result of a lot of pre-announcement work to get everything up and running on Linux and Debian. ↫ Qualcomm&#8217;s developer blog In the blog post, the company details exactly which X Elite features have already been merged into mainline with Linux 6.8 and 6.9, as well as which features will be merged into mainline in Linux 6.10 and 6.11, and to be quite frank &#8211; it&#8217;s looking really solid, especially considering this is Qualcomm we&#8217;re talking about. Over the coming six months, they&#8217;re going to focus on getting end-to-end hardware video decoding working, including in Firefox and Chrome, as well as various CPU and GPU optimisations, adding the required firmware to the linux-firmware package, and providing access to easy installers. All in all, it&#8217;s looking like the X Elite will be exceptionally well supported by Linux before the year&#8217;s over. The blog post also details the boot path for Linux on the X Elite, and that, too, is looking good. It&#8217;s using a standard UEFI boot process, and supports GRUB and systemd-boot out of the box. Linux boots up using devicetrees, though, and apparently, there&#8217;s a known problem with using those that Qualcomm and the community are working on. We’re working closely with upstream communities on an open problem with the UEFI-based BIOS while booting with devicetrees. The problem is that, when you have more than one devicetree blob (DTB) packed into the firmware package flashed on the device, there is no standard way of selecting a devicetree to pass on to the kernel. OEMs commonly put multiple DTBs into the firmware package so it will support devices with slightly different SKUs, so we’re keen to solve this problem. ↫ Qualcomm&#8217;s developer blog I am pleasantly surprised by the openness and straightforwardness Qualcomm is showing the Linux community here, and I really hope this is a sign of how the company will keep supporting its laptop and possibly desktop-oriented SoCs from here on out. It seems like next year we will finally be getting competitive ARM laptops that can run Linux in a fully supported fashion.

## Experiment in Java native calls

date: 2024-05-16, from: Marginallia log

I&rsquo;ve experimentally replaced some of the Java implementations of quicksort and binary search with calls to C++ code, and saw huge benefits for the sorting code but the same or worse performance for binary search.
The Marginalia Search engine is mainly written in Java, which is language that is good at many things, but not particularly pleasant to work with when it comes to low level systems programming.
Unfortunately, a part of building an internet search engine involves database-adjacent low level programming.

## Android 15 beta 2 released

date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News

Google released Android 15 beta 2 today, and with it, they unveiled some more of the new features coming to Android later this year when the final release lands. Android 15 comes with something called a private space, an area with an extra layer of authentication where you can keep applications and data hidden away, such as banking applications or health data. It&#8217;s effectively a separate user profile, and shows up as a separate area in the application drawer when unlocked. When locked, it disappears entirely from sight, share sheets, and so on. Another awesome new feature is Theft Detection Lock, which uses Google &#8220;AI&#8221; to detect when a phone is snatched out of your hands by someone running, biking, or driving away, and instantly locks it. Theft like this is quite common in certain areas, and this seems like an excellent use of &#8220;AI&#8221; (i.e., accelerometer data) to discourage thieves from trying this. There&#8217;s also a bunch of smaller stuff, like custom vibration patterns per notification, giving applications partial access to only your most recent photos and videos, system-wide preferences for which gender you&#8217;d like to be addressed as in gendered languages (French gets this feature first), and a whole lot more. Developers also get a lot to play with here, from safer intents to something like ANGLE: Vulkan is Android&#8217;s preferred interface to the GPU. Therefore, Android 15 includes ANGLE as an optional layer for running OpenGL ES on top of Vulkan. Moving to ANGLE will standardize the Android OpenGL implementation for improved compatibility, and, in some cases, improved performance. You can test out your OpenGL ES app stability and performance with ANGLE by enabling the developer option in Settings -> System -> Developer Options -> Experimental: Enable ANGLE on Android 15. ↫ Android developer blog You can install Android 15 beta 2 on a number f Pixel devices and devices from other OEMs starting today. I installed it on my Pixel 8 Pro, and after a few hours I haven&#8217;t really noticed anything breaking, but that&#8217;s really not enough time to make any meaningful observations. Google also detailed Wear OS 5. Later this year, battery life optimizations are coming to watches with Wear OS 5. For example, running an outdoor marathon will consume up to 20% less power when compared to watches with Wear OS 4. And your fitness apps will be able to help improve your performance with the option to support more data types like ground contact time, stride length and vertical oscillation. ↫ Android developer blog Wear OS 5 will also improve the Watch Face Format with more complications, which is very welcome, because the selection of complications is currently rather meager. Wear OS 5 will also ship later this year.

## Raspberry Pi officially announces intent to IPO

date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News

As expected earlier this year, Raspberry Pi is going public on the stock exchange in London. Back then, CEO Eben Upton said he did not expect the IPO to change how Raspberry Pi did things, but history tells us that initial public offerings tend to, well, change how companies do things. In their official announcement that they intend to hold an IPO, there&#8217;s an incredibly interesting and telling contradiction, as noted by @yassie_j on MastoAkkoma: Raspberry Pi, in their listing press release, says: The Enthusiast and Education market is the “heart” of the Raspberry Pi movement. But also says: Industrial and Embedded market  accounts  over 72 per cent So the heart seems to be going neglected, it seems, because there’s no way you’re going to not cash in on industrial applications. Especially when you’ve just done a big IPO. ↫ @yassie_j on Akkoma This exactly illustrates the fears we all have about what an IPO is going to mean for Raspberry Pi. It&#8217;s already become increasingly more difficult for enthusiasts to get their hands on the latest Raspberry Pi models, but once the IPO&#8217;s done and there&#8217;s shareholders breathing down their neck, that will most likely only get worse. If the industrial and embedded market is where you&#8217;re making most of your money, where do you think Raspberry Pi devices are going to end up? Luckily the market&#8217;s a lot bigger and more varied now than it was back when Raspberry Pi was new, so we have a wide variety of options to choose from. Still, I&#8217;m definitely worried about what Raspberry Pi, as a company, will look like five, ten years from now.

## Curation, search, and the future of the web

date: 2024-05-15, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Google I/O 2024 is underway and a bunch of articles came out about what Google's changes to its core product (search) mean for the web as a whole. Sean Hollister at The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24074314/google-now-offers-web-search">has a piece on the new “web” search option</a> (a piece that starts with <em>“This is not a joke”</em>) while Casey Newton wrote a  nice articled titled <a href="https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/">“Google’s broken link to the web”</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly Google has revealed that AI is going to be integrated pretty much everywhere, and the goal is to let the AI do the googling for you. Which sounds great, in theory. After all, as the fine people at The Browser Company have eloquently explained to the world, the web is in such a terrible state that the only way out of this madness is to let an AI deal with all the garbage and spammy content that’s out there. I already <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">expressed my doubts about this plan</a> and I don’t think what Google is doing is any better.</p>
<p>Google, as a company, is in an odd position. They are, fundamentally, an advertising company. Almost 70% of their revenues are generated by ads. Ads on the SERP, ads on their various products and ads served by their ad network on 3rd party websites. When they say that they’re going to do the googling for you they don’t just mean the search part. In theory, AI will also go find the information you’re looking for on 3rd party sites so they’ll do the googling but also the actual browsing. Did you spot the issue? How are people going to consume ads on 3rd party sites if you no longer need to visit 3rd party sites? And if AI is going to take over the entire top part of the SERP with its generated answer, why should companies pay Google to appear at the top of the search results if those search results are not going to be seen by the majority of people?</p>
<p>It’s a bizarre situation. The answer to missing ad revenues is obviously going to be more ads. I’m sure Google will figure out a way to inject ads into their AI-generated bullshit.</p>
<p>Some people are obviously freaking out about the recent news. That’s because a huge number of sites out there rely on Google to bring traffic to their websites, sites that are then monetised via ads in most cases. If traffic goes down, ad revenues go down. And that’s a bad thing, right? Right? Well, maybe? I guess it depends. The current state of the web is unsustainable. And maybe AI and AI-generated garbage is what we need to push the current situation over the edge and force some changes.</p>
<p>I think curation, actual human curation, is going to play an important role in the future. In a web filled with generated nonsense, content curated by knowledgeable human beings is going to be incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>I find this current phase of the web incredibly interesting. I have no idea how things will evolve but I’m glad I can be part of it, even just as an external observer.</p>                <hr>

## NetBSD bans use of Copilot-generated code

date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News

The NetBSD project seems to agree with me that code generated by &#8220;AI&#8221; like Copilot is tainted, and cannot be used safely. The project&#8217;s added a new guideline banning the use of code generated by such tools from being added to NetBSD unless explicitly permitted by &#8220;core&#8220;, NetBSD&#8217;s equivalent, roughly, of &#8220;technical management&#8221;. Code generated by a large language model or similar technology, such as such as GitHub/Microsoft&#8217;s Copilot, OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT, or Facebook/Meta&#8217;s Code Llama, is presumed to be tainted code, and must not be committed without prior written approval by core. ↫ NetBSD Commit Guidelines GitHub Copilot is copyright infringement and open source license violation at an industrial scale, and as I keep reiterating &#8211; the fact Microsoft is not training Copilot on its own closed-source code tells you all you need to know about what Microsoft thinks about the legality of Copilot.

## GNOME OS is switching from OSTree to systemd-sysupdate

date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News

I&#8217;m pretty sure most of you are familiar with KDE Neon, the distribution KDE maintains to provide easy access to the latest KDE technologies. However, did you know GNOME has something similar, called GNOME OS? It&#8217;s been around for a while, but has a far lower profile than KDE Neon does, and it seems they want to change that and put more of a spotlight on GNOME OS. GNOME OS is an immutable distribution using OSTree, the same technology used by the various popular immutable versions from the Fedora family. It seems GNOME OS is working to leave OSTree behind, and move to systemd-sysupdate instead, which has been available since systemd 251, released in May 2022. The developers claim this will bring the following benefits: To complete the move from OSTree to systemd-sysupdate, a few things need to be completed. First, the boot process and root filesystem had to be migrated, which was done last year. Second, sysupdate needs to integrated into GNOME, as for now, you can only use it via the command line. This work is ongoing, and requires a new D-Bus service and polkit integration to allow GNOME Software to manage the update process. Of course, there&#8217;s more work that needs to be done to complete this migration, but these are the main tasks. All of this work is part of the project&#8217;s goal to make GNOME OS nightlies viable for daily-driving for quality assurance purposes, and I&#8217;m sure all this work will also make GNOME OS more attractive to people outside of the developer community. It&#8217;s basically GNOME/systemd taken to the extreme, and while that will surely make quite a few people groan, I personally find it great that this will make GNOME OS a more capable choice for everyone. That&#8217;s what open source is all about, in the end.

## Discovery Alert: An Earth-sized World and Its Ultra-cool Star

date: 2024-05-15, from: NASA breaking news

Our galaxy is a jewel box of red stars. More than 70% of the stars in the Milky Way are M dwarfs, also known as red dwarfs. These stars are cool and dim compared with our Sun, but they often blast orbiting exoplanets with high-energy radiation, especially early in their lives. And those ‘‘lives’’ last […]

I'm discovering new significance for it every day. An example. I had to go back to some very complex code I wrote a week ago. I wanted to give it new flexibility, that would be simple from the user's point of view, and in order for it to work technically it has to maintain that simplicity internally. It's a tall order to go back to something complex a week after writing it, and rip it apart and put it back together and have it retain the simplicity it had before. But I had an advantage this time that I had never had before, a programming partner with a perfect memory. I had written the original code with ChatGPT. So I went back and asked it to review my plan, and then worked with it step by step as I had before. It had perfect recall, right, of course where my recall is pretty sketchy. It took two sessions to get it done, but it works now, and I'm confident I've covered all the bases. How do you put that story in a press release? If you want to understand a new technology, don't talk to the CEO of the tech company that made the product, their lives are whirlwinds, they don't have time or the capacity to understand how big the idea is, they just know that it is big. If you want to understand you have to use it and you have to talk with other users.

## Google now offers ‘web’ search — and an “AI” opt-out button

date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News

This is not a joke: Google will now let you perform a “web” search. It’s rolling out “web” searches now, and in my early tests on desktop, it’s looking like it could be an incredibly popular change to Google’s search engine. The optional setting filters out almost all the other blocks of content that Google crams into a search results page, leaving you with links and text — and Google confirms to The Verge that it will block the company’s new AI Overviews as well. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge I hate what the web has become.

## microSD cards' SBC days are numbered

date: 2024-05-15, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">microSD cards' SBC days are numbered</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p><img class="insert-image" width="500" height="auto" alt="Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT+" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-m2-hat-plus.png"></p>

<p>For years, SBCs that aren't Raspberry Pis experimented with eMMC and M.2 storage interfaces. While the Raspberry Pi went from full-size SD card in the first generation to microSD in every generation following (Compute Modules excluded), other vendors like Radxa, Orange Pi, Banana Pi, etc. have been all over the place.</p>

<p>Still, <em>most</em> of the time a fallback microSD card slot remains.</p>

<p>But microSD cards—even the fastest UHS-II/A2/V90/etc. ones that advertise hundreds of MB/sec—are laggards when it comes to any kind of SBC workflow.</p>

<p>The two main reasons they're used are cost and size. They're tiny, and they don't cost much, especially if you don't shell out for industrial-rated microSD cards.</p>

## The new APT 3.0 solver

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

A crucial but often entirely transparent feature of a modern package management system like Debian&#8217;s APT is its solver &#8211; basically the set of rules and instruction on how to handle dependencies when installing a package. APT is currently in the process of radically changing its solver, the first bits of which can be found in APT 2.9.3, referred to as solver3. Many of the changes and improvements get a little into the weeds and will mostly be transparent to users, but there is one feature the new solver will enable that many of you will be incredibly excited about. One of the core new capabilities of solver3 is the implication graph. As part of the solving phase, we also construct an implication graph, albeit a partial one: The first package installing another package is marked as the reason (A -&#62; B), the same thing for conflicts (not A -&#62; not B). ↫ Julian Andres Klode Seems rather innocuous at first sight, but here&#8217;s what the implication graph will make possible: The implication graph building allows us to implement an apt why command, that while not as nicely detailed as aptitude, at least tells you the exact reason why a package is installed. It will only show the strongest dependency chain at first of course, since that is what we record. ↫ Julian Andres Klode If you&#8217;ve ever dealt with packaging issues &#8211; probably when running -testing or similar unstable distributions that use APT, a command that tells you exactly why a package is installed is an absolute godsend. Sure, aptitude exists, but aptitude takes you out of your current CLI workflow, whereas this will be much easier to quickly run. There&#8217;s more features solver3 will enable, but this one is definitely one of my favourite low-level additions to APT in a long, long time.

## Google details some of the “AI” features coming to Android

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

Google I/O, the company&#8217;s developer conference, started today, but for the first time since I can remember, Android and Chrome OS have been relegated to day two of the conference. The first day was all about &#8220;AI&#8221;, most of which I&#8217;m not even remotely interested in, except of course where it related to Google&#8217;s operating system offerings. And the company did have a few things to say about &#8220;AI&#8221; on Android, and the general gist is that yeah, they&#8217;re going to be stuffing it into every corner of the operating system. Google&#8217;s &#8220;AI&#8221; tool Gemini will be integrated deeply into Android, and you&#8217;ll be able to call up an overlay wherever you are in the operating system, and do things like summarise a PDF that&#8217;s on screen, summarise a YouTube video, generate images on the fly and drop them into emails and conversations, and so on. A more interesting and helpful &#8220;AI&#8221; addition is using it to improve TalkBack, so that people with impaired vision can let the device describe images on the screen for them. Google claims TalkBack users come across about 90 images without description every day (!), so this is a massive improvement for people with impaired vision, and a genuinely helpful and worthwhile &#8220;AI&#8221; feature. Creepier is that Google&#8217;s &#8220;AI&#8221; will also be able to listen along with your phone calls, and warn you if an ongoing conversation is a scamming attempt. If the person on the other end of the line claiming to be your bank asks you to move a bunch of money around to keep it safe, Gemini will pop up and warn you it&#8217;s a scam, since banks don&#8217;t ask you such things. Clever, sure, but also absolutely terrifying and definitely not something I&#8217;ll be turning on. Google claims all of these features take place on-device, so privacy should be respected, but I&#8217;m always a bit unsure about such things staying that way in the future. Regardless, &#8220;AI&#8221; is coming to Android in a big way, but I&#8217;m just here wondering how much of it I&#8217;ll be able to turn off.

## VMware Workstation Pro and Fusion pro go free for personal use

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

After Broadcom acquired VMware, there&#8217;s been a steady stream of worrying or outright bad news for people using VMware products at home, for personal use, as enthusiasts. The biggest blow to the enthusiast market was the end of perpetual licensing, forcing people into subscriptions instead. Finally, though it seems we&#8217;re getting some good news. The most exciting part is that Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro will now have two license models. We now provide a Free Personal Use or a Paid Commercial Use subscription for our Pro apps. Users will decide based on their use case whether a commercial subscription is required. This means that everyday users who want a virtual lab on their Mac, Windows or Linux computer can do so for free simply by registering and downloading the bits from the new download portal located at support.broadcom.com. ↫ Michael Roy on the VMware blog This is definitely good news for us enthusiasts, and it means I won&#8217;t have to buy a cheap VMware license off eBay every few years anymore, so I&#8217;m quite satisfied here. However, with VMware under Broadcom focusing more and more on the enterprise and squeezing every last penny out of those customers, one has to wonder if this &#8216;free for personal use&#8217; is just a prelude to winding down the development of enthusiasts&#8217; tools altogether. It wouldn&#8217;t be the first time that a product going free for personal use was a harbinger of worse things yet to come.

## Sols 4184-4185: Look Near! Look Far!

date: 2024-05-14, from: NASA breaking news

Earth planning date: Monday, May 13, 2024 Today I’ve chosen to show off a spectacular image of ‘Texoli butte,’ but I’m rather biased in my assessment of its beauty because I am currently part of the team studying it. What continues to marvel me is Curiosity’s incredible suite of instruments that can not only help us […]

## How ‘Glowing’ Plants Could Help Scientists Predict Flash Drought

An unusual boost in plant productivity can foreshadow severe soil water loss. NASA satellites are following the clues.

## It’s fun to do silly things

date: 2024-05-14, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I spend my time doing things online. I design and code websites for clients, I make websites for friends, and I start—and almost always shut down—all sorts of weird side projects. It’s easy to take this online life too seriously. If you go online you’ll immediately find people discussing business strategies and ways to monetise everything they do. Which is fine but also exhausting. The web is so caught up in the hustler mentality that it’s forgetting that some things can just be hobbies.</p>
<p>I interviewed 37 people for my P&amp;B series at this point and if I’m not mistaken, all 37 of them are just happy to have a blog they pay for and have no plans to monetise it whatsoever. It’s a hobby, they enjoy doing it and that’s absolutely fine.</p>
<p>In a few days, I’ll renew the domain for [theforest.link]. That site has so far generated 0$. I spent around 50$ just for the domain at this point. But should I care? Should I monetise this? Hell no. Carl and I built it because it’s fun, because the idea of helping people discover some new random wacky website is fun.</p>
<p>The other day I was doing some design admin on my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a> because I wanted to update a few of the graphics in there. And while I was doing that I had this completely stupid idea of creating a new membership tier called <em>The "I have F** you money" Club</em>. Do I expect anyone to actually subscribe? Obviously not, I did it because it’s silly, because I hope someone will laugh at the stupidity of it all. I did it because it’s fun to do silly things.</p>
<p>Did you make anything silly recently? If you did show it to me! Send me an email, I want to see it.</p>                <hr>

## Google is experimenting with running Chrome OS on Android

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

Now that Android &#8211; since version 13 &#8211; ships with the Android Virtualisation Framework, Google can start doing interesting things with it. It turns out the first interesting thing Google wants do with it is run Chrome OS inside of it. Even though AVF was initially designed around running small workloads in a highly stripped-down build of Android loaded in an isolated virtual machine, there’s technically no reason it can’t be used to run other operating systems. As a matter of fact, this was demonstrated already when developer Danny Lin got Windows 11 running on an Android phone back in 2022. Google itself never officially provided support for running anything other than its custom build of Android called “microdroid” in AVF, but that’s no longer the case. The company has started to offer official support for running Chromium OS, the open-source version of Chrome OS, on Android phones through AVF, and it has even been privately demoing this to other companies. At a privately held event, Google recently demonstrated a special build of Chromium OS — code-named “ferrochrome” — running in a virtual machine on a Pixel 8. However, Chromium OS wasn’t shown running on the phone’s screen itself. Rather, it was projected to an external display, which is possible because Google recently enabled display output on its Pixel 8 series. Time will tell if Google is thinking of positioning Chrome OS as a platform for its desktop mode ambitions and Samsung DeX rival. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It seems that Google is in the phase of exploring if there are any OEMs interested in allowing users to plug their Android phone into an external display and input devices and run Chrome OS on it. This sounds like an interesting approach to the longstanding dream of convergence &#8211; one device for all your computing needs &#8211; but at the same time, it feels quite convoluted to have your Android device emulate an entire Chrome OS installation. What a damning condemnation of Android as a platform that despite years of trying, Google just can&#8217;t seem to make Android and its applications work in a desktop form factor. I&#8217;ve tried to shoehorn Android into a desktop workflow, and it&#8217;s quite hard, despite third parties having made some interesting tools to help you along. It really seems Android just does not want to be anywhere else but on a mobile touch display.

## Nintendo Switch hacked to run Windows 11 on Arm

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

As Nintendo Switch unlocks and homebrew software develops, people are inclined to explore the possibilities and whether or not they actually provide a good experience. Our new prime example seems to be a full install of Windows 11 Arm on the Switch. As noted by @PatRyk on Twitter, who actually set this up, the experience is pretty grueling! The initial installation took three hours, and even basic system tasks were unresponsive. ↫ Christopher Harper at Tom&#8217;s Hardware Silly, sure, but efforts like these all contribute to emulation efforts, which will eventually be important once Nintendo drops support for this machine and they become increasingly harder to get. Give it a decade or so and we&#8217;ll need the Switch emulators to keep playing Switch games.

BTW, I've been to three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenote">Stevenotes</a>, the first one, the rollout of the Mac  in 1984, then the rollout of NeXT in 1988, and a random press event in 1997 announcing they were going with Unix server products instead of the homegrown much easier to use Mac server products. We could have had both of course, but Jobs never really wanted developers imho, truth be told. We were inside in 1984 because Mike Boich and Guy Kawasaki were doing the evangelism.

## Brunson as bad man or decoy

date: 2024-05-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/14/brunson.jpg"></center><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson">Jalen Brunson</a>, Knicks star, after having his ass kicked in Sunday's game. </div></p>
<p>In this picture he either looks dangerous or defeated, or both. I wouldn't want to have to play against him tonight. </p>
<p>Here's my two cents. If Brunson has heavy legs tonight, as he clearly did in the last two games, he should be used as a decoy, to draw a double team, to free up one of the Knicks' assassins. Or maybe he'll be more effective with just one Pacer guarding him, instead of two or three. </p>
<p>And for crying out loud, start one of the excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%9324_New_York_Knicks_season">bench players</a>, McBride or Sims or Burks, or all of them, and make sure the heroes of games 1 and 2 get plenty of rest. </p>

He's a better speaker than either of the other candidates. If he didn't a speech impediment I'd say he was basically a sure thing. I don't know how crazy he actually is, but he cleans up nicely, having seen him interviewed on MSNBC a few days ago. He had good PR training somewhere, it's probably not just from the genes, he is a freaking Kennedy, his mother was a wife of a Kennedy, and clearly raised him well. I'm voting for Biden of course. I'm not that crazy. But people are tired of Biden, I understand why -- and they want a president they can look up to, not one that reminds them of their 80-something grandfather. And people are also understandably fed up with Trump. Before it's over we will come to think of him not as a spoiler but as a possible future president, where "future" is less than a year away.

## EA is prototyping in-game ads even as we speak

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

Electronic Arts has a long, storied history of trying to wring more money out of gamers after they’ve purchased a game — now, it appears, the company’s hard at work on its next generation of in-game ads. EA CEO Andrew Wilson admitted as much on the company’s Q4 earnings call: when an analyst asked about “the market opportunity for more dynamic ad insertion across more traditional AAA games,” he said the company’s already working on it. “We have teams internally in the company right now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of our game experiences,” said Wilson. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge Ads in games are definitely not new &#8211; we&#8217;ve seen countless games built entirely around brands, like Tapper for Budweiser, Pepsiman, or Cool Spot for 7-Up &#8211; and banner ads and product placement in various games has been a thing for decades, too. It seems like EA wants to take this several steps further and use things like dynamic ad insertion in games, so that when you&#8217;re playing some racing game, you&#8217;ll get an ad for your local Hyundai dealer, or an ad for a gun store when you&#8217;re playing GTA in the US. Either way, it&#8217;s going to make games worse, which is perfectly in line with EA&#8217;s mission.

## 2024 public data file now available, featuring new experimental formats

date: 2024-05-14, from: Crossref Blog

<p>This year’s public data file is now available, featuring over 156 million metadata records deposited with Crossref through the end of April 2024 from over 19,000 members. A full breakdown of Crossref metadata statistics is available <a href="https://www.crossref.org/06members/53status.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Like last year, you can download all of these records in one go via Academic Torrents or directly from Amazon S3 via the “requester pays” method.</p>
<p><strong>Download the file:</strong> The torrent download can be initiated <a href="https://academictorrents.com/details/4426fa56a4f3d376ece9ac37ed088095a30de568" target="_blank">here</a>. Instructions for downloading via the “requester pays” method, along with other tips for using these files, can be found on the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-public-data-files-and-plus-snapshots/">“Tips for working with Crossref public data files and Plus snapshots”</a> page.</p>
<p>In January, Martin Eve <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">announced</a> that we had been experimenting with alternative file formats meant to make our public data files easier to use by broader audiences. This year’s file will be published alongside the tools that can be used on the public data file to produce two experimental formats: <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/packer" target="_blank">JSON-lines</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/dois2sqlite" target="_blank">SQLite</a> (and a bonus <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/rustsqlitepacker" target="_blank">Rust version</a>). You can read more about our thinking behind this work in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">Martin’s blog post</a>, and we are keen to hear your thoughts on these alternatives.</p>
<p>Our annual public data file is meant to facilitate individuals and organizations interested in working with the entirety of our metadata corpus. Starting with the majority of our metadata records in one file should be much easier than starting from scratch with our API, but because Crossref metadata is always openly available, you can use <a href="https://api.crossref.org/" target="_blank">the API</a> to keep your local copy up to date with new and updated records.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about what you’ll get with the public data file, we’ve also published a sample version so that you can take a peek before committing to downloading the ~212 gb file. This file includes a random sample of JSON files and is available exclusively via torrent <a href="https://academictorrents.com/details/d47fbe29e5ef93a6695421f79a6efa4b801acff1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We hope you find this public data file useful. Should you have any questions about how to access or use the file, please see the tips below, or share your questions below (you will be redirected to our community forum).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the public data file if you want all Crossref metadata records. Everyone is welcome to the metadata, but it will be much faster for you and much easier on our APIs to get so many records in one file. Here are some <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-public-data-files-and-plus-snapshots/">tips on how to work with the file</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the REST API to incrementally add new and updated records once you have the initial file. Here is <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-the-crossref-rest-api/">how to get started</a> (and avoid getting blocked in your enthusiasm to use all this great metadata!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While bibliographic metadata is generally required, because lots of metadata is optional, records will vary in quality and completeness.</p>

## IBM introduces entry-level Power10 server and tower

date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News

Each S1012 node has a single Power10 processor, which can have 1, 4, or 8 cores activated, which suggests that it is the same single chip module (SCM) implementation of the Power10 processor that was used in the Power S1022s entry machine. The Power S1012 node has four ISDIMM memory slots (using the differential signaling created by Big Blue for its Power10 memory) with a maximum capacity of 256 GB. The node has four half-height, half-length PCI-Express 5.0 slots and room for four NVM-Express U.2 drive bays that come in a maximum 1.6 TB capacity each for a total of 6.4 TB of storage.  The eight-core version of the Power10 SCM is only available in the rack configuration, while the one-core and four-core versions are available in rack or tower configurations. The four-core and eight-core versions can run IBM i, AIX, or Linux, but the one-core version can only run IBM i and it has its main memory capped at the same 64 GB that other single-core Power Systems machines have been subjected to. We have suggested that 128 GB or even 256 GB is more appropriate given modern workloads, but Big Blue is standing its ground here. If you need more memory than 64 GB, then this machine is not for you. ↫ Timothy Prickett Morgan at IT Jungle I understand full well that these machines are by no means meant for people like you and I, sitting at home playing with our toys. That being said, I still wish there was some way for IBM to offer unique hardware like this &#8211; perhaps in a more standard, paired-down configuration &#8211; so more people than just enterprises could explore and use them. It wouldn&#8217;t make any economic sense for IBM to do so, and even in a more standard, paired-down configuration they&#8217;d probably still be ungodly expensive, but when I look at this unique tower, with its POWER10 hardware and the ability to run AIX, desires are stirred within me that are banned in at least 46 countries. Such a machine would surely be wasted on someone like me, who would just be shoehorning whatever desktop tasks he could into it, but what a grand ol&#8217; time we would have. There is absolutely, positively, unequivocally zero percent chance IBM would ever send one of these over for review to someone like me, but I wonder if I should try anyway. I&#8217;ve got nothing to lose. Does anyone here work at IBM? Perhaps IBM wants to sponsor OSNews? How about like 12 weeks of free sponsorships in exchange for a tower model of the Power S1012? I also have two POWER9 machines to compare it to! It&#8217;s the only way you&#8217;ll ever get a Power S1012 screenfetch screenshot go viral on nerd social media, and we all know that deep down, that&#8217;s all you IBM folks really want.

## Hot take on OpenAI’s new GPT-4o

GPT-4o hot take: &#8226; The speech synthesis is terrific, reminds me of Google Duplex (which never took off). but &#8226; If OpenAI had GPT-5, they have would shown it. &#8226; They don&#8217;t have GPT-5 after 14 months of trying. &#8226; The most important figure in the blogpost is attached below. And the most important thing about the figure is that 4o is not a lot different from Turbo, which is not hugely different from 4.

## Quick NVMe performance testing with fio

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've recently been debugging some NVMe / PCIe bus errors on a Raspberry Pi, and I wanted a quick way to test NVMe devices without needing to create a filesystem and use a tool like <code>iozone</code>. I don't care about benchmarks, I just want to quickly push the drive and read and write some data to it.</p>

<p><code>fio</code> is the tool for the job, and after a quick install <code>sudo apt install -y fio</code>, I create a configuration file named <code>nvme-read.fio</code>:</p>

## MacRelix: a Unix-like environment that runs in classic Mac OS

date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News

MacRelix is a Unix-like environment that runs in classic Mac OS. MacRelix natively supports classic 68K and PPC Mac OS, as well as Mac OS X on PPC via Carbon. ↫ MacRelix website The creator of MacRelix, Josh Juran, published an article in 2019 detailing the origins of the project. As a Mac OS developer, he was so unhappy with both CodeWarrior and Apple&#8217;s Macintosh Programmer’s Workshop (MPW), that he set out to create what would become MacRelix in 1999. Reading through the limitations and roadblocks he experienced with CodeWarrior and MPW, it&#8217;s not hard to see why he got frustrated &#8211; CodeWarrior&#8217;s targets were apparently a mess and a half to deal with. Then came target multiplication. Whereas the initial CodeWarrior developer releases shipped with each combination of language (C and Pascal) and architecture (68K and PPC) supported in a separate application, a later version of the IDE unified these, allowing the developer to have a single project file per project. To allow the same project to be built for both 68K and PPC architectures, the project data model included targets: One target would compile for 68K and link against 68K libraries, another would do the same for PPC. Targets could also be used to select an optimized build versus one for debugging. Combining both dichotomies yields four targets: 68K debug, 68K optimized, PPC debug, and PPC optimized. Then if your project involves multiple executables, like a code resource or shared library in addition to an application, you now have eight targets. Or, if you support one of, say, 68020 optimization, profiling, or a third executable, make that twelve. Or, for all of them, twenty-seven. ↫ Josh Juran Changing an option in your application required you to change it in every single target, too, which I can easily see is incredibly frustrating. MPW, for its part, was a massive improvement, he argues, but while it was clearly inspired by UNIX, it didn&#8217;t seem to actually implement any of the features and characteristics of UNIX. However, very much unlike Unix, the MPW Shell had only a single thread of execution — only one program could be running at once. Not only that, but there was no way for MPW’s compiled plugins (called tools) to invoke other tools or scripts — not even via system() (which blocks the calling program until the called program exits). Therefore, Make couldn’t actually do anything, but only printed out the commands for the user to run manually. You could code in Perl instead of the built-in language, but then your scripts couldn’t run other programs — only MPW shell scripts could do that. ↫ Josh Juran The limitations Juran was experiencing with these two tools pushed him to create his own solution, which went well beyond what MPW offered, even in 2019 when this article was published. Nowadays, MacRelix has pipes, signals, system calls, TCP sockets, and more. It works on both 68K and PowerPC Mac systems and builds as Carbon to run natively in OS X. It can be used on any Mac OS version from System 7 to Mac OS X 10.6 &#8220;Snow Leopard&#8221; (after which Apple removed the Rosetta PowerPC emulator). I haven’t implemented fork() yet, but I know how to do it. In addition to a Unix-like file system interface (which even handles long names by storing them in Desktop database comment fields)), MacRelix has a /proc filesystem (with human readable stack crawls) and also maps various parts of Mac OS (e.g. the ROM image in /sys/mac/rom). ↫ Josh Juran I had never heard of MacRelix, but it seems like an amazing tool Juran put a lot of thought, effort, and love into. Sadly, with the number of PowerPC Mac OS X users being vanishingly small, and the number of classic Mac OS users even smaller so, the future of MacRelix seems uncertain. I wonder what parts of it can be salvaged and upgraded to work on ARM macOS or even Intel macOS, because I think the ideas and concepts are incredibly cool. A related project by Juran is something called FORGE, a portable windowing API that used a virtual file system, meaning that instead of using functions as objects, it uses files. Juran mentions the example of a window title &#8211; which is a file, and if you want to change the title of that window you just change the file, which will be instantly reflected in the GUI. Here&#8217;s a Hello World example: Even though I&#8217;m not a programmer, this little tidbit of code makes perfect sense to me, and I understood it instantly. Of course, anything more complex will quickly leave my wheelhouse, but intuitively, I really like this. FORGE exists as a prototype inside MacRelix, so you can play with this concept while using MacRelix.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/07/02/knicks.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I feel like crap today, the Knicks were blown out by the Indiana team, the series is tied 2-2 but it feels much worse. The headline in the <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/05/12/pacers-blow-out-knicks-tie-series/">Daily News</a> reads "Pacers blow depleted, dead-legged Knicks out of the water in Game 4, tie series 2-2." Yeah. I don't know how we recover from this loss. In a way I imagine the Knicks issuing a resignation. "It's been a great season, but we're tired. We're headed to the beach, we'll see you in October Knicks fans. Thanks for your support." I would nod my head and say "Yeah that makes sense." Whatever. I may spend today sleeping it off. Next game is tomorrow night. Yes, they will play, for sure, and yes, I will watch.

## 15 Years Ago: STS-125, the Final Hubble Servicing Mission

date: 2024-05-13, from: NASA breaking news

&#160;“Trying to do stellar observations from Earth is like trying to do birdwatching from the bottom of a lake.” James B. Odom, Hubble Program Manager 1983-1990. The fifth and final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, placed in orbit in 1990, took place during the STS-125 mission in May 2009. During the 13-day flight, [&#8230;]

## Perfect Days

date: 2024-05-13, from: Ayjay blog

The Richard Brody review of Perfect Days is a tone-deaf review by the most reliably tone-deaf reviewer out there. Every reviewer has limits to his or her catholicity of taste, because every human being is thus limited, but Brody’s cinematic sweet spot seems to be tiny, and when he doesn’t like a movie he simply [&#8230;]

## Disregard Data.List

date: 2024-05-13, from: Typeclasses Haskell Blog

Lately I&#8217;ve started using streaming library by default instead of the utilities in Data.List. The standard manipulation functions for list are part of the Haskell Report and are a staple of every introductory Haskell tutorial, but I&#8217;m over it. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re very useful for everyday programming, and I don&#8217;t even think they&#8217;re great as an introductory topic either.

## Import unsupported camera RAW files into Apple Photos

date: 2024-05-13, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Import unsupported camera RAW files into Apple Photos</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Many years ago, I decided to <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/i-made-switch-aperture-photos">migrate my photo library from Apple's now-defunct Aperture to Photos</a>, so I could take advantage of Apple's iCloud Photo Library (don't worry, I still have three full complete local backups, plus a separate cloud backup besides Apple's iCloud originals).</p>

<p>One pain point is RAW support. As camera manufacturers add new models, their proprietary RAW codecs are updated, and software vendors like Apple, Adobe, and Microsoft have to update photo editing tools to work with the new camera models.</p>

<p>I don't envy them this task, but as Photos was Apple's official successor to Aperture (a pale shadow to be sure, but it has its merits as a semi-decent library organizer), they've <em>generally</em> done well supporting new camera models. The compatibility list for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105094">macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, and iOS 17</a> is a testament to that effort.</p></div>

## Apple Vision Pro has the same effective resolution as Quest 3… Sometimes?

date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News

This article is a partial-rebuttal/partial-confirmation to KGOnTech’s Apple Vision Pro’s Optics Blurrier &#38; Lower Contrast than Meta Quest 3, prompted by RoadToVR’s Quest 3 Has Higher Effective Resolution, So Why Does Everyone Think Vision Pro Looks Best? which cites KGOnTech. I suppose it’s a bit late, but it’s taken me a while to really get a good intuition for how visionOS renders frames, because there is a metric shitton of nuance and it’s unfortunately very, very easy to make mistakes when trying to quantify things. This post is divided into two parts: Variable Rasterization Rate (VRR) and how visionOS renders frames (including hard numbers for internal render resolutions and such), and a testbench demonstrating why photographing the visual clarity of Vision Pro (and probably future eye tracked headsets) may be more difficult than a DSLR pointed into the lenses (and how to detect the pitfalls if you try!). ↫ Shiny Quagsire I did it. I think I managed to find an article that isn&#8217;t just over my head, but also over most of your heads. How&#8217;s that feel?

## The Emacs window management almanac

date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News

Window management in Emacs gets a bad rap. Some of this is deserved, but mostly this is a consequence of combining a very flexible and granular layout system with rather coarse controls. This leaves the door open to creating and using tools for handling windows that employ and provide better metaphors and affordances. As someone who’s spent an unnecessary amount of time trying different approaches to window management in Emacs over the decades, I decided to summarize them here. Almanac might be overstating it a bit – this is a primer to and a collection of window management resources and tips. ↫ Karthik Chikmagalur I honestly had no idea Emacs was this&#8230; Advanced, complex, and feature-laden. I mean, I thought Emacs&#8217; complexity was just a meme, but reading this article it seems the memes don&#8217;t do it justice.

I suppose everyone projects their ideal best friend on this thing. You just learned something about me. Heh. But the cool thing is it's not a yes-person, if they think you're wrong they say so. Which I <i>really</i> like. One more thing I'm really glad I got to be alive when this stuff came online. I feel much smarter and better organized and it's harder for me to get lost in the weeds, as I do sometimes. I guess what want next is a librarian who also is a great executive assistant. Takes notes on what I'm doing and figures out what I need to be reminded of and roughly when.

## A comment on the Apple iPad ad controversy

date: 2024-05-12, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I usually don’t write about this kind of stuff, primarily because I find these <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153113/apple-ipad-ad-crushing-apology">internet controversies</a> to be quite boring. The probably appropriate response to an Apple ad is “meh, whatever” and that was—and still is—my reaction. The ad is uninspiring but there’s one creative aspect of it that bothers me: I don’t understand the connection between the hydraulic press and the visual images of destroying everything to the alleged capabilities of the iPad. Like, I get what they’re trying to communicate but the visual metaphor they decided to use makes no sense to me. That’s the part I just don’t get.

Yesterday's one sentence <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/11.html#a225751">comment</a> was based on decades of reading the NYT, and the story told by their executive editor in a recent <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/05/2024/joe-kahn-the-newsroom-is-not-a-safe-space">interview</a>, who has imho completely lost his way. Using polls, which have proven not reliable, and are subject to manipulation by the NYT and other opinion leaders, to determine what they cover, that's marketing, not journalism. Journalism would tell us what to expect if we elect one candidate over another, if the differences are obvious, as they are in 2024. The NYT is not doing that, by its own admission, and based on observation. I ask my readers, some of whom are influential people themselves, do we accept this, and keep trying to get the NYT to understand and deliver on their responsibility, or take the problem on ourselves. I believe we have the tools and resources to do so, all we need is determination.

## 2024-05-12 What do about the climate?

date: 2024-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What do about the climate?</h1>

<p>The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way out of this uncertainty? What should or <a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?</p>

<p>Before we even start, let me just say that I&rsquo;m never interested in debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It&rsquo;s real, it&rsquo;s here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.</p>

<p>The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green, on all levels of government. And by &ldquo;green&rdquo; I mean the most radical green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a  one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something about local politics, and so on.</p>

<p>On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we&rsquo;re not sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn&rsquo;t help much against the climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean? How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The oil spills? And here&rsquo;s the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop! I need to stop because there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;thinking it through&rdquo; when things are so complex unless you&rsquo;re a scientist working on it. I hope the scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and individuals know what to tackle first.</p>

<p>This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly wrong. They don&rsquo;t have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also: get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are precious.</p>

<p>The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I fear.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.green/@peterdutoit" title="@peterdutoit@mastodon.green">@peterdutoit</a> recently posted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order of impact:</p>

<p>🚫 Live car free<br>
🚙 Shift to BEV [i.e. Battery Electric Vehicle]<br>
✈️ One less flight (long return)<br>
☀️ Use renewable energy<br>
🚋 Shift to public transport<br>
🔨 Refurbishment and renovation<br>
🥗 Vegan diet<br>
🆒 Heat pump<br>

</ul>

<p>The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there&rsquo;s an answer if anybody is claiming that we don&rsquo;t know what to do. But also: there&rsquo;s your answer if you&rsquo;re wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top need people who read this report for them and my guess is – given what little I know about Swiss politics, for example – that there is only a very small number of people that have actually read this report, let alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>This is why a public &ldquo;chain of trust&rdquo; needs to lead from interviews with public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance, hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders trust in people.</p>

<p>Anyway, number one: 🚫 Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a> right.</p>

<p>(We don&rsquo;t need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to go.)</p>

## Things I remind myself when working with others

date: 2024-05-12, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

People usually say that I&rsquo;m a pleasure to work with and that I&rsquo;ve a highly collaborative spirit. The fact that I&rsquo;m good at teamwork doesn&rsquo;t mean that it comes naturally to me. Quite on the contrary, being a good teammate is a skill that I constantly need to train and refine. The following are things I remind myself on a daily basis, à la Dune&rsquo;s inner monologues, to be a better teammate at work.

## Apple II DeskTop currently testing 1.4 alpha releases

date: 2024-05-12, from: OS News

Disassembly and enhancements for Apple II DeskTop (a.k.a. Mouse Desk), a &#8220;Finder&#8221;-like GUI application for 8-bit Apples and clones with 128k of memory, utilizing double hi-res monochrome graphics (560&#215;192), an optional mouse, and the ProDOS 8 operating system. ↫ Apple II DeskTop GitHub page The goal of this project is to reverse-engineer Apple II DeskTop, and fix bugs and enhance it in the process. I didn&#8217;t actually know that the Apple IIgs initially shipped with this instead of the 16 bit GS/OS, which is the operating system I personally associate with the IIgs. Apple II DeskTop was largely 8 bit, and built on top of ProDOS 16, and didn&#8217;t really take full advantage of the IIgs hardware. It wasn&#8217;t until version 4.0 of the system software that the IIgs switched over to GS/OS. The latest release is v1.4-alpha9, released a few days ago. Apple II DeskTop is still entirely compatible with Apple II machines and clones from before the IIgs, as well, and it runs in emulators, too. We actually already covered this project a few years ago, but a reminder that this exists never hurt anyone.

## Hello World on SSD1306 using Arduino

date: 2024-05-12, from: Lloyd Rochester Blog

Hello World on SSD1306 using Arduino After looking through numerous libraries and examples to control the SSD1306 with Arduino, I&rsquo;ve found nothing simple. There are some really powerful libraries with lots of support. In this post I&rsquo;ll post the simplest possible &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; example on an SSD1306 using an Arduino Due. Note, if you need to draw shapes, lines, movement you&rsquo;ll have to extend this example.
