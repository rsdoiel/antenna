Ashton, Edward <strong>Mal Goes to War </strong>(St. Martin’s 4/24)
Ashton made a splash years ago with SF novel <strong>Mickey7</strong>,
and this new volume blends thrills with satire. Mal, a free AI who lives
bodi­lessly in the Infosphere, finds the war between augmented Federals
and puritanical Human­ists tedious and pointless… until a salvage job
goes wrong and he finds himself trapped in the corpse of a cyborg
soldier,

Sometimes, I really enjoy speculative fiction that works more by image
and dream logic than plot and worldbuilding. Not to say Ben Berman
Ghan’s <strong>The Years Shall Run Like Rabbits </strong>lacks those
traditional elements: The ingredients here are quite recognizable –
deadly cyborgs and lunar colonies, time travel and genetic engineering.

Outside of the vast English-speaking fandom lies a tapestry of diverse
and weakly interlinked communities from the countries with small
language bases. These languages, and the nations that speak them are
often – because of inertia, rather than ill intent – perceived as
“minor.” Indeed, they are minor in one critical aspect: as literary
markets. This circumstance has a profound effect on their literature.
