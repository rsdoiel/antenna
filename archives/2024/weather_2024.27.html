Tropical Depression Aletta Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP012024
800 AM MST Fri Jul 05 2024
 
Multiple microwave images between 08 and 12 UTC indicated that
Aletta still has a well-defined center, and it has continued to
produce a small area of deep convection near that center. Objective
and subjective intensity estimates range from around 25 to 35 kt, so
the estimated maximum winds are still 30 kt for this advisory.
Aletta is moving westward (270/10kt) and a west-southwestward turn
is expected later this morning.
 
The small depression is located in a marginal environment, and a
combination of decreasing SSTs below 26 deg C, drier surrounding
air, and increasing shear should cause Aletta to lose its deep
convection later today. In fact, all dynamical guidance suggests
that Aletta will become a remnant low within the next 6 to 18 h. The
NHC forecast conservatively maintains Aletta as a tropical cyclone
on the longer side of that range, but still shows gradual weakening
through the forecast period. After it becomes a remnant low, Aletta
is expected to turn back toward the west and dissipate within 
another day or so.

Mesoscale Discussion 1538
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CDT Fri Jul 05 2024

Areas affected...eastern Kentucky...southern Ohio...western West
Virginia...northeastern Tennessee and far western Virginia.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 051256Z - 051530Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The atmosphere is destabilizing this morning across the
Tennessee/Ohio Valley which may support an increased severe weather
threat.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms has continued through much of the
overnight period with 30 to 40 knot convective wind gusts and
sporadic wind damage. The airmass ahead of these storms is very
moist with dewpoints in the mid 70s and a mean mixing ratio of 17.8
g/kg on the 12Z BNA RAOB. In addition, the wind profile is more
favorable than anticipated with 40 knots of effective shear.
Inhibition will be eroded by mid to late morning as temperatures
warm into the mid to upper 80s ahead of this line of storms.
Modifying the 12Z BNA RAOB for mid 80F temperatures suggests
2500-3000 J/kg MLCAPE with a mostly uncapped surface parcel.
Therefore, expect the storms in this line to intensify by mid to
late morning with an increasing damaging wind threat. 

The 12Z ILN RAOB showed significant drying from 00Z, indicating the
prohibitive environment north of the front which is currently across
southern Ohio. Therefore, expect the severe weather threat to be
confined to areas south of this boundary.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Fri Jul 05 2024

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY INTO THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will be possible midday into the
afternoon across parts of the upper Ohio Valley into the central and
southern Appalachians.  Damaging gusts 50-65 mph will be the primary
severe hazard.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a mid-level shortwave trough
and associated low moving east across the mid to upper MS Valley and
into the western Great Lakes.  A belt of strong southwesterly 500-mb
flow (50-60 kt) will move through the base of the trough from the
lower MO Valley east-northeastward through IN/OH and into the Lower
Great Lakes through early evening.  Upstream of this disturbance, a
lower amplitude shortwave trough will move southeastward from AB
into MT during the day.  

...Eastern Great Lakes/Ohio Valley/Southern and Central
Appalachians...
A convectively augmented lead disturbance over the lower OH Valley
will continue to progress eastward today ahead of a larger-scale
trough forecast to pivot east across the OH Valley.  An ongoing
squall line from southern IN to the AL/TN border, will move east
into a very moist and destabilizing airmass.  Surface analysis shows
a reservoir of lower to mid 70s deg F dewpoints from north-central
AL north-northeastward through the central Appalachians and OH River
vicinity.  A belt of stronger mid-level southwesterly flow will
likely remain north of the OH River, but some enhancement to 2-6 km
flow (reference Memphis, Paducah, Fort Campbell, and Evansville
WSR-88D VADs) will likely spread downstream across TN/KY and into
southern OH and WV.  Visible-satellite imagery denotes strong
heating will occur ahead of the MCS, thereby contributing to upwards
of 1500-3000 J/kg MLCAPE by early afternoon (2400 J/kg MLCAPE per
Nashville 12 UTC raob).  Organized multicells (via the MCS) will be
capable of scattered 50-65 mph gusts and wind damage.  Farther south
into the southern Appalachians and Carolinas/VA Piedmont, weaker
flow but very moist/unstable conditions later today will support
scattered thunderstorms and an isolated risk for damaging gusts with
the stronger wet microbursts.  

Farther north, more uncertainty and potentially lower strong/severe
storm coverage will extend from Lower MI across the southern/Lower
Great Lakes into PA and west-central New York.  A hail threat
may also develop in parts of Lower Michigan, ahead of the
upper-level trough, where mid-level temperatures will be cooler
which will aid in steeper mid-level lapse rates.  Localized damaging
gusts will be the main severe risk.

...Eastern New Mexico...
Southwestern periphery of stronger mid-level northwesterly flow will
glance the southern High Plains in between a mid-level anticyclone
centered near the northern CA coast and the larger-scale trough over
the Midwest.  Strong heating and moist upslope flow (dewpoints near
60 F) will contribute to initially isolated storms preferentially
developing over the higher terrain by early to mid afternoon.  Model
guidance shows MLCAPE peaking in the 1500 to 2000 J/kg range, with
0-6 km shear around 30 kt.  Some organization of storms is possible,
mainly via multicells and perhaps transient supercell structures. 
Isolated severe gusts/hail may accompany the stronger thunderstorms.

...MT...
Aforementioned mid-level impulse will move into central/eastern MT
this afternoon/evening.  Strong heating amidst 40s dewpoints will
yield weak buoyancy (500-1000 J/kg MLCAPE) but steep lapse rates.  A
few stronger storms may be capable of locally severe gusts for a few
hours late this afternoon before this activity subsides later this
evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Tue Jul 02 2024

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will prevail over much of the CONUS as a mid-level
trough overspreads the northern Rockies tomorrow (Wednesday). During
the afternoon, dry downslope flow will encourage dry and breezy
conditions across much of the Great Basin into the central Rockies.
Latest guidance consensus suggests that 15+ mph sustained westerly
winds (locally higher in terrain-favoring areas) will coincide with
10-15 percent RH for several hours. With fuels beginning to become
at least modestly receptive to wildfire spread on a widespread
basis, Elevated highlights have been introduced.

Mesoscale Discussion 1509
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0643 PM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Areas affected...portions of eastern Nebraska into western Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 012343Z - 020115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The severe threat will gradually increase as the warm
front approaches and the low-level airmass destabilizes through the
evening. Severe wind and hail are the predominant threats, though a
tornado or two could also occur. A WW issuance will eventually be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Several thunderstorms are progressing eastward across
NE, including a supercell that is traversing the warm frontal zone
with a history of brief tornadoes. The surface warm front is
expected to continue drifting northward with time as low-level
warm-air advection increases in tandem with the strengthening of the
low-level jet. Initially elevated buoyancy will advect over eastern
NE into western IA with large, curved hodographs. The stronger,
longer-lived updrafts that form should become multicellular and
perhaps supercellular, capable of severe wind and hail. The tornado
potential will be largely dependent on the degree of
surface-based/boundary-layer destabilization can materialize this
evening. A WW issuance will eventually be needed as storms across
central NE impinge on the eastern bounds of Tornado Watch 496.

  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Initial supercell thunderstorms should pose a threat for
large hail generally 1-2 inches in diameter this afternoon. As this
activity spreads eastward later this afternoon and evening, it
should grow upscale in more of a line/cluster, with a greater threat
for severe/damaging winds up to around 60-70 mph.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 105
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles north northwest
of Mobridge SD to 70 miles southeast of Chadron NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0429 AM CDT Mon Jul 01 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the Interior West today,
encouraging surface low development near the Four Corners region.
The result will be dry and breezy conditions characterized by 15+
mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds overlapping with
10-15 percent RH during the afternoon across much of the Great
Basin. Given drying fuels over much of the Basin, Elevated
highlights have been maintained. An outside chance for a dry
thunderstorm is also possible over portions of the Snake River Plain
in southern Idaho. However, modest fuel receptiveness, and low
confidence in storm coverage, preclude isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights.

Mesoscale Discussion 1492
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Areas affected...northern NJ into western Long Island/NYC Metro
vicinity

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489...

Valid 301826Z - 302000Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489
continues.

SUMMARY...An intense bowing segment will move across northern New
Jersey into western Long Island and the New York City metro vicinity
over the next 1-2 hours. Damaging wind gusts are expected with these
storms.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of storms has rapidly intensified and
developed into a bowing segment near the northern NJ/PA state line
this afternoon. This activity will spread east/southeast over the
next 1-2 hours into the axis of strong instability oriented over the
northern Mid-Atlantic region. These storms have already produced
gusts to near 50 kt and areas of wind damage. This activity is
likely to continue producing severe/damaging wind gusts as storms
spread across northern NJ and the New York City metro vicinity.

Mesoscale Discussion 1491
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0116 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Areas affected...eastern Kentucky...eastern Tennessee...southern
West Virginia...far western Virginia...and western North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 301816Z - 302015Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Marginal threat for strong to severe gusts will remain
possible with thunderstorm activity through the afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity continues to increase in coverage
across portions of eastern Kentucky into western Virginia this
afternoon. The air mass in this region has warmed and become more
unstable through the morning, with around 2000-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE
in recent surface objective analysis. This is also apparent in radar
and satellite trends for in echo tops and cloud top cooling with
ongoing thunderstorm activity. Upper-level flow remains modest
across the region, waning further with south and eastward extent
into far eastern Tennessee/Carolinas. As such, deep layer shear for
organization remains weak, though around 30-35 kts of effective
shear is analyzed across eastern Kentucky. As such, instances of
severe wind should remain fairly isolated and localized. A watch is
unlikely to be needed but trends will continue to be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1490
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1259 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Areas affected...southern NY into southern New England

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489...

Valid 301759Z - 301930Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 489
continues.

SUMMARY...A line of intense storms will shift east across southern
New England and Southern New York/portions of Long Island the next
couple of hours. Swaths of wind damage will accompany this activity.

DISCUSSION...A well organized bowing segment over CT will continue
to shift east at around 35-40 kt the next couple of hours. This
activity has a long history of producing wind damage, and this trend
is expected to continue as the bow moves across CT into RI and
southern MA through 4pm EDT.

An area of convection to the southwest of the bow continues to
become better organized from southern NY into western CT. This
activity should also continue generally eastward over the next
couple of hours and may impact portions of Long Island. Damaging
gusts may also accompany this activity.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 PM CDT Sun Jun 30 2024

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible on Monday across the
northern/central Plains centered over Nebraska and South Dakota.
Areas of damaging winds and sporadic hail will be possible.

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough will move into the northern and central Plains
on Monday, with a gradual weakening of the upper high over the
southern Plains. The strongest cooling aloft will occur over the
northern Plains, but gradual height falls will also develop over the
central Plains.

At the surface, a large area of high pressure will exist over the
Great Lakes, with a strengthening pressure gradient over the Plains
as low pressure develops over western NE/KS. A cold front will push
into the western Dakotas during the afternoon, with a warm front
lifting north across the mid MO Valley where a narrow plume of
higher dewpoints will exist.

...Central and northern Plains...
Early day elevated thunderstorms are likely over eastern KS and NE
within the warm advection regime, and this should generally weaken
as it lifts northeastward. Behind this activity, a plume of 70s F
dewpoints will spread northwestward into parts of central NE, while
strong heating and mixing develop across CO/western KS/western NE.
Lift will be maximized near the surface low, with clusters of storms
likely by late afternoon. Cellular activity may contain hail
initially before growing upscale into an MCS with damaging winds
increasingly possible as storms move toward the MO Valley. A cell or
two could produce a tornado near the warm front/hot plume interface
prior to storms growing upscale, as low-level shear along the warm
front will be favorable.

To the north and west, ascent with the upper trough will be
strongest from western NE into SD, with late afternoon storms
forming near the eastern WY border. Lengthy hodographs and steeper
midlevel lapse rates will favor hail, with damaging wind as well
developing eastward. Significant theta-e advection around 850 mb
will support both lift and destabilization with the late storms into
southwest MN and western IA.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND AND THE EASTERN MID-ATLANTIC...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered to numerous damaging wind gusts are likely across parts of
the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States this afternoon and evening.
Large hail and severe/damaging winds should also occur from southern
Montana into western North Dakota.

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas...
A mid-level trough over the Great Lakes and eastern Canada will
continue moving eastward through the period. An associated cold
front will likewise advance east-southeastward across New England
and much of the Mid-Atlantic through this evening. Based on area 12Z
soundings and recent surface observations, a very moist airmass is
in place ahead of the front, with surface dewpoints generally in the
low to mid 70s. Filtered daytime heating with broken cloud cover
will support weak to moderate instability through late this
afternoon, with most guidance continuing to suggest a narrow
corridor of 1000-2000 J/kg MLCAPE will be in place along/near the
I-95 corridor from southern New England to the eastern Mid-Atlantic.
Mid-level flow will increase through the day in tandem with the
upper trough, which will foster strong deep-layer shear and
organized convection.

Expectations are for thunderstorms to continue increasing in
coverage and intensity this afternoon, both along/ahead of the cold
front and a pre-frontal surface trough. Multiple rounds of intense
convection appear possible. Given a rather favorable thermodynamic
and kinematic parameter space, swaths of severe/damaging winds
generally 60-70 mph will likely occur as a mix of bowing line
segments/clusters and a few supercells sweep eastward through the
afternoon/evening. No changes have been made to the Enhanced Risk
across parts of southern New England into the Mid-Atlantic, where
the greatest concentration of damaging winds is still anticipated.
Isolated hail and perhaps a tornado may also occur with any
sustained supercell, although poor mid-level lapse rates and
modest/veered low-level flow should hinder both of these threats,
respectively. Deep-layer shear will be weaker with southward extent
across the Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas. Convective mode should
also tend to be mainly multicellular across these regions. Even so,
steepened low-level lapse rates and ample instability should support
a threat for scattered damaging winds as thunderstorms develop and
spread eastward to the Atlantic Coast this afternoon/evening.

...Northern/Central High Plains...
A mid-level shortwave trough evident over the Northwest this morning
will progress eastward across the northern Rockies and adjacent High
Plains through tonight. A surface lee cyclone is forecast to deepen
and consolidate over northern WY/southeast MT by this evening, as
large-scale ascent preceding the upper trough overspreads the
northern High Plains. Even though low-level moisture is expected to
remain rather limited across this area, steep lapse rates and
daytime heating will contribute to at least weak instability
developing by late afternoon. Moderate to strong deep-layer shear
will support updraft organization. Cellular convection that
initially develops over the higher terrain of southwest MT and
vicinity should quickly grow upscale into a small bowing cluster as
it moves east-northeastward across central/eastern MT this evening.
Large hail may occur initially, but a transition to mainly a
severe/damaging wind threat appears likely as this mode transition
occurs. Isolated significant severe wind gusts (75-80 mph) appear
possible given the very steep/favorable low/mid-level lapse rates
expected. This wind threat may continue into parts of western ND and
vicinity tonight before convection eventually weakens.

Farther south, isolated to scattered thunderstorms should develop
along/east of the higher terrain from WY into CO. Various NAM/RAP
forecast soundings across this area show favorable shear for
organized convection, including the potential for a mix of
multicells and perhaps a couple of supercells. The southern fringe
of the stronger mid-level flow and the northwest edge of the
monsoonal moisture may overlap enough in western CO to support an
isolated threat for severe wind gusts.

...Arizona...
Low/mid-level moisture should gradually increase through the period
on the western periphery of a mid/upper-level high centered over the
southern Plains. Diurnal heating in the wake of overnight convection
should occur across the higher terrain of eastern/southeast AZ
through this afternoon, which will aid in the development of weak to
moderate instability. Expectations are for thunderstorms to
initially form over the higher terrain, and then slowly westward
late this afternoon and evening in response to around 15-20 kt of
east-southeasterly mid-level flow. A very well mixed boundary layer,
with steep lapse rates through much of the troposphere, should
support a threat for isolated strong to severe wind gusts with this
high-based convection.
