<h2 id="blade-runner">Blade Runner</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-03, from: Digital Antiquarian</p>
<p>Blade Runner has set me thinking about the notion of a “critical
consensus.” Why should we have such a thing at all, and why should it
change over time? Ridley Scott’s 1982 film Blade Runner is an adaptation
of Philip K. Dick’s 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,
about a police officer cum […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: Computer ads from the Past</p>
<p>The Company Rockwell International has been around for quite a while.
Willard Rockwell started the company in 1919 to sell a newly designed
truck axle bearing. Over the years, Rockwell acquired businesses in many
different fields, including defense, industrial electronics, automotive
components, and more. They built both the Apollo spacecraft and the
Space Shuttle program. In 1967, they merged with North American
Aviation. Before the merger, North American Aviation had developed a</p>

<p>Okay, it’s a talk, and it’ll also feature Hexen and Heretic Coming
just days after this year’s Wakefield Show, the next Wakefield RISC OS
Computer Club (WROCC) meeting will take place on Wednesday, 1st May, and

versions of the games, allowing…</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-29, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>If you sometimes find your RISC OS desktop a bit cluttered (which
speaking personally would make it much like my real desktop) one
solution is to close a few windows (or in the case of my actual desk,
put some stuff away). Another solution is to run a piece of software
that expands the size of the desktop beyond the visible area shown on
screen, and move some of your windows into other spaces, ready for
access when necessary. One such piece of software is VirtuDesk, by David
Llewellyn-Jones, aka…</p>
