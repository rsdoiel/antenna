Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0706 AM CDT Tue Sep 17 2024

Valid 171300Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of severe wind gusts and isolated large hail
will be possible this afternoon and evening across parts of the
central and northern High Plains.

...High Plains/Central and Southern Rockies...
Water-vapor imagery early this morning shows a potent mid-level low
and associated trough centered over northeast NV.  This feature will
become negatively tilted and move into the High Plains late today
while the low moves east-northeast reaching southeast MT Wednesday
morning.  Strong attendant forcing for ascent will overspread the
High Plains this afternoon into the early evening with an
accompanying 50-60 kt 500-mb speed max moving into CO and eventually
western NE/SD.  In the low levels, a lee trough will sharpen with
southerly flow maintaining a fetch of seasonably adequate moisture
(50s deg F surface dewpoints) into the High Plains.

Ahead of the approaching trough, partial clearing will result in
strong surface heating this afternoon over the central High Plains.
MLCAPE is expected to peak near 1500 J/kg from eastern Colorado
northward into western Nebraska.  Initial storm activity late this
morning through the early afternoon will develop over the high
terrain of CO/northern NM and move/develop east into richer moisture
by mid-late afternoon.  The increasing large-scale ascent coupled
with heating will eventually result in numerous storms mainly in the
form of linear clusters evolving into linear bands of convection by
early evening.  The greatest combination of instability, lift
and deep-layer shear is forecast across western Nebraska and
northeast Colorado, suggesting an enhanced threat for severe wind
gusts.  Based on some of the latest CAM data, have expanded the
Slight-Risk equivalent wind probabilities farther south into
northeast NM/northwest TX Panhandle.  Some consideration was given
to expand the ENH Risk into southwestern SD, but the later timing of
storms lends enough uncertainty to preclude this change this outlook
update.

...Northern High Plains...
Ahead of the approaching mid-level low, divergent south to
south-southeasterly flow will be in place across the northern
Rockies and northern Plains.  During the afternoon, thunderstorms
will develop in the north-central Rockies and move north to
northeastward across the northern High Plains.  An axis of moderate
instability is forecast by afternoon from the Dakotas northwestward
into northeast Montana.  As large-scale ascent and moderate
deep-layer shear overspread the northern High Plains late this
afternoon and evening, organized storms will be possible.  Severe
wind gusts and isolated large hail will be the primary threats.

...Eastern Florida...
A mid-level trough will move across the eastern Gulf of Mexico
today, as an associated surface trough moves across the Florida
Peninsula. Surface dewpoints in the lower to mid 70s F, along with
surface heating will contribute to moderate instability by
afternoon. As surface temperatures warm today, scattered
thunderstorms are expected to develop along and ahead of the surface
trough.  RAP forecast soundings at 21Z in eastern Florida have
MLCAPE in the 2000 to 3000 J/kg range, with 0-6 km shear around 20
knots.  This, combined with steep low-level lapse rates could be
enough for a marginal threat for locally severe wind gusts.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 PM CDT Sun Sep 15 2024

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE EASTERN
GREAT BASIN INTO THE FOUR CORNERS REGION...ND INTO NORTHWEST
MN...EASTERN NC AND VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
On Monday, sporadic severe gusts and hail will be possible during
the afternoon to early evening across parts of the eastern Great
Basin to Four Corners. Isolated severe storms are possible over
eastern North Dakota into northwest Minnesota. Some tornado threat
may develop over eastern North Carolina and vicinity.

...Eastern Great Basin to the Four Corners...
A seasonably strong mid-level low initially near San Francisco Bay
Monday morning should move east during the day, before curling
northeast Monday night towards the NV/UT/ID border area. This will
occur in response to a strong mid-level jet translating through the
basal portion of the large-scale trough across the Desert Southwest
into the eastern Great Basin.

Convection will likely be ongoing at the start of the forecast
period near the midlevel low, and also farther east toward the Four
Corners region, within the warm/moist conveyor. Relatively strong
heating will be possible between these two regimes, from eastern NV
into parts of UT. While buoyancy will likely remain quite weak
within this warmer and more well-mixed regime, high-based convection
will be possible during the afternoon and evening as the midlevel
low approaches the region, with increasing meridional flow and a
deeply mixed boundary layer supporting isolated severe gusts.  

Farther southeast into eastern UT and the Four Corners vicinity,
increasing southwesterly flow aloft and strengthening deep-layer
shear will become conditionally supportive of organized convection.
Warmer midlevel temperatures may limit buoyancy to some extent,
though sufficient moisture will support afternoon MLCAPE of 500-1000
J/kg. A few supercells will be possible within this regime, with an
attendant threat of isolated severe gusts and hail. 

...Parts of ND into northern MN...
With the primary upper-level trough displaced well to the west,
deep-layer shear will remain weak across much of the Great Plains.
However, most guidance suggests an MCV will emanate out of central
High Plains convection on D1/Sunday and gradually progress northeast
towards the Red River Valley during the day on Monday. In
conjunction with a strengthening low-level jet, this MCV may help to
support relatively vigorous storm redevelopment within a moderately
unstable environment during the afternoon and evening. 

Stronger midlevel flow attendant to the MCV could support some storm
organization, and a couple supercells and/or stronger clusters will
be possible, with a threat of isolated hail and damaging wind.
Somewhat favorable low-level shear/SRH could also support a tornado
threat, if a surface-based supercell can be sustained. Uncertainty
remains regarding the strength/timing of any MCV moving across the
region, along with the most favored corridor for diurnal storm
development. 

...Eastern NC and vicinity...
Guidance generally suggests that an initially offshore surface low
will move northward or northwestward from later on D1/Sunday into
D2/Monday and D3/Tuesday, and eventually move inland across some
part of the Carolinas. However, uncertainty remains regarding the
timing, track, and intensity of this low, along with the extent to
which it acquires any tropical or subtropical characteristics. 

If a deepening low does move onshore, then a higher theta-e airmass
may move inland, accompanied by increasing low-level shear/SRH
along/north of the low track. While the general scenario supports
some potential for low-topped supercells, the magnitude of any
tornado threat will be dependent on the extent of intensification
that occurs with the low (and its attendant wind fields) prior to
landfall. The Marginal Risk has been expanded somewhat across
eastern NC and vicinity, in response to the various uncertainties.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1128 AM CDT Sun Sep 15 2024

Valid 151630Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms capable of producing isolated severe gusts and hail
may occur today and tonight across parts of the northern/central
Plains.

...Northern/Central Plains...
An amplified upper trough along/near the West Coast this morning
will further evolve into a closed upper low over northern CA and
vicinity by late tonight. Ahead of this feature, modestly enhanced
south-southwesterly mid-level flow will be in place over much of the
western states and Rockies through the period. Although low-level
moisture is expected to remain limited over much of this region,
isolated strong to severe gusts may occur with any thunderstorms
that can develop in a deeply mixed boundary layer favorable for
gusty downdraft winds. 

Latest guidance continues to suggest that a relatively greater
concentration of severe potential will be focused across parts of
the northern/central Plains late this afternoon through tonight.
Across this area, a weak surface lee trough and greater low-level
moisture to its east should support weak to moderate instability
with daytime heating. Steep mid-level lapse rates should also aid
updraft accelerations/intensities, with around 20-30 kt of
deep-layer shear supporting modest thunderstorm organization.
Isolated severe hail may occur with initially more discrete
convection, but a tendency for clustering should lead to a
relatively greater wind threat with time as convection spreads
generally east-northeastward through the evening. Regardless, the
overall severe threat from northeast CO into western NE/SD and
vicinity should remain fairly isolated/marginal given the modest
deep-layer shear.

Low-level warm advection is forecast to increase across much of the
northern/central Plains tonight as a southerly low-level jet
strengthens. A surface warm front is also expected to lift northward
over ND late tonight into early Monday morning. With steepening
mid-level lapse rates overspreading the northern Plains in tandem
with increasing low-level moisture, ample MUCAPE should be
available. Most guidance shows at least isolated convection
developing across parts of ND tonight in this favorable
thermodynamic environment. Although deep-layer shear may remain
fairly modest, it may still be sufficient for updraft organization
and an isolated threat for severe hail with any elevated convection
that can form. Have therefore expanded the Marginal Risk northward
to account for this potential.

...Coastal Carolinas...
Latest NHC forecast continues to indicate some potential for
sub-tropical or tropical development of a surface low currently off
the SC Coast. Regardless of development, it still appears that the
more moist/tropical low-level airmass over the Gulf Stream will
struggle to advance inland over coastal portions of NC/SC through
the end of the Day 1 forecast period early Monday morning (16/12Z).
Accordingly, tornado potential with any low-topped supercells on the
north to northeast periphery of the surface low should tend to
remain offshore until Day 2/Monday (after 16/12Z).

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CDT Sun Sep 15 2024

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, with minor changes made to
the Elevated areas to reflect the latest guidance consensus.
Additionally, a couple of dry strikes may accompany isolated
thunderstorms along the Front Range in eastern Colorado (and
surrounding areas), but overall modest fuel receptiveness suggests
that lightning-induced fire ignitions should remain a localized
concern, so no isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have been added.

..Squitieri.. 09/15/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Sun Sep 15 2024/

...Synopsis...
Preceding an amplifying large-scale trough over the West Coast,
enhanced deep-layer meridional flow will overspread the Great Basin,
while a related surface cyclone evolves over northern NV. Deep
boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced flow aloft, along with a
tightening pressure gradient peripheral to the surface cyclone, will
yield 20-25 mph sustained southerly surface winds and 15-20 percent
RH over southern/central NV. Given modestly receptive fuels here,
elevated fire-weather conditions are expected during the afternoon. 

Additionally, large-scale ascent accompanying the amplifying
midlevel trough will promote a mix of wet/dry thunderstorms across
the northern Great Basin/Intermountain West. While quick storm
motions and limited precipitation with some of this activity could
yield a risk of lightning-induced ignitions, marginal fuels should
generally limit the threat. 

Over the southern High Plains, breezy/gusty southerly surface winds
will develop amid a warm/dry boundary layer near a lee trough during
the afternoon. This will favor a few hours of elevated fire-weather
conditions.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Ileana Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092024
800 AM MST Sun Sep 15 2024
 
Ileana has been devoid of deep convection since yesterday afternoon, 
as the system has been within a strong wind shear and very dry 
environment. Given the lack of convection, the system is being 
designated as a post-tropical remnant low.  An ASCAT-C pass from 
late last night depicted winds near 30 kt over the Gulf of 
California near northern Sinaloa.  Given this, will hold the 
intensity at 30 kt for this advisory, although that may be generous.
 
The system has been meandering over the Gulf of California with a 
motion of 310/3 kt.  The remnant low will increase forward speed 
later today as it continues northwestward.  The remnant low will 
continue to weaken throughout the day, and is forecast to dissipate 
on Monday. 

This is the last advisory on this system. For additional 
information on the remnant low please see High Seas Forecasts issued 
by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFEPI, WMO 
header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
