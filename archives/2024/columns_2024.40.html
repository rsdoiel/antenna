<h2 id="how-about-those-mets-day-2">How about those Mets, day 2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I am reminded of 2015, when the Mets were so charmed – they could be
down 9-0 in the 8th inning and you would tune into the game to see how
they’d win it. It’s not the usual thing for the Mets, who pull defeat
from the jaws of victory far more often than the other way.
</p>
<p>
And omg, 2024 is shaping up the same way.
</p>
<p>
Sit down and shut up, here come the Mets!
</p>
<p>
Briefly, because I have stuff to do – the Mets were down 1-0 in the
bottom of the 8th, having been thoroughly shut down by the amazing Zach
Wheeler. Imagine someone throwing a ball at you at 100 mph that looks
like it’s going down but actually goes up and to the left. Or next time
down and to the right. You could try to swing but you’d have to be very
lucky to connect. And so it was for the first seven innings until they
took out Wheeler (pitchers don’t do complete games any longer, they used
to).
</p>
<p>
The Mets were ready. Hit after hit after hit and before you knew it, it
was 5-1. Alonso, the star of the last Milwaukee game drove in one of the
runs with a long sacrifice fly to center.
</p>
<p>
The Phillies and their fans who had been so confident of victory were
shocked. And left to plan for today’s game at 4PM on Fox. You gotta know
where I’ll be – glued to the set and dreaming about the fate of this
Mets team who shows real signs of strong

<h2 id="wordpress-destiny-day-2">WordPress destiny, day 2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Glad I wrote the piece I wrote
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/05/142118.html?title=wordPressDestiny1">yesterday</a>.
</p>
<p>
I could have written it any time in the last year as I was investigating
and developing on the WordPress API and back end, but now seemed to be a
good time, with all the attention its getting, and Matt’s interviews, I
and others are getting a better idea of what the various components of
the community are. I don’t know about the rest of you, but I had only a
vague idea of what WordPress is beyond a piece of software used for
commerce and to a lesser extent these days, writing on the web.
</p>
<p>
A few ideas – not in any particular order:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
From my point of view, blogging and the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>, WordPress is being
built <i>around</i> more than being built on, when it is such a
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">potent</a> and surprisingly open
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+coral+reef">platform</a>.
I took the time to look, and underneath the cluttered user interface is
a strong foundation that you could build <i>any kind of writing
software</i> on.
</li>
<li>
If a community developed at this level, writing tools, we’d be
compatible at a very deep level, so the opportunities for
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop">interop</a>
are amazing. I don’t say that lightly. (I had asked them to allow apps
to attach their own data to posts for years, until I discovered earlier
this year the API has that feature. If only they had listened to the
question and answered it thoughtfully, we could have saved years. The
company desperately needs an evangelism function.)
</li>
<li>
The WordPress platform could be a very strong part of the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>. The comparison
between developer freedom on the WordPress platform and the Facebook one
(which is what Threads is built on) is stark. I have worked on the
Facebook platform, btw – and from a software design perspective it’s
brilliant, a breakthrough, something to emulate, which I did in the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity">wpidentity</a> package
I wrote. But from a policy standpoint, after the 2016 election
Facebook’s API was radically restricted, not something many people know
about (it was a fully public event). WordPress has an API that doesn’t
appear to have any such limits, and even if they imposed them, in theory
their server could be cloned (it’s open source) but it certainly could
be emulated at an API level.
</li>
<li>
It’s enticing. All those users – there should be a market for writing
tools there, but there isn’t. Why is that??
</li>
<li>
I feel like we’re like ships passing in the night. I thought I should
point this out, at least once, as Matt and company go off in a direction
I don’t understand and don’t see why I should want to. Did they care
when the move to HTTPS undermined what remains of the original
blogosphere? I don’t see any evidence of it. It’s like Walmart sought to
build a shopping center on the remains of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria">Library of
Alexandria</a>. People don’t seem to have any respect for independent
writing on the web, what we dreamed of in the beginning, and <i>the
dream was realized.</i> No wonder the tech industry wants to tear it
down. It contradicts a basic premise of the programming priesthood. And
no wonder journalism doesn’t defend it, they are offended by the idea of
people writing for free, based on the incorrect assumption about what we
do. We’re their sources, dammit, not their competitors, at least if they
would do their jobs (which is another problem altogether) and if they
spent any time thinking and questioning before condeming.
</li>
<li>
Look at
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/the-blogosphere-is-in-full-bloom-the-rest-of-the-internet-has-wilted-dave-winer">John
Naughton’s piece</a> today in the Guardian. He’s doing more to focus
attention on the web as a writing environment than the whole tech
industry which is built on our work, especially Automattic. The
ignorance and in some cases resentment in the industry is huge,
something else Naughton points out so well. We can turn this around, I
guess since WordPress is open source, it doesn’t have to wait for Matt
to turn in that direction.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Just some thoughts as the world seems to be converging on something, not
sure what. There are so many doors that are now open that never were
before, the question is – do we have the courage to connect the dots and
work together, or do we all insist on going our own ways to a fairly
dark future.

<h2 id="a-wordpress-app-ecosystem">A WordPress app ecosystem?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A few years before WordPress came out, I did a product called
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22radio+userland%22">Radio
UserLand</a> which was a combination
<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/15/024232.html?title=radioUserlandScreenShot">blogging
tool</a> and feed reader. Two main screens, a streamlined UI. You could
get in quickly, write and publish a post in a minute, and see it show up
in the reader a moment later. It worked, and it added a major new
component to the blogging world, and I think still represents the
simplest most focused UI for writing. It was a really popular product.
</p>
<p>
The same idea, really simple blog post writing and editing, with all the
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">features</a> that should be available
to web writers, optional titles, links, simple styling, enclosures, the
ability to edit. The things the common social web apps generally
<i>don’t</i> have.
</p>
<p>
This imho is a huge opportunity. I wish this is where the focus in the
WordPress community was, but I think right now the world is building
<i>around</i> WordPress, not on it. It could be great, it could totally
solve the problem of a new document standard in the social web that
makes it really like the web. Instead they’re fighting over who owns
what part of the WordPress trademark, at least as far as I can tell.
</p>
<p>
Last year I created a Node.js package called
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity">wpidentity</a> that
acts as a bridge between a browser-based JavaScript app and the
WordPress back-end, and the result is fine. It suggests that there could
be a developer community writing apps that all join up in the middle in
WordPress’s database. Pretty powerful idea!
</p>
<p>
And I think the users, the writers, would love it, because we developers
could <b>compete to delight them</b>, and not have to worry about
building a huge server capability as Automattic already has debugged and
scaled. And maybe the battle that’s going on now could fade into the
background.

think a lot of confusion about AI products comes from the name. It’s not
clear what intelligence in humans is or how it works. We just believe it
exists. So then the question is, can machines do the same thing? The
truth is no one knows. It could be that human intelligence, once we
figure out what it is, will be as trivial as they tell us the AI
“intelligence” is. So if you’re trying to make sense of it, or if the
idea is offensive, try pretending that “intelligence” was “pomegranate”
or “cauliflower” – these are two terms
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JKoFCUaUbY">John Lennon</a>
suggested George Harrison use in place of words in
<a href="https://genius.com/The-beatles-something-lyrics">lyrics</a> he
hasn’t come up with. Say ChatGPT is “Artificial Cauliflower” and that
should be less offensive, yes? It would make as much sense as calling it
intelligence. On the other hand, conversation with my favorite
Artificial Cauliflower app does feel pretty much exactly like conversing
with a human. A very patient and very knowledgeable and intelligent
(whatever that means) but not infallible human.</p>

<h2 id="how-about-those-mets">How about those Mets!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/04/caseyStengelMetsManager.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">We
are a Mets family. Around the kitchen table in my childhood home, the
default question was “What did the Mets do?” Before I was born we were a
Brooklyn Dodgers family, always National League, but the Dodgers left
shortly after I was born and the Mets came along when I was seven, and
that was it for us. It was the one thing we all agreed on – the Mets.
Much later when my Mom and I would fight about something, a pretty
regular thing – I invented what I called
<a href="https://hello.typepad.com/hello/2009/11/shea-stadium-rules.html">Shea
Stadium Rules</a>, which meant that a disagreement could be tabled when
we remember that underneath everything we are true Mets fans, and
ultimately Mets fans can find something to agree on – that rain or shine
and there was plenty of rain, we always stood with our team. A deeper
truth of the Mets was we didn’t really mind when they lost. Because
underneath it all at a whole other level, the Mets have a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">philosophy</a>
that is strong. We are the Mets and that’s all you need to know.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, last night it wasn’t lookin good. It was a winner-take-all game
with the hated (for now) Milwaukee Brewers. We hated them because it
looked like they were going to end the Mets season in the first round of
the playoffs. I was getting ready to take off my Mets cap for the year,
and put on my Knicks cap, when Lindor walked, then Nimmo singled, and
with runners on first and third and one out, Pete Alonso comes to the
plate. He’s been cold all year. I hoped for a base hit or at least a
long sacrifice fly to bring in the runner on third. I couldn’t watch but
forced myself to. And then <b>it happened</b>.
</p>
<p>
We who have been joined at the heart to this team and have been through
it all, have come to expect failure, but sometimes winning happens, as
it did last night. A big swing. The bat connects. Oh please let it land
anywhere but the glove of a Brewer, and then all of a sudden Alonso is
jogging around the bases, and delirium takes over, in the living room of
my mountain home and everywhere Mets fans were at that fateful hour.
</p>
<p>
We figured at that point they might as well just retire the side, but
the Metsies, who Casey Stengel, the first manager asked “Can’t anyone
play this stinkin game!” – brought in another run, which it turns out we
didn’t need.
</p>
<p>
The Brewers were overwhelmed. They tried to score in the bottom of the
ninth but the Mets
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mets+philosophy">philosophy</a>
was too strong.
</p>
<p>
It’s like every baseball kid’s fantasy – the count is 3 and 2 ,the
team’s back is to the wall, up comes the slugger, the crowd is silent
and then he hits it <b>out of the park</b> and the team emerges
victorious and the young person’s fantasy saves the day. We’ve all been
there, many times. Last night we got to live it, again, this time for
real.
</p>
<p>
And now we go to Philadelphia to give them a proper dose of New York
love.
</p>
<p>
Meet the Mets meet the Mets, step right up and greet the Mets, etc.
</p>
<p>
Game 1 of the NLDS begins tomorrow at 4PM. Good times will be had by all
(except Philadelphia fans of course).
</p>
<p>
PS: This wasn’t
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/10/08/baseballCanTeachUsAboutLif.html#p9">Mookie</a>
in
<a href="https://baseballhall.org/discover-more/stories/whole-new-ballgame/new-york-mets-1986-world-series">game
6 </a>of the 1986 World Series, but it was along those lines of
improbability.
</p>
<p>
PPS: I love that they give a realtime readout on screen of the
probability of each team winning. At the top of the ninth, before all
the michegas, the Mets had only a 6% chance of winning. I think every
game should come with a graph over time of this stat. It would be an
emotional map, much more interesting than the other stats.

A reading portal brings a lot of writers together so you can read them
all in one place.

A writing portal is the same idea but in reverse. I write in my portal,
and it flows where ever I want it to.

The problem is the reading portals aren’t open to allow this to work.

ChatGPT news network would be pretty interesting. You could register as
an independent blogger, and push your writing up to their cloud in real
time. And then readers could ask what experts on <i>whatever</i> think
about <i>what just happened</i> and it would know what your expertise
is, and it could build the report also in realtime, in response to a
very detailed question you could ask. And you could tell it whether or
not you want lies, or if they should omit the lies. Personally I would
opt out of the lies, but some people like lies in their news, kind of
like menthol in cigarettes. And forget about paying the news orgs. They
don’t give you a way to opt out of the lies.</p>

<h2 id="ai-deflates-the-value-of-expertise">AI deflates the value of
expertise</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I didn’t read the WSJ story about the deflation of expertise, quoting
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla">Vinod Khosla</a>,
Silicon Valley venture capitalist, who I know from my time in
California. He says AI leads to a deflation of expertise. I agree with
him, AI absolutely deflates the value of expertise.
</p>
<p>
It aggregates all of our knowledge in one place where it’s easy to
access, about anything you want to know. It answers questions that you
can’t get any other way.
</p>
<p>
Some technological developments are profound. We never understand all
the implications of a new technology when it comes online, but you do
get some strong clues. You have to use it to know learn how to think
about it. That’s not unreasonable because we all grew up in a world that
didn’t have this technology, as my parents grew up in a world without
television, and I didn’t use a computer until I was 18 or use the web
until I was 37. None of us grew up with anything but fiction about AI,
and the fiction imho didn’t grasp the implications very well.
</p>
<p>
If I ask good questions ChatGPT stretches my mind in ways it never has
been stretched before and I’m well educated and in my work have explored
frontiers of knowledge, even so – this is the most mind-stretching
experience I’ve ever had. Not kidding. And I’m not a VC or prone to
overhyping tech.

Hackers can execute commands on a remote computer by sending
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/attackers-exploit-critical-vulnerability-recently-patched-in-zimbra-servers/">malformed
emails</a> to a Zimbra mail server. It’s critical, but difficult to
exploit.

<blockquote>
<p>
In an email sent Wednesday afternoon, Proofpoint researcher Greg
Lesnewich seemed to largely concur that the attacks weren’t likely to
lead to mass infections that could install ransomware or espionage
malware. The researcher provided the following details:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
While the exploitation attempts we have observed were indiscriminate in
targeting, we haven’t seen a large volume of exploitation attempts
<li>
Based on what we have researched and observed, exploitation of this
vulnerability is very easy, but we do not have any information about how
reliable the exploitation is …

<h2 id="how-i-use-this-site">How I Use This Site</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-03, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
I wanted to write a blog post with some thoughts I’ve been having about
how I’ve been using this site in recent times, and how that’s likely to
change (or not) in the short to medium-term. Basically, as you may have
noticed, I’ve been posting much less this year (and even last year) than
I used to, in the early years of me having this site. There are a couple
of reasons for that, which mainly boil down to me just not being in a
frame of mind to blog so much. I’ve been pregnant for most of the year,
which has sapped me of a lot of the energy I used to have. I also kind
of don’t want to blog about being pregnant all the time, but it’s been
such a big thing going on in my life that it’s like I have no ideas for
anything else to blog about! It’s just… a weird time. What else can I
say?
</p>
<p>
Another thing that’s been going on is that I’ve been posting much more

in the first instance, and then copying posts back here – often in a big
batch – when I find the energy at some point down the line. In

often, like I say, significantly after I first posted the posts on
Mastodon). I feel like the whole “IndieWeb” approach to online
socialising, which appealed to me so much when I first came across the
idea, worked really well for so long as I had the enthusiasm to keep up
with janky multi-step publication workflows… but as time has gone on,
it’s come to feel like a hassle. It’s so much <em>easier</em> to post on
Mastodon than it is to post on my own site, especially from my phone. I
do have an

server which is <em>supposed</em> to make posting on this site just as
hassle-free, but see “janky multi-step publication workflows”… it’s not
the fault of Indiekit itself but it feels like there’s <em>always</em>
some reason why it doesn’t work. The server (deployed on fly.io) crashes
for no good reason. The authentication to GitLab somehow breaks. I make
a mistake not escaping an apostrophe in an image’s alt text and then the
Hugo rebuild fails and I can’t fix it until I get back on my computer.
Considering I feel like the vast majority of people who read my posts
read them via Mastodon anyway, I just can’t be bothered any more! There
are some things I do post here exclusively (mainly link posts), or here
simultaneously with Mastodon, but I can only do that from my computer,
which I’m not using 100% of the time. Otherwise it’s a lot easier to
post first there, and use this site to archive those posts.
</p>
<p>
And I mean, as I suggested, I am currently <em>very</em> pregnant. I’m
anticipating that once Baby is here, an even larger proportion of the
“internet time” that I have will be via my phone, rather than via my
computer, and I’ll probably have less “internet time” overall too. So…
that suggests to me that I’m not going to get back to using this site as
a “home base”, and
<abbr title="Post on Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere">POSSE</abbr>ing out
from here, any time soon.
</p>
<p>
Which is not to say that I’m “giving up” on having a personal site, by
any means. Certainly, even if I do post first on Mastodon, I like that
archiving posts here means I’m way more able to find them again later.
If I want to browse all the Gidget pics I’ve posted, or the thoughts
I’ve posted about pretty much any specific topic, I can do so using the
tag archive pages here (or the search function). Mastodon makes it a lot
harder to browse old posts. Mastodon is also not a place to post
full-length blog posts (like this one) so if and when I have one of
those to put out there, those’ll be going up here first. I also like
having a <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/">personal wiki</a>
(even if I’ve found that pages on anything topical are freaking
impossible to keep updated), dedicated “sections” for link posts and
book reviews, the ability to create alternate language versions to
further my
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/international-auxiliary-language.html">auxlanging</a>
hobby, and so forth… I mean, I could solve a lot of my own problems by

is that a deployed static website isn’t going to break if I don’t update
it. (That said, the <em>bad</em> thing about Hugo is that sometimes a
new version of Hugo itself comes out that fucks up something I’ve been
doing with this website. That’s generally not fun to try to resolve when
I’m lacking the energy for website workflow debugging in the first
place. So, I have to be careful not to cavalierly run <code>brew
upgrade</code> on my computer unless I’m prepared to risk losing the
ability to locally preview stuff, haha.) So you know, this post isn’t
really to say I’m going to be changing anything about this site. It’s
more to acknowledge the way I’ve already been using it, over the last
few months.

<p>
I do wish the IndieWeb would be <em>easier</em> for people who aren’t
professional-tier web developers who can code their own
<abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>es and admin their own
servers. Or maybe I’m just in an awkward place where my wants are too
“advanced” for a ready-made solution like Micro.blog but I also don’t
have the skills (or consistent enthusiasm) to maintain something
bespoke. And honestly, I feel like I’m seeing this loss of enthusiasm
among other “IndieWeb but not diehards about it” people that I used to
follow on Micro.blog… and still do follow on Micro.blog, technically,
but I so rarely even open my Micro.blog timeline any more (instead
following Micro.blog accounts on Mastodon, if not the person’s Mastodon
account). People are using federated social media more, and trying other

(or continuing with their own blogging setups like me, but pulling away
from more specific “IndieWeb” stuff like

a lot of people. I don’t know. I mean, it’s a hobby, right, so we’ve got

there’s no point.

Feel free to follow whichever of
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/rss.html">this site’s RSS feeds</a>
you like, too – there’s likely to be some stuff (mainly link posts) that
I don’t also post on Mastodon – but just be warned that microblog posts
are likely to come in batches some time down the track from when they
were actually written (but the timestamps should be accurate for the
original time of writing). My life is changing, and I don’t have the
energy to keep on top of this site the way I used to, but it’s not going
anywhere! And it’s totally possible that one day I’ll have more capacity
for it all again. At any rate… in the meantime, keep up with you all

<p>I’m writing this post on my SGI O2. Why? Because it’s more
distraction-free environment (no https so almost no “Internet” at all).
It makes some things harder, however. Wikipedia searches are limited to
the gopher interface and so on.</p>

I found that the settings in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> had no
effect. Namely, <code>PrintLastLog no</code> and <code>PrintMotd
no</code>.
</p>
<p>
Instead, what helped was to edit <code>/etc/pam.d/sshd</code> and
comment the first line (to get rid of the <code>uname -a</code> stuff
identifying the system). I kept the second line because
<code>/etc/motd</code> just says “This is the server.”
</p>
<pre><code># session    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic

<p>
I got rid of the <code>fish</code> greeting by using <code>set -U
fish_greeting ""</code> – although using <code>set -U fish_greeting
"🐟"</code> would be a cute alternative. 😄

    read -z -l input
    printf &quot;\033]52;c;&quot;
    printf &quot;%s&quot; $input | base64
    printf &quot;\a&quot;
end
</code></pre>
<p>
I need to install this for every remote account, of course, because it
has to exist on the remote end. Use <code>funced –save ssh-copy</code>
to do it.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an example of how to use it:
</p>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ssh sibirocobombus
This is the server.
You have new mail.
alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; echo hello | ssh-copy
alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; exit
Connection to alexschroeder.ch closed.
alex@melanobombus ~&gt; wl-paste
hello

</code></pre>
<p>
<code>wl-paste</code> and <code>wl-copy</code> are from the
<code>wl-clipboard</code> package for Wayland.

<h2 id="california-ai-safety-bill-vetoed">California AI Safety Bill
Vetoed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-02, updated: 2024-10-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Governor Newsom has
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/california-governor-vetoes-controversial-ai-safety-bill/">vetoed</a>
the state’s AI safety bill.
</p>
<p>
I have mixed feelings about the
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/from-sci-fi-to-state-law-californias-plan-to-prevent-ai-catastrophe/">bill</a>.
There’s a lot to like about it, and I want governments to regulate in
this space. But, for now, it’s all
<a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/">EU</a>.
</p>
<p>
(Related, the Council of Europe
<a href="https://rm.coe.int/1680afae3c">treaty on AI</a> is
<a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/council-of-europe-opens-first-ever-global-treaty-on-ai-for-signature">ready
for signature</a>. It’ll be legally binding when signed, and it’s a big
deal.)

2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China
</h1>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-14</strong>. I’m somewhere in the Italian-speaking parts
of Switzerland with my wife. There is a lot of running, hiking, hugging,
kissing, eating and drinking involved. 🥰
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-15</strong>. Still on the trip but late at night I spent
more than an hour trying to figure out why my server had a load of
nearly 40. 💻
</p>
<p>
All I discovered is that load went down when I shut down Emacs Wiki. See
also <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2024-09-16">2024-09-16</a>
on Emacs Wiki.
</p>
<p>
Well, I needed to sleep and I‘ve got plans for the next few days so I
shut it down while I slept hoping that the misconfigured spider is fixed
or the inept programmer discovers their mistake. Just another day in the
Butlerian Jihad. Some misguided soul probably wanted to download it all
and wrote a broken web crawler and when that got blocked they bought
some nice scaling infrastructure from Amazon, Hetzner, OHV or Alibaba
Cloud or whatever they are called, allowing them to use a gazillion
different IP numbers that will eventually lead me to implement some sort
of cloud service provider block.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-09-15-emacs-china.png" alt="Load shoots up to nearly 40 around midnight. The graph is for an entire week so the peaks are not shown. It just goes up to 30 multiple times." />
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-16</strong>. Switched Emacs Wiki back on after a few
hours of sleep and it did fine. But then it restarted again… at 18:00,
19:00, 21:00, 22:00… and so I switched Emacs Wiki off again. Time to ban
some networks!
</p>
<p>
Anybody interested in my banning of IP ranges and possibly interested in
me reverting any of these, take a look at
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> … from a network that isn’t
banned, I guess. 😏
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-17</strong>. This continues to keep me busy and angry
every evening. Too bad I don’t have a real fast
<a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a> to firewall ban
pipeline. I’m using this script instead of carefully checking IP numbers
and networks. I’m also sick and tired of the same networks popping up
again and again.
</p>
<p>
I added over a hundred Chinese networks to the firewall rules and I’m
seriously considering blocking the whole country for a week. It seems
that most of the offenders are networks run by China Telecoms and China
Mobile.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-09-18</strong>. So far, so good. Load stays below two.
</p>
<h2 id="example">
Example
</h2>
<p>
Here’s example usage for <code>network-lookup</code>, filtering for
Emacs Wiki and a URL parameter used when requesting recent changes or a
RSS feed for a single page only. That would count as suspicious
misbehaving crawler behaviour in my book.
</p>
<pre><code>Made 16 DNS requests.
4 cache hits.

As far as I am concerned, all deserve to be banned. Over-banning? Maybe.
What do you think?
</p>
<p>
For demonstration purposes, this is what I ran:
</p>
<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus.root grep '&quot;^www.emacswiki.org.*rcidonly&quot;' /var/log
/apache2/access.log \
| tail -n 20 \
| ssh sibirocobombus.root bin/admin/network-lookup \
| wl-copy
</code></pre>
<p>
So now I’m ready to ban them all:
</p>
<pre><code>wl-paste | grep ipset
</code></pre>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Emacs">#Emacs</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-10-01</strong>. Today I came back to the server with load
at 40. Again! Here’s me filtering the log for requests that got a server
error status code (500–509).
</p>
<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus ~# tail -n 20000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| grep -v ^social \
| grep &quot; 50[0-9] &quot; \
| tail -n 50 \
| bin/admin/network-lookup
Made 44 DNS requests.
6 cache hits.
</code></pre>
<p>
I think the only one I didn’t ban was the unknown one, Gwene and Bing
(Microsoft).

Cross-posting is here now. I am not surprised
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/croissant-debuts-a-cross-posting-app-for-threads-bluesky-and-mastodon/">Croissant</a>
is getting such a positive reception.

<p>
That is where the fediverse will be defined imho, in the intersection
between the competing social web services.

<p>
You’ll know it’s working when they feel they have to match each others’
features because with cross-posting their difference in character
limits, titles, styling, links etc will be much more visible.

Activitypub is too much. Cross-posting is exactly right and here now.

<p>I had a dream last night with many of my dead relatives present. We
were at some kind of social event. My grandfather had a new wife or
girlfriend, but he didn’t recognize me, though he pretended to. My
mother was far off in the distance taking pictures. I wonder what that
means. Some of them <i>were</i> dead and gone. I had to remind myself of
that. Meanwhile both my parents were alive and being themselves. (Heh.)
My subconscious has a clear idea of who they are/were, only it doesn’t
register that some of them are gone.</p>

open up the market, and stand out from the pack. I’ve been

ChatGPT by Planting False Memories into Its Data</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, updated: 2024-09-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This vulnerability hacks a feature that allows ChatGPT to have long-term
memory, where it uses information from past conversations to inform
future conversations with that same user. A researcher
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/false-memories-planted-in-chatgpt-give-hacker-persistent-exfiltration-channel/">found</a>
that he could use that feature to plant “false memories” into that
context window that could subvert the model.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A month later, the researcher submitted a new disclosure statement. This
time, he included a PoC that caused the ChatGPT app for macOS to send a
verbatim copy of all user input and ChatGPT output to a server of his
choice. All a target needed to do was instruct the LLM to view a web
link that hosted a malicious image. From then on, all input and output
to and from ChatGPT was sent to the attacker’s website…

identical machines, at various price points arrived at by that
mysterious breed known as "marketers". In fact, the only difference in
the plastic on display was how much drive space had the engineers fitted
in, and how much RAM did they have. Was the case a pretty colour, that
appealed to the latest 10-year-old-girl, or a rugged he-man, who was

released its first 8080 processor in 1972 and later followed up with
variations on a theme, eventually leading to the 80286, the 80386, the
80486 (getting useful), and so on. All of these variations needed an
operating system which basically was a variation of MS-DOS, believed to
have been based on QDOS, or "Quick and Dirty Operating System," the work
of developer Tim Paterson at a company called Seattle Computer Products
(SCP). It was later renamed 86-DOS, after the Intel 8086 processor, and
this was the version that Microsoft licensed and eventually purchased.

Sanyo bought build quality, the so-called "lotus card" to make it fully
compatible with the IBM PC, and later, an RGB colour monitor and a 10
meg hard drive. The basic model was still two 5¼" floppy drives, which
they pushed up to 720kB, and later the 3.½" 1.25MB floppy drives. Ahead

Commodore 64. A pharmaceutical company had developed a software system

Texas Instruments laptop ran well enough and I remember playing Doom  on

we ended the 20th century, we bought bigger and more powerful machines.
The desktop was being chased by the laptop, until I stood in my favorite
computer wholesaler staring at a long row of shiny boxes that were
basically all the same, wondering which one my wife would like… knowing
that it would have to connect to the so-called "internet", and in doing
so, make all sorts of decisions inevitable.  As to securing a basically
insecure system which would require third part programs of dubious
quality and cost. </span>

I chose a smaller Asus, with 16GB of main RAM and an NVIDIA   card, and
retreating to my cottage, collapsed in despair. Fifty years of computing

it said “HELLO” against a big blue background that promised the world –
but only offered more of the same.  As in, a constant trickle of
hackers, viruses, Trojans and barely anything useful – but now included
several new perversions called  chat-bot or “AI”.</span>

would happen if we got really innovative? I still remember Bill Gates
saying "Nobody will ever need more than 640k of RAM." And yet, it is
common now to buy machines with 8 or 16 or 32GB of RAM, because the poor
quality of operating systems fills the memory with badly codded garbage
that causes memory leaks, stack-overflow errors and other memory
issues.</span>

away the useless touch pads, and gimmicks like second mini screens built

sodim ram plus 4GB of SDDR2 video RAM, and 2×500GB WD 7200RPM spinning
rust hard drives. This was beginning to look more like a computer. Over
the time I used it, I was able to replace the spinning-rust drives with
500GB Samsung SSDs, and as larger sticks of RAM became available,
increased that to the limit as well. I ran that machine, which was
Linux-compatible, throwing away the BSOD [Blue Screen Of Death – Ed.] of

looked at my battered old faithful; my many-times-rebuilt Asus, and
decided the time had come. I started building. Maximum RAM and video
RAM, latest NVIDIA card, two SSDs, their top-of-the-line WiFi and
Bluetooth chip sets, sound cards, etc. Then, as my time in Perth was at
an end I got it sent to New Zealand, as I was due to fly back the next
day. </span>

was the first of four Metabox machines I have built, and is still

had decided to go to the Philippines and South east Asia to help set up
clinics for distressed children, something I had already done in South
America, and the NZ winter was fast approaching.  Hastily I arranged
with a church group in North Luzon to be met at Manila airport.  I had
already contacted an interpreter who was fluent in Versaya and Tagalog,
and was an english teacher so we arranged to meet at Manila airport and
go on from there.</span>

so called job soon showed up as a scam and after spending a week or so
In Manila I suggested that rather than waste visa we have a look over
some of the country.  Dimp pointed out her home was on the next Island
over and would make a good base to move from.</span>

we ended up in Cagayan de Ora – the city of the river of gold!  After
some months of traveling around  we decided to get married and so I
began the process of getting a visa for Dimp to live in NZ.  This was a
very difficult process, but with the help of a brilliant immigration
lawyer, and many friends, we managed it and next year Dimp becomes a NZ
citizen.</span>

next Metabox was described as a Windows 10 machine, but I knew that it
would run Linux beautifully – and so it did. A few tweaks around the
ACPI subsystem and it computed away merrily, with not a BSOD in sight. A
friend of mine who had popped in for a visit was so impressed with it
that he ordered one too, and that arrived about three months later. A
quick wipe of the hard drive (thank you, Gparted!), both these machines
are still running happily, with not a cloud on the horizon.</span>

new Metabox arrived about six weeks ago, and I decided – just out of
curiosity – to leave Windows 11 on it. A most stupid decision, but as my
wife was running Windows 11 and had already blown it up once, needing a
full reset (which, to my surprise, worked), I proceeded to charge it for
the recommended 24 hours, and next day, switched it on. “Hello” it said,
in big white letters, and then the nonsense began… a torrent of unwanted
software proceeded to fill up one of my 8TB NVMe drives, culminating
after many reboots with a Chatbot, an AI “assistant”, and something
called “Co-pilot”. </span>

I cried, “not in a million years!” – and hastily plugging in my Ventoy
stick, I rebooted it into Gparted, and partitioned my hard drive as ext4
for Ubuntu MATE.</span>

far, the beast seems most appreciative, and it hums along with just a
gentle puff of warm air out of the ports. I needed to do a little
tweaking, as the latest NVIDIA cards don’t seem to like Wayland as a
graphics server, and the addition to GRUB of  acpi=off, and another
flawless computer is on the road.</span>

Configuring Oddµ via environment variables</h2>

<h1 id="2024-09-29-configuring-oddµ-via-environment-variables">
2024-09-29 Configuring Oddµ via environment variables
</h1>
<p>
<a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> replaced <a href="Oddmuse">Oddmuse</a> as
my preferred wiki software.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Oddµ is a <strong>wiki</strong> – a website that can be edited on the
web, using a regular web browser on my phone, for example. Only I get to
edit the wiki these days and there is no way to leave a comment. Send me
an email, instead. I love getting email! 😍
</li>
<li>
Oddµ is a <strong>static site generator</strong> (SSG) so that I can in
theory write a bunch of Markdown files locally, run Oddµ and upload the
result to the web. The reason I don’t use it like that is that this
disables online search. If you don’t need online search or you’re using
some other software to handle it, static files are a great option.
Static files are also a great option if you need to archive or export
the whole site for offline viewing. Anybody will be able to browse the
HTML files offline.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Oddµ reacts to changes made as it runs, so I can edit the Markdown files
remotely, using ssh and my favourite editor or I can edit the Markdown
files locally and sync them with the server and the pages Oddµ serves
reflect those changes immediately, no restart required. Earlier versions
required a restart so that Oddµ would update its in-memory indexes of
page names and titles.
</p>
<p>
Oddµ is also a program that doesn’t take a config file. Oddmuse, its
predecessor, was designed to be hackable. There were a gazillion options
to set. You could hook into the parser and add new rules, add new
actions, add new meta data, and on and on. The drawback was an
incredible lock-in. After twenty years, I started to feel it: it was
hard to remove features for any specific wiki because its pages used a
markup that was incompatible with everything else. The sources files
ended up being tied to the config files and the modules used.
</p>
<p>
Some of my Oddmuse wikis used the old
<a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Usemod_Markup_Extension">UseMod
markup</a>. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used the newer
<a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Creole_Markup_Extension">Wiki Creole
markup</a> that some wiki engine authors wanted to push
<a href="2006-09-04_Wiki_Creole">back in 2006</a>. Some of my Oddmuse
wikis used their own
<a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Markup_Extension">eclectic markup
mix</a>. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used
<a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Markdown_Rule_Extension">Markdown</a>.
For a while I even added <a href="Gemtext">Gemtext</a> to the mix! I
didn’t like this incompatibility between sites and sometimes even
between old and new pages on the same site. This is why Oddµ only does
Markdown with three minimal extensions: hashtags, wiki links and fedi
account links. See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.5">oddmu(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
Oddµ generates HTML using templates so there is no need for options to
control the HTML output. If you want it changed, edit the templates. See
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-templates.5">oddmu-templates(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
Oddµ doesn’t know anything about users, passwords and permissions. If
you want authentication and authorization (which you do, if your wiki is
public), then you need to configure your webserver to ask for passwords
and restrict access accordingly. See
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-apache.5">oddmu-apache(5)</a> and
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-nginx.5">oddmu-nginx(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
Over time, however, I did add a few configuration options to Oddµ. This
happens via environment variables.
</p>
<p>
When stdin is a socket, Oddµ reads requests from it instead of listening
on port. This allows for systemd-style socket activation. This is what I
use at the moment. Otherwise, it listens on the address from
<strong>ODDMU_ADDRESS</strong> and the port from
<strong>ODDMU_PORT</strong>. ODDMU_ADDRESS may be either an IPV4 address
or an IPv6 address. If ODDMU_ADDRESS is unspecified, then the listener
listens on all available unicast addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6. If
ODDMU_PORT is unspecified, it listens on port 8080. See
<a href="oddmu/oddmu.1">oddmu(1)</a> and
<a href="oddmu/oddmu.service.5">oddmu.service(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
By default, Oddmu tries to identify the language used on every page in
order to allow a style sheet to enable hyphenation for the correct
language. This is important for multi-lingual sites. The library used
detects over 70 languages. This takes memory and time.
<strong>ODDMU_LANGUAGES</strong> allows admins to reduce the number of
languages taken into account. This site, for example, only considers
English and German. See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.1">oddmu(1)</a> and
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-templates.5">oddmu-templates(5)</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
A pretty hairy feature is activated using <strong>ODDMU_FILTER</strong>.
Sometimes, subdirectories are separate sites. If you do not want to
include those sites in searches or archives of the whole site, you need
to identify them. The way to do this is via the environment variable
ODDMU_FILTER. It’s value is a regular expression matching separate
sites. On this site, my dad’s old site resides in such a subdirectory. I
use this environment variable to exclude “his” pages from searches made
on “my” pages. See <a href="oddmu/oddmu-filter.7">oddmu-filter(7)</a>
for more.
</p>
<p>
And finally, since linking to fediverse accounts involves an outgoing
Webfinger lookup, this feature is disabled by default. You can switch it
on by setting <strong>ODDMU_WEBFINGER</strong> to “1”. It’s what I do.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.5">oddmu(5)</a> for more.

<strong>2024-09-29</strong>. I really love the fact that I picked
Markdown. If I miss something, I can just write HTML directly. And with
the decision to use Markdown, all the Markdown writing from years on
GitHub use stays relevant. There’s no need to tinker with the code. That
still surprises me.

2024-09-29 How do I feel about the MNT Pocket Reform?
</h1>
<p>
SpaceLizard asked:
<a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/what-brought-you-to-the-mnt-community/2132">What
brought you to the MNT community</a>? Well, actually there were three
questions:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
How did you first find out about MNT Reform and/or what brought you
here?
</li>
<li>
What do you do / want to do with your Reform Laptop most?
</li>
<li>
Are cats or dogs better, (or robots)?
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here’s what I said:
</p>
<p>
I learned about MNT Reform on fedi. I had bought a Purism laptop
<a href="2017-12-23_New_Laptop">in 2017</a> and
<a href="2018-06-08_Librem_13_by_Purism_Mini_Review">I wasn’t happy</a>.
On a blog post <a href="2021-08-26_New_laptop%2C_again%E2%80%BD">in
2021</a> I mentioned the MNT Reform laptop for the first time. I
mentioned the MNT Pocket Reform in 2022,
<a href="2020-11-20_Small_computer">on a blog post from 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
I still use the Purism laptop as my main laptop, but one of its hinges
broke in 2021 and I needed something else to take on trips. That’s why I
started looking for an extra small laptop. I wanted something that was
energy efficient, that would allow me to use all my Debian stable tools
for system administration, to write Perl code, to use Emacs, to browse
the web using Firefox, to ssh into my server and do maintenance work
from hotel rooms and the like. The MNT Pocket Reform landed on the list.
</p>
<p>
As it stands right now, I’m still using Debian testing but I’d love to
make that switch to Debian stable one day. My secret idea is that I just
have to wait and one day I’d be able to do it using
/etc/apt/sources.list sorcery. I managed to switch from PureOS to Debian
stable doing that, so I don’t doubt that there is a way to do it from
Debian testing to Debian stable. Painfully, maybe, but doable.
</p>
<p>
I’d love for battery and wifi to be no problem. Right now, battery life
is good enough for my evening sessions if I have to move to the couch,
and wifi seems to be working fine now that summer is over. I have an
ethernet connection for the Pocket Reform, however, and that’s very
nice. The cable is 3m long or something. But in a hotel, wifi still
works, as I said.
</p>
<p>
I recently had some emergency sysadmin stuff to do in the evenings while
on holidays and the Pocket Reform did exactly what I needed it to do.
</p>
<p>
Finally, cats are bird murderers and dogs are our best friends. No
question, dogs are better! But also, I don’t have time in my life for a
dog, so I think I’ll vote for little Internet people in my computers, on
forums, IRC, Discord, Fedi, newsgroups and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Luckily,
<a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@josch" title="@josch@floss.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="josch">@josch</span></a> had some answers
for me!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Instead of doing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> sorcery in the
future, you could replace “testing” by “trixie” today. That way, at the
point in time where “testing” becomes “stable” you do not need to edit
your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. The updates and security
mirrors also exist already for trixie but are of course empty but this
means that you can also add those today already and have things set up
for the future:
</p>
<pre><code>deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie main
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie-updates main
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security trixie-security main
</code></pre>
<p>
The one point of pain may be that after the trixie release, the MNT
repositories will continue to build packages for unstable which will
work for a while but will break after new uploads of glibc and friends.
So in the future, you might want to switch out the MNT repo for the
Debian stable repositories on <code>reform.debian.net</code> which are
currently only serving packages for bookworm and not trixie.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This sounds like great advice.

I haven’t mentioned this before, but I’m working on the reading
interface for my blog. What you see when you go to scripting.com. I’m
putting the same kind of attention into it that I did for the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/03/13/010313.html">blogroll</a> feed
reader earlier this year. There are a few unreleased products that use
the same approach. The way we read the web hasn’t received enough
attention, we’ve been so focused on the twitter-like interfaces,
forgetting that reading on a full page is important too. We’ve settled
for a pretty awful way of reading. I want to fix writing too, and have
plans for this, but I thought I should do some work on reading as well.
I wish I could show you all the new ideas, but I’m saving that for a big
reveal at some point.</p>

Some observations on swift concurrency:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>it has caught a bunch of mistakes I made<br />- I made a couple of
mistakes trying to speed run fixes<br />- some of the solutions to the
problems are harder to grasp than I hoped. I still google a lot.<br />-
wish there was a “sure you are correct, but I can guarantee this ain’t
ever going to happen, let me do it”
</p>
<p>
That said, I forgot how many times I used “foo!.bar” because I knew
“this is never going to happen” and found it a few months later on the
crash logs.
