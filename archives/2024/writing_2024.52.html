<p>“As someone who’s been obsessed with vampires since I was a little
kid, I don’t totally know [why we love vampire movies so much].
Obviously, sex and death are always interesting and in vampire stories,
including the very earliest accounts of folk vampirism in Eastern
Europe, that connection has always been there. Some of these early
folkloric vampires didn’t drink blood but fornicated with their widows
until they died. And then, being undead, rising from the grave, you know
Dracula and Jesus have had the most movies made about them of any
popular characters in Western cultures, so there must be something to
that as well,” says Robert Eggers, writer/director of
<em>Nosferatu</em>, starring Lily Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult and Bill
Skarsgård.  <br> <br>In this episode, Eggers talks about the
play-version of Nosferatu that he wrote and directed when he was in high
school, writing the Ellen character (Depp) as a woman at war with
herself, and making Orlok (Skarsgård) the villain without making him too
arch or campy.  <br> <br>“[Orlok] has a sense of humor and he has a
sense of poetry. He’s a well-learned man so that’s enjoyable. It’s fun
to write dialogue for someone who had their heyday in the 16th century
and English was like their 17th language, that’s fun,” says Eggers. 
<br> <br>We also asked Eggers about telling an old story but making it
relevant to today. He says that while he doesn’t worry about making a
film with a specific message, “I don’t live in a vacuum. So even if I’m
not trying to write a film with a message, whatever is happening around
me is coming out. Also, it’s interesting that the movie didn’t get made
until when it did. The original <em>Nosferatu</em> came out a couple of
years after the Spanish flu. This is coming out a couple of years after
the pandemic. And I wrote all that stuff before the pandemic. In fact,
they had face coverings originally, and I took them away because it felt
too much on the nose. So, I think it’s all there for the taking,” he
says.  <br> <br>To hear more about the power of vampires and Egger’s
writing process, listen to the podcast. </p>

<p>
Sophie Burnham’s <strong>Sargassa </strong>is another first novel, and
another novel that flits with playful seriousness between the trappings
of fantasy, science fiction, and alternate history, using all three to
question and upend the reader’s assumptions about the world of the novel
(and perhaps the world at large) and how it works. <strong>Sargassa
</strong>takes the aura of Rome – perennial

<p>
<em>Disclaimer</em> warns audiences at the beginning to be wary of
narratives and forms that distract from hidden truths. Written and
directed by auteur Alfonso Cuarón, this AppleTV+ miniseries weaves
together storylines to uncover the truth about what happened years ago
between a young Catherine Ravenscroft (Leila George) and Jonathan
Brigstocke (Louis Partridge), the deceased son of a grieving
widow.<br><br>After the adult Catherine (Cate Blanchett) receives a copy
of an independently published novel with the disclaimer: “Any
resemblance to persons living or dead is not a coincidence,” the mystery
begins to unravel before the audience.<br><br>With a heavy focus on form
and structure, <em>Disclaimer</em> offers valuable lessons for
screenwriters looking to hook audiences with a shocking mystery.

<p>date: 2024-12-23, from: Author’s Union blog</p>
<p>The case Sedlik v. Drachenberg, currently pending before the 9th
Circuit, presents the 9th Circuit a first opportunity to interpret the
fair use right in the wake of the Warhol decision. Anticipating the
far-reaching consequences for artists and authors, Authors Alliance
filed an amicus brief in support of KVD. In our brief, we explained that
(1) a distinct purpose is required for the first factor to tilt in favor
of fair use, (2) a successful social media presence does not
automatically render all postings “commercial,” and (3) concrete
evidence is needed to prove the existence of a licensing market or the
likelihood of it developing.</p>

There are different ways of writing medical SF. One, as in the case of
Rajaniemi above, or Greg Egan occasionally, is to crank up the
verisimilitude and extrapolate specific diseases or treatments in the
best net-up hard-SF fashion; another is to lean into medicine as a
system rather than a sci­ence and build
