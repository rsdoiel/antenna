ALLIANCE SUBMITS AMICUS BRIEF IN SEDLIK v. DRACHENBERG</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-23, from: Author’s Union blog</p>
<p>The case Sedlik v. Drachenberg, currently pending before the 9th
Circuit, presents the 9th Circuit a first opportunity to interpret the
fair use right in the wake of the Warhol decision. Anticipating the
far-reaching consequences for artists and authors, Authors Alliance
filed an amicus brief in support of KVD. In our brief, we explained that
(1) a distinct purpose is required for the first factor to tilt in favor
of fair use, (2) a successful social media presence does not
automatically render all postings “commercial,” and (3) concrete
evidence is needed to prove the existence of a licensing market or the
likelihood of it developing.</p>

In my experience, it’s often the case that once you hear a good idea,
you think “Of course! Why has no one done that before?” In that spirit:
the “new year, new you!” slogan seems a perfect theme for a speculative
fiction anthology – now that Chris Campbell has

There are different ways of writing medical SF. One, as in the case of
Rajaniemi above, or Greg Egan occasionally, is to crank up the
verisimilitude and extrapolate specific diseases or treatments in the
best net-up hard-SF fashion; another is to lean into medicine as a
system rather than a sci­ence and build
