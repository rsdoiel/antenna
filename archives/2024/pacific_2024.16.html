Watch: Magnetics, magma, and monitoring: new technology for old

<p>date: 2024-04-21, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Earth&amp;#8217;s magnetic field surrounds us every second of the day, everywhere on the planet. Anyone who has picked up a pocket compass and seen the magnetic needle quickly align itself has seen the action of this ever-present invisible field. But can we harness the magnetic field to forecast volcanic activity? Emerging technology in the field of &amp;#8220;quantum&amp;#8221; science may aid us in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The phrase, &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t waste a crisis,&amp;#8221; has almost become a cliche, and we use it in reference to many things, especially economic crises. Indeed, when we experience a crisis, we should always learn what we can from it in the hopes of not experiencing it again. Experiencing a medical crisis often leads us to pay greater attention to our health. An economic crisis may lead us to make better decisions about spending and saving.&lt;/p&gt;
