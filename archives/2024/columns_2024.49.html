Ultraviolet Grasslands</h2>

<h1 id="2024-12-07-armour-in-2d6-ultraviolet-grasslands">
2024-12-07 Armour in 2d6 Ultraviolet Grasslands
</h1>
<p>
I’m running Ultraviolet Grasslands (UVG) using 2d6 rules. UVG itself
uses d20 rules and so I often have to translate back and forth and it is
not very satisfying, to be honest.
</p>
<p>
So what to do? In
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2024-11-17_Ultraviolet_Grasslands">a
recent episode</a> of the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZürich/Internet_Office_Hours">Internet
Office Hours</a> podcast,
<a class="account" href="https://ludosphere.fr/@Whidou" title="@Whidou@ludosphere.fr"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Whidou">@Whidou</span></a> suggested a
system of immunities. So here are my thoughts.
</p>
<h2 id="brainstorming">
Brainstorming
</h2>
<p>
Weapons are either “normal” (2d6 damage) or “extreme violence” (3d6
damage). Some weapons might be practically instant death weapons, like
plasma guns, necrotic blasters desintegrators and the like. These might
do 4d6 and more damage.

Perhaps it would be best to extend the list of tags UVG uses. Then
weapons can have tags such as Cut, Stab, Crush, Slug, Energy, Necrotic,
Blast – and armour can confer protection or immunity against these tags.
Other tags are easy to add:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
2H prevents the use of a shield.
</li>
<li>
Vicious deals 3d6 instead of 2d6 damage.
</li>
<li>
Close means that it’s good for close combat, like in tunnels or inside
narrow corridors. Enemies with longer weapons get a free attack if you
need to close (outside of tunnels and corridors).
</li>
<li>
Range means that you can shoot stuff.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Vicious weapons do 3d6 damage; blast weapons do 4d6 damage. Stationary
guns like plasma guns go on a different list but do 5d6 and more damage.
Scope creep!

<p>
And then armour! Using some more tags, too.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Hot means no problem in cold environments but endurance tests to act
otherwise
</li>
<li>
Cold means no problem but cannot be worn outside of combat in cold
environments
</li>
<li>
Bulky means no sneaking and similar checks
</li>
<li>
Rare cannot be bought at a regular shop
</li>
<li>
Alive means that it is a permanent part of your body, now
</li>
<li>
Power means that it can only be used for the given number of fights
until it needs recharging; the altar to charge it takes a whole sack (a
porter to carry it)

A shield can be used to negate a single hit. (“Shields shall be
splintered.”)
</p>
<p>
I wonder how good spears and other stabbing weapons are, though. Cutting
weapons really must be the best weapons against unarmoured opponents!
Why were axes unpopular given the table above? There must be more to it.
</p>
<p>
Let’s test some assumptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the crossbow and halberd are armour piercing: yes, because breastplate,
scale shirt and cuirass all don’t protect against Crush
</li>
<li>
the dagger is good for unsuspecting enemies because it’s Close
</li>
<li>
the axe is is good for fighting in close quarters against armoured
opponents because it’s Close and Crush
</li>
<li>
there cloth armour that helps against the smaller calibres (pistols and
SMGs)
</li>
<li>
golem armour is immune against slug throwers
</li>
<li>
the advanced combat suites (spectral, porcelain) make you immune to
normal melee weapons
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Surprising result: Swords are pretty bad against armoured opponents.
Perhaps they are mostly a status symbol after all. A status symbol of a
ruling warrior class over unarmed peasants. They’re probably just easier
to carry than spears.

<h2 id="why-i-like-my-model-y">Why I like my Model Y</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Yesterday I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/06.html#a150415">wrote</a> that
I’d trade in my Model Y if an non-Tesla EV came along that equaled it. A
few people asked what I liked about the Model Y that I’m not finding in
alternatives. Here’s the list.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I love the handling of the Tesla. It’s a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_car">muscle car</a> like
the 2007 <a href="https://www.kbb.com/bmw/5-series/2007/">BMW 535i</a> I
used to drive, great acceleration, but handles like the 1993
<a href="https://www.cars.com/research/mazda-mx_5_miata-1993/">Miata</a>
another car I owned and loved. I’ve also owned really sloppy cars like a
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/subaru/forester-2022">Subaru
Forester</a> or a
<a href="https://www.cars.com/research/toyota-sienna-2004/">Toyota
Sienna</a> minivan, even a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Voyager#Full-size_van_(AB;_1974%E2%80%931983)">1974
Plymouth Voyager</a>, the largest American passenger car ever made. I’m
never going back to a car that doesn’t have the authority of a Model Y.
</li>
<li>
The Model Y has lots of headroom, which my long torso needs, so I don’t
bruise my head each time I get in the freaking car.
</li>
<li>
I have a Tesla charger at home, so whatever I buy has to be compatible
with or adaptable to it.
</li>
<li>
4WD is important because where I live it snows in winter, and I drive on
dirt roads a lot too.
</li>
<li>
It’s a computer. It’s going to be hard for a competitor to offer the
integration with a network that Tesla offers, they’re a computer company
as much as they’re a car company. Their connection to Starlink (assumed
to be coming) is going to be hard to compete with too.
</li>
<li>
Calling it <i>self-driving</i> should get them in trouble with the FTC,
there’s no way anyone should trust it to drive itself, and the car’s OS
enforces that view, so I guess they have lawyers at Tesla. That said, I
like having access to this technology. I’ve been an innovative software
developer for a long time, and I like using tech that pushes the leading
edge. The marketing (a Musk feature presumably) is what I don’t like.
</li>
<li>
Charging network. I occasionally take trips that are out of range of my
home charger, to Boston, or NYC sometimes leave me needing a charge on
the way home. I’d like to have the option of driving cross-country as
well. The Tesla charging network is a big plus. I honestly don’t know
how good the charging situation is for other brands. This would be
something for car magazines to rate, to have a way of measuring it, as
people who are put off by Musk’s politics (about 1/2 of American voters)
look for ways to drive something other than a Tesla.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So this turned into an ad for Tesla. Heh.
</p>
<p>
There are <i>reasons</i> we love it so much.
</p>
<p>
Just separate from Musk and all’s well.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been thinking Tesla drivers who love America should have some kind
of demonstration. We all park our cars around local Tesla dealers, let
the police tow our cars, only to be replaced by other Teslas. We’re all
computer nerds, we could probably even figure out the scheduling. We
probably have nearly as much money as they do. Just sayin.
</p>
<p>
Tired of companies that push us around politically and Tesla is one of
the worst. So far they’ve managed to convince us they aren’t Elon Musk,
but that’s a mirage, he is the company and the company is him. They are
completely one and the same.
</p>

<p>When Bluesky was experiencing its huge post-election surge, it was
exciting because lots of users were experiencing the surge in followers
and engagement. It was exhilirating. That has slowed to nothing now, no
more engagement there than on Threads, Masto or Twitter. The character
limit on Bluesky being considerably less than the others makes it harder
to rekindle interest imho. And btw the euphoria being gone is neither
good or bad, it just is.</p>

<p>
Fifteen years ago I
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/01/friday_squid_bl_166.html">blogged</a>
about a different SQUID. Here’s an
<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/archive/squid-long-and-sticky-arms-law">update</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Fleeing drivers are a common problem for law enforcement. They just
won’t stop unless persuaded­—persuaded by bullets, barriers, spikes, or
snares. Each option is risky business. Shooting up a fugitive’s car is
one possibility. But what if children or hostages are in it? Lay down
barriers, and the driver might swerve into a school bus. Spike his
tires, and he might fishtail into a van­—if the spikes stop him at all.
Existing traps, made from elastic, may halt a Hyundai, but they’re no
match for a Hummer. In addition, officers put themselves at risk of
being run down while setting up the traps…

<p>ChatGPT is also a tutor. I’m learning new ways of coding SQL through
drill and it’s also improving my JavaScript code. It’s infinitely
impatient. It does make mistakes, but that’s also good for the drill,
catching the mistakes is instructive too. And in programming you always
have to be looking for errors, because you’ll almost always find them.

<h2 id="i-got-the-adhd-too">I got the ADHD, too</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
This month I got my official diagnosis for Adult ADHD. It’s fun to share
experiences with
<a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/my-adhd-diagnosis-process/">friends</a>.
While ADHD presents some new waters to navigate, it isn’t exactly news
to me. Thanks to Dr. TikTok, I’ve suspected this outcome for a few years
now. It’s nice to have a proper diagnosis though. If I’m struggling to
focus or feeling overwhelmed, I know the probable root cause is how my
brain processes dopamine and norepinephrine impacting my executive
function.
</p>
<p>
There are different flavors of ADHD, so I can only describe my
experience:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I crave “optimal stimulation” – 1 task = too little. 3-5 tasks =
perfect, ideal. 6+ tasks = uh-oh, all the spinning plates come crashing
down.
</li>
<li>
I experience periods of hyperfocus – I often will lock in on an
interesting problem and work for hours and forget to eat.
</li>
<li>
Difficulty with tasks when overwhelmed – When overwhelmed (which is
always, I have some generalized anxiety too), I’m unable to summon focus
for even the smallest of tasks.
</li>
<li>
Sensitivity to messy environments – Related to optimal stimulation,
cluttered and messy environments (a common ADHD issue) creates a feeling
of overwhelm for me.
</li>
<li>
Sensory-seeking behaviors and fidgeting (classic restless leg syndrome)
</li>
<li>
I don’t have the hyperactive part of ADHD.
</li>
<li>
I’m pretty attentive and a good listener… until I’m not.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’ve developed a lot of coping and masking strategies over the years
that have allowed me to maintain a decent level of productivity. In my
20s I used to manage this by brute force and caffeine. But now that I’m
in my 40s with a lot more responsibilities and spinning plates, I feel
the reins slipping a bit. To help with this, I’m trying out a
non-stimulant sNRI medication that tries to repair that norepinephrine
processing. It takes a week or so to fully activate so it’s not an
instant fix, and to be honest I don’t quite know what to expect. I’m
excited to see if it makes a difference but even if it doesn’t I’m happy
to be on a journey.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, cheers to unique brains.

<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/">This
tool</a> seems to do a pretty good job.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The company’s Mobile Threat Hunting feature uses a combination of
malware signature-based detection, heuristics, and machine learning to
look for anomalies in iOS and Android device activity or telltale signs
of spyware infection. For paying iVerify customers, the tool regularly
checks devices for potential compromise. But the company also offers a
free version of the feature for anyone who downloads the iVerify Basics
app for $1. These users can walk through steps to generate and send a
special diagnostic utility file to iVerify and receive analysis within
hours. Free users can use the tool once a month. iVerify’s
infrastructure is built to be privacy-preserving, but to run the Mobile
Threat Hunting feature, users must enter an email address so the company
has a way to contact them if a scan turns up spyware—as it did in the
seven recent Pegasus discoveries…

<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@HeyeBodo" title="@HeyeBodo@rollenspiel.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="HeyeBodo">@HeyeBodo</span></a> stellt auf
fedi jeden Tag eine Frage zum Rollenspielsetting. Die darf man dann
beantworten. Da ich schon lange nichts mehr auf Deutsch hier auf dem
Blog geschrieben habe, werde ich die Gelegenheit wahrnehmen, das hier zu
tun. Allerdings habe ich vor, alles auf dieser Seite zu sammeln. Das
wird für die Leser, die dem Blog via einem Feed folgen, wahrscheinlich
etwas seltsam, denn heute gibt es nur Antworten auf die ersten zwei
Tage. Mir fällt leider auch keine andere Lösung ein, denn irgendwie will
ich auch nicht jeden Tag eine Seite schreiben.

<h2 id="welchen-geografischen-maßstab-hat-oder-strebst-du-für-dein-setting-an">
Welchen geografischen Maßstab hat oder strebst Du für Dein Setting an?
</h2>
<p>
Eine typische Karte, wie ich sie vorbereiten würde, ist von Ost nach
West ca. 30 Tagesreisen breit und von Nord nach Süd ca. 10–20
Tagesreisen hoch. Das sieht ästhetisch gut aus, bietet Platz für ein
paar Städte, Magiertürme, Monsterlager, Bauernhöfe, versteckte
Siedlungen, und so weiter. Ein paar Seen, ein oder zwei Gebirge mit
Pässen und Handelsrouten, viele Flüsse. Ich weigere mich, eine genau
Grösse anzugeben und behaupte einfach, ein Feld auf der Karte ist eine
Tagesreise. Wenn es keine Wege gibt, behaupte ich manchmal, dass eine
Tagesreise vielleicht nur 5–10km sind. Klar kann man als trainierter
Legionär auf einer römischen Strasse vielleicht ab und zu einen 50km
Marsch machen, oder 30km weit ziehen, aber in einem Tal, wo die Talwände
steil und von Bächen zerklüftet sind, wo der Talboden versumpft und wild
ist, wo das Wasser überall steht und fliesst, das Unterholz im Wald
dicht ist, weil die Wisente immer wieder Lichtungen reissen und es keine
richtige Forstwirtschaft gibt, kann ich mir nicht vorstellen, dass Leute
mit 20–30kg Ausrüstung pro Person mehr als ein paar Kilometer weit
kommen. Ich schliesse da von mir auf andere. 😅
</p>
<p>
Und damit kommen wir zum nächsten Thema, angenommen, ein Feld ist 10km
und dann ist eine Karte von 30×20 ungefähr so gross wie die ganze
Schweiz.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Die Ausdehnung der Schweiz beträgt von Norden nach Süden 220km und von
Osten nach Westen 348km. … Die Schweiz gliedert sich in drei
geografische Zonen: die Alpen mit einem Anteil von etwa 58% der
Gesamtfläche, das Mittelland mit rund 31% und der Jura mit 11%. 48
Schweizer Berge sind über 4000 m hoch. Obwohl Gebirge insgesamt 70% des
Staatsgebietes einnehmen, lebt in diesem Gebiet nur ein Viertel der
Bevölkerung. –
<a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/de/home/umwelt/geografie/geografie---fakten-und-zahlen.html">Geografie
– Fakten und Zahlen</a>, Eidgenössisches Departement für auswärtige
Angelegenheiten (EDA)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In diesem Gebiet gibt es 26 Kantone und entsprechend 26 grössere Orte
und ein Vielfaches an Burgen. An jedem Talausgang hat es eine Burg. In
grösseren Tälern hat es mehrere Burgen. Wenn wir jetzt von 30×20 Feldern
ausgehen, von denen 58% Gebirge sind, bleiben 348 Felder für die 26
Kantone oder im Durchschnitt 13 Felder pro Kanton.
</p>
<p>
Jetzt bin ich selber überrascht, wie überdimensioniert und leer meine
Karten sind. Da muss viel, viel mehr rein!
</p>
<h2 id="wovon-ist-dein-setting-inspiriert">
Wovon ist Dein Setting inspiriert?
</h2>
<p>
Meine Welt ist vor allem von der Umwelt inspiriert, in der ich lebe. Die
Berge, Täler und Hügel, in denen ich selber herumlaufe, inspirieren mich
für mein Spiel. Ich versuche natürlich mir vorzustellen, wie es früher
aussah, vor den Flussbegradigungen, vor der Trockenlegung der Sümpfe,
vor dem Strassenbau. Und somit ist klar, dass all diese Vorstellungen
aus der Vergangenheit irgendwie kollidieren und kollabieren müssen. Das
Resultat ist unrealistisch und weltfremd, und doch vertraut genug.
</p>
<p>
Die Monster und Menschen sind in vielem wohl von Conan und dem Herr der
Ringe bestimmt. Die Elfen sind eher keine Elben, sondern irgendwo
zwischen der Elfenwelt und Elric von Melniboné angesiedelt; die Orks
irgendwo zwischen Mordor und Skyrim; die Halblinge bei den Hobbits; die
Goblins in Moria; die Bäume in Fangorn; die Götter stammen aus der
nordischen Tradition (Odin, Thor, Loki), aber auch aus dem Zweistromland
(Ishtar, Marduk, Pazuzu), Griechenland (Hekate) oder aus Ägypten (Thot,
Ra, Set), aus Hyperborea (ebenfalls Set) und aus D&amp;D (Orcus).
</p>
<h2 id="wie-würdest-du-den-technologischen-entwicklungsstand-innerhalb-deines-settings-beschreiben">
Wie würdest Du den technologischen Entwicklungsstand innerhalb Deines
Settings beschreiben?
</h2>
<p>
In meiner Fantasy gibt es abgestürzte Raumschiffe, Laserpistolen,
Pistolen, Gewehre, Astralsegler, fliegende Schiffe, und so weiter, aber
ungleich verteilt. Aus Sicht der Spielenden ist ein Plattenpanzer mit
Schild die beste Rüstung. Hochwertige Rüstungen gibt es, doch dann sind
es Prunkstücke, die mehr kosten, aber nicht mehr nützen. Fantastische
Technologie gibt es im Rahmen von “Golem Rüstungen”, die dann einem
Plattenpanzer +2 und Schild +2 entsprechen und mit einer passenden
Energiequelle dann zu Plattenpanzer +4 und Schild +4 gesteigert werden
könnten. Ich kann mich allerdings nicht erinnern, dass dies jemand am
Tisch je geschafft hat. Die Laserpistolen sind sehr einfach gehalten:
Ein Schuss macht 1W6 Schaden wie eine Schusswaffe, Trefferwurf normal
durch Geschicklichkeit beeinflusst, Nachladen unnötig. Schaden liegt in
der Grössenordnung von einem magischen Geschoss. Eine Plasmakanone
funktioniert wie ein Bitzschlag und und macht 5W6 Schaden entlang einer
Linie, ein Granatwerfer wie ein Feuerball und macht 5W6 Schaden im
Zielgebiet, Rettungswurf gegen Drachenodem für halben Schaden. Das
könnten genau so gut Zauberstäbe mit Ladungen sein. So lässt sich alles
entweder mit Technik oder Magie erklären und es macht keinen grossen
Unterschied, da es die Rolle eines Technikers für die Spielenden nicht
als Klasse gibt. In dem Sinne ist alle Technik verloren gegangene und
wiederentdeckte Technik, die nicht wirklich beherrscht ist, die wie
Magie verwendet wird.
</p>
<p>
Auch die Zeitgeschichte ist mir egal. Bei aller Technologie von Waffen,
Rüstungen, Schiffstypen, Sprengkörpern und so weiter wird frisch und
fröhlich durcheinander gemischt. Die technologischen Unterschiede von
Hopliten und Conquistadores, zwischen Kataphrakten und Rittern, zwischen
Skythen, Mongolen und Hunnen, zwischen Vikingern und Reisläufern,
Landsknechten und Legionären interessiert mich nicht richtig.
</p>
<p>
Gespielt wird in einer Fantasiewelt, in der man keinen Sprengstoff und
kein Pulver kaufen kann. Die Schiffe sind aus Holz und von Segelkraft
betrieben. Kohleindustrie und Stahlindustrie gibt es nicht, also gibt es
keine Schiesswaffen und kein Dampfmaschinen, also auch keine Eisenbahn,
keinen Zeppelin, kein Flugzeug. Es gibt keinen Wilden Westen, kein
kolonialen Weltreiche, kein Zeitalter der Entdeckungen. In diesem Sinne
ist auch der Kapitalismus als “Finanztechnologie” nicht entdeckt.
</p>
<h2 id="was-ist-in-deinem-setting-unter-einem-monster-zu-verstehen">
Was ist in Deinem Setting unter einem „Monster“ zu verstehen?
</h2>
<p>
In den D&amp;D-artigen Spielen vermischen sich Dinge: Auf der einen
Seite sind Monster Konsequenzen für soziale Rätsel, wo es um etwas geht,
weil die Gewaltbereitschaft der Gegner allen Gesprächen, so lustig und
geblödelt sie auch daherkommen, jeder Zeit in Mord und Totschlag
umschlagen können. Bildlich sind diese Monster menschenähnlich, damit
auch geredet werden kann. Überhaupt ist mir wichtig, dass die Monster
reden wollen. Ich tendiere dazu, Regeln zu ignorieren, die das
erschweren.
</p>
<p>
Die zweite Sorte Monster sind Monster, die den Mainstreamalpträumen
entspringen. Kraken, Spinnen, Würmer. Hier gibt es alles von
Körperhorror, Gestaltwandlern, Chimären, Fleischmagie und mehr. Hier
gibt es auch Zwischenstufen. Auch diese Monster reden, aber es
unterstreicht mehr den Alptraum. Wovon reden denn Harpyien, Ghule,
Matikore und Trolle ausser vom ewigen Leben und wie alles verflucht ist?
Hier gibt es dann auch eine Traumlogik, wo man nicht immer eine
rationale Diskussion führen kann.
</p>
<p>
Wenn ich Traveller spiele, dann sind die erste Sorte Monster immer
Menschen und die zweite Sorte Monster immer Maschinen oder Institution,
Organisationen, Firmen, Staaten, Prozesse, Gerichte, Polizei und Militär
– auch hier geht es ins Alptraum-artige: Hoffnungslosigkeit, lange
Zeiträume, unmenschliche Bedingungen, Entfernungen, Zeiten, kafkaeske
Komplikationen, faschistisches Gedankengut, Gewaltspiralen, Krieg – das
sind die Alpträume, mit denen man nicht mehr rational diskutieren kann,
weil die Gegenseite auch kein menschliches Werteversändnis mehr hat.
</p>
<h2 id="welche-konflikte-gibt-es-in-deinem-setting">
Welche Konflikte gibt es in Deinem Setting?
</h2>
<p>
Meistens hat es latente Kolonialsituation oder soziale Ungerechtigkeit,
sei es die Feudalherrschaft, Theokratie, Plutokratie, Kleptokratie oder
ähnliche Konflikte. Das sind verhärtete Fronten, welche nur mit einer
grossen Kampagne umgestossen werden können – und das soll man auch
dürfen aber auch lassen dürfen. Wenn es einen Krieg gibt, dann ist er
weit weg und man sieht nur die Flüchtenden, Desertierenden,
Maraudierenden, das Elend und die Verzweiflung aus der Ferne.
</p>
<p>
Wenn der Krieg zu aktiv ist, dann entsteht der Wunsch, einzugreifen und
Einfluss auf Schlachten und Ereignisse zu haben, als sei man Hauptfigur
in einem Film. Aber so will ich das fast nie spielen. Also braucht es
eine angespannte Lage, die aber ohne Einflussnahme der Spieler statisch
bleibt. Nur so kann ich eine Sandbox leiten. Wenn wir dann mal 30
Spielabende gespielt haben, darf es Änderungen geben, vielleicht eine
Massenschlacht, eine Änderung der Machtverhältnisse. Aber der Krieg
selber steht nicht im Zentrum des Spiels.

idea</a> related to <a href="https://this.how/podcasting/">listening
lists</a>. Aggregate all the shows from all the feeds in a list into a
single feed. This seems brilliant because it reduces the implementation
in the client to almost nothing, just rebuild a feed periodically, it
could be done entirely in the client app. But it also could be something
users could share with other users, sort of a meta-channel. I think it’s
brilliant with the caveat that sometimes when you implement it you find
something that makes it more complex than it seems at first. This is the
second idea I’ve heard that the initial listening lists idea spawned. I
think there’s a lot of unexplored possibilities here.</p>

Power (with apologies to Guy Kewney)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<p>First Unix box I ever touched, in my first job, here on the Isle of
Man 36Y ago.<br /><br />It was a demo machine, but my employers, CSL
Delta, never sold any AFAIK. It sat there, running but unused, all day
every day. Our one had a mono text display on it, and no graphics
ability that I know of.<br /><br />I played around, I wrote “Hello,
world!” in C and compiled it and it took me a while to find that the
result wasn’t called “hello” or “hello.exe” or anything but
“a.out”.<br /><br />If I had the knowledge then, I’d have written a
Mandelbrot generator or something and had it sit there cranking them out
– but I was not skilled enough. It was not networked to our office
network, but it had a synchronous modem allowing it to access some IBM
online service which we used to look up tech support
info.<br /><br />Synchronous modem comms, or serial comms, are very
different indeed to the familiar Unix asynchronous serial comms used on
RS-232 connections for terminals and things. Sync comms are a mainframe
thing, more than a microcomputer
thing.<br /><br /><a href="https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Asynchronous_vs_Sy">https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Asynchronous_vs_Sy</a>…<br /><br />That
modem was a very specialised bit of kit that cost more than a whole PC –
when PCs cost many thousands each – and it couldn’t talk to anything
else except remote IBM mainframes, basically.<br /><br />The RT/PC felt
more powerful than a high-end IBM PC compatible of the time, but only
marginally. It had a bit of the feeling of Windows NT about 6-7 years
later: when you were typing away and you did something demanding, the
hard disk cranked up and you could hear, and even feel the vibrations,
that the machine was working hard, but it stayed responding to you the
same as ever. It’s a bit hard to describe because all modern OSes work
like this, but it was not normal in the 1980s.<br /><br />Then, OSes
didn’t multitask or they did it badly, and things like hard disk
controllers of the time took over the CPU completely when reading or
writing. So on MS-DOS, or PC-DOS or OS/2 1.x or DR Concurrent DOS, when
you typed commands or interacted with programs, the computer responded
right away as fast as it could. But if you gave a command that made the
machine work hard, like asked for a print preview or a spell-check of a
multi-page document, or sorted a spreadsheet of thousands of rows, or
asked it to draw a graph from hundreds of points of data, the computer
locked up on you. The hard disks span up, you heard the read/write heads
chattering away as it worked, but it was no longer listening to you and
anything you pressed or typed was lost. Or, worse, buffered, and when it
was done, then it tried to do those commands, and quite possibly did
something very much not what you wanted, like deleted loads of
work.<br /><br />(Decades later something similar happened with cooling
fans, and now that’s going away too. But with hearing the fans spin up,
there’s a hysteresis: it takes time, and tens of billions of CPU cycles,
for the CPU to heat up, so the fans come on later, and maybe stay on for
a while after it’s done. A PC locking up as the hard disk went crazy was
immediate.)<br /><br />The RT/PC was a Unix box. It didn’t do that. No
idea how much RAM or disk ours had: maybe 4MB if that, perhaps 100-200MB
disk. A lot for 1988! But if I did, say,<br /><br />cd / ls
-laR<br /><br />… then it would sit there for several minutes with the
HDD chuntering away, listing files to screen… but what was remarkable
was that you could switch to another virtual console and it stayed
perfectly responsive as if nothing were happening. That hard disk was
SCSI of course, so it didn’t use loads of CPU under heavy disk
load.<br /><br />The machine always felt a little slower, a little less
responsive than DOS, but it never slowed down even when working hard.
You had the feeling of sitting behind the wheel of a Rolls Royce with
some massive engine there, but pulling a massive weight, so it didn’t
accelerate or brake fast, but could just keep accelerating slowly and
steadily ’til you ran out of road… and you’d make an impressively large
crater.<br /><br />We sold a lot of IBM PS/2 machines with Xenix, and it
was a Unix too and felt the same… but limited by the puny I/O buses of
even high-end 1980s IBM PS/2 kit, so it sssslllloooowwwweeeedddd way
down doing that big directory listing.<br /><br />Whereas contemporary
PC OSes responded quicker but just locked up when working hard. This
included Windows 2, 3.x, 95, 98 and ME, and also OS/2 1.x, 2.x, and
Warp. The kernels did not support multithreading and background I/O very
well, so it didn’t matter that the hardware didn’t
either.<br /><br />Then Windows NT 4.0 came along, and it did. Suddenly
the hardware mattered. But if you had a Pentium 1 machine, with an Intel
Triton chipset on the motherboard, there was an innocent looking driver
floppy in the box. On that was a busmastering DMA driver for the Intel
PIIX EIDE controller. Install it on Win9x and it could see a CD-ROM on
the PATA bus. Handy but not world-shattering.<br /><br />Install it on
an NT machine and once the kernel booted, the sound of the hard disk
changed because the kernel was now using busmastering to load stuff from
disk into RAM. As the machine booted the mouse pointer kept moving
smoothly, with no jerkiness. When the login screen appeared it blinked
onto the screen and you could press Ctrl-Alt-Del and start typing and
your username appeared slowly but smoothly. The stars representing your
password, the same.<br /><br />It suddenly had that “massive computer
power being used to keep the machine responsive” feeling of an RT/PC the
decade before. Like that PIIX driver had made the machine’s £100 cheapo
IDE disk into a £400 SCSI
disk.<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=93060" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<p>“Tokyo, formerly Edo, historically Tokio, and officially the Tokyo
Metropolis, is the capital and largest city of Japan. Its metropolitan
area is the most populous in the world, with an estimated 37.468 million
residents. Its metropolitan area is the largest in size and the most
populous, with an area of 13,452 square kilometers and its city proper
has a population of 13.99 million people. Located at the head of Tokyo
Bay, the prefecture forms part of the Kantō region on the central
Pacific coast of Japan’s main island of Honshu. Tokyo is the political
and economic center of the country, as well as the seat of the Emperor
of Japan and the national government.”</p>

<p>
It’s been the
<a href="https://www.undp.org/super-year-elections">biggest year</a> for
elections in human history: 2024 is a
“<a href="https://www.idea.int/publications/catalogue/global-state-democracy-2024-strengthening-legitimacy-elections">super-cycle</a>”
year in which 3.7 billion eligible voters in 72 countries had the chance
to go the polls. These are also the
<a href="https://www.aspenideas.org/sessions/the-first-ai-elections">first
AI elections</a>, where many feared that deepfakes and artificial
intelligence-generated misinformation would overwhelm the democratic
processes. As 2024 draws to a close, it’s instructive to take stock of
how democracy did.

<p>
Looking at my logs, I’m adding <code>TurnitinBot</code> to my
<code>robots.tx</code> and I’m adding <code>DocSpider</code> to my web
server ban rules because the user agent string doesn’t contain a URL.
</p>
<p>
I also found an IP number from 147.124.205.0/24 quickly looking at all
sorts of URLs, with changing user agents and no bot identification, so
that entire network gets <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">banned at the
firewall</a>.

<p>
And there was an IP number that requested the main page a hundred times.
What the hell is wrong with people? They stopped an hour ago, so I’m not
taking action.

<h2 id="we-need-a-bdg-for-bluesky">We need a BDG for Bluesky</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I was very happy to see
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfefferle.org/post/3lcfkqqlcfk2j">this
post</a> on Bluesky this morning from a friend, Matthias Pfefferle, who
works at Automattic on the connection between WordPress and ActivityPub.
</p>
<p>
In his post he asks if there is a BDG for creating a PDS for Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
A BDG is a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+busy+developer%27s+guide">Busy
Developer’s Guide</a>, something we did
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041009205034/http://www.soapware.org/bdg">first</a>
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2001/04/04/aBusyDevelopersGuideToSoap.html">for
SOAP</a> in 2001 when we were trying to figure out how to map
<a href="http://xmlrpc.com/">XML-RPC</a> onto it. Since then there have
been lots of BDGs for all kinds of things. It’s a useful concept because
developers are often overly busy, so we need to get right to the problem
before understanding all the theory behind it. We need an example that
works, and we’ll just do what it does. That also guarantees interop,
which is the point of course.
</p>
<p>
Now we have a similar problem. Bluesky stores a user’s writing in a PDS.
If we can generate a PDS for our blogs, theoretically Bluesky should be
able to see them and use them as if they were created inside Bluesky. If
it were easy to understand we could get busy converting everything so it
works there. We can do that because we’re using popular simple formats
like JSON (see below) to organize our work.
</p>
<p>
For example this is how I use JSON for my blog, the one you’re reading
right now.

In 2017 the <a href="http://futureoflife.org/">Future of Life
Institute</a> released a video entitled
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipTO_7mUOw"><i>Slaughterbots</i></a>.
Wikipedia describes it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterbots">as an</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
arms-control advocacy video presenting a dramatized near-future scenario
where swarms of inexpensive
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_air_vehicle">microdrones</a>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial
intelligence</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_software">facial
recognition software</a> to assassinate political opponents based on
preprogrammed criteria.
</blockquote>
War accelerates technological progress. The war in Ukraine has not yet
produced “slaughterbots” but it has greatly accelerated drone technology
and taken some giant steps toward them. The most important of these
steps is that the cost of precision strike has been reduced by 1-2
orders of magnitude, making it affordable for “non-state actors” and
even individuals.<br /> <br /> Below the fold I look at drone
developments in the war in Ukraine, what is happening with drones and
drone defense in the West, and sketch some implications for the
future.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> In parallel with
the military developments I discuss here, there is rapid evolution in
civilian drone systems, especially in China, which can be expected to
feed into the military space. For example, Arnaud Bertrand describes
Pingyin County’s
<a href="https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862726569040781505">low-altitude
economy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The “low-altitude economy” is a big trend in China at the moment. XPeng,
one of China’s leading EV manufacturers, recently released a
low-altitude flying car for instance. Drone deliveries are becoming
increasingly common in Chinese cities, and various regions are actively
developing low-altitude transportation networks. Shanghai, for instance,
plans to establish 400 low-altitude flight routes by 2027.<br /> …<br />
this experiment in Pingyin County might seem small, but it could be the
beginning of something truly revolutionary. This is China effectively
experimenting around becoming the world’s first truly three-dimensional
economy, with low-altitude transportation and logistics networks. In a
decade or two Chinese cities might have as much activity happening in
the sky as on the ground.
</blockquote>

Ukraine
</h2>
The drone systems I am discussing here fall into two classes:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Small systems such as First Person View (FPV) quadcopters, with a range
of a few tens of kilometers.
</li>
<li>
Larger systems navigating autonomously by GPS or other means with a
range of hundreds of kilometers but relatively slow speeds of up to
200Kph.
</li>
</ul>
I am excluding faster systems such as short-range missiles like HIMARS
and cruise missiles such as Storm Shadow.<br />
<h3>
Short Range Drones
</h3>
The battlefield use of small fixed-wing and FPV quadcopter drones in the
class of DJI’s
<a href="https://store.dji.com/product/dji-mavic-3-pro">Mavic</a> and
<a href="https://store.dji.com/product/m350-rtk-and-dji-care-enterprise-basic">Matrice</a>
has transformed both reconnaissance and strike. They cost a few hundred
to a few thousand dollars; for comparison a
<a href="https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/04/goal-100k-artillery-shells-month-sight-army-says/396047/">155mm

Small drones, such as the Russian
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlan-10">Orlan-10</a>, provide
an eagle’s-eye view of the battlefield with real-time video. They have
greatly extended the range of battle field surveillance. With zoom
lenses they can provide detail at these longer ranges. With GPS they can
provide precise target locations. With thermal cameras they can do all
this at night.<br /> <br /> These changes have had significant tactical
effects:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Movement within about 20Km of the front line has become much more
dangerous. Night is no longer a good cover for movement. This has made
logistical support for positions close to the front more difficult.
<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">For
example</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
That has made some sections of the front lines, for example around
Siversk in Luhansk province, practically no-go areas for humans. Drones
are now responsible for a majority of battlefield losses, overtaking
artillery, according to Ukrainian sources.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
Damage assessment has become much easier. Real-time video of strikes can
estimate their effects accurately, avoiding wasting ammunition by
repeated strikes on targets that have been sufficiently disabled.
</li>
<li>
The vast amount of video generated, much of it from drones and the rest
from cellphones allows selected clips to be posted to social media used
for propaganda and for units to fund-raise. Donations are significant,
especially on the Russian side for vehicles, and on the Ukrainian side
to
<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">support
drone manufacture</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Ukrainian state is buying more than it once was, but voluntary
foundations still provide at least a third of all drones used by the
army.
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
This cornucopia of video fuels an active
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence">open
source intelligence</a> community and especially their impressive
ability to geolocate. It has become much harder for combatants to hide
events from the public.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Strike
</h4>
Kamikaze FPV drones provide sniper-like precision strike, but at vastly
longer range, with much heavier warheads, and the ability to access
<a href="https://x.com/Osint613/status/1852045500519981272">targets that
snipers cannot</a>. For example, social media videos routinely show FPV
drones striking targets inside buildings or infantry fighting vehicles
(IFVs) after entering through open doors. The warheads in common use
include anti-armor explosively formed projectiles — here is a
<a href="https://twitter.com/mouw5284/status/1859996364563939769">small
FPV drone</a> costing a few thousand dollars demolishing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-90">T-90</a>, the most advanced
tank Russia has deployed costing perhaps $3-5M. Note the precision with
which the FPV drone strikes the joint between the turret and the hull.
And
<a href="https://twitter.com/PStyle0ne1/status/1862419476454535531">here</a>
four FPV drones totaling around $10K destroy a $24M Zoopark radar.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Javelin_Fire!_(48638261261).jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" title="The U.S. Army,

Javelin</a> with a unit cost of around $250K, a range of less than 5Km
and weighing 22Kg. Is one Javelin as effective as 50 FPV drones
delivering perhaps six times the weight of warhead at more than twice
the range?<br /> <br /> There are also many FPV strike drones that are
not kamikaze. There are
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_drone">Dragon drones</a>”
that drop burning thermite on

Then there is the night bomber drone the Ukrainians call “Vampire” and
the Russians

<blockquote>
The drone is a large hexacopter (6-rotor) drone. It is equipped with an

deploying “mortar-sized munitions” and also as a “mother-ship” drone
equipped with a signal repeater, anti-jamming equipment, batteries, and
directional antennas. Its ability to function as a signal repeater
extended the battery life and range of secondary drones. During the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, the drones have been used primarily at
night.

emerging to fill it, such as one in the video tweeted by

On the Russian side the predominant strike drone is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZALA_Lancet">Lancet</a>, a
propeller-driven fixed-wing drone costing around $20K with a range up to
40Km. It has been fairly effective until recently (see Defense below),
but probably less cost-effective than the much cheaper quadcopter FPV
drones.<br /> <br /> The Achilles heel of all these drones is their
dependence upon radio communication for command and control, which can
be both detected and jammed. Worse, the command and control transmitter
can be located and attacked; drone pilots are a high-priority target for
both sides.
<a href="https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1798050100633366633">This
tweet</a> shows the Ukrainians using remotely-controlled directional
antennas so to minimize the risk of detection, and the loss if
attacked.<br /> <br /> Thus both sides have started to deploy drones
controlled via a fiber optic cable. David Hambling reports on a
Ukrainian version in
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/11/07/ukraine-fields-reboff-unjammable-fiber-optic-fpv-attack-drone/"><i>Ukraine
Fields Unjammable Fiber Optic FPV Attack Drone</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Khyzak REBOFF is a new Ukrainian FPV kamikaze drone with fiber optic
cable for communication instead of radio. This makes it immune to
jamming , the most effective protection against small drones.<br />
<br /> Russia has deployed similar technology with the Prince Vandal FPV
used in action since August, and which has been lethally effective.
However, Ukrainian expert Serhii Flash believes this is a Chinese model
which the Russian suppliers rebranded and sold to the military (at a
750% markup), and which was not designed for military use.
</blockquote>
The <a href="https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1855078938164482502">video
in this tweet</a> shows that the fiber doesn’t impair the FPV drone’s
remarkable agility. And
<a href="https://x.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1853504089734451210">this
tweet</a> from the Russian side highlights the high-definition video
characteristic of fiber optic drones. This thread discusses the
<a href="https://twitter.com/GrandpaRoy2/status/1862908038149194028">many
advantages fiber optics have over radio</a> in drone warfare. However,
replacing radio with fiber adds cost and weight, and reduces
range.<br /> <br /> The other way to prevent detection and neutralize
jamming is to remove the need for a remote pilot by having the drone
detect potential targets and select the most valuable autonomously, as
implemented for example in the UK’s “fire-and-forget”
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brimstone_(missile)#Targeting_and_sensors">Brimstone</a>
missile. Brimstone costs around $130K, over an order of magnitude more
than these Ukrainian autonomous drones. They are cheap enough to be used
in swarms, as shown in
<a href="https://x.com/banderafella/status/1851657984377598327">this
tweet’s video</a>.<br /> <br /> The US military
<a href="https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/military-review/Archives/English/Online-Exclusive/2024/Multidomain-Battlefield-AI/Multidomain-Battlefield-AI-UA.pdf">reports
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Attaching infrared and visible light sensors to unmanned systems with

performance and targeting effects regardless of illumination conditions.
The Ukrainian army is already deploying semiautonomous multirotor drones

autonomously.

Ukraine is using dozens of domestically made AI-augmented systems for
its drones to reach targets on the battlefield without being piloted, a
senior official said, disclosing new details about the race against
Russia to harness automation.<br /><br /> Systems that use artificial
intelligence allow cheap drones carrying explosives to spot or fly to
their targets in areas protected by extensive signal jamming, which has
reduced the effectiveness of manually piloted drones.<br /> …<br /> A
Ukrainian official told Reuters in July that most first person view
units’ target strike rate had fallen to 30%-50%, while for new pilots
that can be as low as 10%, and that signal jamming was the main
problem.<br /><br /> The official predicted that AI-operated first
person view drones could achieve hit rates of around 80%.

Data from the battlefield suggest that the hit rate for these AI-guided

Mr Liscovich notes that, although there are now more highly experienced
drone pilots, some with thousands of hours of flying time, the average
quality of Ukrainian personnel has fallen over time as less motivated
people are conscripted. “We can train an operator within 30 minutes and
the quality of the engagement doesn’t depend on their piloting skills,”

With feedback from use in combat, the performance of these systems is
<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">improving
rapidly</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Rudimentary object-recognition software has been in use, on both sides,
for over a year. But it is getting better. Lorenz Meier of Auterion, a
Switzerland-based firm, says that between spring and summer his firm’s
software, known as Skynode, managed to double the range at which a drone
could engage a target, from 500 metres to 1km or so. He says that
improvements in the resolution of images captured by drones have since
increased that further. <i>The Economist</i> understands that AI systems
are sometimes locking onto targets at perhaps double that distance, far
beyond the range at which basic jammers could take out the drone.
</blockquote>
The innovation cycle is
<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/12/02/how-ukraine-uses-cheap-ai-guided-drones-to-deadly-effect-against-russia">accelerating</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Mr Meier reckons that fewer than a tenth of drones are AI-guided at
present. But that number is rising. Ukraine’s innovation cycles are
relentless, with feedback loops in some cases down to a few days. The
simplicity of FPV drones, which Ukraine builds from off-the-shelf
components, can also act as a hindrance: it makes them easy to
replicate. One manufacturer says Russian reverse engineering can be as
quick as three weeks, but encryption means that the software can be
protected from copying.
</blockquote>
These autonomous systems are still vulnerable to jamming before they get
close enough for the AI to recognize the target. Some idea of the
intensity of the electronic warfare in Ukraine can be gained from
Charlie Metcalfe’s
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/12/1103833/ukraine-russia-drone-war-flash-radio-serhii-beskrestnov-social-media/"><i>Meet
the radio-obsessed civilian shaping Ukraine’s drone
defense</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Serhii “Flash” Beskrestnov hates going to the front line. The risks
terrify him. “I’m really not happy to do it at all,” he says. But to
perform his particular self-appointed role in the Russia-Ukraine war, he
believes it’s critical to exchange the relative safety of his suburban
home north of the capital for places where the prospect of death is much
more immediate. “From Kyiv,” he says, “nobody sees the real
situation.”<br /> <br /> So about once a month, he drives hundreds of
kilometers east in a homemade mobile intelligence center: a black VW van
in which stacks of radio hardware connect to an array of antennas on the
roof that stand like porcupine quills when in use. Two small devices on
the dash monitor for nearby drones. Over several days at a time, Flash
studies the skies for Russian radio transmissions and tries to learn
about the problems facing troops in the fields and in the
trenches.<br /> <br /> He is, at least in an unofficial capacity, a spy.
But unlike other spies, Flash does not keep his work secret. In fact, he
shares the results of these missions with more than 127,000
followers—including many soldiers and government officials—on several
public social media channels. Earlier this year, for instance, he
described how he had recorded five different Russian reconnaissance
drones in a single night—one of which was flying directly above his van.

and a speed of up to 220 km/h<br /> <br /> The main feature of the HX-2

provide autonomous target recognition and their destruction even with
active electronic warfare.

This is similar to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brimstone_(missile)#Targeting_and_sensors">Brimstone’s
capabilities</a> but slower, smaller, longer-ranged and much
cheaper.<br /> <br /> Again, the most important aspect of these
developments is that they greatly reduce the
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-15/above-ukraine-a-sky-full-of-drones-is-changing-the-war">cost
of precision strike </a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Ukraine’s new drones are also cheap. A kit of 10 Fire Point drones plus
a control station and transport, including three mobile trailers, costs
$580,000. That’s a fraction of the cost of military drones produced by
western arms manufacturers, though it’s still a stretch for Ukraine’s
military budget. FP says it can produce at least 500 drones per month,
but that Ukraine’s defense ministry struggles to buy a fifth of that.

<h3>
Drone Defense
</h3>
The essential feature of a successful defense against either the short-
or the longer-range drones is that it be cheaper than the attack. This
is rapidly decreasing, making cost-effective defense challenging.<br />

Over a field east of Poltava, the sound of a 4-cylinder piston engine
rumbles through the quiet of the night. A small electronic box attached
to a cell tower records the sound, identifying the audio profile of a
Geran-2 loitering munition, and transmits the data for processing.
Responding to an alert, two soldiers fire up the engine on their Nissan
pickup truck and go speeding down the road to the grid coordinates
provided. In position, they scan the horizon in the direction of the
attack. They have only a narrow window of opportunity. Tracers arc into
the sky from their old but reliable DShK, their efforts rewarded as the

Three weeks ago Gordon Lubold, Lara Seligman and Aruna Viswanatha of the
<i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported that the

Drones Swarmed a U.S. Military Base for 17 Days. Pentagon Is
Stumped</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
U.S. Air Force Gen. Mark Kelly wasn’t sure what to make of reports that
a suspicious fleet of unidentified aircraft had been flying over Langley
Air Force Base on Virginia’s shoreline.<br /> <br /> Kelly, a decorated
senior commander at the base, got on a squadron rooftop to see for
himself. He joined a handful of other officers responsible for a clutch
of the nation’s most advanced jet fighters, including F-22
Raptors.<br /> <br /> For several nights, military personnel had
reported a mysterious breach of restricted airspace over a stretch of
land that has one of the largest concentrations of national-security
facilities in the U.S. The show usually starts 45 minutes to an hour
after sunset, another senior leader told Kelly.<br /> <br /> The first
drone arrived shortly. Kelly, a career fighter pilot, estimated it was
roughly 20 feet long and flying at more than 100 miles an hour, at an
altitude of roughly 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Other drones followed, one by
one, sounding in the distance like a parade of lawn mowers.<br /> <br />
The drones headed south, across Chesapeake Bay, toward Norfolk, Va., and
over an area that includes the home base for the Navy’s SEAL Team Six
and Naval Station Norfolk, the world’s largest naval port.
</blockquote>
Given the incredible lethality of drones in Ukraine, this seems like a
problem. The <i>WSJ</i> story provided
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/mystery-drones-swarmed-a-u-s-military-base-for-17-days-the-pentagon-is-stumped/ar-AA1saqAu">more
details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Over 17 days, the drones arrived at dusk, flew off and circled back.
Some shone small lights, making them look like a constellation moving in
the night sky—or a science-fiction movie, Kelly said, “‘Close Encounters
at Langley.’” They also were nearly impossible to track, vanishing each
night despite a wealth of resources deployed to catch them.<br /> <br />
Gen. Glen VanHerck, at the time commander of the U.S. Northern Command
and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, said drones had for
years been spotted flying around defense installations. But the nightly
drone swarms over Langley, he said, were unlike any past incursion.

The swarms were clearly a

operation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
U.S. officials didn’t believe hobbyists were flying the drones, given
the complexity of the operation. The drones flew in a pattern: one or
two fixed-wing drones positioned more than 100 feet in the air and
smaller quadcopters, the size of 20-pound commercial drones, often below
and flying slower. Occasionally, they hovered.<br /> <br /> They came
from the north around 6 p.m. to traverse the base, which sits on a
peninsula at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, and continued south, beyond
the reach of radar. They repeated the pattern and then disappeared,
typically by midnight.
</blockquote>
Shaheds do sound like lawn movers, fly around 100mph, and have the
endurance to fly several circuits of Langley between 6pm and midnight.
General Kelly might have over-estimated the length; the fixed-wing
drones may have been Shahed 136 equivalents. The map shows the vast area
from which a Shahed 136-class drone attack on Langley could be
launched.<br /> <br /> In

Drone Defense: Systems

his approach</a> to drone defense:<br />
<blockquote>
“I think there’s certainly a role for fighters. There’s a role for
non-kinetic or low-collateral kinetic capabilities that would be at the
smaller end. And then I’m a big proponent for advances in directed
energy, laser and high power microwave. So those non-kinetic
capabilities that bring a kinetic result of bringing down the systems,
and I think it has to be layered in today’s today’s threat.”

Indeed, the DoD’s Palletized High Energy Laser Program has produced a
laser counter-drone system, the
<a href="https://bluehalo.com/bluehalo-locust-laser-weapon-system-delivered-to-the-palletized-high-energy-laser-p-hel-program/">BlueHalo
LOCUST Laser Weapon System</a>. The <i>WSJ</i> reported on it in
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFiDYFnlp7s">this
video</a>.<br /> <br /> One of the big problems with cheap drones is
that you need to shoot them down even more cheaply. LOCUST touts a
per-shot cost of just $3, but that isn’t the end of the story. Each
LOCUST costs $10M. “fewer than a dozen are deployed”, all overseas. Each
requires a dedicated team from BlueHalo to maintain it because there are
no stocks of spare parts. And “the Pentagon has not confirmed that a
laser has taken down a drone in combat”. It weighs 3400lb and fits in a
7’ cube. It takes “as many as 15 seconds to melt a target”.<br /> <br />
Despite the low per-shot cost, LOCUST isn’t a solution to the rash of
drone swarms. First, at a unit price of $10M plus a dedicated support
team defending the vast number of US defense assets isn’t affordable.
Second, the problem isn’t defending against a single drone, it is
defending against a swarm of cheap drones. For example, Ukraine used at
least 34 drones in their November 10<sup>th</sup>
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-drone-attack-forces-closure-two-moscow-airports-2024-11-10/">attack
on Moscow</a>. Lets guess that Locust can switch targets in 5 seconds,
and is 100% lethal in 15 seconds, it would take 11:20 to defeat the
swarm. It isn’t going to have that long, because at 100mph that is 19
miles. So even if 34 was the biggest feasible swarm (hint: it isn’t)
defending a high-value asset would need say 5 LOCUST systems at $50M
capex plus opex.<br /> <br />
<h3>
Drone Defense: Policy
</h3>
Neither the pickups with the Brownings nor the cellphones are systems
the DoD’s supply chain is interested in building. But even if systems
like LOCUST could be afforded and deployed, policies need to be
established for their use. Joseph Trevithick, Howard Altman and Tyler
Rogoway’s
<a href="https://www.twz.com/news-features/lasers-microwaves-missiles-guns-not-on-the-table-for-domestic-drone-defense"><i>Lasers,
Microwaves, Missiles, Guns Not On The Table For Domestic Drone Defense
</i></a> is a deep dive into the policy issues:<br />
<blockquote>
Even if counter-drone policies are clarified and solidified, and
authorities get expanded, there are still other concerns at play,
especially when it comes to collateral damage. Shooting something down
with a gun-based system or a surface-to-air missile carries inherent
dangers of projectiles or interceptors, or debris from them, falling
onto innocent bystanders below. The aforementioned Centurion C-RAM
<a href="https://www.twz.com/36412/centurions-roaring-whips-of-exploding-shells-are-still-engaging-rockets-over-iraqs-green-zone">fires
specialized self-destructing ammunition</a> to reduce these risks.
</blockquote>
Here, for example, is an
<a href="https://x.com/Trotes936897/status/1851738072779501911">Oerlikon
Revolver</a> in Ukraine firing
<a href="https://x.com/Trotes936897/status/1851738118396801392">air-burst
ammunition</a>. But the ammunition isn’t the only problem:<br />
<blockquote>
The drone, or what is left of it, which could include undetonated
explosive warheads or
<a href="https://www.twz.com/air/poop-filled-north-korean-balloons-descend-on-the-south-stoking-fears-of-deadlier-payloads">other
potentially hazardous payloads</a>, would also fall to Earth in an
uncontrolled manner after any such engagement.<br />
</blockquote>
The Russians frequently explain burning oil refineries and similar
mishaps on debris from successful interceptions of drones. Someone whose
house was destroyed by the 50Kg warhead of a shot-down Shahed 136 would
have reason to be upset. Deciding on a suitable counter-drone policy is
<a href="https://www.twz.com/news-features/lasers-microwaves-missiles-guns-not-on-the-table-for-domestic-drone-defense">complex</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Maybe even more importantly is that these weapons do fail and they are
packed with high explosives and traveling at high speed, which could
cause very unpredictable harm to people and property in a large
potential impact area. Then there is the idea that you have to know
exactly what you are shooting at, and that can be harder than it sounds
when dealing with strange objects in the sky, especially in populated
areas where civilian air traffic is dense. Making the call to shoot down
an object over the U.S. is an incredibly complex task that never
actually occurred until recently.

But even in war zones where the US policy is clear and permissive, it
isn’t foolproof. Stefan Becket and Kaia Hubbard reported on a January
incident at Tower 22 on the border with Syria in
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-troops-killed-jordan-american-service-members-syria/"><i>3
American service members killed and dozens injured in drone attack on
base in Jordan, U.S. says</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Three American service members were killed and dozens more were injured
in an unmanned aerial drone attack on a base in Jordan on Sunday,
President Biden and the U.S. military said.<br /> …<br /> Mr. Biden said
the attack happened at a base in northeast Jordan, a U.S. ally, close to
the border with Syria. A U.S. official said the attack occurred at an
outpost known as Tower 22, where roughly 350 U.S. Army and Air Force
personnel are deployed, according to the Department of Defense.<br />
<br /> U.S. Central Command, which oversees forces in the Middle East,
initially put the number of injured at 25, but two U.S. officials soon
said that figure had risen to more than 30. CENTCOM confirmed later
Sunday night that at least 34 had been injured. Eight of the wounded
service members had to be evacuated — some were in critical condition
but all were stable, a defense official told CBS News.
</blockquote>
How was the drone able to penetrate US defenses and kill or injure more
than 10% of the base occupants?
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/29/politics/us-soldiers-deaths-jordan/index.html"><i>Drone
that killed US soldiers in Jordan followed American drone onto base,
causing confusion</i></a> by Natasha Bertrand, Oren Liebermann and Haley
Britzky explains:<br />
<blockquote>
The drone that killed three US Army soldiers and wounded dozens more in
Jordan on Sunday approached the US military outpost, Tower 22, around
the same time an American drone was returning to the base, which led to
uncertainty over whether it was hostile and caused a delay to the US
response, two US officials told CNN.<br /> <br /> The enemy drone
followed the American drone as it approached, but it is not clear
whether the enemy drone intentionally followed the American one or if it
was a coincidence, one of the officials said.
</blockquote>
These problems don’t go away if the counter-drone technology is
electronic. Confusing the drone’s navigation with GPS spoofing or
detaching an FPV drone from its pilot using a jammer may prevent it
reaching its target but it doesn’t render it harmless to innocent
bystanders.<br />
<h3>
The Threat
</h3>
One notable feature of the war in Ukraine is Russia’s sustained campaign
against Ukraine’s electric grid, which has caused major difficulties
especially in the winter. On November 26<sup>th</sup>
<a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1861396932658115043">Volodymyr
Zelenskyy tweeted</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Last night, Russia attacked Ukraine, launching a record number of strike
drones—188—against our people. I want to thank our defenders of the sky
for repelling the attack. Around 80 drones were shot down, and more than
90 were lost due to location disruption.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately,
there has been damage to our critical infrastructure, and the situation
in Ternopil remains challenging. All services and repair crews are
on-site, doing everything to assist people and restore electricity as
quickly as possible.
</blockquote>
A mysterious feature has been Ukraine’s reluctance to attack Russia’s
electric grid, especially since their economy and military are
completely dependent upon freight trains hauled by electric locomotives.
This may have been part of the US’ “escalation management”.<br /> <br />
If whoever is behind the drone incursions in the West decides to switch
from reconnaissance to strike, they are likely to follow the Russian
example and strike the grid by attacking the transformers.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalf_sniper_attack">US
transformers have already been shot</a> and damaged by unknown
attackers, presumably right-wing militia. FPV drones would cause far
more than the $15M damage in that attack. Large grid transformers are
expensive, long lead-time items, completely defenseless against drone
attack. A coordinated attack on a number of them would have a major,
long-lasting impact on the US grid, similar to a major
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/07/coronal-mass-ejections.html">coronal
mass ejection</a>.<br />
<h2>
The Future
</h2>
The cost of precision strike, both at short and longer ranges, has been
reduced by at least an order of magnitude and likely much more. Further
reductions are very likely. Typically, when the cost of something is
greatly reduced, you get a lot more of it. What is likely to be the
effect of greatly increasing the supply of precision strike?<br />
<br /> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09592318.2024.2319216"><i>The
impact of precision strike technology on the warfare of non-state armed
groups: case studies on Daesh and the Houthis</i></a> by Max Mutschler,
Marius Bales and Esther Meininghaus examines one effect that has already
happened:<br />
<blockquote>
Precision strikes from a distance are a common practice of state
warfare. However, the global proliferation of precision strike
technologies, like missiles and armed drones, makes such weapons
progressively available to non-state armed groups (NSAGs). We look at
Daesh in Syria and Iraq and at the Houthis in Yemen as two case studies
to analyse the consequences of this proliferation for non-state warfare.
</blockquote>
The Houthis, with help from Iran, have used precision strike systems
much more sophisticated than the ones I deal with here to cause a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis">major disruption
to world trade</a>, and to cause Western nations to expend vastly more
expensive systems in a futile attempt to stop them.<br /> <br /> The war
in Ukraine spawned
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/13/nx-s1-5147284/ukraine-drones-russia-war#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20more%20than%20200%20drone,Literally%20made%20in%20the%20kitchen.%E2%80%9D">hundreds
of new drone manufacturers</a>. This incredibly competitive market has
driven costs down to a point where groups with far less funding than the
drug cartels, and even individuals, can acquire precision strike
capabilities. In the US civilian use of drones is currently regulated by
the FAA. Drones are required to be registered and the areas where they
are permitted to fly are restricted. They are not regarded as weapons,
but what does the 2<sup>nd</sup> Amendment say about drones if they are
regarded as weapons?<br /> <br /> Many of the same policy issues arise
when it comes to individuals defending themselves against drone attacks.
Electronic defenses such as jamming and GPS spoofing are illegal.
“Kinetic” defenses such as shotguns are legal in some cases, but
restricted by the risks to bystanders. Passive defenses such as “cope
cages” on vehicles would be illegal under safety regulations, and on
houses by planning regulations.<br /> <br /> Potential future
technological developments may greatly increase the difficulty of
defending against drone attacks by making it impossible to interfere
with their navigation. Current high-end cruise missiles such as
Ukraine’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-360_Neptune">R360-Neptune</a>
use inertial navigation, but because it drifts over time it requires
regular updates from GPS to maintain accuracy. This is similar to the
navigation systems in commercial aircraft. These systems are too large
and expensive for drones.<br /> <br />

<a href="https://scitechdaily.com/revolutionary-quantum-compass-could-soon-make-gps-free-navigation-a-reality/"><i>Revolutionary
Quantum Compass Could Soon Make GPS-Free Navigation a Reality</i></a>
dramatic increases in accuracy and reductions in cost and size for
inertial navigation are on the way:<br />
<blockquote>
Now, scientists are attempting to make a motion sensor so precise it
could minimize the nation’s reliance on global positioning satellites.
Until recently, such a sensor — a thousand times more sensitive than
today’s navigation-grade devices — would have filled a moving truck. But
advancements are dramatically shrinking the size and cost of this
technology.<br /> <br /> For the first time, researchers from Sandia
National Laboratories have used silicon photonic microchip components to
perform a quantum sensing technique called atom interferometry, an
ultra-precise way of measuring acceleration.<br /> …<br /> Besides size,
cost has been a major obstacle to deploying quantum navigation devices.
Every atom interferometer needs a laser system, and laser systems need
modulators.<br /> <br /> “Just one full-size single-sideband modulator,
a commercially available one, is more than $10,000,” Lee said.<br />
<br /> Miniaturizing bulky, expensive components into silicon photonic
chips helps drive down these costs.<br /> <br /> “We can make hundreds
of modulators on a single 8-inch wafer and even more on a 12-inch
wafer,” Kodigala said.

immune from prosecution. Does anyone really think

Are Coming for Democracy—but It’s Not All Bad</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, updated: 2024-11-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
In 2025, AI is poised to
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-global-elections/">change
every aspect of democratic politics</a>—but it won’t necessarily be for
the worse.
</p>
<p>
India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has used AI to translate his
speeches for his multilingual electorate in real time, demonstrating how
AI can help diverse democracies to be more inclusive. AI avatars were
used by presidential candidates in South Korea in electioneering,
enabling them to provide answers to thousands of voters’ questions
simultaneously. We are also starting to see
<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/generative-ai-political-advertising">AI
tools</a> aid fundraising and get-out-the-vote efforts. AI techniques
are starting to augment more traditional polling methods, helping
campaigns get cheaper and faster data. And congressional candidates have
started using AI robocallers to engage voters on issues. In 2025, these
trends will continue. AI doesn’t need to be superior to human experts to
augment the labor of an overworked canvasser, or to write ad copy
similar to that of a junior campaign staffer or volunteer. Politics is
competitive, and any technology that can bestow an advantage, or even
just garner attention, will be used…

to people who know how to write a bug report, how to find and read the

clearly what went wrong. This the hardest part of getting a product fit

<p>I’m using the term “RSS-based podcasts” in place of “podcasts” to
make sure whoever reads it knows to ask the question of other
“podcasts,” are you RSS-based? The best answer is to encourage YouTube
et al to just connect their “podcasts” to RSS and everyone’s happy. Like
“organic cheeseburgers.” :-)</p>

way to help <i>RSS-based podcasts</i> is to promote individual episodes
from the past. Sometimes shows are done, but the archive contains good
stuff. Not everything is based on current events. Music, art, history
for example. Also bring the feed out from hiding. At least the nerdy
people should understand how this stuff works. One of the big crimes was
when the browser makers tried to hide the feeds. I like to be able to
lift the hood even if I don’t understand what I’m looking at.</p>

I remember when the first wave of 3D printers morphed into consumer

within reach of mere mortals. But I remember them as extremely finicky,
where you had to print out half the parts to make the rest of it once

<p>For the record, Bluesky has completely taken over from Threads.
Threads is basically at zero, needs something to shake it up. Obviously
this could be different for everyone. And engagement on Twitter is
pretty close to zero. I still check there periodically because despite
what people say a lot of people I follow still post there. And I do too,
since cross-posting costs me nothing. And it has been pointed out that
deleting your Twitter account comes with a fairly huge risk. And if you
do it, I wouldn’t announce it, because anyone apparently can claim your
account once it is completely deactivated. And that could create some
problems for you. Probably better to hold the account indefinitely.</p>

<p>Welcome to the last month of
<a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> in the year 2024.
Each year goes by faster and faster. And as we move forward in time,
there’s less room in front of us on the runway of life, and more behind
us. At some point in the next decade my plane will probably take off. I
feel a sense of urgency about getting it done. Still a fair amount on my
todo list, but I’m making progress. As someone once said many times:
Still diggin!</p>

<p>Cas Mudde, a political scientist who specializes in extremism and
democracy, observed yesterday on Bluesky that “the fight against the far
right is secondary to the fight to strengthen liberal democracy.” That’s
a smart observation.</p>
