<p>date: 2024-04-26, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>NASA is working to resume science operations of the agency’s Hubble
Space Telescope after it entered safe mode April 23 due to an ongoing
gyroscope (gyro) issue. Hubble’s instruments are stable, and the
telescope is in good health. The telescope automatically entered safe
mode when one of its three gyroscopes gave faulty readings. The gyros

<p>date: 2024-04-26, from: Status-Q blog</p>
<p>I’m fond of both milk and dark chocolate. Milk chocolate is yummy
kiddy comfort food. Dark chocolate is more sophisticated, more bitter,
more ‘adult’. It’s also less likely to melt at inconvenient times, so
helping you preserve that more sophisticated appearance. But the
problem, I find, is that dark chocolate often has too little taste.

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
Hi, my name is Veronique, and I’m an artist, writer, and zine maker. I
live in Toronto with my dog, Muskoka. I love making zines and
championing small-press indie writers. I enjoy discovering new artists,
going for trail hikes with my doggo, making art while listening to
tunes, daydreaming, exchanging emails as personal letters, and
discovering new personal blogs. Lately, I’ve been teaching myself how to
play my late father’s guitar.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I started my blog in August 2022, after stumbling upon a few personal
sites. I became enchanted by these quiet spaces away from social media.
One blog in particular, <em>TMO</em> (no longer active), inspired me to
start writing. His vulnerable, daily slice-of-life posts immediately
catapulted me into wanting to document my life through blogging.
</p>
<p>
My search for a simple writing platform took some time, but eventually,
I came across <a href="https://bearblog.dev"><em>Bearblog</em></a>,
which won me over with its simplicity. I’m not tech-savvy, so the fewer
bells and whistles a platform has, the more I can concentrate on what
matters—writing.
</p>
<p>
My dad fell ill in the fall of 2022, and writing on my blog became a
lifeline. Writing online created a cocooned arena for exploring my
wayward thoughts and feelings and forged an invisible string, tying me
to far-flung strangers across the web. Blogging felt like a refuge and
reminded me that we’re all sharing this bumpy, precarious timeline
together.
</p>
<p>
I read once that you should write your obsessions. Not only for yourself
but also to find your <em>kind</em>. Being an introvert, this sentiment
really resonated with me. Connecting through personal blogs can
sometimes feel deeper than in-person interactions. Since writing on my
blog, I’ve met the most wonderful internet denizens who have morphed
into veritable email comrades—and I love it.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
My posts are primarily short-form and meant to be a catch-all container
for ideas and preserving fragments of ordinary moments. I prefer to
write in spontaneous, off-the-cuff spurts. Thoughts, ideas, and links to
things I want to share are written in my phone notes app or the myriad
unfinished journals around my apartment.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been fond of writing posts in bullet form lately. It’s a quick way
to record passing thoughts and share pictures, ideas, and quotes I like.
I feel like personal blogs are in constant flux and unpolished by
nature, which appeals to me.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also, do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I like to write first thing in the morning before I’m swayed emotionally
by other people’s output.
</p>
<p>
I’ve romanticized having an old wooden “writers’ desk” in the corner of
my living room, but I have a sneaking suspicion I’d still end up on the
couch, scrunched up with horrible posture with my laptop over my legs.
</p>
<p>
I like to blog on my phone when I’m out and about—busy pubs, cafes, or
on the bus. Plunking myself in new places sharpens my observational
rolodex and removes me from my regular inner dialogue.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
My setup is minimal. I write on my MacBook Air M2 laptop and iPhone 15
Pro phone. Bearblog hosts my blog, and my domain name is registered with
GoDaddy. C’est tout!
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I haven’t been blogging long, but I wish I was more versed in HTML and
CSS. I’ve spent countless hours combing the net for tips on how best to
tinker with my site. I enjoy it, though, as it feels like solving a
mini-puzzle.
</p>
<p>
The other thing would be allowing people to subscribe to my blog with
their email. I need to remedy that asap.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetizing personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
For now, Bearblog is $20 a year, and it costs me about $35 to renew my
domain.
</p>
<p>
Monetizing a blog feels like a touchy subject, and a lot of people are
put off by paying someone for online writing. Newsletter fatigue is
real, and being hit with member fees in every nook and cranny on the net
is rampant.
</p>
<p>
But from a creative perspective, people still have to pay rent, and
people still need to eat.
</p>
<p>
Artists, writers, and makers should and <em>can</em> make a living doing
what they love.
</p>
<p>
I’m a huge proponent of supporting artists for their work. I allocate
about $20 a month to support my favorites through platforms like
Patreon, BMAC, Ko-Fi, independent newsletters, and one-off coffees.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to make a living from writing on my blog. Is this realistic,
especially without ads, trackers, sponsored posts, or paywalls? I don’t
know, but I spend a lot of time thinking about how to make it work. I
keep trying different things and am not afraid to pivot if something
isn’t working. It’s tough, but it’s something I love working towards.
</p>
<p>
The idea of making money from my writing still feels uncomfortable
sometimes. There’s a touch of imposter syndrome, low self-esteem, and
not feeling in league with the high-caliber writers of Substack, etc,
but I keep pushing through. However, money aside, writing and sharing
things on my blog is something I deeply cherish and will continue doing
regardless of monetary gain.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
There are so many blog gems I love! Here’s a few favs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://anhvn.com/">Anh’s</a> website is so fun and whimsical.
I’m in awe of her site’s aesthetic and how she incorporates her
illustrations to further express herself.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://lili.bearblog.dev">Lili’s Musings</a>. Uncut,
thought-provoking writing. Themes include diary-like entries, thoughts
on academia, unraveling the writing process, trans struggles, and
processing anxieties.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://dahlstrand.net/2024/03/14/this-is-a.html">Sven
Dahlstrand</a>. A cool human being with a really fun blog who’s always
linking to interesting things.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://rusi.me">Growing Old With You</a>. Ru’s blog is a
tapestry of poignant writing and laid-bare slices of life, and I admire
her vulnerability on the page.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://thewallflowerdigest.co.uk">The Wallflower Digest</a>
Alice’s blog is new to me, and I’m having so much fun devouring her
writing. She’s a book-loving introvert who grapples with social anxiety
(like me!), and her writing topics and hobbies are wide and varied.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Lili</em> and <em>Anh</em> would both be great guests for your next
interview!
</p>

id="corporate-greed-from-apple-and-google-have-destroyed-the-passkey-future">Corporate
greed from Apple and Google have destroyed the passkey future</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>William Brown, developer of webauthn-rs, has written a scathing blog
post detailing how corporate interests – namely, Apple and Google – have
completely and utterly destroyed the concept of passkeys. The basic gist
is that Apple and Google were more interested in control and locking in
users than in providing a user-friendly passwordless future, and in
doing so have made passkeys effectively a worse user experience than
just using passwords in a password manager. Since then Passkeys are now
seen as a way to capture users and audiences into a platform. What
better way to encourage long term entrapment of users then by locking
all their credentials into your platform, and even better, credentials
that can’t be extracted or exported in any capacity. Both Chrome and
Safari will try to force you into using either hybrid (caBLE) where you
scan a QR code with your phone to authenticate – you have to click
through menus to use a security key. caBLE is not even a good
experience, taking more than 60 seconds work in most cases. The UI is
beyond obnoxious at this point. Sometimes I think the password game has
a better ux. The more egregious offender is Android, which won’t even
activate your security key if the website sends the set of options that
are needed for Passkeys. This means the IDP gets to choose what device
you enroll without your input. And of course, all the developer examples
only show you the options to activate “Google Passkeys stored in Google
Password Manager”. After all, why would you want to use anything else? ↫
William Brown The whole post is a sobering read of how a dream of
passwordless, and even usernameless, authentication was right within our
grasp, usable by everyone, until Apple and Google got involved and
enshittified the standards and tools to promote lock-in and their own
interests above the user experience. If even someone as knowledgeable
about this subject as Brown, who writes actual software to make these
things work, is advising against using passkeys, you know something’s
gone horribly wrong. I also looked into possibly using passkeys,
including using things like a Yubikey, but the process seems so complex
and unpleasant that I, too, concluded just sticking to Bitwarden and my
favourite open source TFA application was a far superior user
experience.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Gentoo, the venerable Linux distribution which in my headcanon I
describe as ‘classy’, has banned any use of “AI”. A proposal by Gentoo
Council member Michał Górny from February of this year banning its use
has been unanimously accepted by the Gentoo Council. The new policy
reads: It is expressly forbidden to contribute to Gentoo any content
that has been created with the assistance of Natural Language Processing
artificial intelligence tools. This motion can be revisited, should a
case been made over such a tool that does not pose copyright, ethical
and quality concerns. ↫ Michał Górny We’ll have to see how this policy
will be implemented, but I like that Gentoo is willing to take a
stand.</p>

<h2 id="cloudnativepg-1.23.0-1.22.3-and-1.21.5-released">CloudNativePG
1.23.0, 1.22.3 and 1.21.5 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-26, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is excited to announce the
release of version 1.23.0 of the <strong>CloudNativePG
Operator</strong>!
</p>
<p>
This release brings a host of new features and enhancements, including
support for PostgreSQL image catalogs, synchronization of user-defined
replication slots, and Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) configuration.
</p>
<p>
We’ve revised our Community support to enhance our focus and optimize
resources. The supported versions will be the last minor, plus the
previous minor, which will be supported for three months once the new
minor is out. This is in effect adding two more months of support to the
outgoing minor over what we used to have.
</p>
<h2>
What’s New in 1.23
</h2>
<h3>
PostgreSQL Image Catalogs
</h3>
<p>
Say goodbye to PostgreSQL version management headaches! With image
catalogs based on major versions, managing your database fleet has never
been easier. Simply request the PostgreSQL major version you need and
control how your databases stay up-to-date. We’ve introduced two new
resources (<code>ClusterImageCatalog</code> and
<code>ImageCatalog</code>) and a new stanza
(<code>spec.imageCatalogRef</code>), setting the stage for simpler
management of default images. The Community will provide catalogs, and
you could also use third-party ones, or even build your own.
</p>
<h3>
Synchronization of User-Defined Replication Slots
</h3>
<p>
Ensure seamless failover with extended physical replication slot
synchronization, now covering persistence of user-defined slots after
failover.
</p>
<h3>
Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) Configuration
</h3>
<p>
Customize PDB settings with the new <code>.spec.enablePDB</code> field.
Disable PDBs on primary instances for single-instance deployments,
ensuring smooth pod eviction during maintenance operations. This marks
our first step towards deprecating the node maintenance window feature.
</p>
<h2>
Upgrade and Maintenance
</h2>
<p>
Before upgrading, carefully review the
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/installation_upgrade/#upgrading-to-1230-1223-or-1215">detailed
instructions</a>. New patch releases are now available for all supported
versions, including 1.22.3 and 1.21.5.
</p>
<p>
We recommend upgrading to CloudNativePG 1.23.0 at your earliest
convenience. Alternatively, update to the latest patch version within
your current minor release.
</p>
<h2>
End of Life Announcement
</h2>
<p>
With the release of 1.23.0, the 1.21.x minor version will reach its
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.23/supported_releases/#support-status-of-cloudnativepg-releases">end
of life</a> on May 24, 2024. Plan your upgrade to ensure continued
support and security.

id="this-years-call-for-expressions-of-interest-to-join-our-board">This
year’s call for expressions of interest to join our board</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-26, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
The Crossref Nominating Committee is inviting expressions of interest to
join the Board of Directors of Crossref for the term starting in January
2025. The committee will gather responses from those interested and
create the slate of candidates that our membership will vote on in an
election in September.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Expressions of interest will be due Monday, May 27th,
2024</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is an exciting time to join the board, as we have a number of
active projects underway: We are considering resourcing Crossref for a
sustainable future and board members will be part of deciding any
changes to our fees scheme and overseeing its implementation. We’re
focusing on how our community and metadata can contribute to ensuring
the integrity of the scholarly record. We’re broadening our metadata
record to capture richer funding and institutional affiliations. We’re
working towards a future where the scholarly record prioritizes
relationships between research outputs to build a holistic research
nexus. The board helps guide this work.
</p>
<h3 id="about-the-board-elections">
About the board elections
</h3>
<p>
The board is elected through the “one member, one vote” policy wherein
every member organization of Crossref has a single vote to elect
representatives to the Crossref board. Board terms are for three years,
and this year, there are four seats open for election.
</p>
<p>
The board maintains a balance of seats, with eight seats for smaller
members and eight seats for larger members (based on total revenue to
Crossref). This is an effort to ensure that the scholarly community’s
diversity of experiences and perspectives is represented in decisions
made at Crossref.
</p>
<p>
This year, we will elect two of the larger member seats (membership
tiers $3,900 and above) and two of the smaller member seats (membership
tiers $1,650 and below). You don’t need to specify which seat you are
applying for; we will provide that information to the nominating
committee.
</p>
<p>
The online election will open in September, with results announced at
the annual meeting on October 29th, 2024. New members will begin their
term in January 2025.
</p>
<h3 id="about-the-nominating-committee">
About the Nominating Committee
</h3>
<p>
The Nominating Committee reviews the expressions of interest and selects
a slate of candidates for election. The slate put forward will exceed
the total number of open seats. The committee considers the statements
of interest, organizational size, geography, and experience.

What is the committee looking for this year
</h3>
<p>
The committee looks for skills and experience that will complement the
rest of the board. Candidates from countries and regions not currently
reflected on the board are strongly encouraged to apply. Successful
candidates often have some or all of these characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Demonstrate a commitment to or understanding of our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/strategy/" target="_blank">strategic
agenda</a> or the
<a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank">Principles
of Open Scholarly Infrastructure</a>;
</li>
<li>
Have expertise that may be underrepresented on the board currently;
</li>
<li>
Hold senior/director-level positions in their organizations;
</li>
<li>
Have experience with governance or community involvement;
</li>
<li>
Represent member organizations that are active in the scholarly
communications ecosystem;
</li>
<li>
Demonstrate metadata best practices as shown in the member’s
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/members/prep/" target="_blank">participation
report</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The board is also encouraging Crossref members who are research funders
to apply.
</p>
<h3 id="board-roles-and-responsibilities">
Board roles and responsibilities
</h3>
<p>
Crossref’s services provide a central infrastructure for scholarly
communications. Crossref’s board helps shape the future of our services
and by extension, impacts the broader scholarly ecosystem. We are
looking for board members to contribute their experience and
perspective.
</p>
<p>
The role of the board at Crossref is to provide strategic and financial
oversight of the organization, as well as guidance to the Executive
Director and the staff leadership team, with the key responsibilities
being:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Setting the strategic direction for the organization;
</li>
<li>
Providing financial oversight; and
</li>
<li>
Approving new policies and services.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The board is representative of our membership base and guides the staff
leadership team on trends affecting scholarly communications. The board
sets strategic directions for the organization while also providing
oversight into policy changes and implementation. Board members have a
fiduciary responsibility to ensure sound operations. They do this by
attending board meetings as well as joining more specific board
committees.
</p>
<h3 id="who-can-apply-to-join-the-board">
Who can apply to join the board?
</h3>
<p>
Any active member of Crossref can apply to join the board. Crossref
membership is open to organizations that produce content, such as
academic presses, commercial publishers, standards organizations, and
research funders.
</p>
<h3 id="what-is-expected-of-board-members">
What is expected of board members?
</h3>
<p>
Board members attend four meetings each year that typically take place
in January, March, July, and November. Meetings have taken place in a
variety of international locations and travel support is provided when
needed. January, March, and November board meetings are held virtually,
and all committee meetings take place virtually. Each board member
should sit on at least one Crossref committee. Care is taken to
accommodate the wide range of time zones in which our board members
live.
</p>
<p>
While the expressions of interest are specific to an individual, the
seat that is elected to the board belongs to the member organization.
The primary board member also names an alternate who may attend meetings
in the event that the primary board member is unable to. There is no
personal financial obligation to sit on the board. The member
organization must remain in good standing.
</p>
<p>
Board members are expected to be comfortable assuming the
responsibilities listed above and to prepare and participate in board
meeting discussions.

<p>date: 2024-04-25, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>

Matt Haughey wrote
<a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/a-blueprint-of-my-dream-blogging-cms/">a
blueprint for his “Dream CMS”</a> and
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/612/">we had him on ShopTalk</a> to
talk about it. That got me thinking about what features I’d want in
<em>my</em> dream CMS. It’s fun to think of what a modern CMS might have
like inline editing, asset serving, monetization/membership
functionality, and more imaginative comment moderation.
</p>
<p>
Most of my dream CMS features center around improving my writing and
content surfacing. All these ideas seem like a pretty good fit for LLMs
or AI, even though I don’t drink from that particular well often.
</p>
<h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>On-the-fly fact-checking
</h2>
<p>
As
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/03/lies-damned-lies-and-stochastics/">I
think more about verifying outputs</a>, I’d love a feedback tool that
did a quick fact check before I hit publish. Did I not cite a source?
Did I make a false assertion that ruins the credibility of the whole
post? Did I not consider some perspective I should have? Am I just
bitching and moaning? CMS, help me, please! I’m making an idiot out of
myself.
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Auto-tagging
</h2>
<p>
I write a lot of posts but I’m shit at tagging them. I wish I could tell
my CMS “Hey, here’s a general list of topics I write about, please
recommend tags before I hit publish.” Then I think it’d be cool if the
little robot butler could crawl old posts suggest tags for those or find
themes emanating from my subconscious that I hadn’t picked up on.
</p>
<aside>
<p>
Sideblog: IMHO, tag templates are an underserved part of web design and
it’s my goal to give all my tag pages the full blow-out treatment like I
started to do with my
<a href="https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck">vibechecks</a>.
</p>
</aside>
<h2>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Topic bundling
</h2>
<p>
À la auto-tagging, it would be neat if a CMS observed my content at a
high-level and suggested opportunities to bundle posts of a similar
theme into an online “zine” to offer new topic-based entry points for
new readers. My lists of reverse chronological posts are thematically
scattershot and I think some readers might find this more useful.
</p>
<p>
This idea gets into listicle territory pretty quick, but I often pull on
thought threads over the course of months or years but that is entirely
unsurfaced on my blog. I’d also love it if the machine could bundle
links I share on my Mastodon feed to pull in other perspectives as well.
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Idea validation
</h2>
<p>
I’d love to know what content is outperforming other content. I’m sure I
could piece this together myself with a half-dozen spreadsheets from
Google Analytics, but I’d love to log into my CMS and know “Your CSS
posts tend to have 10x engagement over your longform thoughtvomit” or
“Your shitposts are driving traffic but are negatively impacting the
quality of your site”. I don’t play the engagement game much but I’d
love some data-driven validation nudging me in a positive direction when
I’m discouraged, perhaps it could even suggest a handful of topics.
</p>
<p>
There’s a gross content farm machine version of this idea that

<h2 id="ubuntu-24.04-lts-released">Ubuntu 24.04 LTS released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>It wasn’t too long ago that new Ubuntu releases were major happenings
in the Linux world, as it was the default Linux distribution for many,
both old and newcomers, in the desktop Linux space. These days, Ubuntu
release hit a little different, with Canonical’s focus having shifted
much more to the enterprise, and several aspects of the distribution
being decidedly unpopular, like the snap package management system.
Still, Ubuntu is probably still one of the most popular, if not the most
popular, distributions out there, so any new release, like today’s
Ubuntu 24.0 LTS, is still a big deal. Ubuntu Desktop brings the
Subiquity installer to an LTS for the first time. In addition to a
refreshed user experience and a minimal install by default, the
installer now includes experimental support for ZFS and TPM-based full
disk encryption and the ability to import auto-install configurations.
Post install, users will be greeted with the latest GNOME 46 alongside a
new App Center and firmware-updater. Netplan is now the default for
networking configuration and supports bidirectionality with
NetworkManager. ↫ Utkarsh Gupta on ubuntu-announce Of course, all the
various other Ubuntu editions have also seen new releases: Edubuntu,
Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu Cinnamon, Ubuntu Kylin, Ubuntu
MATE, Ubuntu Studio, Ubuntu Unity, and Xubuntu. Yes, that’s a long list.
They all mostly share the same improvements as Ubuntu’s main course, but
paired with the latest versions of the respective desktop environments
instead. Except for Kubuntu. Unlike just about any other major
distribution released over the last few months, such as Fedora 40 only a
few days ago, Kubuntu does not ship with the new KDE Plasma 6, opting
for Plasma 5.27.11 instead. There simply wasn’t enough time between the
release of Plasma 6 and the Ubuntu feature freeze, so they made the – in
my opinion – understandable call to stick to Plasma 5 for now, moving
Plasma 6 to the next release later this year.</p>

<h2 id="too-little-and-too-much-self-promotion">Too little, and too
much, self-promotion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-25, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Self-promotion is a weird subject. It’s one of those things that is strictly tied to who you are as a person. I am, broadly speaking, a shy and reserved person. I don’t like to be in the spotlight, I don’t like to draw attention to myself. I also really care about other people&#39;s space and time, which is why I’ve always been incredibly conservative when it comes to promoting things I do online.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Every time I need to do something that is marketing-related, I can feel
the tension in my brain as if a part of me is trying to fight against
it. And this is for the most benign things. I’ll give you an example. I
recently edited all P&amp;B interviews and added a line at the end of
the intro that reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you’re enjoying the People and Blogs series and you want to see it
grow, consider supporting on Ko-Fi.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A line of text and a link. The reason why I did that is because the only
place where Ko-Fi was mentioned was way at the of each interview and I
thought that most people probably stop reading when they reach the end
of the interview. And so I added that single line. But adding that
single line was a struggle. Because in my head, it’s obvious that if you
do enjoy something and are willing to support it, you’d probably go look
for a way to do it. That’s how my brain works. But unfortunately, that’s
not how the internet works. Apparently, the correct approach seems to be
the opposite one. You have to constantly remind people to like and
subscribe, to support, to contribute, and to share.
</p>
<p>
How much self-promotion is too much? Substack interrupting your reading
experience to remind you to subscribe feels too much to me. An overlay
interrupting your browsing to ask you to subscribe to a newsletter is
also too much. Am I wrong? Am I crazy in thinking it’s too much?
</p>
<p>
Also, is promoting something I’m doing any different than advertising? I
know it’s conceptually not the same thing but for you, on the other side
of this, is it any different? So many questions. It’s goddamn hard to do
“marketing” with integrity.

don’t think conversation on the web has been the big benefit some people
think. Do you remember when you first realized that people weren’t
talking to you in a response to your post, they were talking over your
shoulder to the people who read your post. I guess it depends on who you
are, but I don’t see any value in providing a surface for spam. These
days I block people without much thought if I think that’s what they’re
doing. So, why should you design a protocol, and pay the cost of
supporting, something that is a vector for spam and abuse? That’s the
argument in favor of using

(Reykjavík-ish). Using capacitive textiles and pressure sensitive layers
the exhibit lets visitors touch the land and create earthquakes at their

only viable Android and iOS competitor intends to leave China and go
global</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Huawei plans to expand its native HarmonyOS smartphone platform
worldwide, despite coming under US-led sanctions that have deprived it
of access to key technologies. The Chinese tech megacorp released its
own phone platform in 2019, the same year that US sanctions blocked
Huawei from having further access to Google’s Android software to power
its devices. More recently, the company saw its Mate 60 Pro smartphone
become the top selling device in China’s huge consumer market,
displacing rivals such as Apple’s iPhone. It also has a newer device,
the Pura 70, that could pose a bigger threat to Apple sales in the
country. ↫ Dan Robinson at The Register If there is one company that has
the capabilities and will to truly offer a third alternative, it’s
Huawei with HarmonyOS. This company has the full might of the Chinese
state behind it, and it clearly has the drive to prove itself after the
various sanctions levied against it in recent years that barred it from
using Google’s Android. It’s obviously already experiencing major
success in its home market, but now the company intends to go global,
country by country, to positino HarmonyOS alongside iOS and Android.
Huawei basically takes a brute-force approach, explaining that they
identify the 5000 most popular applications, which they claim cover 99%
of users’ time with their smartphones, and port those over first. I’m
not entirely sure how they convince developers to port over their
applications, but I’m guessing money is involved. Fair play, I would say
– it’s not like anything else is going to break the stranglehold Apple
and Google have over the mobile application market. We haven’t really
spent much time talking about HarmonyOS in the west in general, and on
OSNews in particular, which is a bit of a shame because it has some
interesting characteristics. For instance, it has a multi-kernel design,
where it uses the Linux kernel on more powerful devices like smartphones
and tablets, and the RTOS LiteOS kernel on lower power IoT devices.
DSoftBus is another interesting part of the operating system, which
allows multiple devices to kind of join together and share data,
applications, and control seamlessly. HarmonyOS supports both Android
and true HarmonyOS applications, the latter of which are marked with a
little logo in the corner of the application icon, but the unique
features of HarmonyOS, like DSoftBus, are only accessible to true
HarmonyOS applications. Developing these native applications can be done
in DevEco Studio, which is built atop IntelliJ IDEA, using ArkUI. Huawei
even went so far as to develop its own browser engine for HarmonyOS,
which it recently released as open source, called ArkWeb. While
HarmonyOS currently still supports running Android applications, this
will soon no longer be the case as the company is working on HarmonyOS
NEXT, which will remove Android compatibility to focus entirely on true
HarmonyOS applications instead. NEXT also does away entirely with the
multikernel approach, ditching both the Linux and LiteOS kernels for a
new HarmonyOS microkernel, and uses Huawei’s own Cangjie programming
language for application development. HarmonyOS NEXT is currently being
tested on a variety of Huawei devices, with a beta and final release
planned for later this year. It’s just our luck that the only
potentially viable competitor to Android and iOS is a party
closed-source operating system from China, which will surely bring with
it a whole host of security concerns in the west. It’s really difficult
at the moment to ascertain just how much of HarmonyOS – and
specifically, HarmonyOS NEXT – is available as open source, which is a
major bummer. I don’t think I’d ever want to use a (partly) closed
source Chinese operating system for anything major in my life, but if
it’s open source we could at least see non-Chinese forks that I’d find
easier to trust. The road of iOS and Android competitors is littered
with the bodies of failed attempts – Symbian, the various iterations of
Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Sailfish, Ubuntu Touch, the GNOME/Plasma
attempts that just can’t grow beyond proof of concepts – and there is no
way to know if Huawei can pull off outside of China what it did with
HarmonyOS inside China. Western markets are incredibly weary of anything
related to Huawei, and for all we know, this operating system won’t ever
even be allowed inside the US and the EU in the first place. Regardless
of international politics and the CCP’s brutal, totalitarian, genocidal
regime, HarmonyOS NEXT seems like a very interesting platform with fresh
ideas, and I’d love to at least try it out once it hits international
markets with proper localisation into English. I’ll take a problematic
Chinese smartphone operating system competitor over no competitor at all
– even if I won’t use it myself, it’ll be at least some form of
competition both Apple and Google desperately need.</p>

that ran it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>But just as smartphones would do, PDAs offered a dizzying array of
operating systems and applications, and a great many of them ran Palm
OS. (I bought my first Palm, an m505, new in 2001, upgrading from an HP
95LX.) Naturally, there’s no way we could enumerate every single such
device in this article. So in this Ars retrospective, we’ll look back at
some notable examples of the technical evolution of the Palm operating
system and the devices that ran it—and how they paved the way for what
we use now. ↫ Cameron Kaiser at Ars Technica This sure takes me back to
my own in-depth Palm retrospective from – checks notes – 11 years ago
(!). It turns out all the images from that article no longer load, so I
should set aside some time to fix that up.</p>

2024-04-24 Micro-blogs
</h1>
<p>
Recently, I jokingly replied to
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@jameschip" title="@jameschip@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jameschip">@jameschip</span></a> when he
said “maybe we need a new word for types of blogs that have comments and
federation” that we should have kept the word micro-blogs. Regular
blogs, with a character limit.
</p>
<p>
Then again, micro-blogs in that sense, from Identi.ca to GNU Social,
Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and the Fediverse now have a big plus:
Notification actually works. If you mention another account, they get
notified. If you get a reply, you get notified. It’s glorious.
</p>
<p>
For regular blogs, notification works with the oldest, universal,
federated, communication medium online: email. Conversely, if you don’t
have email or don’t do, you don’t get notified and most likely you can’t
even comment. 😐
</p>
<p>
I tried web-mentions and they didn’t work I wanted them to. Far too few
other blogs supported them, and for this blog, I didn’t know what to do
with them. I didn’t want to send myself email so I turned them into
comments, but mentions aren’t as strong a signal as a comment. Mentions
aren’t public but comments are. Mentions don’t need a strong connection
to the main article but comments do. By turning mentions into comments,
I had made a mistake and the result was frustrating. So
<a href="2023-09-20-web-mentions-vs-referrals">I got rid of them</a>.
</p>
<p>
And so here we are, it’s 2024, and blogs still don’t have good
(spam-free) comments and notifications where as micro-blogs do. 😢

a related blog post, where he wrestles with webmentions:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This blog doesn’t have comments, although you can always send me an
email if you want to comment anything, and some people have done that.
Not often, but if I have received a handful of emails, that’s more
comments that my old blog had in its last few years. –

</blockquote>
<p>
James also had this to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If your blog then has comments, and likes, and people on other platforms
can comment, like, and share posts directly, is it really a blog any
more? … Should blogs even have comments and notifications?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
I know that back when the Old School RPG blogosphere was strong, there
were often questions that got tackled by multiple people. You’d see a
post about something interesting and post your own take and link back to
the original. More people would jump onto the band-wagon, link to the
four or five related blog posts they could find and add their take. It
was cool! Those “replies” weren’t just replies, they sometimes built on
what had been said before, reformulated it, distilled it. It was great!
The replies were also hard to find, unfortunately. People relied on the
blogrolls of well-connected bloggers and blog aggregators like the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg">RPG Planet</a> I’m running and
similar sites like the RPGA, and forums like EN World, Dragonsfoot,
ODD74, and so on.
</p>
<p>
I think we have to do the work and link to other people’s blogs.

id="google-postpones-phasing-out-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-once-more">Google
postpones phasing out third party cookies in Chrome once more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>While Firefox and Safari phased out third party cookies years ago,
it’s taking Chrome a bit longer because, well, daddy Google got ads to
sell. As such, Google has been developing a complicated new alternative
to third party cookies that it calls “Privacy sandbox”, a name in the
vain of “Greenland”. This process has not exactly been going well,
because Google has had to postpone phasing out third party cookies
several times now, and today, they had to postpone it again. This time,
however, it’s because the UK competition authority, the CMA, still has
some questions. We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related
to reconciling divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and
developers, and will continue to engage closely with the entire
ecosystem. It’s also critical that the CMA has sufficient time to review
all evidence including results from industry tests, which the CMA has
asked market participants to provide by the end of June. Given both of
these significant considerations, we will not complete third-party
cookie deprecation during the second half of Q4. We remain committed to
engaging closely with the CMA and ICO and we hope to conclude that
process this year. Assuming we can reach an agreement, we envision
proceeding with third-party cookie deprecation starting early next year.

12, and is also clocked down from the Elite’s 3.8GHz to 3.4GHz. ↫ Ben
Schoon at 9To5Google It really seems like it’s finally happening – ARM
computers for the general public (that aren’t from Apple). I really hope
that Qualcomm can deliver on its promises, and that Microsoft’s
involvement means these computers will be fairly standardised so it’s
easier for non-Windows platforms to support them. I’ve seen quite a few
rumblings from people invited to Qualcomm’s press events for these new
ARM chips that the company is delivering Linux support alongside Windows
support, so that’s at least a good start. Whenever we talk about ARM
coming to the generic PC market, people rightfully point out the lack of
standardisation in the ARM space, so that really is the deciding factor
here for people like us, who tend to not be all too interested in
locked-down platforms. If every one of these machines is different
enough that supporting them is a nightmare – like the world of
smartphones – ARM for PCs will be dead on arrival for me because I have
zero interest in buying Windows-only hardware. One thing Microsoft tends
to be good at is getting at least some standardisation to stick in the
PC market, and I hope they’re going to that here, too – Microsoft
probably isn’t relishing supporting each individual ARM machine in
Windows ‘by hand’ either. Let’s keep our fingers crossed.</p>

Maldives 2024
</h1>
<p>
The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the
Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.
</p>
<p>
The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane,
Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like
sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the
<a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible,
too.
</p>
<p>
With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We
went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in
2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to
the Maldives.

<p>
<strong>2024-04-06</strong>. The last leg of the journey – our
water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the
reef begins a few meters in.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an
underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or
the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10
before we left.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to
hide in the sand.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it
attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in
Australia or the Galapagos. This purple giant is cool, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
There are still plenty of colourful fish.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-8.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games. The most popular tropical
island game is Race for the Galaxy.

<strong>2024-04-10</strong>. More pictures.
</p>
<p>
We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey
moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily
scared and therefore obviously harmless.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when
you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful
fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" />

<p>
When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep
blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.

<p>
There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either
uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can
stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work
on the tourist islands.
</p>
<p>
The capital city is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one
of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.
</p>
<p>
I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage
problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know
what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a>
book. Check out these stats from the
<a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia
page on the Maldives</a>: In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had
about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much
better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman
has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years
in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement
from the point of view of the locals.
</p>
<p>
From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The
picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don’t know
what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage
incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had
to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in
the the fish. People eat the fish. It’s easy to feel grim about this. I
need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a
generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much,
much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally
summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that
this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look
away.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-04-12</strong>. Bad luck for Claudia. Yesterday, late at
night, she stuck her small toe in a gap between two planks, took another
step, nearly fell and twisted her foot. There’s a huge dark bruise on
its back and a significant dark bruise below. No more fins, for a while.
😭
</p>
<p>
We had signed up for a snorkel safari when suddenly the buzz was that
the young humpback whale they had seen two days ago was still around and
so the ship picked up some extra passengers and Claudia came along to do
some whale watching.
</p>
<p>
The whale watching did not disappoint.
</p>

<p>
This adolescent
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale">humpback
whale</a> was about 8m long. It’s unusual to find a whales here, now, so
close to the reef, so young, without its family. There was speculation
that it might be waiting for its family to pick it up again, or that
perhaps it was sick.

she is supposed to rest her foot.

<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-04-21</strong>. After snorkling with the whale, not much
seemed to be worth posting about.
</p>
<p>
Before going on this trip, I bought an older GoPro HERO 10. Now I have a
few gigabytes of reef snorkeling footage. I don’t know what to do with
it. Post it? Unlikely! It takes too much space and nobody would look at
it. Donate it to YouTube? Unlikely! Upload it to some Peertube instance
and thereby offload the cost? Unlikely.
</p>
<p>
Regarding the economy of the Maldives and the shock when I learned about
the garbage island and my dismay when I saw the skyline of Malé island –
when we flew back, I got a closer look at Malé from the air as we landed
and while it wasn’t an island nature paradise, it was just a city with
nice, tall buildings and roads and palm trees and construction sites and
glass fronts and cars and motorcycles. In other words, it seemed like a
perfectly normal city and it wasn’t shabby and it didn’t have slums and
so I keep coming back to the main issue: Beating poverty is of ultimate
importance in order to improve people’s lives and giving them options so
that they can work on the problems they care about. When we flew over
Thilafushi, the garbage island didn’t look “apocalyptic” but just like
some industrial zone elsewhere in the world, except it’s an island in
the middle of the ocean.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-04-24</strong>. Ugh. Seems like Claudia broke her foot,
after all. 😰

<h2 id="how-i-tricked-ios-into-giving-me-eu-dma-features">How I tricked
iOS into giving me EU DMA features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>In iOS 17.4, Apple introduced a new system called eligibilityd. This
works with countryd (which you might have heard about when it first
appeared in iOS 16.2) and the Apple ID system to decide where you
physically are. The idea is that multiple sources need to agree on where
you are, before giving you access to features such as those mandated by
the Digital Markets Act. ↫ Adam Demasi The way Adam Demasi managed to
convince Apple his very much Australian iPhone in Australia was, in
fact, a European Union iPhone in the European Union was by making sure
not a single wireless signal managed to escape the device. He had to
disable location services, insert an Italian SIM, set up a pfSense Wi-Fi
router using the regulatory country of Italy, and go into his basement
where there’s no mobile signal. Between all these steps, the phone was
reset multiple times. And then, and only then, did the iPhone think it
was in the European Union, with all the benefits that entails. Demasi
has no idea which of these steps are actually needed, but the process of
figuring this all out is ongoing, and more information is sure to be
discovered as smart people sink their teeth into the process by which
Apple determines where an iPhone is from.</p>

<h2 id="openbsd-as-a-daily-driver">OpenBSD as a daily driver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I always like it when I can link to an article written by an OSNews,
and this time it’s even relevant to me as I’m exploring OpenBSD myself.
OSNews reader and silver Patreon supporter Morgan has written an article
about using OpenBSD as a daily driver. OpenBSD is forever tied in first
place with Void Linux as my favorite desktop OS. This is particularly
funny because OpenBSD isn’t “just a desktop OS”; in its purest form, the
base installation without any installed packages, it makes for an
excellent Ethernet router, firewall, or web server. It even ships with
its own fork of X11 called Xenocara, along with fvwm2 and its own calm
window manager, so there’s a rudimentary desktop OS in there too. With
that said, in 2024 there is no such thing as a fully functioning desktop
computer or workstation without at least a web browser of some kind, and
if you’re adding packages you may as well build a full desktop system to
suit your needs. So how do you go from the amazing but unfortunately
limited base install to a “daily driver” workstation operating system?
There are many ways to do this, and I will present a couple of paths I
take depending on the hardware and use case involved. Before I do that,
a bit of prep is necessary to get OpenBSD into more of a desktop OS
mode. ↫ Morgan I’ll be using this guide over the coming days to make
sure I end up with something usable. I still haven’t decided on what
desktop environment I want to go for – I’m not interested in running
GNOME or KDE, so Xfce is probably the most likely option. I’d also love
to try out LXQt, but it seems the version OpenBSD has in its
repositories is very, very outdated (1.0.0 from years ago, when 2.0.0
was just released). There’s a small chance I might suck it up and use
one of those “build your own desktop environment” options, but I have no
idea which one I should go for.</p>

<h1 id="embeddable-game-engine">
Embeddable Game Engine
</h1>
<p>
<img
src="https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/images/SwiftGodot%20Header.png"
align="right" width=240> Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where
we were building cross-platform libraries for mobile developers, we
wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming capabilities for our users in the
form of adding 2D or 3D content to their mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired
libraries.
</p>
<p>
For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years,
and we contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).
</p>
<p>
Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great
UI support called Urho, and the other one was a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>,
which had a great IDE, but did not support being embedded.
</p>
<p>
I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be
turned into such engine. While I tend to take copious notes of all my
meetings, those notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft
acquisition, but from what I can remember Juan told me, "Godot is not
what you are looking for" in two dimensions, there were no immediate
plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was not as advanced
as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.
</p>
<p>
We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go
into becoming a
<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and
mobile platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR
headsets. Sadly, Microsoft’s management left UrhoSharp to die.
</p>
<p>
Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the
most popular open-source projects in the world.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Faolan-Rad">@Faolan-Rad</span>
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a
patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library that could be embedded into
applications. I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a>
and have been very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed
Godot content into their application.
</p>
<p>
However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one
Godot game as an embedded system and could not do much more. The folks
at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk Software</a> wanted to take this
further. They wanted to host independent Godot scenes in their app and
have more control over those so they could sprinkle Godot content at
their heart’s content on their mobile app
(<a href="https://x.com/JoshBromberg1/status/1721564103859114132">demo</a>)
</p>
<p>
They funded some initial work to do this and hired
<a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely Kis’s company</a> to do this work.
</p>
<p>
Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year. I came back very excited
from GodotCon and I decided to turn my
<a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype
Godot on iPad</a> into a
<a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete product</a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of
Godot in discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to
productize and polish this patch for general consumption.
</p>
<p>
Now, there is a
<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch
under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary Godot scenes into
their apps. For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot
scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is
done, I will update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift
users (bindings for other platforms and languages are left as an
exercise to the reader).
</p>
<p>
It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in
Godot land.

views and questions about metadata across Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
This past year has been a captivating journey of immersion within the
Crossref community, a mix of online interactions and meaningful
in-person experiences. From the engaging Sustainability Research and
Innovation Conference in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to the impactful
webinars conducted globally, this has been more than just a professional
endeavour; it has been a personal exploration of collaboration,
insights, and a shared commitment to pushing the boundaries of scholarly
communication.

<p>
The adventure began with a significant in-person event, the
Sustainability Research and Innovation Conference. In the coastal city
of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, I had the honour of hosting a parallel
co-creation session titled “Connecting Science to Society: A Network
Approach to Improving Science Communication in the Global South.” The
co-creation session addressed research discoverability and accessibility
among early-career researchers. Apart from some immediate feedback from
the researchers in the room about how they might use co-creation beyond
the conference to improve their research experience and outcome, I also
had conversations with research funders from the Belmont Forum, Future
Earth, and National Research Foundation - South Africa and the National
Research Foundation - Mozambique about connecting their grants and
grantees with their published outputs referencing Crossref’s
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/" target="_blank">Open
Funder Registry</a> and
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/grants/" target="_blank">research
grants registration</a>. A different side conversation was about a
community organisation in Botswana that is interested in registering
patents with Crossref for proper referencing and protecting the
intellectual property of their research on the indigenous communities’
innovations and the associated published work. These conversations are
ongoing, unveiling a new understanding of unique needs and opportunities
to pursue with research funders and research organisations working on
indigenous knowledge and innovations.

<h2 id="learning-from-organisations-in-gem-eligible-countries">
Learning from organisations in GEM-eligible countries
</h2>
<p>
The journey extended globally through a series of webinars conducted in
Bangladesh, Tanzania, Nepal, and Ghana. Collaborating with dedicated
Ambassadors and my colleagues leading the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/gem/" target="_blank">Global Equitable
Membership (GEM) program</a>, we witnessed an increase in Crossref
membership from the GEM countries and initial metadata registration. The
GEM Program offers relief from both Crossref membership and Crossref
content registration fees for organisations in the least economically
advantaged countries in the world, based on the World Bank’s IDA list.
Susan, in her blog post,
“<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-gem-program-year-one/" target="_blank">The
GEM Program: Year One</a>”, elaborated on the significance of these
efforts and their impact on fostering equitable access to scholarly
resources and communication through the expansion of Crossref’s
membership base in underrepresented regions, such as Bangladesh,
Tanzania, Nepal, and Ghana. Specific concerns encountered while
presenting the GEM program included feedback expressing reservations
about the program’s approach, particularly in deciding on eligible
countries, and advocating eligibility for the program to be extended to
all the non-GEM countries in Africa. Additionally, a conversation with
some organisations brought up concerns regarding the program’s
sustainability, with inquiries about whether GEM was merely a free trial
or freemium service, and seeking assurances against future fees. The
audience found these sessions helpful, acknowledging that joining fees
were no longer going to be a barrier, yet questions about the program’s
longevity brought out the need for sustained support.

</h2>
<p>
My journey then led me to Makerere University in Uganda for the
Consortium of Uganda University Libraries (CUUL 2023) conference and the
Forum for Open Research in MENA (FORM 2023) in Abu Dhabi. In Uganda, I
noticed the synergy between university libraries, institutional
repositories, and the research and education network service provider
formed a consortium that played a crucial role in bridging the digital
gap and supporting the adoption of open infrastructure. The event was
mainly attended by librarians from different universities in Uganda.
Most of those I connected with needed more information about Crossref
and had questions about how Crossref DOIs are different from ARKs, which
they commonly use in their publishing workflows. At FORM 2023, in my
presentation titled, “The Research Nexus: A Rich and Reusable Open
Network of Relationships in the Scholarly Record,” I shared Crossref’s
vision for a connected research ecosystem with the audience that
comprised of researchers, research administrators, and funders, and a
good number of big publishers like IEEE and Taylor &amp; Francis. The
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-gem-program-year-one/" target="_blank">Research
Nexus</a> seeks to reveal relationships beyond persistent identifiers,
utilising rich metadata to connect various scholarly components. I also
took the opportunity at both events to share about
<a href="https://theplace.discourse.group/" target="_blank">The
Publishers Learning And Community Exchange (PLACE)</a>, an online forum
promoting best practices in scholarly publishing. The goal was to show
attendees how they can actively contribute to and benefit from this
vision, fostering a robust and interconnected research community through
Crossref’s open infrastructure.

I enjoyed the opportunity to join the National Open Science Dialogue by
TCC Africa, which provided crucial insights, emphasising the need for
assessing awareness, implementing comprehensive policies, and fostering
collaboration around Open Science. Higher education institutions were
recognized as influencers in the global Open Science movement, while a
call for an inclusive research environment was underscored through open
access and data sharing. The dialogue emphasized a collective effort
involving policymakers, educators, researchers, and institutions,
focusing on inclusivity and collaboration to advance Open Science in
East Africa.

<h2 id="exploring-how-rich-metadata-can-provide-trust-signals-with-members-in-kenya">
Exploring how rich metadata can provide trust signals with members in
Kenya
</h2>
<p>
Reflecting on the Crossref Nairobi event that happened in February 2024,
it was an enriching experience exploring key issues shaping scholarly
publishing in Kenya. The discussions also touched on the role of
metadata as a trust signal and a tool for the persistence of the
scholarly record, particularly in regions where data protection
challenges persist. This is exemplified by concerns raised during the
event about the fear of data theft, misuse, or loss, especially in
places with comparatively weaker data protection laws. The presence of
robust metadata, particularly with detailed provenance information,
becomes crucial in such contexts, as it enables better identification
and handling of potential misuse. Thus, through effective metadata
implementation and the persistence facilitated by identifiers, the
management of data risks can be significantly improved.
</p>
<p>
The insights from existing Crossref members pointed out contextual
challenges, regional differences, and the importance of effective
post-publication processes. The conference served as a valuable platform
for dialogue, emphasising the collective commitment to continuous
improvement of scholarly communication in the country, and the need for
continuous awareness and training on making the most of Crossref
services. The roundtable discussions during the Crossmark service
consultation brought to light various reflections and considerations
regarding post-publication changes in publishing workflows. The
Crossmark service was a new discovery for most participants, with
potential value recognized in facilitating current updates on articles.
However, there are existing barriers such as a lack of awareness and
technical expertise, suggesting the need for further education to
facilitate adoption. Overall, the consultation provided a platform for
introspection and exploration of avenues for improving post-publication
practices in scholarly publishing.

We organised the Crossref Nairobi event with the help of colleagues from
the outreach team and local Ambassadors, Mercury Shitindo of Kenya,
Baraka Ngussa of Tanzania and our Board Members in Kenya, Oscar Donde.
It was the first time I saw both my colleagues and Ambassadors in action
and working closely together - making presentations and accommodating
last-minute facilitation changes to the program. Compared to attending
or speaking at an event, organising one was a unique experience
requiring a lot of planning in advance for logistics and the event
program, identifying and keeping in touch with important stakeholders,
ushering guests and being on standby for any matters that come up about
the event. All of that went very well thanks to the team on the ground
and cooperative participants.

<h2 id="exploring-the-role-of-open-infrastructure-for-african-universities">
Exploring the role of open infrastructure for African universities
</h2>
<p>
Attending the recent WACREN 2024 conference was an eye-opening
experience, unfolding the role of open infrastructure in addressing
challenges faced by African universities. A focus on open access systems
and advocacy for decolonizing knowledge were voiced too, including
challenges of affordability of DOIs and questions of local ownership
amidst global initiatives. Global persistent identifier providers,
including ORCID and DataCite too, had a presence at the conference,
alongside passionate advocates for more locally managed, decentralised
infrastructure. These are concerns that Crossref needs to understand
better, as we seek to find effective ways of supporting equitable
participation in the Research Nexus. The conference resonated with a
call for continued work in fostering accessibility, sharing, and
leveraging resources to accelerate research and innovation in Africa.

<p>
Conversations with Crossref Ambassadors brought about a shared narrative
across universities in some African countries. These institutions are
actively embracing digital shifts, setting up institutional repositories
using platforms like DSpace and OJS. However, challenges persist,
particularly in funding and technical capacity. It’s heartening to see
how national and regional research and education networks step in to
help in internet connectivity, opening up collaboration opportunities
with other interoperable infrastructure, setting up repositories,
providing hosting services and event managing content identifiers.
</p>
<p>
Deceptive publishing practices remain a shared concern, and we’ve had
requests at these meetings for stricter inclusion criteria for
membership of Crossref to ensure quality and trustworthiness of articles
accessible through Crossref metadata.
</p>
<p>
We’ve explained to those we’ve met that Crossref doesn’t (and can’t)
assess the quality of content or the integrity of the research process.
We don’t have the people or the skills, and it isn’t our mission to be
the gatekeepers of research quality. A DOI record is just an indication
that something was published, it isn’t an indication of quality.
</p>
<p>
However, we do still have a vital role in preserving the integrity of
the scholarly record. We provide the infrastructure which enables those
who produce scholarly outputs to provide metadata (effectively evidence)
about how they ensure the quality of content and how the outputs fit
into the scholarly record. The scholarly record - that network of
published outputs, inputs, relationships and contexts - is captured
through the metadata records that our members register with us, and that
we then distribute freely and openly through our API. The richer and
more comprehensive Crossref records are, the more context there is for
our members and for the whole scholarly research ecosystem to make their
own decisions around trustworthiness. Blocking access to the
infrastructure creates gaps in the scholarly record, but also
potentially blocks legitimate newcomers.
</p>
<p>
“Crossref is focused on enriching metadata to provide more and better
trust signals while keeping barriers to membership and participation as
low as possible to enable an inclusive scholarly record.” Read more

</p>
<p>
While the landscape of digital scholarly publication witnesses
significant strides, a crucial need persists, the importance of
preserving and interconnecting metadata to the global scholarly record.
It’s not just about discoverability, a theme resonating strongly within
the community, but about enabling reproducibility, upholding research
and editorial integrity, and facilitating reporting and assessment.

<h2 id="the-path-forward">
The path forward
</h2>
<p>
As I reflect on this year of immersing myself within the Crossref
community, building awareness in new communities, and learning more
about the different perceptions across the region, it feels like a
personal progression of growth and discovery. From the captivating
in-person moments to the global webinars and collaborative efforts to
address challenges in scholarly communication, this journey is not just
a professional pursuit; it’s a personal exploration. The path forward
involves continued support, intensified awareness-building, and
sustained dialogue, ensuring that the scholarly ecosystem continues to
thrive, evolve, and leave a lasting impact.

<p>Earth planning date: Monday, April 22, 2024   Curiosity succeeded on
a ~14 m drive along a bend in upper Gediz Vallis ridge (uGVR) to park
next to “Pinnacle Ridge,” an outcrop of uGVR to the north. Benefitting
from a surplus in power, Curiosity’s already substantial targeted
science block was extended to 2 hours. This […]</p>

<h2 id="fedora-40-released-with-kde-plasma-6-and-gnome-46">Fedora 40
released with KDE Plasma 6 and GNOME 46</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a big day for Fedora users such as myself – and especially for
Fedora KDE users, also such as myself. Fedora 40 has been released
today, and while the main focus is always on the GNOME release –
although not everyone is happy about that – the various other spins, in
Fedora parlance, have also seen major updates. Most prominently among
them is the KDE spin, which ships with KDE’s recent megarelease, KDE
Plasma 6. Starting at the top, Fedora 40 Workstation comes with the
latest GNOME release, 46, which we covered when it was released earlier
this year. It also comes with IPV4 Address Conflict Detection to resolve
duplicate IPV4 addresses in the same physical network, and the PyTorch
machine learning framework is now in the Fedora software repositories
for easier installation and implementation by developers – a harbinger
of what’s to come. The KDE spin comes, as already mentioned, with KDE
Plasma 6, and inherits the non-GNOME improvements and fixes as well, of
course. There’s also countless other spins covering pretty much every
desktop environment and window manager under the sun, and Fedora 40 is
also the first release to implement the new naming scheme for Fedora’s
various immutable editions – the Atomic Desktops.</p>

<p>Hot on the heels of NetBSD 10.0 comes NetBSD 9.4, a minor release in
the previous release branch. NetBSD 9.4 is primarily a bug and security
fix release, however, there are some new features, such as support for
more MegaRAID controllers, ZTE MF112 and D-Link DWM222 USB 3G modems,
and improved CPU feature detection for newer AMD/Intel devices. All
users of netbsd-9 should upgrade if they are not following the stable
branch. ↫ NetBSD 9.4 release announcement A very important note here is
that the version of OpenSSL in NetBSD 9.4 is no longer supported unless
you have a support contract with OpenSSL. They suggest upgrading to
NetBSD 10.0, or to use OpenSSL from pkgsrc.</p>

<p>Tribblix, the unique ilumos distribution – think Solaris – has a new
SPARC milestone. It’s one of the few platforms still actively supporting
SPARC, so even if the amount of users might be slim, I think it’s an
important contribution to the ecosystem. The application software here
roughly corresponds to m34 on x86 systems, although the underlying
illumos is still closer to m25/m26. Note that there are no functional
illumos changes from the m28 sparc release – if that release didn’t work
on your system, this one won’t either. ↫ Peter Tribble I’m still looking
for my mythical, unobtanium Sun Ultra 45, a goal farther away now than
it’s ever been (Patreon maybe? One-time donation? Help me out after I
took OSNews full-time?), and the SPARC version of Tribblix would be my
first go-to.</p>

2024-04-22 Gopher, again
</h1>
<p>
Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to
be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept
thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> using a version
of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a
library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully
grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>,
the Gemini server I’m using, based on renderer code I found in the
<a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a>
that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Oddµ, I
figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable
Gopher pages.
</p>
<p>
It took some wrangling and it’s probably not great, but the main menu
matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site
is back as a gopher hole on port 70!

<p>
See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown
Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.

And naturally I’m immediately annoyed by the lack of UTF-8 support in
this client I’m using.

<h2 id="paying-for-it-doesnt-make-it-a-market">Paying for it doesn’t
make it a market</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Cory Doctorow, nailing it as usual. If you care about how people are
treated by platforms, you can’t just tell them to pay for services
instead of using ad-supported media. The most important factor in
getting decent treatment out of a tech company isn’t whether you pay
with cash instead of attention – it’s whether you’re locked in, and thus
a flight risk whom the platform must cater to. ↫ Cory Doctorow I’m sick
and tired of the phrase “if you’re not paying for the product, you’re
the product”, because it implies that if just you pay for a product or
service, you’re not going to be treated like ass. The problem is, as
Doctorow points out, that this simply is not supported by the evidence,
and that it isn’t whether or not you’re paying that makes you have a
good or bad experience – it’s whether or not you’re locked in. If you’ve
got nowhere else to go, then corporations can treat you like ass. There
are so, so many free services and products I use where I’m anything but
a “product”. My Linux distribution of choice, Fedora. My web browser,
Firefox. The countless open source applications I use on my desktops,
laptops, and smartphone. Those are all cases where even though I’m not
paying, I know I’m being treated with respect, and I feel entirely
comfortable with all of those. And no, you don’t get to exclude the open
source world just because it’s inconvenient for the “you’re the product”
argument. There are also countless services and products where the
opposite is true; I’m a paying customer, but I still feel like I’m the
product. I pay for additional Google Drive storage. I pay for an Office
364 subscription because I needed it as a translator (I’m working on
OSNews full-time now, and could use your help keeping the site going),
but I can’t cancel it because my wife, my parents, and my parents-in-law
use that same subscription. We pay for Netflix and one or two other
video services. I don’t know if our ISP or wireless provider do anything
malicious, but it wouldn’t surprise me. And so on. Being a paying
customer means nothing. It’s how easy it is for you to stop being a
customer that matters.</p>

opens its Android-based Quest operating system to other VR device
makers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today we’re taking the next step toward our vision for a more open
computing platform for the metaverse. We’re opening up the operating
system powering our Meta Quest devices to third-party hardware makers,
giving more choice to consumers and a larger ecosystem for developers to
build for. We’re working with leading global technology companies to
bring this new ecosystem to life and making it even easier for
developers to build apps and reach their audiences on the platform. Meta
Horizon OS is the result of a decade of work by Meta to build a
next-generation computing platform. To pioneer standalone headsets, we
developed technologies like inside-out tracking, and for more natural
interaction systems and social presence, we developed eye, face, hand,
and body tracking. For mixed reality, we built a full stack of
technologies for blending the digital and physical worlds, including
high-resolution Passthrough, Scene Understanding, and Spatial Anchors.
This long-term investment that began on the mobile-first foundations of
the Android Open Source Project has produced a full mixed reality
operating system used by millions of people. ↫ Facebook’s blog In
summary, Facebook wants the operating system of their Quest series of
virtual reality devices – an Android Open Source Project fork optimised
for this use – to become the default platform for virtual reality
devices from all kinds of OEMs. Today, they’re announcing that both Asus
and Lenovo will be releasing devices running this Meta Horizon OS, with
the former focusing on high-end VR gaming, and the latter on more
general use cases of work, entertainment, and so on. Facebook will also
be working together with Microsoft to create a Quest “inspired by Xbox”.
The Meta Quest Store, the on-device marketplace for applications and
games, will be renamed to the Meta Horizon Store, and the App Lab, where
developers can more easily get their applications and games on devices
and in the hands of consumers as long as they meet basic technical and
content guidelines, will be integrated into the Meta Horizon Store for
easier access than before. In addition, in a mildly spicy move, Facebook
is openly inviting Google to bring the Google Play Store to the VR
Android fork, “where it can operate with the same economic model it does
on other platforms”. The odds of me buying anything from Facebook are
slim, so I really hope this new move won’t corner the market for VR
headsets right out of the gate; I don’t want another Android/iOS
duopoly. I’m not particularly interested in VR quite yet – but give it a
few more years, and I certainly won’t pass up on a capable device that
allows me to play Beat Saber and other exercise-focused applications and
games. I just don’t want it to be a Facebook device or operating
system.</p>

<h2 id="inside-the-super-nintendo-cartridges">Inside the Super Nintendo
cartridges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the remarkable characteristics of the Super Nintendo was the
ability for game cartridges (cart) to pack more than instructions and
assets into ROM chips. If we open and look at the PCBs, we can find
inside things like the CIC copy protection chip, SRAM, and even
“enhancement processors”. ↫ Fabien Sanglard When I was a child and
teenager in the ’90s, the capabilities of the SNES cartridge were a bit
of a legend. We’d talk about what certain games would use which
additional processors and chips in the cartridge, right or wrong, often
boasting about the games we owned, and talking down the games we didn’t.
Much of it was probably nonsense, but there’s some good memories there.
We’re decades deep into the internet age now, and all the mysteries of
the SNES cartridge can just be looked up on Wikipedia and endless
numbers of other websites. The mystery’s all gone, but at least now we
can accurately marvel at just how versatile the SNES really was.</p>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">
This is a hefty one. I usually try to keep things as accessible as
possible, but this time we have to get a little more technical than
usual. We are picking up in 1964, with the first proposals for a new
version of ALGOL. From there we sail through the fraught waters of ALGOL
X, Y, W, and finally 68. Along the way we see how a language evolves
over time, and how people and politics mesh with technical issues.

<h2 id="niri-0.1.5-released">Niri 0.1.5 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we talked about Niri, a very unique tiling window
manager for Wayland that scrolls infinitely to the right. I’ve never
seen anything quite like it, and while it seems polarising, I think it’s
absolutely worthy of a dedicated niche. The project’s got a major new
release out, and there’s a lot of improvements here. First and foremost,
virtually all animations have been overhauled, and new ones have been
added for almost every kind of interaction. The videos on the release
page do a really good job of highlighting what they’re going for, and I
think it looks great, and for the animation-averse, every individual
animation can be turned off. Niri now also supports variable refresh
rate, and the IPC mechanism has been improved. Among the smaller
improvements is a welcome one: when using the touchscreen, the mouse
cursor disappears. I really think this one has to be tried before
judged, and I’m seriously contemplating setting up a Wayland environment
just for this one, to see if it works for me. My window “flow”, if that
makes sense, is already left-to-right, so the idea of having that
effectively automated with an infinite canvas sounds very appealing to
me, especially on smaller displays. I just need to figure out if it
works in reality.</p>

<p>Doc asks the
<a href="https://twitter.com/dsearls/status/1782145396950835248">question</a>
on all our minds: “Why does ChatGPT misspell the f*ck out of words on
images?” Don Park, Wes Felter and JY Stervinou chime in.</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1782032706903195993">observed</a>
as follows: “Let’s do something great with our lives! In the meantime I
miss the role that twitter used to play and never will play again. It
was the place to go to say ‘How about those Knicks!’ when they win a
game like the one they won last night. Not no mo.”

cognitive errors and LLM hallucinations that I wrote this short
explainer: Humans say things that aren’t true for many different reasons
• Sometimes they lie • Sometimes they misremember things</p>

<p>“The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over
again while expecting different results.” If all we had was ChatGPT, we

than journalism alone, and bigger than a story alone can tell.
(Image borrowed from the brilliant Despair.com.) We who care about
journalism are asked to join the Save Journalism Project, and its fight
