id="the-state-of-falkon-kdes-browser-is-much-better-than-you-know">The
state of Falkon: KDE’s browser is much better than you know</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s no secret that I am very worried about the future of Firefox,
and the future of Firefox on Linux in particular. I’m not going to
rehash these worries here, but suffice to say that with Mozilla
increasingly focusing on advertising, Firefox’ negligible market share,
and the increasing likeliness that the Google Search deal, which
accounts for 85% of Mozilla’s revenue, will come to an end, I have
little faith in Firefox for Linux remaining a priority for Mozilla. On
top of that, as more and more advertising nonsense, in collaboration
with Facebook, makes its way into Firefox, we may soon arrive at a point
where Firefox can’t be shipped by Linux distributions at all anymore,
due to licensing and/or idealogical reasons. I’ve been warning the Linux
community, and distributions in particular, for years now that they’re
going to need an alternative default browser once the inevitable day
Firefox truly shits the bed is upon us. Since I’m in the middle of
removing the last few remaining bits of big tech from my life, I figured
I might as well put my money where my mouth is and go on a small side
quest to change my browser, too. Since I use Fedora KDE on all my
machines and prefer to have as many native applications as possible, I
made the switch to KDE’s own browser: Falkon. What is Falkon? Falkon
started out as an independent project called QupZilla, but in 2017 it
joined the KDE project and was renamed to Falkon. It uses QtWebEngine as
its engine, which is Qt’s version of the Chromium engine, but without
all the services that talk to Google, which are stripped out. This
effectively makes it similar to using de-Googled Chromium. The downside
is that QtWebEngine does lag behind the current Chromium version;
QtWebEngine 6.8.0, the current version, is Chromium 122, while Chromium
133 is current at the time of writing. The fact that Falkon uses a
variant of the Chromium engine means websites just work, and there’s
really nothing to worry about when it comes to compatibility. Another
advantage of using QtWebEngine is that the engine is updated
independently from the browser, so even if it seems Falkon isn’t getting
much development, the engine it uses is updated regularly as part of
your distribution’s and KDE’s Qt upgrades. The downside, of course, is
that you’re using a variant of Chromium, but at least it’s de-Googled
and entirely invisible to the user. It’s definitely not great, and it
contributes to the Chromium monoculture, but I can also understand that
a project like Qt isn’t going to develop its own browser engine, and in
turn, it makes perfect sense for KDE, as a flagship Qt product, to use
it as well. It’s the practical choice, and I don’t blame either of them
for opting for what works, and what works now – the reality is that no
matter what browser you’re choose, you’re either using a browser made by
Google, or one kept afloat by Google. Pick your poison. It’s not
realistic for Qt or KDE to develop their own browser engine from
scratch, so opting for the most popular and very well funded browser
engine and strip out all of its nasty Google bits makes the most sense.
Yes, we’d all like to have more capable browser engines and thus more
competition, but we have to be realistic and understand that’s not going
to happen while developing a browser engine is as complex as developing
an entire operating system. Falkon’s issues and strengths While
rendering websites, compatibility, and even performance is excellent –
as a normal user I don’t notice any difference between running Chrome,
Firefox, or Falkon on my machines – the user interface and feature set
is where Falkon stumbles a bit. There’s a few things users have come to
expect from their browser that Falkon simply doesn’t offer yet, and
those things needs to be addressed if the KDE project wants Falkon to be
a viable alternative to Firefox and Chrome, instead of just a
languishing side project nobody uses. The biggest thing you’ll miss is
without a doubt support for modern extensions. Falkon does have support
for the deprecated PPAPI plugin interface and its own extensions system,
but there’s no support for the modern extensions API Firefox, Chrome,
and other browsers use. What this means for you as a user is that there
are effectively no extensions available for Falkon, and that’s a huge
thing to suddenly have to do without. Luckily, Falkon does have adblock
built-in, including support for custom block lists, so the most
important extension is there, but that’s it. There’s a very old bug
report/feature request about adding support for Firefox/Chrome
extensions, which in turn points to a similar feature request for
QtWebEngine to adopt support for such extensions. The gist is that for
Falkon to get support for modern Firefox and Chrome extensions, it will
have to go through QtWebEngine and thus the Qt project. While I
personally can just about get by with using the BitWarden application
(instead of the extension) and the built-in adblock, I think this is an
absolute most for most people to adopt Falkon in any serious numbers.
Most people who would consider switching to a different browser than
Chrome or Firefox are going to need extensions support. The second major
thing you’ll miss is any lack of synchronisation support. You won’t be
synchronising your bookmarks across different machines, let alone open
tabs. Of course, this extends to mobile, where Falkon has no presence,
so don’t expect to send your open tabs from your phone to your desktop
as you get home. While I don’t think this is as big of an issue as the
lack of modern extensions, it’s something I use a lot when working on
OSNews – I find stories to link to while browsing on my phone, and then
open them on my desktop to post them through the tab sharing feature of
Firefox, and</p>

id="unofficial-windows-11-mobile-is-possible-even-on-select-budget-phones-with-a-free-utility">Unofficial
Windows 11 mobile is possible even on select budget phones with a free
utility</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Back in December 2019, Microsoft finally killed off Windows 10
Phone as it announced the end of support. The company’s grand plans with
Lumia and Windows Phones sadly never became the success it needed to be
in order to be able to compete with the likes of Android or iOS. Thus
Windows 11 Phone never became a real official thing outside of concepts.
However, there is a free unofficial way that makes it possible, albeit
the experience may not totally be free from flaws. Dubbed Project
Renegade, the mod enables users to try Windows 11 on Qualcomm Snapdragon
phones, among other devices. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin Windows Phone 7 and 8
were amazing, and probably my favourite mobile platform of all time. I’m
still sad that the duopoly made it impssible even for Microsoft to gain
a foothold, because their efforts definitely deserved it. They didn’t
just blindly copy Android or iOS, but came up with a truly original,
unique, and in my view, superior mobile operating system, and in a fair
market, they would’ve been rewarded for it, and Windows Phone would have
a perhaps small, but profitable segment of the market. In the vein of
Bernie can still win, I still have this faint belief that Microsoft
hasn’t completely given up on the smartphone market. Now that they’re
serious about Windows on ARM, they might use it as sneaky way to get
application developers on board, so that their applications are ready
for the big Surface Phone a few years from now, complete with Windows
Phone-inspired features and UI. I know this won’t happen, but let me
enjoy my non-existent future, please. I don’t want to rely on big tech
anymore, but I might make an exception for an up-to-date Windows Phone.
I’m only human.</p>
