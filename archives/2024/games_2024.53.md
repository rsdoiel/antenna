## Marvel’s What If…? was nothing more than a slew of missed opportunities

date: 2024-12-30, updated: 2024-12-27, from: Polygon Website

One of Marvel Comics&#8217; oldest traditions has been the What If title, a series that aims to take the Marvel universe as we know it and ponder what said universe would be like if something (whether it be a small, seemingly insignificant detail or the absence of entire superteams) was different. So when Marvel Studios [&#8230;]

And then there’s the Monterey Bay Aquarium and its oceanic lo-fi livestreams.  Monterey Bay is an internationally respected aquarium that real nerdy-ass fuckin’ nerds will know as the shot-on-location stand-in for the [&#8230;]

## Watching this YouTuber restore old consoles is oddly satisfying

date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website

YouTube channel Odd Tinkering doesn’t hold many surprises — other than the disbelief at how good the consoles, controllers, and keyboards they restore look when the work is done. What starts as a broken, dirty Game Boy Color in this video becomes a crisp, clean handheld fit to be a 1998 Christmas present. The creator, [&#8230;]

## ‘Outside In’ makes a complex math concept fun and approachable

date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: Polygon Website

When it comes to good YouTube videos, I’m biased in favor of content made explicitly for the platform: media critiques, long-form investigations, and pointless tests of human endurance. “Outside In” is an exception. This educational video comes from a strange and distant land: the 1990s. Based on the mathematical concept of sphere inversion, it should [&#8230;]
