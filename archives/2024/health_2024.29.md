## Treatment of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii

date: 2024-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Patients with severe carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections currently face significant treatment challenges. When patients display signs of infection and the clinical suspicion of CRAB infections is high, appropriate treatment should be immediately provided. However, current treatment plans and clinical data for CRAB are limited. Inherent and acquired resistance mechanisms, as well as host factors, significantly restrict options for empirical medication. Moreover, inappropriate drug coverage can have detrimental effects on patients. Most existing studies have limitations, such as a restricted sample size, and are predominantly observational or non-randomized, which report significant variability in patient infection severity and comorbidities. Therefore, a gold-standard therapy remains lacking. Current and future treatment options of infections due to CRAB were described in this review. The dose and considerable side effects restrict treatment options for polymyxins, and high doses of ampicillin-sulbactam or tigecycline appear to be the best option at the time of initial treatment. Moreover, new drugs such as durlobactam and cefiderocol have substantial therapeutic capabilities and may be effective salvage treatments. Bacteriophages and antimicrobial peptides may serve as alternative treatment options in the near future. The advantages of a combination antimicrobial regimen appear to predominate those of a single regimen. Despite its significant nephrotoxicity, colistin is considered a primary treatment and is often used in combination with antimicrobials, such as tigecycline, ampicillin-sulbactam, meropenem, or fosfomycin. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has deemed high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam, which is typically combined with high-dose tigecycline, polymyxin, and other antibacterial agents, the best option for treating serious CRAB infections. A rational combination of drug use and the exploration of new therapeutic drugs can alleviate or prevent the effects of CRAB infections, shorten hospital stays, and reduce patient mortality.

## Analysis of Amblyomma americanum microRNAs in response to Ehrlichia chaffeensis infection and their potential role in vectorial capacity

date: 2024-07-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a subset of small noncoding RNAs and carry tremendous potential for regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They play pivotal roles in distinct cellular mechanisms including inhibition of bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections via immune response pathways. Intriguingly, pathogens have developed strategies to manipulate the host’s miRNA profile, fostering environments conducive to successful infection. Therefore, changes in an arthropod host’s miRNA profile in response to pathogen invasion could be critical in understanding host-pathogen dynamics. Additionally, this area of study could provide insights into discovering new targets for disease control and prevention. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the functional role of differentially expressed miRNAs upon Ehrlichia chaffeensis, a tick-borne pathogen, infection in tick vector, Amblyomma americanum.MethodsSmall RNA libraries from uninfected and E. chaffeensis-infected Am. americanum midgut and salivary gland tissues were prepared using the Illumina Truseq kit. Small RNA sequencing data was analyzed using miRDeep2 and sRNAtoolbox to identify novel and known miRNAs. The differentially expressed miRNAs were validated using a quantitative PCR assay. Furthermore, a miRNA inhibitor approach was used to determine the functional role of selected miRNA candidates.ResultsThe sequencing of small RNA libraries generated >147 million raw reads in all four libraries and identified a total of >250 miRNAs across the four libraries. We identified 23 and 14 differentially expressed miRNAs in salivary glands, and midgut tissues infected with E. chaffeensis, respectively. Three differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-87, miR-750, and miR-275) were further characterized to determine their roles in pathogen infection. Inhibition of target miRNAs significantly decreased the E. chaffeensis load in tick tissues, which warrants more in-depth mechanistic studies.ConclusionsThe current study identified known and novel miRNAs and suggests that interfering with these miRNAs may impact the vectorial capacity of ticks to harbor Ehrlichia. This study identified several new miRNAs for future analysis of their functions in tick biology and tick-pathogen interaction studies.

## Integrated analysis of gut microbiome and its metabolites in ACE2-knockout and ACE2-overexpressed mice

date: 2024-07-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAberrant activation of the classic renin–angiotensin system (RAS) and intestinal micro dysbiosis adversely affect insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia, and other metabolic syndrome markers. However, the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and gut health in systemic homeostasis vary, and their interaction is not completely understood.MethodsWe adopted a combinatory approach of metabolomics and fecal 16S rRNA analysis to investigate gut microbiota and metabolite in two different mouse models, ACE2 knockout (ACE2 KO) mice and the ACE2-overexpressing obese mice.Results16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that ACE2 influences microbial community composition and function, and ACE2 KO mice had increased Deferribacteres, Alcaligenaceae, Parasutterella, Catenibacterium, and Anaerotruncus, with decreased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (Marvinbryantia and Alistipes). In contrast, ACE2-overexpressed mice exhibited increased anti-inflammatory probiotic (Oscillospiraceae, Marinifilaceae, and Bifidobacteriaceae) and SCFA-producing microbes (Rikenellaceae, Muribaculaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Odoribacter, and Alistipes) and decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. Metabolome analysis indicated differential metabolites in ACE2 KO and ACE2-overexpression mice, especially the glucolipid metabolism-related compounds. Furthermore, correlation analysis between gut microbiota and metabolites showed a dynamic mutual influence affecting host health.ConclusionOur study confirms for the first time a significant association between ACE2 status and gut microbiome and metabolome profiles, providing a novel mechanism for the positive effect of ACE2 on energy homeostasis.

## Methylome-wide analysis in systemic microbial-induced experimental periodontal disease in mice with different susceptibility

date: 2024-07-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThe study delved into the epigenetic factors associated with periodontal disease in two lineages of mice, namely C57bl/6 and Balb/c. Its primary objective was to elucidate alterations in the methylome of mice with distinct genetic backgrounds following systemic microbial challenge, employing high-throughput DNA methylation analysis as the investigative tool.MethodsPorphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)was orally administered to induce periodontitis in both Balb/c and C57bl/6 lineage. After euthanasia, genomic DNA from both maxilla and blood were subjected to bisulfite conversion, PCR amplification and genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using the Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq System coupled with the Illumina Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip.ResultsOf particular significance was the distinct methylation profile observed within the Pg-induced group of the Balb/c lineage, contrasting with both the control and Pg-induced groups of the C57bl/6 lineage. Utilizing rigorous filtering criteria, we successfully identified a substantial number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across various tissues and comparison groups, shedding light on the prevailing hypermethylation in non-induced cohorts and hypomethylation in induced groups. The comparison between blood and maxilla samples underscored the unique methylation patterns specific to the jaw tissue. Our comprehensive methylome analysis further unveiled statistically significant disparities, particularly within promoter regions, in several comparison groups.ConclusionThe differential DNA methylation patterns observed between C57bl/6 and Balb/c mouse lines suggest that epigenetic factors contribute to the variations in disease susceptibility. The identified differentially methylated regions associated with immune regulation and inflammatory response provide potential targets for further investigation. These findings emphasize the importance of considering epigenetic mechanisms in the development and progression of periodontitis.

## Endophthalmitis: a bibliometric study and visualization analysis from 1993 to 2023

date: 2024-07-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

AimsThis study is designed to generalize and depict the research hotspots of endophthalmitis through bibliometric methods and software and analyze the evolutive tendency of the work on this severe disease over the past 30 years.MethodsThis study employed a rigorous bibliometric approach. We identified all endophthalmitis-related literature by conducting a comprehensive search of the Science Citation Index Expanded database under the Web of Science Core Collection. The data was then analyzed and visualized using CiteSpace and VOSviewer, two widely recognized software tools in the field of bibliometrics. CiteSpace was used to analyze the country distributions, dual map overlay of journals, keyword bursts, and co-cited references. VOSviewer was employed to describe the authors and co-cited authors, the journals, the co-cited journals, and the keywords co-occurrence network. This robust methodology ensures the reliability and validity of the study’s findings.ResultsA total of 2960 publications, including 2695 articles and 265 reviews, were included in this bibliometric study. There has been no shortage of endophthalmitis-related publications since 1993, with an apparent upward trend during recent years. Possible correlations with the COVID-19 pandemic are also analyzed. These studies were finished by 11,048 authors from 75 countries worldwide, with the United States in the lead. In the keyword co-occurrence network, except for the endophthalmitis term, cataract surgery becomes the keyword with the highest frequency. Different categories of endophthalmitis, including postoperative, post-injection, post-traumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis, and antibacterial and anti-inflammatory therapies of infectious endophthalmitis, are discussed by categories. From the perspective of the timeline, postoperative and post-injection endophthalmitis were the dominant forms before and after the year 2000, respectively. Co-citation analyses reveal that the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study (EVS) conducted in 1995 provides pivotal guidance for later research. Diverse pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Propionibacterium acnes, Viridians Streptococci, and Bacillus cereus) or fungi (e.g., Candida, Aspergillus, and Fusarium) contribute to varying treatment principles and clinical prognosis, which should be taken seriously. In addition, intravitreal and intracameral antibiotics are the mainstay for treating and preventing infectious endophthalmitis, respectively.ConclusionOur bibliometric analysis provides an overview of dynamic evolution and structural relationships in the research field of endophthalmitis. The displayed hotspots and developmental directions have reference values for future investigation.

## Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis caused by Rhizopus arrhizus diagnosis via metagenomics next-generation sequencing: a case report

date: 2024-07-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) is a rare, invasive, and fatal fungal disease that is often easily misdiagnosed in the early stages due to the lack of specific clinical manifestations and adequate auxiliary examinations. Early diagnosis and timely therapy are essential for successful treatment. In this report, we presented a 46-year-old man with diabetes who experienced gradual vision loss, right ptosis, swelling, and headaches that progressively worsened to death within 4 days after admission. It was finally confirmed as a fungal Rhizopus arrhizus infection by metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Our report has proved that mNGS testing should be strongly recommended in highly suspected patients.

## Exploring TRIM proteins’ role in antiviral defense against influenza A virus and respiratory coronaviruses

date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Numerous tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, identified as E3 ubiquitin ligases, participate in various viral infections through ubiquitylation, ISGylation, and SUMOylation processes. Respiratory viruses, particularly influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs), have severely threatened public health with high morbidity and mortality, causing incalculable losses. Research on the regulation of TRIM proteins in respiratory virus infections is crucial for disease prevention and control. This review introduces TRIM proteins, summarizes recent discoveries regarding their roles and molecular mechanisms in IAV and CoVs infections, discusses current research gaps, and explores potential future trends in this rapidly developing field. It aims to enhance understanding of virus–host interactions and inform the development of new molecularly targeted therapies.

## Pediatric endocarditis - a stone left after the pandemic cascade

date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Infective endocarditis is a rare disease in children. The etiology is mainly bacterial. However, viral infective endocarditis, possibly related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has also been reported. The pathophysiological principle of the connection between the two entities seems to be attributed to the transient immune deficiency of the body during the infection. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is reported in the literature as a direct cardiopathic virus. Therefore, the new coronavirus seems to have the ability to affect both the intact cardiac tissue and the previously damaged one both during the acute episode and at a distance from it. Consequently, we propose to review the main pathophysiological aspects of pediatric cardiac damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. The ultimate goal is to deepen existing knowledge, broaden the horizon of understanding and analysis regarding the systemic damage induced by viral infections, and strengthen an information base from which to start a meta-analysis. Next, we performed a non-systematized screening of the specialized literature with reference to cases of endocarditis in the pediatric population, reported in the period 2020–2023. From the total of articles found, we chose to include in the review a number of 6 case reports, including a number of 7 patients (5 children and 2 adolescents). Analysis of reports suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection could play a role in the development of endocarditis, either directly through active infection or indirectly through a post-infectious immune response. Also, pre-existing conditions and complex medical history predispose to an increased risk of developing a severe, complicated form of endocarditis. Also, the lack of data on the vaccination history and the failure to categorize the infection depending on the type of antibodies (IgM or IgG) in some studies represent a major bias in the reports. The latter make it difficult to evaluate the influence of vaccination and the impact of acute versus chronic infection on the course of cases.

## Long-term stability of acquired drug resistance and resistance associated mutations in the fungal pathogen Nakaseomyces glabratus (Candida glabrata)

date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The limited number of available antifungal drugs and the increasing number of fungal isolates that show drug or multidrug resistance pose a serious medical threat. Several yeast pathogens, such as Nakaseomyces glabratus (Candida glabrata), show a remarkable ability to develop drug resistance during treatment through the acquisition of genetic mutations. However, how stable this resistance and the underlying mutations are in non-selective conditions remains poorly characterized. The stability of acquired drug resistance has fundamental implications for our understanding of the appearance and spread of drug-resistant outbreaks and for defining efficient strategies to combat them. Here, we used an in vitro evolution approach to assess the stability under optimal growth conditions of resistance phenotypes and resistance-associated mutations that were previously acquired under exposure to antifungals. Our results reveal a remarkable stability of the resistant phenotype and the underlying mutations in a significant number of evolved populations, which conserved their phenotype for at least two months in the absence of drug-selective pressure. We observed a higher stability of anidulafungin resistance over fluconazole resistance, and of resistance-conferring point mutations as compared with aneuploidies. In addition, we detected accumulation of novel mutations in previously altered resistance-associated genes in non-selective conditions, which suggest a possible compensatory role. We conclude that acquired resistance, particularly to anidulafungin, is a long-lasting phenotype, which has important implications for the persistence and propagation of drug-resistant clinical outbreaks.

## Fulminant fatal pneumonia and bacteremia due to Aeromonas dhakensis in an immunocompetent man: a case report and literature review

date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAeromonas dhakensis is associated with soft tissue infection, bacteremia and gastroenteritis. Involvement of respiratory system in adults is extremely rare. We report a case of fulminant pneumonia and bacteremia due to A. dhakensis in a patient without underlying diseases.Case presentationA 26-year-old man became ill suddenly with pneumonia after swimming in a river. Despite intensive support measures in the intensive care unit, he died 13 hours after admission and 4 days after his first symptoms. Autopsy showed abundant Gram-negative bacteria, massive inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, necrosis and hemorrhage in lung tissue. A. dhakensis was isolated from blood culture taken at admission and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) after intubation. Moreover, A. dhakensis was also detected in lung tissue by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay. The infection may have come from river water.ConclusionIn patients who develop a fulminant pneumonia after contacting an aquatic environment, A. dhakensis should be alerted and mNGS may aid in the detection of aquatic pathogens by being more sensitive and specific versus traditional bacterial culture.

## Coumarin derivatives ameliorate the intestinal inflammation and pathogenic gut microbiome changes in the model of infectious colitis through antibacterial activity

date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Coumarin, a phenolic compound, is a secondary metabolite produced by plants such as Tanga and Lime. Coumarin derivatives were prepared via Pechmann condensation. In this study, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine the antimicrobial and gut immune-regulatory functions of coumarin derivatives. For the in vitro antimicrobial activity assay, coumarin derivatives C1 and C2 were selected based on their pathogen-killing activity against various pathogenic microbes. We further demonstrated that the selected coumarin derivatives disrupted bacterial cell membranes. Next, we examined the regulatory function of the coumarin derivatives in gut inflammation using an infectious colitis model. In an in vivo infectious colitis model, administration of selected C1 coumarin derivatives reduced pathogen loads, the number of inflammatory immune cells (Th1 cells and Th17 cells), and inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6 and IL-1b) in the intestinal tissue after pathogen infection. In addition, we found that the administration of C1 coumarin derivatives minimized abnormal gut microbiome shift-driven pathogen infection. Potential pathogenic gut microbes, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae, were increased by pathogen infection. However, this pathogenic microbial expansion was minimized and beneficial bacteria, such as Ligilactobacillus and Limosilactobacillus, increased with C1 coumarin derivative treatment. Functional gene enrichment assessment revealed that the relative abundance of genes associated with lipid and nucleotide metabolism was reduced by pathogen infection; however, this phenomenon was not observed in C1 coumarin derivative-treated animals. Collectively, our data suggest that C1 coumarin derivative is effective antibacterial agents that minimize pathogen-induced gut inflammation and abnormal gut microbiome modulation through their antibacterial activity.
