## Exploring TRIM proteins’ role in antiviral defense against influenza A virus and respiratory coronaviruses

date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Numerous tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, identified as E3 ubiquitin ligases, participate in various viral infections through ubiquitylation, ISGylation, and SUMOylation processes. Respiratory viruses, particularly influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs), have severely threatened public health with high morbidity and mortality, causing incalculable losses. Research on the regulation of TRIM proteins in respiratory virus infections is crucial for disease prevention and control. This review introduces TRIM proteins, summarizes recent discoveries regarding their roles and molecular mechanisms in IAV and CoVs infections, discusses current research gaps, and explores potential future trends in this rapidly developing field. It aims to enhance understanding of virus–host interactions and inform the development of new molecularly targeted therapies.

## Pediatric endocarditis - a stone left after the pandemic cascade

date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Infective endocarditis is a rare disease in children. The etiology is mainly bacterial. However, viral infective endocarditis, possibly related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has also been reported. The pathophysiological principle of the connection between the two entities seems to be attributed to the transient immune deficiency of the body during the infection. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 is reported in the literature as a direct cardiopathic virus. Therefore, the new coronavirus seems to have the ability to affect both the intact cardiac tissue and the previously damaged one both during the acute episode and at a distance from it. Consequently, we propose to review the main pathophysiological aspects of pediatric cardiac damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. The ultimate goal is to deepen existing knowledge, broaden the horizon of understanding and analysis regarding the systemic damage induced by viral infections, and strengthen an information base from which to start a meta-analysis. Next, we performed a non-systematized screening of the specialized literature with reference to cases of endocarditis in the pediatric population, reported in the period 2020–2023. From the total of articles found, we chose to include in the review a number of 6 case reports, including a number of 7 patients (5 children and 2 adolescents). Analysis of reports suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection could play a role in the development of endocarditis, either directly through active infection or indirectly through a post-infectious immune response. Also, pre-existing conditions and complex medical history predispose to an increased risk of developing a severe, complicated form of endocarditis. Also, the lack of data on the vaccination history and the failure to categorize the infection depending on the type of antibodies (IgM or IgG) in some studies represent a major bias in the reports. The latter make it difficult to evaluate the influence of vaccination and the impact of acute versus chronic infection on the course of cases.

## Long-term stability of acquired drug resistance and resistance associated mutations in the fungal pathogen Nakaseomyces glabratus (Candida glabrata)

date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The limited number of available antifungal drugs and the increasing number of fungal isolates that show drug or multidrug resistance pose a serious medical threat. Several yeast pathogens, such as Nakaseomyces glabratus (Candida glabrata), show a remarkable ability to develop drug resistance during treatment through the acquisition of genetic mutations. However, how stable this resistance and the underlying mutations are in non-selective conditions remains poorly characterized. The stability of acquired drug resistance has fundamental implications for our understanding of the appearance and spread of drug-resistant outbreaks and for defining efficient strategies to combat them. Here, we used an in vitro evolution approach to assess the stability under optimal growth conditions of resistance phenotypes and resistance-associated mutations that were previously acquired under exposure to antifungals. Our results reveal a remarkable stability of the resistant phenotype and the underlying mutations in a significant number of evolved populations, which conserved their phenotype for at least two months in the absence of drug-selective pressure. We observed a higher stability of anidulafungin resistance over fluconazole resistance, and of resistance-conferring point mutations as compared with aneuploidies. In addition, we detected accumulation of novel mutations in previously altered resistance-associated genes in non-selective conditions, which suggest a possible compensatory role. We conclude that acquired resistance, particularly to anidulafungin, is a long-lasting phenotype, which has important implications for the persistence and propagation of drug-resistant clinical outbreaks.

## Fulminant fatal pneumonia and bacteremia due to Aeromonas dhakensis in an immunocompetent man: a case report and literature review

date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAeromonas dhakensis is associated with soft tissue infection, bacteremia and gastroenteritis. Involvement of respiratory system in adults is extremely rare. We report a case of fulminant pneumonia and bacteremia due to A. dhakensis in a patient without underlying diseases.Case presentationA 26-year-old man became ill suddenly with pneumonia after swimming in a river. Despite intensive support measures in the intensive care unit, he died 13 hours after admission and 4 days after his first symptoms. Autopsy showed abundant Gram-negative bacteria, massive inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, necrosis and hemorrhage in lung tissue. A. dhakensis was isolated from blood culture taken at admission and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) after intubation. Moreover, A. dhakensis was also detected in lung tissue by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay. The infection may have come from river water.ConclusionIn patients who develop a fulminant pneumonia after contacting an aquatic environment, A. dhakensis should be alerted and mNGS may aid in the detection of aquatic pathogens by being more sensitive and specific versus traditional bacterial culture.

## Coumarin derivatives ameliorate the intestinal inflammation and pathogenic gut microbiome changes in the model of infectious colitis through antibacterial activity

date: 2024-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Coumarin, a phenolic compound, is a secondary metabolite produced by plants such as Tanga and Lime. Coumarin derivatives were prepared via Pechmann condensation. In this study, we performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine the antimicrobial and gut immune-regulatory functions of coumarin derivatives. For the in vitro antimicrobial activity assay, coumarin derivatives C1 and C2 were selected based on their pathogen-killing activity against various pathogenic microbes. We further demonstrated that the selected coumarin derivatives disrupted bacterial cell membranes. Next, we examined the regulatory function of the coumarin derivatives in gut inflammation using an infectious colitis model. In an in vivo infectious colitis model, administration of selected C1 coumarin derivatives reduced pathogen loads, the number of inflammatory immune cells (Th1 cells and Th17 cells), and inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6 and IL-1b) in the intestinal tissue after pathogen infection. In addition, we found that the administration of C1 coumarin derivatives minimized abnormal gut microbiome shift-driven pathogen infection. Potential pathogenic gut microbes, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcaceae, were increased by pathogen infection. However, this pathogenic microbial expansion was minimized and beneficial bacteria, such as Ligilactobacillus and Limosilactobacillus, increased with C1 coumarin derivative treatment. Functional gene enrichment assessment revealed that the relative abundance of genes associated with lipid and nucleotide metabolism was reduced by pathogen infection; however, this phenomenon was not observed in C1 coumarin derivative-treated animals. Collectively, our data suggest that C1 coumarin derivative is effective antibacterial agents that minimize pathogen-induced gut inflammation and abnormal gut microbiome modulation through their antibacterial activity.
