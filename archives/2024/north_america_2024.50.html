approves national security memo on China, Iran, North Korea and Russia
ahead of Trump’s return</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden has approved a new national security
memorandum ahead of Donald Trump’s return to the White House that could
serve as a road map for the incoming administration as it looks to
counter growing cooperation among China, Iran, North Korea and Russia,
the White House said Wednesday. </p>
<p>Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this
summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next
administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it deals with the
tightening relationships involving America’s most prominent adversaries
and competitors, according to two senior administration officials. </p>
<p>The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground
rules set by the White House, said the classified memorandum would not
be made public because of the sensitivity of some of its findings. </p>
<p>The document includes four broad recommendations: improving U.S.
government interagency cooperation, speeding up the sharing of
information with allies about the four adversaries, calibrating the U.S.
government’s use of sanctions and other economic tools for maximum
effectiveness, and bolstering preparation to manage simultaneous crises
involving the adversaries. </p>
<p>The U.S. for many years has been concerned about cooperation among
the four countries. Coordination has accelerated between the countries
in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. </p>
<p>The officials noted that as Russia has become more isolated by much
of the world, Moscow has turned to Iran for drones and missiles. From
North Korea, the Russians have received artillery, missiles and even
thousands of troops that have traveled to help the Russians try to repel
Ukrainian forces from the Kursk region. China, meanwhile, has supported
Russia with dual use components that help keep its military industrial
base afloat. </p>
<p>In return, Russia has sent fighter jets to Iran and assisted Tehran
as it looks to bolster its missile defense and space technology. </p>
<p>North Korea has received from Russia much-needed fuel and funding to
help build out its manufacturing and military capabilities. The
officials added that Russia has “de facto accepted North Korea as a
nuclear weapon state.” </p>
<p>China, meanwhile, is benefiting from Russian know-how, with the two
countries working together to deepen their military technical
cooperation. The two nations are also conducting joint patrols in the
Arctic region. </p>
<p>Biden and Trump have sharply different worldviews, but officials in
both the incoming and outgoing administrations said they have sought to
coordinate on national security issues during the transition. </p>
<p>One of the officials said that the Biden White House memo “isn’t
trying to box (the Trump administration) in or tilt them toward one
policy option or another.” </p>
<p>The official said the document is intended to help the next
administration build “capacity” as it shapes its policies on some the
most difficult foreign policies it will face.</p>

<h2 id="in-5-americans-now-bet-on-sports">2 in 5 Americans now bet on
sports</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
40% of Americans say they bet on sports through casinos or apps.
Americans are projected to bet $150 billion on sports this year — that’s
more than the entire annual budget of the state of New York. Today,
we’ll consider what’s behind America’s sports betting boom. But first:
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced new data release
procedures, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wants to crack
down on sensitive data sales.

The Chinese electric automaker BYD is entering a new stage in its
history. Last month, it
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/byd-track-top-2024-sales-goal-outsell-ford-honda-2024-12-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sold</u></a>

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> It’s been clear since Trump pulled out
of the Paris Agreement, to some degree, that China was trying to race
ahead in these clean technologies in a way that America was not. But I
feel like the full arrival of the Chinese EV industry in the U.S.
discourse has only happened in the past year. Can you zoom out and just
give us a sense of how we went from the Chinese car industry being … not
a joke, necessarily, but not really seen as a serious global competitor,
to now, where the Chinese EV industry is shaping U.S. and European
policy at the highest levels?<br/> <br/> <strong>Ilaria Mazzocco:
</strong>I actually think the fact that the traditional internal
combustion engine automotive industry in China was so uncompetitive is
part of the reason why we’re here, right? So the Chinese government for
decades tried to come up with ways of getting a world-class industry. So
it’s like, you know, to access the Chinese market, you have to create a
joint venture, and the government picked — usually it was state-owned
enterprises, which are not known for their dynamism and creativity and
innovation.<br/> <br/> And in fact the car companies that did do better
in China were often sort of the private, or like the small state-owned
enterprises that were sort of coming in from the margins and maybe
struggled to get a license to operate initially — like Geely, right?
Geely was sort of a classic example of that. <br/> <br/> But
essentially, by around the global financial crisis, there was the sense
that this just wasn’t working. And this was also at a time when the
Chinese bureaucracy is starting to think more and more about industrial
upgrading. Salaries in China are going up. So you want to think of
what’s next steps as maybe textiles and other sort of lower-end
manufacturing moves outside of China. And so the thinking was, well, why
don’t we invest and put our weight behind the next-generation technology
in automotive, and sort of invest in that. And that way, we’re competing
on a level playing field. <br/> <br/> Ironically, that’s sort of the
idea — or in the sense that, you know, you’re not competing with
companies that have been accumulating IP for over 100 years, you’re sort
of playing … Chinese companies may have even an advantage if they start
early. <br/> <br/> This was sort of the brainchild of the minister at
the time, the minister of science and technology, who was an auto guy,
Wan Gang. And so this was a fairly small project, to be honest. This
wasn’t something that the secretary of the party or the premier who came
up with it. It was a ministry-level initiative. There were four
ministries working on it, but yeah, pretty small. It was really pilot
city programs, not a big success initially — kind of expensive — but
they stick with it. And that’s kind of the key there, right? So that’s
what the big advantage that the Chinese bureaucracy has, that it can
have that policy continuity. These are not politicized things, issues.
These are, there’s also not, there’s no voters there looking at the
budget and saying, <em><em>You’re spending a ton of money on this
unproven technology.</em></em> And so that’s one advantage.<br/> <br/>
What I also like to point out is that it was the right time. This is,
they started the program to commercialize, right? Obviously there’d been
R&amp;D grants and that sort of thing, but there’s a program to start
actually giving consumers rebates to buy EVs and incentivizing taxi
fleets, which was pretty crucial in China, and bus fleets to electrify
self-starts around 2009, 2010. And you know, in those years, that’s also
when Tesla is starting to emerge, right? This is a moment in which the
technology is … not mature, but it’s mature enough that it can actually
make real strides when it starts to be commercialized. <br/> <br/> And
then the third part is you had really good entrepreneurs. You had BYD
that was just there lobbying to get this. You actually had Tesla in
there trying to get more incentives for this, as well. But, you know,
you had Chinese companies like BYD that were really at the margins and
quite hungry that really took up this opportunity and started investing
and really believed in it. So I think you had that combination of
factors and, you know, now we’re like 15 years later, I think we’re
seeing the results of it. <br/> <br/> I will say it doesn’t always work
that way. To an extent, there’s an element of luck, right? This is the
problem with industrial policy. You can do the work right in the
research and you can get it right, but it’s still not a … you don’t
always know that it’s going to work out. And I give the example of fuel
cell technology. They received the same types of subsidies, fuel cell
passenger vehicles in China. And that, you know, we’re nowhere close to
seeing a mass market for that.

id="atmospheric-river-and-potential-bomb-cyclone-bring-chaotic-winter-weather-to-east-coast">Atmospheric
river and potential bomb cyclone bring chaotic winter weather to East
Coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Maine — The U.S. East Coast was beginning a
whiplash-inducing stretch of weather on Wednesday that was rainy, windy
and potentially dangerous, due in part to an atmospheric river and
developing bomb cyclone.</p>
<p>Places like western Maine could see freezing rain, downpours,
unseasonably high temperatures and damaging winds — all in the span of a
day, said Derek Schroeter, a forecaster with the National Weather
Service.</p>
<p>The heavy rain and fierce winds will last until Wednesday night in
many areas, and flooding is possible in some locales, forecasters said.
Utilities were also gearing up for potential power outages from damage
caused by winds that could exceed 97 kph in some areas.</p>
<p>One of the key factors driving the weather is an atmospheric river,
which is a long band of water vapor that can transport moisture from the
tropics to more northern areas, said Schroeter, who’s based in Gray,
Maine.</p>
<p>The storm has the ability to hit New England hard because it could
tap moisture from the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of the U.S.
Southeast, and transport it to places like Maine. The state was
preparing for a “multifaceted storm” that could bring two to three
inches of rainfall in some areas, Schroeter said.</p>
<p>Similar conditions had been possible elsewhere from Tuesday night to
Wednesday night.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at the risk of slick travel (Tuesday night) with the
freezing rain,” Schroeter said, “and we are going to be watching for the
potential for flash flooding and sharp rises on streams as temperatures
rise into the 50s (10-15 Celsius).”</p>
<p>Forecasters also said the storm had the potential to include a
process that meteorologists call bombogenesis, or a “bomb cyclone.” That
is the rapid intensification of a cyclone in a short period of time, and
it has the ability to bring severe rainfall.</p>
<p>Parts of the Northeast were already preparing for bad weather. In
Maine, some schools operated on a delay on Tuesday, which began with a
few inches of snow. A flood watch for Vermont runs from Wednesday
afternoon to Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The city of Montpelier, Vermont, was advising residents to prepare
for mild flooding in the area and to elevate items in basements and low
areas that are prone to flooding. The city said Tuesday that it has been
in contact with the National Weather Service and Vermont Dam Safety and
“will be actively monitoring the river levels as this storm passes
through.”</p>
<p>Ski resorts around the Northeast were preparing visitors for a
potentially messy day on Wednesday. Stratton Mountain Resort, in
southern Vermont, posted on its website that patrons “make sure to pack
your Gore-Tex gear because it’s going to be a wet one.”</p>

id="sudan-largest-humanitarian-crisis-ever-recorded-irc-report">Sudan
largest humanitarian crisis ever recorded: IRC report</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAIRO — Sudan has become the “biggest humanitarian crisis ever
recorded” after 20 months of devastating war between rival generals, the
International Rescue Committee said in a report released Wednesday.</p>
<p>“The country accounts for 10% of all people in humanitarian need,
despite being home to less than 1% of global population,” the New
York-based organization said in their 2025 Emergency Watchlist.</p>
<p>Since April 2023, a war between the Sudanese regular army and the
paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands of people
and uprooted 12 million.</p>
<p>Nearly 9 million of those are displaced within Sudan, most in areas
with decimated infrastructure and facing the threat of mass
starvation.</p>
<p>Across the country, nearly 26 million people – around half the
population – are facing acute hunger, according to the United
Nations.</p>
<p>Famine has already been declared in the Zamzam displacement camp in
the western Darfur region, and the United Nations has said Sudan is
facing the worst humanitarian crisis in recent memory.</p>
<p>IRC’s report highlights the 20 countries at greatest risk of
humanitarian deterioration, with Sudan ranking highest on the list for
the second consecutive year.</p>
<p>They said a total of 30.4 million people were in humanitarian need
across the northeast African country, making it “the largest
humanitarian crisis since records began,” the IRC said.</p>
<p>There is no end to the war in sight, with both parties intensifying
strikes on residential areas in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The IRC warned of total “humanitarian collapse,” as the health crisis
was set to worsen and both sides continued to “choke humanitarian
access.”</p>
<p>Around 305 million people worldwide are in need of humanitarian
support, according to IRC, with 82% of them in watchlist areas such as
the occupied Palestinian territories, Myanmar, Syria, South Sudan and
Lebanon.</p>
<p>“It is clear that ‘the world is on fire’ is a daily reality for
hundreds of millions of people,” IRC chief David Miliband said.</p>
<p>“The world is being cleaved into two camps: between those born in
unstable conflict states, and those with a chance to make it in stable
states.”</p>

House wants Syrian-led process for new government after Assad’s
ouster</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration says it is in touch with all
rebel groups in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad
and wants the process of forming a new government to be led by
Syrians.</p>
<p>White House national security communications adviser John Kirby spoke
with VOA Turkish’s White House correspondent Begum Donmez Ersoz and said
whatever governance comes out of the process, Washington wants to make
sure it meets the aspirations of the Syrian people.</p>
<p>Kirby says it’s too soon to tell whether Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS),
the Sunni Islamic al-Qaida offshoot that the United States has
designated a terror group, and its leader, Mohammed al-Golani, have
undergone an ideological transformation.</p>
<p>The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: Did Israel give the United States prior notification of their
strikes on the Golan Heights and their deeper push into Syria?</p>
<p>John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser: I’m
going to let the Israelis speak to their operations, and I’m not going
to speculate about what they’re doing. I would just tell you that they
certainly have the right to self-defense. We recognize that they see
threats across that border as things unfold in Syria, and they’ve taken
some actions. … We, too, share a concern that the Israelis have over
chemical weapons and the possibility of stockpiles in Syria and the
potential use … so we’re in constant communication with the Israelis
about what they’re doing, and that will continue.</p>
<p>VOA: Does the U.S. believe that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has undergone an
ideological transformation?</p>
<p>Kirby: I think it’s too soon to tell. Mr. al-Golani is saying the
right things about inclusiveness, about not being interested in
persecuting either minorities or other groups. But I think, you know, we
have to wait and see what they actually do in terms of trying to
establish good governance. … They are still a designated terrorist
group. … Whatever kind of governance comes out of this, we want to make
sure it meets the aspirations of the Syrian people, that they have a
vote and a voice in their future. So, we want it to be a Syrian-led
process, and the United States will continue to support that kind of
process.</p>
<p>VOA: There is a concern in Turkey about the potential of an
independent Kurdish state in northern Syria. How will the United States
mitigate Turkey’s concerns?</p>
<p>Kirby: They have legitimate concerns in terms of the safety and
security of people inside Turkey. I know right now, Syria is kind of
coming to the fore because of the news over the weekend, but it’s not as
if we haven’t continually, over the last four years, had conversations
with the Turks about their concerns along that border. And quite
frankly, sharing with them our concerns about what we’re trying to do
against ISIS, partnering with the Syrian Democratic Forces. So, where
those two levels of concerns overlap, or maybe conflict, we have the
ability and have executed the ability to have conversations with the
Turks to try to sort all this out.</p>
<p>VOA: The United States is talking to Turkey for information on the
whereabouts of journalist Austin Tice. Can you share more on those
talks?</p>
<p>Kirby: I won’t get into the details of the discussions. … We’re still
trying to get more context and information about Austin — where he is,
what condition he might be in. We obviously talked to the Turks about
this … but we also talked to other counterparts in the region. Those
conversations are ongoing. As the president said on Sunday, we want to
see him back home with his family where he belongs, and we’ll continue
to have the level of engagement in the region to see if we can bring
about that outcome.</p>
<p>VOA: President-elect Donald Trump has signaled a hands-off approach
in Syria. What would be the danger of that for U.S. interests in the
region?</p>
<p>Kirby: Well, we’ll let Mr. Trump speak to his plans when he comes
into office. We believe there are two things keenly in America’s
national security interest. Number 1 is the transition, peaceful
transition, to legitimate governance in Syria that is a Syrian-led
process. … The second thing that’s very much in our national security
interest is making sure that ISIS cannot regenerate the capabilities
like it had in 2014 and cannot exploit the current uncertainty in Syria
to their own advantage.</p>
<p>VOA: Syria was an important playground for Iran and the Shia
Crescent. That has been broken now. Do you think Iran’s ambitions over
the Middle East are over?</p>
<p>Kirby: I think only [the] supreme leader can answer that particular
question. … As Iran wakes up and looks at the region, it is different,
and their axis of resistance has been broken in many, many places. … And
they, too, have been weakened as a military and as a capability, just in
terms of, for instance, air defense. … That said, I can’t tell you that,
as we look at the world today, that we see Iran giving up on their
hegemonic ambitions in the region. They certainly are not as capable of
executing those visions and that ambition, but I haven’t seen anything
that would indicate that that they’re turning a blind eye to trying to
pursue those kinds of ambitions.</p>
<p>VOA: Would the United States accept a hard-line government under HTS
in Syria that would contain Iran, as Golani alluded to in his
speech?</p>
<p>Kirby: What we want to see in terms of governance in Syria is
governance that is seen as credible and legitimate, that is sustainable,
that meets the aspirations of the Syrian people, and that is the result,
the product, of a Syrian-led process to get them to that point. I think
it’s too soon to know exactly how it’s all going to unfold, and we’re
watching this real, real close.</p>

<h2 id="bill-to-protect-journalists-fails-in-us-senate">Bill to protect
journalists fails in US Senate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A shield law known as the PRESS Act that would give
journalists greater federal protections failed to pass the Senate on
Tuesday evening after it was blocked by Senator Tom Cotton.  </p>
<p>Shield laws protect journalists from being forced by the government
to disclose information such as the identities of sources. The PRESS Act
would also limit the seizure of journalists’ data without their
knowledge.  </p>
<p>Nearly every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has either a
shield law or court recognition of qualified privilege for sources, but
no federal law is in place.  </p>
<p>The Republican-controlled House of Representatives unanimously passed
the PRESS Act in January.  </p>
<p>But an attempt to pass the bill in the Senate via unanimous consent
failed Tuesday evening after being blocked by Cotton. Any single senator
has the power to halt a bill put forward by a unanimous consent
request. </p>
<p>In a speech, Cotton, a Republican, said he was blocking the bill over
national security concerns.  </p>
<p>“Passage of this bill would turn the United States Senate into the
active accomplice of deep-state leakers, traitors and criminals, along
with the America-hating and fame-hungry journalists who help them out,”
Cotton said. </p>
<p>“Contrary to what members of the press may think, a press badge
doesn’t make you better than the rest of America,” Cotton later added.
 </p>
<p>The PRESS Act makes exceptions for terrorism and other
emergencies. </p>
<p>Democratic Senator Ron Wyden made a rebuttal after Cotton’s speech.
 </p>
<p>“I understand that we don’t have unanimous consent today. I think
it’s unfortunate. I think America would be stronger and freer if we were
passing this legislation today. But we’ll be back,” Wyden said.  </p>
<p>“This is about as important as it gets. Free speech is fundamental to
what makes our country so special,” Wyden said later. </p>
<p>Press freedom groups expressed disappointment over the bill’s failure
to pass. </p>
<p>“This is a commonsense bill with broad bipartisan support,” Gabe
Rottman, policy director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press, told VOA. “It’s time to get it across the finish line.”  </p>
<p>After President-elect Donald Trump won election to the White House in
November, several press freedom groups said they were making a final
push to get the bill through Congress and signed into law before
President Joe Biden left office.  </p>
<p>Trump has previously threatened to jail journalists if they don’t
reveal sources in stories he believes have national security
implications.  </p>
<p>And last month, he called on Republicans to “kill this bill” in a
post on Truth Social. </p>
<p>Now, the only way that the PRESS Act could pass the Senate is either
by attaching it to a year-end spending bill or bringing it up for a
stand-alone vote, according to the Freedom of the Press Foundation, or
FPF.  </p>
<p>“We need more than speeches about the PRESS Act’s importance. We need
action. Senate Democrats had all year to move this bipartisan bill, and
now time is running out,” FPF’s advocacy director Seth Stern said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>“Hopefully, today was a preview of more meaningful action to come,”
Stern said.</p>
<p>The PRESS Act’s failure comes on the same day that a Justice
Department report revealed that federal prosecutors ignored Justice
Department rules when they seized journalists’ phone records as part of
a media leak investigation during the Trump administration.</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Donald Trump has signaled he wants to avoid involvement in Syria
following an insurgent group’s ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.
However, as White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports, the
president-elect might need to balance his stance with U.S. goals of
protecting Israel, isolating Iran, and dealing with Russia, Turkey and
other actors.</p>

<h2 id="how-us-foreign-policy-is-made">How US foreign policy is
made</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — When most people think of U.S. foreign policy, they
picture the president. The president, to be sure, is the nation’s chief
executive and its chief foreign policy architect. But he is not the only
one calling the shots, and his power has limits.</p>
<p>Consider what U.S. presidents can and cannot do. They can deploy the
U.S. military around the world but cannot declare war — that power rests
with Congress. They can enter into executive agreements with other
countries but not treaties, which require Senate approval. They can
establish ties with a foreign government but cannot send a dime’s worth
of aid without Congressional appropriation.</p>
<p>Presidents often find their powers tested after they enter office.
During his first term in office, then-President Donald Trump pulled out
of the Paris agreement on climate change and a nuclear deal with Iran,
but his campaign pledge to rein in North Korea’s nuclear weapons program
and end “endless wars” in the Middle East remained unfulfilled.
President Joe Biden’s administration then rejoined the Paris agreement
and pulled U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, but he failed to revive the
Iran nuclear deal.</p>
<p>“There are limits to what a president can do and that is because of
the number of actors that are involved and the number of checks and
balances that do exist,” said David McKean, former director of policy
planning for the State Department and staff director for the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, who served as ambassador to Luxemburg.</p>
<p>Historically, foreign policy was the president’s domain, with
significant Congressional input, according to Thomas Schwartz, a
historian of U.S. foreign policy at Vanderbilt University. In the 18th
and 19th centuries, the State Department was small, and the executive
bureaucracy limited.</p>
<p>As the U.S. grew in power in the 20th century, so did its foreign
policymaking apparatus.</p>
<p>“Today’s foreign policy machinery is enormous, committed to billions
of dollars and thousands of persons involved, in the military,
political, economic arms of the United States,” Schwartz told VOA. “The
one thing that probably is consistent is that the role of the president
… is now much more in the forefront.”</p>
<p>A model of the U.S. foreign policymaking process, developed by the
late political scientist Roger Hilsman, includes three circles:</p>
<pre><code>The inner circle:  The president and his close advisers, including his national security adviser who usually heads National Security Council meetings
The middle circle: Key executive branch departments and agencies – the departments of State and Defense, the military&#39;s high command, the intelligence community
The outer circle: Congress and a variety of other actors, including interest groups, corporations, think tanks, foreign governments – all vying for influence</code></pre>
<p>“There is no doubt that the institutional architecture of foreign
policy has gotten much, much bigger,” McKean said.</p>
<p>For example, the State Department, a small agency with 700 employees
in the 1930s, has expanded to a 70,000-strong bureaucracy, McKean
noted.</p>
<p>The NSC</p>
<p>The NSC is the nerve center of the foreign policymaking machinery.
Created in 1947, the office, located next door to the White House, has
expanded in size and scope. Its principal members include the president,
the vice president, the secretaries of state and defense and other top
officials. McKean calls this the “president’s own foreign policy
team.”</p>
<p>The national security adviser’s influence has changed from
administration to administration. However, the adviser, McKean said, has
the ear of the president while the secretary of State is often
traveling.”</p>
<p>When a crisis erupts, such as the fall of the Assad regime in Syria,
the NSC swings into action. To help the president decide on a course of
action, the national security adviser calls an emergency “principals
meeting,” while NSC staff put together options for discussion.</p>
<p>“When you’re dealing with an immediate crisis like Assad, you’ve got
no time, you’ve got negative time,” said Gordon Adams, an emeritus
professor of international relations at American University who served
on the NSC in the 1990s. “Cars have to pick up principles and whisk them
to the White House, and those meetings start at any hour of the day or
night and happen with great urgency.”</p>
<p>Congress</p>
<p>With the president in charge of foreign policy, a change in
administration can result in significant policy shifts. But often there
is more continuity than change.  </p>
<p>That is because the president is not the only actor shaping foreign
policy.  As a co-equal branch of government, Congress plays an important
role. Though not given a specific role in foreign affairs, Congress can
provide oversight of policy decisions and pass legislation to shape
policy. </p>
<p>Most importantly, Congress controls the budget, Adams said. This
means it can influence how much money is spent on foreign aid, military
operations and other international initiatives. For example,
President-elect Trump has promised a mass deportation of undocumented
migrants, but he’ll need congressional funding to make it happen.</p>
<p>“Congress is going to have a voice in what the legislative term
language is around that process and around the money that is actually
appropriated for that process,” Adams said.</p>
<p>Other actors</p>
<p>As the foreign policy machinery has grown over the years, so too has
the influence of outside actors. These include corporations, interest
groups, think tanks, foreign governments, the media and the public.</p>
<p>“That is also an area where I think there’s been a huge increase in
influence so that corporations increasingly play a big role in foreign
policy because so much of what goes on in terms of trade involves
multinational corporations,” McKean said.</p>
<p>Foreign allies can also influence U.S. foreign policy, though this
varies from issue to issue and administration to administration, Adams
said. He noted that in the 1990s, then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair
persuaded a reluctant President Bill Clinton to intervene in the
Balkans.</p>
<p>With so many actors involved in the U.S. foreign policymaking
process, the system can seem bewildering to policymakers in other
Western democracies, Adams said.</p>
<p>“They don’t have this kind of sloppy all-over-the-place set of
display of interests and the ambitions and agendas that we have in the
American policy process,” Adams said. “So in a way, we have one of the
least efficient policy processes of Western democracies.”</p>

id="trump-says-hell-name-andrew-ferguson-head-of-ftc-kimberly-guilfoyle-as-ambassador-to-greece">Trump
says he’ll name Andrew Ferguson head of FTC, Kimberly Guilfoyle as
ambassador to Greece</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump made another flurry of job
announcements on Tuesday, selecting Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of
the Federal Trade Commission, Ron Johnson was nominated to be ambassador
to Mexico, and Kimberly Guilfoyle to be ambassador to Greece.</p>
<p>Ferguson, who is already one of the FTC’s five commissioners, will
replace Lina Khan, who became a lightning rod for Wall Street and
Silicon Valley by blocking billions of dollars’ worth of corporate
acquisitions and suing Amazon and Meta while alleging anticompetitive
behavior.</p>
<p>“Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship,
and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country,” Trump wrote on
Truth Social, adding, “Andrew will be the most America First, and
pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country’s History.”</p>
<p>Tom Barrack was chosen as the nominee for ambassador to Turkey.
Barrack, a wealthy financier, met Trump in the 1980s while helping
negotiate Trump’s purchase of the renowned Plaza Hotel. He was charged
with using his personal access to the former president to secretly
promote the interests of the United Arab Emirates but was acquitted of
all counts at a federal trial in 2022.</p>
<p>Trump called him a “well-respected and experienced voice of
reason.”</p>
<p>Johnson — not the Republican senator — served as ambassador to El
Salvador during Trump’s first administration. His nomination comes as
the president-elect has been threatening tariffs on Mexican imports and
the mass deportation of migrants who have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico
border. Johnson is also a former U.S. Army veteran and was in the
Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>Guilfoyle is a former California prosecutor and television news
personality who led the fundraising for Trump’s 2020 campaign and became
engaged to Don Jr. in 2020. Trump called her “a close friend and ally”
and praised her “sharp intellect make her supremely qualified.”
Guilfoyle was on stage with the family on election night.</p>
<p>“I am so proud of Kimberly. She loves America and she always has
wanted to serve the country as an Ambassador. She will be an amazing
leader for America First,” Don Jr. posted.</p>
<p>The ambassador positions must be approved by the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Guilfoyle said in a social media post that she was “honored to accept
President Trump’s nomination to serve as the next Ambassador to Greece
and I look forward to earning the support of the U.S. Senate.”</p>
<p>Trump also announced Tuesday that he had selected Jacob Helberg as
the next undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the
environment, and Dan Bishop as deputy director for budget at the Office
of Budget and Management.</p>
<p>The replacement of Khan at the FTC likely means that the commission
will operate with a lighter touch when it comes to antitrust
enforcement. The new chair is expected to appoint new directors of the
FTC’s antitrust and consumer protection divisions.</p>
<p>“These changes likely will make the FTC more favorable to business
than it has been in recent years, though the extent to which is to be
determined,” wrote Anthony DiResta, a consumer protection attorney at
Holland &amp; Knight, in a recent analysis.</p>
<p>Deals that were blocked by the Biden administration could find new
life with Trump in command.</p>
<p>For example, the new leadership could be more open to a proposed
merger between the country’s two biggest supermarket chains, Kroger and
Albertsons, which forged a $24.6 billion deal to combine in 2022. Two
judges halted the merger Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The FTC had filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to
block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading
to higher prices and lower wages for workers. The two companies say a
merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals
like Walmart.</p>
<p>One of the judges said the FTC had shown it was likely to prevail in
the administrative hearing.</p>
<p>Yet given the widespread public concern over high grocery prices, the
Trump administration may not fully abandon the FTC’s efforts to block
the deal, some experts have said.</p>
<p>And the FTC may continue to scrutinize Big Tech firms for any
anticompetitive behavior. Many Republican politicians have accused firms
such as Meta of censoring conservative views, and some officials in
Trump’s orbit, most notably Vice President-elect JD Vance, have
previously expressed support for Khan’s scrutiny of Big Tech firms.</p>

id="us-moves-to-save-once-common-monarch-butterflies-from-extinction">US
moves to save once-common monarch butterflies from extinction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States is moving to grant federal protections
to the monarch butterfly — a once-common species recognizable by its
striking black and orange patterns that has faced a dramatic population
decline in recent decades.</p>
<p>The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) said Tuesday it has initiated a
public comment period to consider listing the insect under the
Endangered Species Act.</p>
<p>But the looming presidency of Donald Trump, who rolled back numerous
wildlife protections during his first term, casts uncertainty over the
decision.</p>
<p>“The iconic monarch butterfly is cherished across North America,
captivating children and adults throughout its fascinating lifecycle,”
said FWS Director Martha Williams in a statement. “Despite its
fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when
we just give them a chance.”</p>
<p>The proposed listing comes at a critical time for the species, which
has been designated as endangered by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature since 2022.</p>
<p>Monarchs are divided into two migratory populations in North America.
The larger eastern group has declined by approximately 80% since the
1980s, while the western population has plummeted by 95%.</p>
<p>According to the FWS, the species faces a host of threats, including
the loss and degradation of its breeding, migratory and overwintering
habitats; exposure to insecticides; and the growing impacts of climate
change.</p>
<p>As part of its conservation efforts, the FWS is also recommending the
designation of critical habitat at specific overwintering sites along
California’s coast. These habitats serve as vital winter refuges,
providing monarchs the resources needed to rest and prepare for spring
breeding.</p>
<p>“The fact that a butterfly as widespread and beloved as the monarch
is now the face of the extinction crisis is a tri-national distress
signal warning us to take better care of the environment that we all
share,” said Tierra Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for
Biological Diversity.</p>
<p>“For 30 years, we’ve watched the population of monarch butterflies
collapse. It is clear that monarchs cannot thrive — and might not
survive — without federal protections,” added Dan Ritzman, director of
conservation at Sierra Club.</p>
<p>The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is widely credited with saving
iconic American species such as the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly
bear.</p>
<p>During Trump’s first administration, however, key provisions of the
law were weakened. These changes, later reversed by President Joe Biden,
included measures that allowed industrial projects such as roads,
pipelines and mines in areas designated as critical habitat for
vulnerable species.</p>
<p>Trump’s administration also removed endangered species protections
for gray wolves across most of the United States and slashed critical
habitat designated for northern spotted owls.</p>

says review of Nippon-US Steel tie-up ongoing as US Steel shares
tumble</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A national security review of Nippon Steel’s $15 billion bid for U.S.
Steel is ongoing and President Joe Biden will see what it yields before
making a decision on whether to block it, the White House said on
Tuesday, cautioning he still opposes the tie-up.</p>
<p>The statement comes after shares of U.S. Steel tumbled more than 10%
on Tuesday afternoon following a Bloomberg report suggesting the deal
would be killed in short order.</p>
<p>CFIUS, a powerful committee charged with reviewing foreign
investments in U.S. firms for national security risks, has until
December 22 to make a decision on whether to approve, block or extend
the timeline for the deal’s review, Reuters has reported.</p>
<p>“The President’s position since the beginning is that it is vital for
U.S. Steel to be domestically owned and operated,” Saloni Sharma, a
White House spokesperson said in a statement. “As we have said before,
the President will continue to see what the CFIUS process yields. We
have not received any CFIUS recommendation. The CFIUS process was and
remains ongoing.”</p>
<p>Bloomberg’s initial headline read that Biden was “set to” block the
deal, suggesting a final decision had been made, but the outlet later
updated it to say he “plans to” kill it, echoing prior comments and
leaving the door open to a last-minute change.</p>
<p>CFIUS declined to comment.</p>
<p>Japan’s Nippon Steel said it was inappropriate that politics
continued to outweigh true national security interests.</p>
<p>“Nippon Steel still has confidence in the justice and fairness of
America and its legal system, and — if necessary — will work with U.S.
Steel to consider and take all available measures to reach a fair
conclusion,” it added in a statement.</p>
<p>U.S. Steel said the transaction should be approved on its merits.</p>
<p>“The benefits are overwhelmingly clear,” it said in a statement. “Our
communities, customers, investors, and employees strongly support this
transaction, and we will continue to advocate for them and adherence to
the rule of law.”</p>
<p>The two companies are poised to pursue litigation over the process if
Biden decides to block the merger.</p>
<p>The acquisition has faced opposition within the U.S. since it was
announced last year with both Biden and his incoming successor Donald
Trump both publicly indicating their intention to block it.</p>
<p>CFIUS told the two companies in September the deal would create
national security risks because it could hurt the supply of steel needed
for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects.</p>
<p>Despite opposition, including from the United Steelworkers union,
Japan’s Nippon has pressed on in pursuit of a deal, promising to not
transfer any U.S. Steel production capacity or jobs outside the U.S. if
the merger succeeds.</p>
<p>Nippon has also said it would not interfere in any of U.S. Steel’s
decisions on trade matters, including decisions to pursue trade measures
under U.S. law against unfair trade practices.</p>
<p>In a bid to win over support from workers, Nippon Steel said on
Tuesday it planned to give employees $5,000 each if the deal with U.S.
Steel closed. It also pledged $3,160 closing bonuses to employees in
Europe, which would result in a nearly $100 million total payment to
employees.</p>

id="report-on-attempts-to-kill-trump-urges-secret-service-to-limit-protection-of-foreign-leaders">Report
on attempts to kill Trump urges Secret Service to limit protection of
foreign leaders</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A congressional task force investigating the attempts to
kill Donald Trump during his presidential campaign is recommending
changes to the Secret Service, including protecting fewer foreign
leaders during the height of election season and considering moving the
agency out of the Homeland Security Department.</p>
<p>The 180-page report by the bipartisan task force released Tuesday is
one of the most detailed looks so far into the July assassination
attempt against Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania and a
second attempt in Florida two months later.</p>
<p>Like the series of other investigations and reports, the task force
railed at the agency tasked with protecting the top echelon of America’s
democratic leaders.</p>
<p>“The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the
litany of related security failures are unacceptable,” the authors
wrote. “The Secret Service’s zero fail mission allows no margin for
error, let alone for the many errors described in this report.”</p>
<p>In the July shooting, a gunman opened fire from the roof of a nearby
building, wounding Trump in the ear, killing one rallygoer and wounding
two others. He was killed by a counter sniper.</p>
<p>In another assassination attempt in September, a gunman waited for
hours for Trump to appear at his golf course in Florida, but a Secret
Service agent thwarted the attack by spotting the firearm poking through
some bushes.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights of the new report and its
recommendations:</p>
<p>Reducing the number of people protected — specifically foreign
leaders</p>
<p>The report’s authors noted that the number of people the agency is
tasked with protecting has “greatly expanded.” At the same time, the
presidential campaign season is getting longer and more intense.</p>
<p>The agency is also tasked with protecting foreign dignitaries during
the U.N. General Assembly, when heads of state and government flood into
New York. That event happens every September, which comes at the “height
of campaign season,” the report noted, adding to the agency’s staffing
crunch.</p>
<p>“Congress, DHS, and the USSS should jointly consider the protective
role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties
can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS’s primary
duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders,” the
report said.</p>
<p>Drop some investigative work, especially during elections</p>
<p>The Secret Service is known for its high-profile work of protecting
the president, the vice president, presidential candidates, their
families and others.</p>
<p>But agents also carry out a wide range of investigations not related
to their protective mission — investigating fraud and financial crimes,
for example. Stemming from when the agency was part of the Treasury
Department, those investigations are an important part of training
Secret Service officers for skills they’ll need on protective details,
agency leaders say.</p>
<p>But the task force recommended reviewing these investigative
responsibilities — especially during campaign season — so the agency
“can prioritize the protection of U.S. leaders and candidates running
for office.”</p>
<p>Questioning whether the Secret Service should stay in the Homeland
Security Department</p>
<p>After DHS was created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks, the Secret Service was moved there from the Treasury
Department.</p>
<p>The task force suggested reevaluating that move. During the time
Secret Service has been in the Homeland Security Department, “USSS has
not benefited from stable leadership,” the lawmakers said.</p>
<p>They said the structure “potentially weakens USSS, a small but
critically important agency, in advocating for its budget and other
priorities inside a much larger entity.”</p>
<p>Staffing problems</p>
<p>The task force said the gunman in Butler, Pennsylvania, Thomas
Crooks, exploited gaps in protection because of a lack of assets and
staff.</p>
<p>Specifically, the panel noted that the Secret Service, already
dealing with the increased tempo of a presidential campaign, was
protecting not one but two high-profile people that day in close
vicinity to each other, with first lady Jill Biden at a nearby
event.</p>
<p>In one example highlighting the lack of resources at the Trump rally,
the task force said there should have been a counter-surveillance unit
in Butler, and if there had been one assigned that day, it might have
spotted the shooter earlier.</p>
<p>Such a counter-surveillance team was in place for the Biden event,
the report noted, although that event was indoors.</p>
<p>“From interviews with special agents on the ground, it appears that
the main factor in the decision to not request [the counter-surveillance
unit] was an assumption that the request would be denied due to the
protectee’s status as a former President at the time of the event,” the
report said.</p>
<p>Pointing to bad communication, faulty planning</p>
<p>Much of the criticism in the aftermath of the July assassination
attempt has centered on how the shooter could have gotten access to a
roof with a clear line of sight to Trump and why there was such poor
communication between the Secret Service and local law enforcement.</p>
<p>The Secret Service often relies on local law enforcement to secure
large events. The report detailed how local law enforcement had one idea
of its responsibilities while the Secret Service had another.</p>
<p>But the task force emphasized that ultimately the Secret Service is
responsible for ensuring that coordination runs smoothly.</p>
<p>“The Secret Service must own responsibility for the security of the
site,” the report said.</p>

id="suspect-in-killing-of-ceo-struggles-shouts-while-entering-courthouse">Suspect
in killing of CEO struggles, shouts while entering courthouse</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALTOONA, PENNSYLVANIA — The suspect in the killing of
UnitedHealthcare’s CEO struggled with deputies and shouted while
arriving for a court appearance Tuesday in Pennsylvania, a day after he
was arrested at a McDonald’s and charged with murder.</p>
<p>Luigi Nicholas Mangione emerged from a patrol car, spun toward
reporters and shouted something partly unintelligible referring to an
“insult to the intelligence of the American people” while deputies
pushed him inside.</p>
<p>Prosecutors were beginning to take steps to bring Mangione back to
New York while new details emerged about his life and how he was
captured. The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland
real estate family was charged with murder hours after he was arrested
in the Manhattan killing of Brian Thompson, who led the largest U.S.
medical insurance company.</p>
<p>At the brief hearing, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey informed the court
that Mangione will not waive extradition to New York but instead wants a
hearing on the issue. Mangione was denied bail after prosecutors said he
was too dangerous to be released.</p>
<p>Mangione, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, mostly stared straight
ahead at the hearing, occasionally consulting papers, rocking in his
chair or looking back at the gallery. At one point, he began to speak to
respond to the court discussion but was quieted by his lawyer.</p>
<p>A law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press said that
at the time of his arrest, Mangione was carrying a handwritten document
expressing anger with what he called “parasitic” health insurance
companies and a disdain for corporate greed and power.</p>
<p>He wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive health care system in
the world and that profits of major corporations continue to rise while
“our life expectancy” does not, according to the bulletin.</p>
<p>In social media posts, Mangione called “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski a
“political revolutionary,” according to the police bulletin. Kaczynski
carried out a series of bombings while railing against modern society
and technology.</p>
<p>Mangione remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially
charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing
false identification to police. Manhattan prosecutors have obtained an
arrest warrant, a step that could help expedite his extradition from
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>McDonald’s customer recognizes suspect</p>
<p>Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania — about 370 kilometers
(about 230 miles) west of New York City — after a McDonald’s customer
recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.</p>
<p>Officers found him sitting at a back table, wearing a blue medical
mask and looking at a laptop, according to a Pennsylvania police
criminal complaint.</p>
<p>He initially gave them a fake ID, but when an officer asked Mangione
whether he’d been to New York recently, he “became quiet and started to
shake,” the complaint says.</p>
<p>When he pulled his mask down at the officers’ request, “we knew that
was our guy,” Officer Tyler Frye said.</p>
<p>Images of Mangione released Tuesday by Pennsylvania State Police
showed him pulling down his mask in the corner of the McDonald’s while
holding what appeared to be hash browns and wearing a winter jacket and
beanie. In another photo from a holding cell, he stood unsmiling with
rumpled hair.</p>
<p>New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Mangione was carrying
a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the
suspected shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a
passport and other fraudulent IDs.</p>
<p>New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said
Mangione also had a three-page, handwritten document that shows “some
ill will toward corporate America.”</p>
<p>A law enforcement official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the
investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed
to have acted alone.</p>
<p>“To the Feds, I’ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do
for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly
that I wasn’t working with anyone,” the document said, according to the
official.</p>
<p>It also had a line that said, “I do apologize for any strife or
traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it
coming.”</p>
<p>Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a
Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Police quickly came to
consider the shooting as a targeted attack by a gunman who appeared to
wait for Thompson, came up behind him and fired a 9 mm pistol.</p>
<p>Investigators have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on
ammunition found near Thompson’s body. The words mimic “delay, deny,
defend,” a phrase used to criticize the insurance industry.</p>
<p>From surveillance video, New York investigators determined the
shooter quickly fled the city, likely by bus.</p>
<p>Suspect’s family prays for victim’s family</p>
<p>A grandson of a wealthy, self-made real estate developer and
philanthropist, Mangione is a cousin of a current Maryland state
legislator.</p>
<p>Valedictorian at his elite Baltimore prep school, he went on to earn
undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science in 2020 from the
University of Pennsylvania, a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,” Mangione’s
family said in a statement posted on social media late Monday by his
cousin, Maryland Delegate Nino Mangione. “We offer our prayers to the
family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all
involved.”</p>
<p>From January to June 2022, Luigi Mangione lived at Surfbreak, a
“co-living” space at the edge of touristy Waikiki in Honolulu.</p>
<p>Like other residents of the shared penthouse catering to remote
workers, Mangione underwent a background check, said Josiah Ryan, a
spokesperson for owner and founder R.J. Martin.</p>
<p>“Luigi was just widely considered to be a great guy. There were no
complaints,” Ryan said. “There was no sign that might point to these
alleged crimes they’re saying he committed.”</p>
<p>At Surfbreak, Martin learned Mangione had severe back pain from
childhood that interfered with many aspects of his life, from surfing to
romance, Ryan said.</p>
<p>Mangione left Surfbreak to get surgery on the mainland, Ryan said,
then later returned to Honolulu and rented an apartment.</p>
<p>Martin stopped hearing from Mangione six months to a year ago.</p>

Are Expecting a Natural Gas Boom. Will They Get It?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTI0MjQ3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MzkyNzI3MH0.-bSZ0NnJx3LgxPt-u5QOUSlILjV7kiaKOD7V7lXw1n4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When you think of companies whose valuations are soaring due to
artificial intelligence, the ones that come to mind first are probably
the chip designer Nvidia, whose shares are up 180% this year, or Elon
Musk’s xAI, which its investors recently valued at
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musks-startup-xai-valued-at-50-billion-in-new-funding-round-7e3669dc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$50
billion</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But aside from those, some of the best performing companies of this year
have been those that own or supply equipment for the power plants that
generate the energy to run all that AI infrastructure in the first
place.
</p>
<p>
GE Vernova’s gas turbine orders have almost doubled so far this year,
chief executive Scott Strazik
<a href="https://www.gevernova.com/sites/default/files/gev_webcast_transcript_10232024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in an October earnings call</u></a>; since then, the company has secured
orders for another nearly 9 gigawatts’ worth of turbines in the U.S.,
the company said in an
<a href="https://www.gevernova.com/sites/default/files/gev_investor_update_presentation_12102024.pdf" target="_blank">investor
presentation</a> Tuesday. “I can’t think of a time that the gas business
has had more fun than they’re having right now,” Strazik told investors.
The company’s stock is up almost 150% from the end of 2023.
</p>
<p>
Vistra, which owns over 40,000 megawatts of generation assets, including
around 6,500 megawatts of nuclear power plants and more than two dozen
gas-fired power plants, is planning on developing 2,000 megawatts of
natural gas capacity, its chief executive Jim Burke
<a href="https://investor.vistracorp.com/2024-11-07-Vistra-Reports-Third-Quarter-2024-Results,-Raises-and-Narrows-2024-Guidance,-and-Initiates-2025-Guidance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in November</u>; its share price</a> is up 272% for the year. The
utility Entergy, which last week
<a href="https://www.entergynewsroom.com/news/meta-selects-northeast-louisiana-as-site-10-billion-data-center/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed
a deal with Meta</u></a> to power a planned data center in northeastern
Louisiana, is up 45%. Compare those impressive results to the S&amp;P
500, which is up a healthy but comparatively modest 27% on the year.
</p>
<p>
Much of that enthusiasm comes from huge expected increases in energy
demand. Grid Strategies, an energy policy consulting firm, last week
updated its forecast for energy demand growth over the next five years,
raising it from an increase of 39 gigawatts as of the end of 2023 to a
rise of <em><em>128 gigawatts</em></em>. That works out to annual
projected growth of around 3%, compared to less than 1% annual growth in
the first two decades of this century.
</p>
<p>
Where will all that additional energy come from? “Quite frankly, in the
next five years, we’re going to see a lot of new gas turbines being
built,” Cy McGeady, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, told me, adding that the “prospects are good for
a natural gas boom.”
</p>
<p>
The data centers that are driving renewable demand tend to require a
constant flow of energy at all times — except when their
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>power
demands surge</u></a> — while renewables are intermittent and may be far
away from planned load growth. While so-called hyperscalers such as
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/amazon-x-energy-nuclear-deal" target="_self"><u>Amazon</u></a>,
<a href="https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/12/03/accelerating-the-next-wave-of-nuclear-to-power-ai-innovation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Meta</u></a>,
and
<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-kairos-power-nuclear-energy-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Google</u></a>
have made deals to support the development of 24/7 clean power sources
like nuclear, the most optimistic time frame for any of these new
developments to start producing power is sometime in the early 2030s.
</p>
<p>
Rob Gramlich, the president of Grid Strategies, told me the technology
companies generating all this demand growth typically want it satisfied
with renewables, but “they really need transmission in order to do
that.”
</p>
<p>
“If everyone had done this 10 years ago, we could have connected a lot
of generation a lot quicker. It could have been a lot cleaner generation
mix,” Gramlich told me. Now, though, even if a utility wants to build
solar, wind, and storage that can provide power at costs comparable to
new gas, “it’s only available as an option if you build the grid
infrastructure ahead of time,” he said.
</p>
<p>
McGeady agrees. “It’s the only path forward,” he said of natural gas.
“Nobody is willing to <em><em>not</em></em> build the next data center
because of inability to access renewables.”
</p>
<p>
But therein lies the difficulty: While natural gas plants are not as
transmission-dependent as renewables, some analysts worry that even gas
generators won’t be able to respond quickly enough to the increase in
demand.
</p>
<p>
“When we look at the hot spots of Data Center development, in the U.S.
and around the world, we see a significant overlap with regions that
have favorable policy support for natural gas,” Morgan Stanley analysts
wrote in a note to clients. And yet, “there will in our view be a
significant shortfall in available U.S. power grid access relative to
the magnitude of new data centers needed to ‘absorb’ the AI equipment
purchases over the next several years, with the bottleneck becoming
apparent in mid-to-late 2025,” the analysts wrote.
</p>
<p>
The utilities in these areas — places like
<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/12/02/georgia-power-says-data-center-growth-will-cause-electricity-demands-to-triple-in-next-decade/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Georgia</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.aps.com/en/About/Our-Company/Newsroom/Articles/APS_Secures_its_Largest-Ever_Energy_Supply_to_Reliably_Serve_Customers#:~:text=Arizona%20Public%20Service%20(APS)%20has,state's%20growing%20demand%20for%20energy." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Arizona</u></a>,
and
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/regulators-ok-duke-energys-gas-plant-buildout-despite-n-c-climate-law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>North
Carolina</u></a> — are indeed building new natural gas capacity. In
other places where the laws and regulations aren’t as favorable to gas
development, however, analysts expect to see more data centers sited at
existing power plants. Some of those may be powered by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/coreweave-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>fossil
fuels</u></a>, as in the case of a New Jersey facility recently taken
over by the cloud computing company Core Weave, while others may wind up
taking zero-carbon power off the grid, as Amazon
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-11-4-2024/card/the-amazon-talen-deal-why-it-was-stopped-0zPgZJrJatPX0GZ2Wr38" target="_blank"><u>attempted
to do</u></a> with the Susquehanna nuclear station in Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p>
Building new natural gas capacity is more difficult in the PJM
Interconnection, the country’s largest electricity market, which spans
the Eastern Seaboard and a large chunk of the Midwest. Its leadership is
hoping high prices can
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/pjm-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>lure
new gas</u> generation</a>, but the complexity and uncertainty of the
system’s reward structure for companies that agree to supply failsafe
capacity has hindered the massive new investment PJM says it needs.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Some clean energy advocates argue that utilities are being short-sighted
in their plans to develop new gas resources that could be around for
decades — well past corporate, state, or national goals for electric
system decarbonization.
</p>
<p>
“They’re used to building gas plants more so than they’re used to
building other things. It reflects a lack of creativity on their part,”
Michelle Solomon, a senior policy analyst at Energy Innovation, told me.
</p>
<p>
But until
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ferc-transmission-planning-rule" target="_self"><u>the
system for building and paying</u></a> for transmission can be reformed
to clarify who pays for what and what transmission can be built where —
<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/experts-react-senators-manchin-and-barrasso-announce-permitting-reform-bill" target="_blank"><u>as
federal regulators and Congress are trying to do</u></a> — utilities
will likely default to what they know best.
</p>
<p>
“The difficulty of building transmission certainly can constrain
utilities’ ability to serve new load, and it can constrain the ability
to serve the load with clean generation,” Gramlich told me.
</p>
<p>
Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie’s vice president of energy transition and
power and renewables,
<a href="https://www.woodmac.com/horizons/gridlock-demand-dilemma-facing-us-power-industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>echoed</u></a>
Gramlich’s thought in a note from October. “The constraint is not the
demand for renewables,” he wrote, “but the ability to get through
permitting, interconnection, and building out the transmission system
accordingly.”

including in his announcements of various economic and policy roles in
his upcoming administration. His designee for Secretary of the Interior,
Doug Burgum, for instance, will also head a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/trump-national-energy-council" target="_self">
<u>National Energy Council</u></a> that will “oversee the path to U.S.
ENERGY DOMINANCE by cutting red tape … by focusing on INNOVATION over
longstanding, but totally unnecessary, regulation.”<br/> <br/> When
Trump
<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113466208496990420" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>announced his nomination</u></a> of Lee Zeldin to head the
Environmental Protection Agency, he said Zeldin would “ensure fair and
swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash
the power of American business.”
</p>
<p>
Current interpretations of existing laws dictate that any project
constituting a major federal action (e.g. one that uses public lands)

<u>must be reviewed under the National Environmental Policy Act</u></a>,
the country’s signature permitting law. Federal courts are often asked
in litigation to sign off on whether that review process — although not
the outcome — was sufficient.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of any changes Trump may make to the federal regulatory
system as president, that infrastructure is already in flux. The D.C.
Circuit Court of Appeals recently issued a ruling that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/nepa-ruling" target="_self">

Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard a separate case on the limits of NEPA

<u>proposed rail line expansion</u></a> to transport oil from Utah’s
Uinta Basin to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. Although the court is
unlikely to issue a decision until next year, its current membership has
shown itself
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-23-supreme-court" target="_self"><u>plenty
willing</u></a> to scrap longstanding precedent in the name of cutting
the regulatory state down to size.
</p>
<p>
Trump did not support his announcement with any additional materials
laying out the legal authorities he plans to exercise to exempt these
projects from regulation or proposed legislation, but it already
attracted criticism from environmentalists, with the Sierra Club
describing it as a “plan to sell out communities and environment to the
highest bidder.It’s also unclear whether Trump was referring to
<em><em>foreign</em></em> direct investment in the United States, of
which there was $177 billion in

Treasury transfers $20 billion in Ukraine loan funds to World Bank</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday said it
transferred the $20 billion U.S. portion of a $50 billion G7 loan for
Ukraine to a World Bank intermediary fund for economic and financial
aid.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said the disbursement makes good on its
October commitment to match the European Union’s commitment to provide
$20 billion in aid backed by frozen Russian sovereign assets alongside
smaller loans from Britain, Canada and Japan to help the Eastern
European nation fight Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>The disbursement prior to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration
in January is aimed at protecting the funds from being clawed back by
his administration. Trump has complained that the United States is
providing too much aid to Ukraine and said he will end the war quickly,
without specifying how.</p>
<p>The $50 billion in credit for 30 years will be serviced with the
interest proceeds from some $300 billion in frozen Russian sovereign
assets that have been immobilized since Russia invaded in February 2022.
The Group of Seven democracies have been discussing the plan for months
and agreed on terms in October, prior to Trump’s election.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration initially sought to split the
$20 billion loan in half, with $10 billion to be used for military aid
and $10 billion for economic aid, but the military portion would have
required approval by Congress, a task made more difficult by
Republicans’ sweeping election victory. With Tuesday’s transfer, the
full amount will be devoted to nonmilitary purposes.</p>
<p>The Treasury said the funds were transferred to a new World Bank fund
called the Facilitation of Resources to Invest in Strengthening Ukraine
Financial Intermediary Fund. The global lender’s board approved the
creation of the fund in October with only one country, Russia,
objecting.</p>
<p>The bank, whose charter prevents it from handling any military aid,
has run a similar humanitarian and economic intermediary fund for
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen personally oversaw staff
executing the wire transfer of the $20 billion to the World Bank fund, a
department official said.</p>
<p>“These funds — paid for by the windfall proceeds earned from Russia’s
own immobilized assets — will provide Ukraine a critical infusion of
support as it defends its country against an unprovoked war of
aggression,” Yellen said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The $50 billion collectively being provided by the G7 through this
initiative will help ensure Ukraine has the resources it needs to
sustain emergency services, hospitals and other foundations of its brave
resistance,” she said.</p>

designates national monument at site of Carlisle Indian school</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has created a new national monument
on the grounds of a former Indian boarding school in Pennsylvania, which
served as the blueprint for hundreds of similar institutions across the
United States.</p>
<p>“I want everyone to know,” Biden said. “I don’t want people
forgetting, 10, 20, 30, 50 years from now.”</p>
<p>Indian children from 140 tribes were taken from their families,
tribes and homelands and forced to spend years at the school in the
borough of Carlisle, he noted.</p>
<p>“It was wrong, and by making the Carlisle Indian School a national
monument, we make clear that [that’s] what great nations do. We don’t
erase history. We acknowledge it. We learn from and we remember, so we
never repeat it again.”</p>
<p>Biden told the 2024 Tribal Nations Summit in Washington Monday that
the monument will encompass 10 hectares (24.5 acres) inside what is
today the Carlisle Army Barracks, including historic buildings and
structures that once made up the school’s campus. These will include the
brick and marble gateposts at the school’s entrance, which Carlisle
students built by hand in 1910.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army will maintain operational control over the site, which
is now home to the U.S. Army War College. The Army will collaborate with
the National Park Service to oversee the planning and management of the
new national monument, consulting with federally recognized tribes to
ensure that the monument accurately reflects historic and contemporary
impacts of the boarding school system on tribal members and
communities.</p>
<p>“This addition to the national park system that recognizes the
troubled history of U.S. and Tribal relations is among the giant steps
taken in recent years to honor Tribal sovereignty and recognize the
ongoing needs of Native communities, repair past damage and make
progress toward healing,” said National Park Service Director Chuck
Sams, a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian
Reservation in Northeast Oregon.</p>
<p>The announcement comes just six weeks after Biden’s visit to the Gila
River Indian Community in Arizona. There, he gave a long-awaited apology
to Native Americans for the boarding school era, calling it “one the
most consequential things I’ve ever had an opportunity to do in my whole
career as president of the United States.”</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland opened the summit with
a speech focusing on the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative she
launched in May 2021.</p>
<p>The initiative resulted in a two-volume report that documented the
history of the school system, accounting for 417 known schools and
confirming more than 900 child deaths.</p>
<p>The initiative also included The Road to Healing, in which Haaland
and Assistant Interior Secretary Bryan Newland traveled to 12 Native
communities, giving survivors and their descendants an opportunity to
share their boarding school experiences.</p>
<p>“So many of you spoke bravely and forthright[ly] … about the horrors
you endured or the trauma that was passed down over generations. Those
stories must continue to be told,” Haaland told the summit leaders.</p>
<p>As part of the initiative, the Interior Department engaged the
National Native Boarding School Healing Coalition to conduct video
interviews with boarding school survivors to create a permanent oral
history collection.</p>
<p>Haaland announced that the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian’s
National Museum of American History will partner to preserve their
accounts for the public.</p>

id="judge-could-permanently-halt-trumps-hush-money-case-while-upholding-his-conviction">Judge
could permanently halt Trump’s hush money case while upholding his
conviction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Prosecutors are urging a judge not to throw out President-elect
Donald Trump’s hush money criminal conviction but suggesting a
willingness to end the case in a way that would preserve the verdict
while avoiding punishment or a protracted legal fight.</p>
<p>In court papers made public on Tuesday, the Manhattan district
attorney’s office proposed an array of options for keeping the historic
conviction on the books, including asking Judge Juan M. Merchan to
consider treating the case the way he would when a defendant dies.</p>
<p>That would effectively put the case into a permanent state of
suspended animation. Trump’s conviction would stand, but everything
would freeze, including any appeal action. It is unclear if that option
is viable under New York law.</p>
<p>“As applied here, this Court could similarly terminate the criminal
proceeding by placing a notation in the record that the jury verdict
removed the presumption of innocence; that defendant was never
sentenced; and that his conviction was neither affirmed nor reversed on
appeal because of presidential immunity,” prosecutors wrote in an
82-page filing.</p>
<p>Among the other options prosecutors proposed was delaying sentencing
until after Trump leaves office in 2029. However, they were adamant that
the conviction should stand, arguing that Trump’s impending return to
the White House should not upend a jury’s finding.</p>
<p>The filing expands on the position the prosecutors laid out last
month. Since then, Trump’s lawyers have pressed Merchan to dismiss the
case altogether in light of his election.</p>
<p>The Trump team argues that letting the case continue would present
unconstitutional “disruptions” to his upcoming presidential term. The
attorneys also cited President Joe Biden’s recent pardon of his son
Hunter Biden, who had been convicted of tax and gun charges. Biden
complained that his son was unfairly prosecuted for political reasons —
and Trump’s lawyers say he was, too.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how soon Merchan may decide what to do next with the
case. Trump, a Republican, takes office Jan. 20.</p>
<p>He had been scheduled for sentencing late last month. But following
Trump’s Nov. 5 election victory, Merchan halted proceedings and
indefinitely postponed the former and future president’s sentencing so
the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the
case.</p>
<p>Merchan also delayed a decision on Trump’s prior bid to dismiss the
case on immunity grounds.</p>
<p>Trump has been fighting for months to reverse his conviction on 34
counts of falsifying business records. Prosecutors said he fudged the
documents to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to
suppress her claim that they had sex a decade earlier.</p>
<p>He says they did not and denies any wrongdoing. Trump portrays the
case as a political attack ginned up by D.A. Alvin Bragg and other
Democrats.</p>
<p>A dismissal would erase Trump’s historic conviction, sparing him the
cloud of a criminal record and possible prison sentence. Trump is the
first former president to be convicted of a crime and the first
convicted criminal to be elected to the office.</p>
<p>Merchan could also decide to uphold the verdict and proceed to
sentencing, delay the case until Trump leaves office, wait until a
federal appeals court rules on Trump’s parallel effort to get the case
moved out of state court or choose some other option.</p>
<p>The hush money case was the only one of Trump’s four criminal
indictments to go to trial.</p>
<p>Since the election, special counsel Jack Smith has ended his two
federal cases, which pertained to Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020
election loss and allegations that he hoarded classified documents at
his Mar-a-Lago estate. A separate state election interference case in
Fulton County, Georgia, is largely on hold. Trump denies wrongdoing in
all.</p>

burn in California as wind-driven wildfire prompts evacuations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MALIBU, CALIFORNIA — Thousands of Southern California residents were
under evacuation orders and warnings Tuesday as firefighters battled a
wind-driven wildfire in Malibu that burned near seaside mansions and
Pepperdine University, where students sheltering at the school’s library
watched as the blaze intensified and the sky turned deep red.</p>
<p>A “minimal number” of homes burned, but the exact number wasn’t
immediately known, Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony
Marrone said. More than 8,100 homes and other structures were under
threat, including more than 2,000 where residents have been ordered to
evacuate. Some 6,000 more people were warned to be prepared to evacuate
at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>Ryan Song, a resident assistant at Pepperdine University, said he
first noticed the power went out at his dorm late Monday and then looked
out the window and saw a huge pink glow.</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘This is too bright,’ and it got bigger and bigger,” the
20-year-old junior said. “I immediately went outside and saw that it was
a real fire.”</p>
<p>Song and the other resident assistants went door to door, evacuating
students. Most were calm and followed instructions, he said; a few who
were scared rushed to their cars to get off campus.</p>
<p>Song spent the next few hours racing back and forth in the dark
between his dorm and the main campus to ensure no one was left behind as
fire raged down a mountain, he said.</p>
<p>“It felt really close,” he said, adding he was probably less than a
mile away. “Seeing the fire rampaging down the hill is obviously scary
for students, but I felt like our staff was prepared.”</p>
<p>The university later said the worst of the fire had pushed past
campus.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known how the blaze, named the Franklin Fire,
started. County officials estimated that more than 9 square kilometers
of trees and dry brush had burned. There was no containment.</p>
<p>The fire burned amid dangerous conditions because of notorious Santa
Ana winds expected to last into Wednesday.</p>
<p>Marrone said at least a thousand firefighters would be scrambling to
get a handle on the blaze before 2 p.m., when winds were expected to
regain strength. “Time is of the essence for us to grab ahold of the
fire and start getting some containment,” the chief said at a morning
news conference.</p>
<p>The fire erupted shortly before 11 p.m. Tuesday and swiftly moved
south, jumping over the famous Pacific Coast Highway and extending all
the way to the ocean, where large homes line the beach and inland
canyons are notoriously fire prone. At one point, it threatened the
historic Malibu Pier, but the structure was protected and is intact,
officials said.</p>
<p>Pepperdine canceled classes and finals for the day and there was a
shelter-in-place order on campus. Helicopters dropped water collected
from lakes in the school’s Alumni Park onto the flames.</p>
<p>Firefighters with flashlights and hoses protected nearby homes
overnight, ABC 7 reported. As the sun came up Tuesday, smoke billowed
over the campus and the adjacent mountains that plunge toward the
coast.</p>
<p>North to northeast winds were forecast to increase to 48 to 64 kph
with gusts up to 105 kph expected, the National Weather Service’s office
for Los Angeles posted on social media platform X.</p>
<p>Power to about 40,000 customers had been shut off by Monday night,
including 11,000 in Los Angeles County, as Southern California Edison
worked to mitigate the impacts of the Santa Ana winds, whose strong
gusts can damage electrical equipment and spark wildfires. Email and
phone messages were left with Edison inquiring whether electricity had
been turned off in Malibu before the fire started.</p>
<p>The Woolsey Fire that roared through Malibu in 2018, killing three
people and destroying 1,600 homes, was sparked by Edison equipment.</p>
<p>Santa Anas are dry, warm and gusty northeast winds that blow from the
interior of Southern California toward the coast and offshore. They
typically occur during the fall months and continue through winter and
into early spring.</p>

Justice Department ignored some policies when seizing journalists’ phone
records, watchdog finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Federal prosecutors ignored some Justice Department
rules when they seized journalists’ phone records as part of media leak
investigations beginning in 2020, according to a report released Tuesday
by the Justice Department inspector general’s office.</p>
<p>The investigation found that the Justice Department during the Trump
administration did not fully comply with the internal guidelines in
place at the time that restricted the department’s use of investigative
tools to seize journalists’ records.</p>
<p>The investigation was launched in 2021 after it was revealed that the
Justice Department had sought records the previous year from reporters
at The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN.</p>
<p>Press freedom experts find the report’s revelations troublesome.</p>
<p>“It’s very concerning to see this kind of government overreach and
inappropriate use of government power to access journalists’ source
material,” Katherine Jacobsen, the U.S., Canada and Caribbean program
coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, told VOA.</p>
<p>“Using journalists as a conduit to find leakers within the federal
government is an incredibly concerning practice,” Jacobsen added.</p>
<p>The report found that the Justice Department in 2020 did not follow
existing department rules that governed searches for reporters’ records,
including failing to convene the News Media Review Committee to consider
the requests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then-Attorney General William Barr, who authorized obtaining records
from news outlets, also did not expressly sign off on the use of
non-disclosure agreements that were sought, which was in conflict with
department policy, the report said.</p>
<p>Press freedom experts say the report’s findings underscore the need
for Congress to pass a proposed federal shield law known as the PRESS
Act.</p>
<p>Shield laws protect journalists from being forced by the government
to disclose information such as the identities of sources. Nearly every
U.S. state and the District of Columbia has either a shield law or court
recognition of qualified privilege for sources, but no federal law is in
place.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives passed the PRESS Act in January. An
attempt to pass the PRESS Act via unanimous consent in the Senate failed
on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“This investigation highlights the need for a reasonable,
common-sense law to protect reporters and their sources,” Reporters
Committee for Freedom of the Press Executive Director Bruce Brown said
in a statement. “It’s time for Congress to pass the PRESS Act, which has
overwhelming bipartisan support, to prevent government interference with
the free flow of information to the public.”</p>
<p>Although the report details years-old rules-dodging, its contents are
particularly relevant since former President Donald Trump will return to
the White House in just over one month.</p>
<p>The president-elect has pledged to jail journalists who do not name
confidential sources on stories he believes to have national security
implications, and he has suggested that the threat of prison rape would
make them talk.</p>
<p>And Trump’s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, has said he wants to
“come after” journalists “who lied about American citizens.” He has also
said that the federal government should be rid of “conspirators” against
Trump.</p>
<p>“Using the Justice Department as a way to find leakers in the federal
government is of great concern, and it’s something that we should be
aware of as he comes into office again,” CPJ’s Jacobsen said.</p>
<p>The Trump administration isn’t the only one that has gone after
government leakers. The Obama administration engaged in what CPJ
described as an “aggressive war on leaks.”</p>
<p>Using journalists to target leakers is an issue that has spanned both
political parties, according to Jacobsen. But it’s also “an issue that
both parties can ultimately fix together,” Jacobsen said, including with
the PRESS Act.</p>
<p>The department also went after the records of two members of Congress
and 43 congressional staffers, according to the report.</p>
<p>The congressional staffers were targeted because they had accessed
classified information, even though doing so was part of their job
responsibilities, the report said.</p>

sanctions Chinese cybersecurity firm for ‘malicious’ activities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States slapped sanctions on a Chinese
cybersecurity company and one of its employees Tuesday, accusing it of
compromising more than 80,000 firewalls in a 2020 attack.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement that it had
sanctioned Sichuan Silence Information Technology Company and an
employee named Guan Tianfeng over the April 2020 attack, which targeted
firewalls around the world, including critical infrastructure in the
U.S.</p>
<p>Over a three-day period, Guan exploited a vulnerability in a firewall
product and proceeded to deploy malware against some 81,000 businesses
around the world with the aim of stealing data, including usernames and
passwords, while also attempting to infect the computers with
ransomware, according to the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>More than 23,000 firewalls were in the United States, of which 36
were protecting “critical infrastructure companies’ systems,” the
Treasury said.</p>
<p>“Today’s action underscores our commitment to exposing these
malicious cyber activities … and to holding the actors behind them
accountable for their schemes,” Bradley Smith, Treasury acting
undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The Treasury, he said, “will continue to leverage our tools to
disrupt attempts by malicious cyber actors to undermine our critical
infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Alongside the sanctions, the Department of Justice has also unsealed
an indictment against Guan and announced a reward of up to $10 million
for information about the employee or company, according to the Treasury
Department.</p>

Tension over tipping may be softening thanks to some holiday cheer. A
new survey from Bankrate finds that more people are planning to tip
regular service providers — like child care providers, housekeepers,

Plus, a potential strike is brewing in the world of European soccer, and

housing supply hiding in plain sight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Empty nesters own prime real estate and lots of it. There are nearly 21
million empty nester households in the U.S., and if they choose to
downsize that could go a ways in addressing the housing shortage, right.
Turns out, location and mortgage rates muddy the answer. Also on this
morning’s show: a scheduled ruling on a potential grocery merger and a
pricey but painless trend in the world of tattooing.

a new design for data centers that reduces water use. The design
“optimizes AI workloads and consumes zero water for cooling,” saving an
estimated 125 million liters of water per year per data center. It does
this by recycling water through a closed loop system, moving it between
the servers and the water chillers. All new Microsoft data center
designs will now be based on this cooling technology, and some pilots
will come online in 2026.

move seems to have angered people on all sides, for many different
reasons. Environmentalists will remember that Biden campaigned on a
promise to stop drilling in the ANWR. “The Arctic Refuge deserves to
remain a place of refuge, not an industrial oilfield lining the pockets
of big oil executives,” Kristen Miller, executive director of Alaska

pack prices dropped by 27% this year, dropping below $100 per

id="south-koreas-leadership-crisis-jeopardizes-us-efforts-to-counter-china">South
Korea’s leadership crisis jeopardizes US efforts to counter China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s uncertain
political future from his martial law backlash could imperil the next
Trump administration’s trilateral coordination with the country and
Japan in countering China, analysts say.</p>
<p>Yoon faces an investigation for treason after declaring martial law
and rescinding it hours later last week. Although he survived an
impeachment vote on Saturday, the main opposition Democratic Party said
the following day it would seek an impeachment vote again.</p>
<p>Uncertainty surrounds Yoon’s leadership and the future leadership of
South Korea amid rapidly evolving political disarray and confusion.</p>
<p>Key government officials have resigned over the martial law
controversy, and the head of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), Han
Dong-hun, said Sunday that Yoon would resign soon and would no longer be
involved in conducting state affairs. In the meantime, the Defense
Ministry said Monday that Yoon still had the control of the South Korean
military.</p>
<p>The South Korean political crisis poses risks to the security of the
region, where countries such as North Korea, China and Russia lie in
wait to take advantage of the situation, analysts say.</p>
<p>“The resulting political turmoil raises uncertainty over the future
direction of the country’s policies and ability to implement them,” said
Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the
Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>“The incoming U.S. administration will be focused on countering the
multifaceted Chinese threat to the region and urging allies and partners
to assume larger roles,” he said. “Yoon’s actions will trigger doubts as
to the viability of Seoul’s roles and contributions.”</p>
<p>“Coupled with the Japanese leadership change and loss of legislative
majority by the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], the United States now
has two weakened allies in Northeast Asia,” Klingner said.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba assumed office in October. The
same month, Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in
parliament. </p>
<p>On Monday, Daniel Kritenbrink, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
East Asia and Pacific affairs, met with his South Korean and Japanese
counterparts to discuss regional security, underscoring the importance
of maintaining close trilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>The trilateral ties were consolidated after Yoon extended an olive
branch to then- Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida after years of
frayed relations between the two countries over colonial wartime
issues.</p>
<p>The two countries’ mending of bilateral ties and their subsequent
trilateral summit with the U.S. at Camp David in August 2023, viewed as
historic in Washington, is frowned upon by South Korea’s main opposition
party, which is considered anti-Japan and pro-China.</p>
<p>If the Democratic Party files another impeachment motion and manages
to get two-thirds of the 300-seat National Assembly and six of nine
constitutional court judges to vote in favor, the country will hold a
special election to choose a new president.</p>
<p>If Yoon resigns or impeachment votes by the parliament and court
pass, the main opposition party has a shot at the country’s next
leadership.</p>
<p>However, how the process will unfold is uncertain as the PPP
boycotted the first impeachment vote and the constitutional court has
three vacancies.</p>
<p>Terence Roehrig, a Korea expert and professor of national security at
the U.S. Naval War College, said, “If Yoon leaves office, either through
impeachment or resignation, the special election that follows will
undoubtedly select a Democratic Party president.”</p>
<p>He continued: “As a result, there is likely to be a shift in South
Korean policy toward China and in maintaining trilateral ties with Japan
and the United States. Much has been done in the past two years to
institutionalize trilateral relations, but these efforts will be tested
with Yoon’s departure along with the incoming Trump administration.”</p>
<p>The PPP criticized Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung for what it
described as his “subservient” attitude toward China when he met with
then-Chinese Ambassador to South Korea Xing Haiming in March.</p>
<p>Lee said at the meeting that South Korea should not be involved in
the cross-strait issue involving Taiwan. China considers the independent
island nation as its own sovereign territory.</p>
<p>Xing in 2023 accused Yoon’s government of tilting too much toward the
U.S. and damaging South Korea’s relations with China.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press
briefing in Beijing on Monday that she will “not comment on the ROK’s
internal affairs,” referring to South Korea by its official name, the
Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea foundation chair in Korea Studies at the
Brookings Institution, said it would not be surprising for China “to
hope for a DP to come back in office,” as during the previous Moon
Jae-in government before Yoon, because the main opposition party is
“more open to engaging China.”</p>
<p>Yeo said that based on President-elect Donald Trump’s key Cabinet
position picks, such as Representative Mike Waltz for national security
adviser and Senator Marco Rubio for secretary of state, both viewed as
China hawks, countering China will be a key focus, and good ties between
Seoul and Tokyo would be “desirable.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Trump’s preference to deal bilaterally rather than
with alliances, makes the future of the trilateral ties a bit uncertain,
Yeo said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the Trump administration may be as active as the Biden
administration was in trying to orchestrate and encourage alliances to
work together,” he said.</p>

id="polygamous-sect-leader-sentenced-to-50-years-in-child-sex-scheme">Polygamous
sect leader sentenced to 50 years in child sex scheme</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX — A polygamist religious leader who claimed more than 20
spiritual “wives” including 10 underage girls was sentenced to 50 years
in prison on Monday for coercing girls as young as 9 years old to submit
to criminal sex acts with him and other adults, and for scheming to
kidnap them from protective custody.</p>
<p>Samuel Bateman, whose small group was an offshoot of the sect once
led by Warren Jeffs, had pleaded guilty to a yearslong scheme to
transport girls across state lines for his sex crimes, and later to
kidnap some of them from protective custody.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Bateman pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy to commit transportation of a minor for sexual activity,
which carries a sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment, and one count
of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, which is punishable by up to life
imprisonment. He was sentenced to 50 years on each count, to be served
concurrently.</p>
<p>The rest of the charges were dismissed as part of the agreement.</p>
<p>Authorities say that Bateman, 48, tried to start an offshoot of the
Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints based in the
neighboring communities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah.
The fundamentalist group, also known as FLDS, split from the mainstream
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after Mormons officially
abandoned polygamy in 1890.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Susan Brnovich sentenced Bateman after
hearing statements in court by three teenage girls about the trauma they
still struggle to overcome. Although they gave their names in court, The
Associated Press does not name victims of sexual crime, and some
appeared to still be minors.</p>
<p>“You should not have the opportunity to be free and never have the
opportunity to be around young women,” Brnovich told Bateman, noting
that for a man of his age the 50-year sentence was effectively a life
sentence.</p>
<p>“You took them from their homes, from their families and made them
into sex slaves,” the judge said. “You stripped them of their innocence
and childhood.”</p>
<p>A short competency hearing that was closed to the public was held
just before sentencing to discuss a doctor’s assessment of Bateman’s
mental health. The defense had argued that Bateman could have benefited
from a maximum of 20 years of psychiatric treatment behind bars before
being released.</p>
<p>The girls told the court, sometimes addressing Bateman himself, how
they grappled to develop relationships in high school, among other
struggles. Now living with foster families, they said they had received
much support from trusted adults outside their community.</p>
<p>After the sentencing, the teens hugged and wept quietly. They were
escorted out of court by a half dozen men and women in jackets with the
slogan “Bikers Against Child Abuse,” a group dedicated to protecting
children from what it calls dangerous people and situations. A woman who
sat with the teens said no one in the group would have a comment.</p>
<p>There was no one in the courtroom who appeared to be a supporter of
Bateman.</p>
<p>The alleged practice of sect members sexually abusing girls whom they
claim as spiritual “wives” has long plagued the FLDS. Jeffs was
convicted of state charges in Texas in 2011 involving sexual assaults of
his underage followers. Bateman was one of Jeffs’ trusted followers and
declared himself, like Jeffs, to be a “prophet” of the FLDS. Jeffs
denounced Bateman in a written “revelation” sent to his followers from
prison, and then tried to start his own group.</p>
<p>In 2019 and 2020, insisting that polygamy brings exaltation in heaven
and that he was acting on orders from the “Heavenly Father,” Bateman
began taking female adults and children from his male followers and
proclaiming them to be his “wives,” the plea agreement said. While none
of these “marriages” were legally or ceremonially recognized, Bateman
acknowledged that each time he claimed another “wife,” it marked the
beginning of his illicit sexual contact with the woman or girl.</p>
<p>Federal agents said Bateman demanded that his followers confess
publicly for any indiscretions and he imposed punishments that ranged
from public shaming to sexual activity, including requiring that some
male followers atone for their “sins” by surrendering their own wives
and daughters to him.</p>
<p>Bateman traveled extensively between Arizona, Utah, Colorado and
Nebraska and regularly coerced underage girls into his criminal sexual
activity, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Arizona said. Recordings of some
of his sex crimes were transmitted across state lines via electronic
devices.</p>
<p>Bateman was arrested in August 2022 by state police as he drove
through Flagstaff, Arizona, pulling a trailer. Someone had alerted
authorities after spotting small fingers reaching through the slats of
the door. Inside the trailer, which had no ventilation, they found a
makeshift toilet, a sofa, camping chairs and three girls, 11 to 14 years
old.</p>
<p>Bateman posted bond but was soon arrested again, accused of
obstructing justice in a federal investigation into whether children
were being transported across state lines for his sex crimes.
Authorities also took nine children from Bateman’s home in Colorado City
into protective custody.</p>
<p>Eight of the children later escaped from foster care in Arizona, and
were found hundreds of miles away in Washington state, in a vehicle
driven by one of the adult “wives.” Bateman also admitted his
involvement in the kidnapping plot.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors noted that Bateman’s plea agreement was
contingent on all of his co-defendants also pleading guilty. It also
called for restitution of as much as $1 million per victim, and for all
assets to be immediately forfeited.</p>
<p>Seven of Bateman’s adult “wives” have been convicted of crimes
related to coercing children into sexual activity or impeding the
investigation into Bateman. Some acknowledged they also coerced girls to
become Bateman’s spiritual “wives,” witnessed Bateman having criminal
sexual activity with girls, participated in illicit group sex involving
children, or joined in kidnapping them from foster care. Another woman
is scheduled to be tried Jan. 14 on charges related to the
kidnappings.</p>
<p>Two Colorado City brothers also face 10 years to life at their
sentencings, on Dec. 16 and Dec. 20, after being convicted in October of
charges including interstate travel to persuade or coerce a child to
engage in sexual activity. Authorities say one bought Bateman two
Bentley automobiles, while the other bought him a Range Rover.</p>
<p>In court records, lawyers for some of Bateman’s “wives” painted a
bleak picture of their clients’ religious upbringings.</p>
<p>One said his client was raised in a religious cult that taught sexual
activity with children was acceptable and that she was duped into
“marrying” Bateman. Another said her client was given to Bateman by
another man as if she were a piece of property, feeling she had no
choice.</p>

<h2 id="biden-under-pressure-to-commute-federal-death-sentences">Biden
under pressure to commute federal death sentences</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden is facing growing calls to
commute the death sentences of the more than three dozen federal inmates
on Death Row before Donald Trump returns to the White House.</p>
<p>Trump resumed federal executions during his last term in office,
overseeing 13 by lethal injection during his final six months in power,
more than any U.S. leader in 120 years.</p>
<p>Biden campaigned for the White House as an opponent of the death
penalty and the Justice Department issued a moratorium on its use at the
federal level after he became president.</p>
<p>During his re-election campaign against Kamala Harris, Trump spoke
frequently of expanding the use of capital punishment to include
migrants who kill American citizens and drug and human traffickers.</p>
<p>There had been no federal inmates put to death in the United States
since 2003 until Trump resumed federal executions in July 2020. </p>
<p>A coalition of death penalty opponents submitted a letter to Biden on
Monday asking him to commute federal death sentences to life in prison
without parole.</p>
<p>“The only irreversible action you can take to prevent President-elect
Trump from renewing his execution spree, as he has vowed to do, is
commuting the death sentences of those on federal death row now,” the
American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Human Rights
Watch and more than 130 other organizations said.</p>
<p>“Your ability to change the course of the death penalty in the United
States will be a defining, legacy-building moment in American history,”
they said.</p>
<p>There are currently 40 prisoners — all men — convicted of federal
crimes awaiting execution, according to the Death Penalty Information
Center, including several in high-profile cases.</p>
<p>They include:</p>
<pre><code>Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 31, the &quot;Boston Bomber,&quot; who was sentenced to death for the murders of two people in the April 15, 2013 bombing of the Boston Marathon.
Dylann Roof, 30, an avowed white supremacist who shot dead nine Black parishoners during a June 17, 2015 Bible study meeting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.
Robert Bowers, 52, an anti-Semitic Pennsylvania man who killed 11 Jewish worshippers during an October 27, 2018 attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Commuted, changed’</p>
<p>Nine of the inmates on federal Death Row were convicted of murdering
fellow prisoners while one killed a prison guard.</p>
<p>Four were sentenced to death for murders committed during bank
robberies.</p>
<p>There are also four inmates on the military’s Death Row including
Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who shot dead 13 people during a
rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has not carried out an execution since 1961.</p>
<p>Pope Francis, in his Sunday address at the Vatican, asked the crowd
to pray for Death Row inmates in the United States and said their
sentences should “be commuted, changed.”</p>
<p>Biden, who controversially pardoned his son Hunter this month for tax
and gun crimes, has been barraged with clemency appeals from other
religious leaders, former state and federal prison officials,
ex-prosecutors and dozens of relatives of murder victims.</p>
<p>Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder, and Sheryl Sandberg, a
former top executive at Facebook, were among the signatories of a letter
from top business leaders urging Biden to exercise his clemency
power.</p>
<p>According to The Washington Post, the White House is considering
“taking steps to commute at least some federal death sentences.”</p>
<p>“No decision has been made, however, about the breadth or scope of
such a possible move, including whether to do it at all,” the newspaper
said.</p>
<p>There have been 23 executions in the United States in 2024 and two
more are scheduled before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while
six others — Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and
Tennessee — have moratoriums in place.</p>
<p>Federal executions are carried out by lethal injection at a prison in
Terre Haute, Indiana. The last one was on January 16, 2021, four days
before Trump left office.</p>

id="unitedhealthcare-ceo-was-likely-killed-with-a-ghost-gun-that-can-be-made-at-home">UnitedHealthcare
CEO was likely killed with a ghost gun that can be made at home</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The brazen killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was likely
carried out with a ghost gun, one of the nearly untraceable weapons that
can be made a home, police said Monday.</p>
<p>A ghost gun is a firearm without a serial number, and police believe
the one used in last week’s shooting of Brian Thompson may have been
made with a 3D printer. It was capable of firing 9 mm rounds. The man
arrested in the crime, Luigi Mangione, also had a sound suppressor, or
silencer, police said.</p>
<p>Ghost guns have increasingly turned up at crime scenes around the
U.S. in recent years.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at the weapons and efforts to regulate them:</p>
<p>What are ghost guns?</p>
<p>The firearms are privately made and have no serial numbers.</p>
<p>Generally, firearms manufactured by licensed companies must have
serial numbers — usually displayed on the frame of the gun — that allow
officials to trace the gun back to the manufacturer, the firearms dealer
and original purchaser.</p>
<p>Ghost guns, however, are made of parts that the owner can assemble
together. The critical component in building an untraceable gun is what
is known as the lower receiver. Some are sold in do-it-yourself kits,
and the receivers are typically made from metal or polymer. They include
semiautomatic handguns and rifles.</p>
<p>Are they legal?</p>
<p>It is legal in the U.S. to build a firearm for personal use. Until
about two years ago, ghost gun kits were available online that allowed
people to assemble the weapons at home without background checks or age
verification.</p>
<p>As police found more ghost guns at crime scenes, the Biden
administration moved to add age requirements and background checks in
2022.</p>
<p>Buying one now is more like purchasing a regular gun at a gun
shop.</p>
<p>The number of ghost guns has since flattened out or declined in
several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and
Baltimore, according to court documents.</p>
<p>But gun groups have challenged the regulation in court. The Supreme
Court heard a case in October and seemed likely to uphold the
regulation. It hasn’t yet handed down a ruling.</p>
<p>Where else have ghost guns been used?</p>
<p>The number of ghost guns recovered by law enforcement increased from
4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 in 2021, according to Justice Department
data. However, traditional guns are still used far more often in
crimes.</p>
<p>Ghost guns really popped into the public consciousness in 2013 when
John Zawahri opened fire on the campus of Santa Monica College in
California, killing six people, including his father and brother.
Zawahri, who was later shot and killed by police, had assembled an
AR-15-style weapon after failing a background check at a gun dealer.</p>
<p>A gunman who killed his wife and four others in Northern California
in 2017 built his own weapon to skirt a court order prohibiting him from
owning firearms. In 2019, a teenager used a homemade handgun to fatally
shoot two classmates and wound three others at a school in suburban Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>A mass shooting carried out with an AR-15-style ghost gun left five
people dead in Philadelphia in 2023. A ghost gun was also used in a
shooting that critically wounded two kindergartners at a tiny religious
school in Northern California last week, police said.</p>

<h2 id="biden-memorializes-painful-past-of-native-people">Biden
memorializes painful past of Native people</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Monday presided over his final
White House Tribal Nations Summit by reaching into the nation’s dark
past and establishing a new national monument to honor the suffering of
thousands of Native children and their families in federal boarding
schools in the last century.</p>
<p>His proclamation starts a three-year clock to design a monument to be
placed at the flagship Carlisle Indian Industrial School in
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Carlisle Indian Industrial School opened in 1879, with the stated
mission to “kill the Indian” to “save the Man.” Schools like this
removed children from their families and forced them to speak English,
wear non-native clothing and eschew tribal customs.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Biden described the treatment of thousands of
Native children at government boarding schools as “a blot” on the
nation’s history.</p>
<p>“The federal government mandated — mandated — removal of children
from their families and tribes, launching what’s called the federal
Indian boarding school era, over a 150-year span, 150 years from the
early 1800s to 1970 — one of the most horrific chapters in American
history,” he said earlier this year. “We should be ashamed.”</p>
<p>The most recent U.S. Census found that the population of those who
consider themselves wholly or partly Native is upward of nearly 9
million. The U.S. Department of the Interior says it serves 1.9 million
American Indian and Alaska Natives, many in sovereign lands.</p>
<p>That’s a shadow of the population that historians say thrived on the
continent before European colonization. Native Americans were only
granted universal U.S. citizenship in 1924 with the passage of the
Indian Citizenship Act.</p>
<p>Activists like Elveda Martinez of the Walker River Paiute Tribe say
it’s remarkable how recent this history of dispossession and
discrimination is.</p>
<p>“It’s within our generation that Natives finally all had the right to
vote,” she said. “So, that’s still a big thing now. We always tell
people, you know, it was our parents and people in that generation that
fought for the right to vote.”</p>
<p>As a group, Native residents have the highest poverty rate in the
country, and their youth lag behind other demographics in education,
according to a study by a bipartisan research group.</p>
<p>On Monday, Biden detailed his administration’s efforts to improve the
livelihoods of descendants of the nation’s pre-colonial populations and
to give communities more say, such as designating conservation areas.
But he stressed that honoring the past is the way forward.“By making the
Carlisle Indian School a national monument, we make clear what great
nations do,” he said. “We don’t erase history. We acknowledge it and
learn from it, so we never repeat it again.”</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as
a Cabinet secretary, praised Biden’s work.</p>
<p>“President Biden has been the best president for Indian Country in my
lifetime,” she said. “This is a president and an administration that
truly sees Indigenous people and has worked tirelessly to address the
issues in Indian Country that have long been underfunded or outright
ignored.”</p>
<p>As a sign of her esteem, Haaland, who is a member of the Pueblo of
Laguna, draped Biden in a personalized parting gift: a black-and-white
version of a blanket designed by Pueblo artist Pat Pruitt, who says the
motif, which depicts thunder and lightning in the desert, is meant to
evoke “the feeling of that calm before the storm that is filled with
electricity and sound.”</p>
<p>But as one tribe made clear Monday, America’s Native people are not a
monolith.</p>
<p>The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians lashed out at the Biden
administration for what the group says is a “lack of tribal
consultation” over a wave of proposed off-reservation casinos, including
a recent approval for Oregon’s first off-reservation casino.</p>
<p>“It is performative to celebrate an administration’s contributions to
Indian Country when the actions tell a very different story,” Cow Creek
Umpqua Tribal Chairman Carla Keene said in a statement sent to VOA on
Monday. “We have been dismissed and ignored about policy that will
devastate our social, cultural, and economic livelihood. There is time
to do the right thing and put a stop to the pending decisions that will
irreversibly harm Tribes across the Pacific Northwest and West Coast,
which is a backwards step in American history, not forward.”</p>
<p>The principal chief of the large and powerful Cherokee nation — which
includes about 450,000 people — issued a careful, diplomatic statement
Monday advocating for the summit to continue under the next
administration.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to attending the White House Tribal Nation’s
summit this week,” Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. posted on Facebook. “Other
than when the summit was not held (2017-2020), I’ve been attending since
2013. I hope it is a productive engagement and I hope it continues on in
future years.”</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump indicated that he views Native issues as
intertwined with energy generation, by naming North Dakota Governor Doug
Burgum as Interior secretary, while also serving as “White House energy
czar.”</p>
<p>“We’re going to do things with energy and with land interior that is
going to be incredible,” he said, but did not elaborate.</p>
<p>As president, Trump angered Indigenous activists by lifting a ban on
the Keystone XL pipeline that cuts through sovereign native lands on its
path south from Canada to Texas.</p>
<p>Biden revoked Trump’s permit for the oil pipeline on the first day of
his term.</p>

wary of fissures, fragmentation as Syria looks to rebuild</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. diplomats and military officials have intensified
their outreach to groups vying to chart a new course for Syria, as well
as to Syria’s neighbors, in an effort to ensure the fall of the regime
of former President Bashar Assad does not give way to a more unstable
and dangerous future.</p>
<p>A number of key meetings took place Monday in Jordan, where senior
U.S. diplomatic officials held consultations with their Jordanian
counterparts following similar meetings a day earlier in Doha,
Qatar.</p>
<p>And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more diplomatic
missions are in the works.</p>
<p>“Senior officials from this department are fanning out through the
region as we speak, working with counterparts on how the United States
can help support the Syrian people as they decide their own path for the
future” Blinken told an audience at the State Department Monday.</p>
<p>“This moment presents a historic opportunity, but it also carries
considerable risks,” he said. “History shows how quickly moments of
promise can descend into conflict and violence.”</p>
<p>As evidence of the U.S. concern, the commander of U.S. Central
Command, which oversees American forces in the Middle East, also engaged
with allies in the region.</p>
<p>General Michael “Erik” Kurilla met in Amman with Major General Yousef
Al-Hunaiti, the chairman of the Jordanian Joint Chiefs of Staff.
According to a U.S. readout, Kurilla promised U.S. support for Jordan
should the situation in Syria deteriorate.</p>
<p>Other U.S. officials on Monday likewise emphasized the need for a
calm and orderly transition in Syria.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that our allies are safe and secure,” U.S.
Deputy United Nations Ambassador Robert Wood told reporters at the U.N.
in New York.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that there isn’t a humanitarian catastrophe,”
Wood said. “So, we’re going to be working over the coming days and weeks
to try to make sure that we can ensure all of those things happen.”</p>
<p>But officials at the State Department and the Pentagon caution there
is ample reason to worry that hopes for a better future for the Syrian
people could disintegrate, with differences leading to new waves of
violence and even migrations out of Syria.</p>
<p>They say that while the words and actions of Syrian rebel leaders,
including Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s Abu Mohammed al-Golani, seem promising,
pledges for a new, inclusive government will be tested if tensions
between rival groups continue to simmer or escalate.</p>
<p>And the State Department officials said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a
U.S.-designated terror group that grew out of the al-Qaida terror
group’s Syrian affiliate before cutting ties, has yet to show that it
deserves to have the terror designation removed.</p>
<p>So too, there are concerns about the Islamic State terror group,
which commands between 2,500 and 5,000 fighters across Syria and Iraq,
and which has been growing stronger in recent months.</p>
<p>“ISIS will try to use this period to reestablish its capabilities, to
create safe havens,” Blinken said Monday, using an acronym for the
terror group, also known as IS or Daesh. “We are determined not to let
that happen.”</p>
<p>U.S. allies on the ground in Syria, however, warn IS has already
begun ramping up its attacks, seeking to take advantage of the collapse
of Syrian regime forces over the past week.</p>
<p>“We are worried,” the U.S. representative for the political wing of
the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) told VOA,
pointing to an uptick in attacks across northeastern Syria.</p>
<p>“They are targeting our internal security forces,” said Syrian
Democratic Council representative Sinam Mohamad, noting efforts by IS
sleeper cells in places like Raqqa, Deir el-Zour and even Hasakah, home
to one of the SDF-run prisons holding thousands of IS fighters captured
after the fall of the terror group’s self-declared caliphate in
2019.</p>
<p>She also warned of increased activity, and new escape attempts at
al-Hol, a displaced persons camp that holds tens of thousands of IS
wives and other family members, many of them children.</p>
<p>Mohamad praised U.S. forces for lending support to the SDF but said
there are indications of additional IS activity in areas abandoned by
Syrian regime forces along with their Russian and Iranian allies.</p>
<p>U.S. military officials hope a series of airstrikes, carried out
Sunday at five locations across central Syria, will help to blunt the
threat.</p>
<p>The strikes are “a way to certainly prevent them [IS] from taking
advantage of the dynamics within Syria and the current situation,” said
Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, briefing reporters at the Pentagon
Monday.</p>
<p>But U.S. counterterrorism officials have long warned that IS is
capable of demonstrating both patience and resilience and is well-aware
of the types of fissures that could still serve to derail a transition
government in Syria.</p>
<p>And perhaps nowhere are those tensions more palpable at the moment
than in Syria’s northeast, where fighting has broken out between Kurdish
militias and the Syrian National Army, or SNA, a coalition of
Turkish-backed militias.</p>
<p>Turkey has defended various efforts to strike at the SDF, claiming it
is led by fighters with the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, a
Syrian-based offshoot of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party
(PKK), labeled by both Ankara and Washington as a terrorist
organization.</p>
<p>The SDC and SDF, in return, have accused the SNA of attacking
civilians in Manbij, and other nearby areas.</p>
<p>“The United States, now, they are trying to stop this,” the SDC’s
Mohamad told VOA.</p>
<p>“There is some negotiation,” she said. “We hope they [the U.S.] can
succeed in that.”</p>
<p>The State Department Monday said it has been clear with both sides,
echoing warnings from the SDF that ongoing clashes could hurt the
ability of the U.S.-backed force to contain IS.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to see an escalation,” said spokesperson Matthew
Miller of the clashes between Kurdish groups and the SNA. “We don’t want
to see anyone take advantage of this period of instability to try, and
further their own position.”</p>

Media mogul Murdoch fails in bid to change family trust</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch has lost a bid to change his family trust to
consolidate control of his media empire in the hands of his son Lachlan,
The New York Times reported Monday, citing a sealed court document. </p>
<p>Nevada Commissioner Edmund Gorman concluded in a decision filed
Saturday that Murdoch and his eldest son, Lachlan, who is the head of
Fox News parent Fox Corp and News Corp, had acted in “bad faith” in
their effort to amend the irrevocable trust, the Times reported. </p>
<p>The court docket indicates Gorman issued a recommendation or order
Saturday, but the document is not publicly available. </p>
<p>The trust currently would divide control of the company equally among
Murdoch’s four oldest children — Lachlan, James, Elisabeth and Prudence
— after his death. </p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch proposed amending the family trust to solidify
Lachlan’s leadership of the family’s media empire after his death, and
block any interference by three of Lachlan’s siblings, who are
politically moderate, the Times reported. </p>
<p>Under one scenario, three of the heirs could technically outvote a
fourth, setting up a battle over the future of the powerful media
outlets, even as Lachlan Murdoch runs Fox and is sole chair of News
Corp. </p>
<p>In his opinion, Gorman said, the plan to change the trust was a
“carefully crafted charade” to “permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s
executive roles” inside the empire “regardless of the impacts such
control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries” of the
family trust, the Times said. </p>
<p>A lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, Adam Streisand, said they were
disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal, the Times reported.
The commissioner’s ruling is subject to approval by a district judge,
whose decision could be challenged in court. </p>
<p>The trust was set up in Nevada, which is prized for its strict
confidentiality rules. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for Rupert Murdoch, 93, could not immediately be
reached for comment. Lachlan Murdoch did not respond to an email seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Lachlan’s siblings issued a joint statement expressing hope that the
family would focus on mending relationships. </p>
<p>“We welcome Commissioner Gorman’s decision and hope that we can move
beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding
relationships among all family members,” the siblings said.</p>

Years of Delay Means to an Offshore Wind Project</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTEzOTk2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODQwNzg0OH0._GyqbDXWOLHCu2YdMuM_d1YvkLVolQBQYXFgeyZpMcI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As soon as Donald Trump was declared the winner of November’s
presidential election, climate advocates vowed to continue making
progress at the state and local level. But some local projects may still
depend too much on federal policy to move forward.
</p>
<p>
The president-elect’s influence has already put a highly anticipated
plan to convert New York City’s biggest power plant into a renewable
energy hub on shaky ground. Central to the conversion is a
1,400-megawatt offshore wind farm called Attentive Energy developed by
TotalEnergies. Trump, a longtime critic of the industry, has
<a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-political-rally-wildwood-new-jersey-may-11-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>made
vague threats</u></a> to “end” offshore wind “on day one.” While that
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/how-will-offshore-wind-fare-under-a-second-trump-term" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overstates
his capabilities</a>, his administration will, at the very least, have
the power to slow the processing of permits.
</p>
<p>
The regulatory uncertainty was enough to convince Patrick Pouyanne, the
CEO of TotalEnergies, to put Attentive Energy on pause, he said at the
Energy Intelligence Forum in London, according to
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-26/total-pauses-new-york-offshore-wind-farm-plans-after-trump-win" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a>
— though he left open the possibility of reviving it “in four years.”
</p>
<p>
That’s bad news for the Ravenswood Generating Station in Long Island
City, Queens. Ravenswood consists of three steam turbines built in the
1960s that run mostly on natural gas, though sometimes also on oil, plus
a natural gas combined cycle unit built in 2004. Together, they emitted
nearly 1.3 million metric tons of CO2 in 2023, or about 8% of the city’s
carbon emissions from electricity production, while representing more
than 20% of the city’s local generating capacity. Ravenswood is also
situated across the street from the largest public housing project in
the country, and has spewed pollution into the area colloquially
referred to as “asthma alley” for decades.
</p>
<p>
Rise Light and Power, the company that owns the plant, has said it will
redress those harms to the community by transforming the site into
“Renewable Ravenswood.” The aspiration includes retiring the three
1960s-era generators and replacing them with offshore wind, battery
energy storage, and additional renewable energy delivered from upstate
New York via a new transmission line. Long term, the company says it
will repurpose the plant’s cooling infrastructure to provide clean
heating and cooling to buildings in the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
Members of the community and local political leaders celebrated the
proposal and showed up at rallies and public hearings to support it.
Rise Light and Power also incorporated clean energy job training into
the plan and earned the support of the union workers who operate the
plant. The environmental group Earthjustice recently cited Renewable
Ravenswood
<a href="https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024.09.23_earthjusticecomments.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
a state filing</u></a> as a shining example of “a more
community-centered approach to energy planning.”
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://renewableravenswood.com/about-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>website</u></a>
for Renewable Ravenswood declares that the plan “starts with offshore
wind,” and
<a href="https://renewableravenswood.com/initiatives/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>says</u></a>
that “Attentive Energy One is the first step.” When Attentive Energy
submitted its initial bid for a power contract with the state last year,
Rise Light and Power CEO Clint Plummer
<a href="https://citylimits.org/2023/08/15/citys-largest-power-plant-nears-milestone-in-renewable-energy-push" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
the local outlet </u><u><em><em>City Limits</em></em></u></a><em>
</em>that the wind farm “essentially unlocks ‘Renewable Ravenswood.’”
</p>
<p>
Now, it’s unclear when the promised air quality benefits and jobs will
materialize.
</p>
<p>
When I hopped on the phone with Plummer, the Ravenswood CEO, last week,
he downplayed the implications of the pause.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think it changes that much,” he told me, stressing that
“project delays don’t impact our commitment to the vision” and that
“it’s simply part of the process of developing these large scale energy
infrastructure projects.” Plummer said the company could continue to
make progress on permitting, engineering, and other related work on the
site and in the community in the meantime. Since New York state has
significantly more control over onshore renewables and transmission, he
said, it may be possible to move more quickly on those.
</p>
<p>
The pause on Attentive Energy may have come with or without Trump — the
project, which is a joint venture between Rise Light and Power,
TotalEnergies, and Corio, had already
<a href="https://attentiveenergy.com/new-york-update/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>withdrawn
its revised bid</u></a> for a contract to sell power into New York’s
energy market in October. When I asked Attentive for clarification,
however, representatives didn’t respond.
</p>
<p>
The wind farm pause is the third big setback to the company’s
replacement plans in as many years.
</p>
<p>
The first effort to bring clean energy to Ravenswood was a 316-megawatt
battery project the New York Public Service Commission approved in 2019.
It was slated to be completed by April 2021, but by January of that
year, the company had
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/lacking-contract-ls-power-delays-major-battery-storage-station-in-ny-62467197" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
yet secured an offtake agreement with Con Edison</u></a>, the local
utility, and so asked for a three-year extension. The development still
has not broken ground. “Our project, and most like it that have been
proposed in New York City, are awaiting the State’s expected battery
procurement next year,” a spokesperson told me when I asked for a status
update. “We expect that projects that received State incentives through
that program will likely be able to proceed to construction quickly.”
</p>
<p>
The company also
<a href="https://riselight.com/rise-plans-innovative-solution-to-power-15-of-nyc-with-upstate-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>submitted
a bid</u></a> to the New York State Energy Research and Development
Authority in May of 2021 to build a transmission line called the
Catskills Renewable Connector that would be capable of delivering 1,200
megawatts of renewable energy from upstate solar and wind farms to the
Ravenswood site, meeting up to 15% of the city’s electricity needs. But
the agency passed over the proposal in favor of two other transmission
lines — Clean Path New York, which would bring renewable power to the
city from Western New York, and the Champlain Hudson Power Express,
which would deliver hydropower from Canada. (While construction on the
latter project is
<a href="https://chpexpress.com/construction-progress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>well
underway</u></a>, Clean Path was cancelled the day before Thanksgiving.)
</p>
<p>
“We weren’t selected then, but we’ve continued to mature and advance
that project,” Plummer told me, regarding the Catskills line. “All these
projects take a very long period of time to realize.”
</p>
<p>
The only aspect of Renewable Ravenswood that’s still alive and kicking,
at least publicly, is the
<a href="https://queensbororenewableexpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Queensborough
Renewable Express</u></a>, a set of high-voltage power lines that would
connect the site to any future offshore wind farms in New York Harbor.
The company is currently awaiting approval on a key permit for the line
from the New York Public Service Commission. But while much of the
project is located within the jurisdiction of New York, part of it will
also need federal approvals.
</p>
<p>
Plummer may not be too concerned about the wind farm’s delay, but a
freeze on offshore wind development for the next four years would
further stretch New York’s already strained climate goals.
</p>
<p>
New York law requires the state to get 70% of its energy from renewable
sources by 2030 and 100% from zero-emissions sources by 2040. The
<a href="https://www.nypa.gov/-/media/nypa/documents/document-library/renewables/NYPA-Renewables-Draft-Strategic-Plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
recent progress report</u></a> on those goals, compiled by the New York
Power Authority, found that the state had enough renewable energy
operating and contracted so far to supply about 44% of expected demand
in 2030.
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="https://dps.ny.gov/news/comments-sought-regarding-clean-energy-standard-biennial-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>separate
state analysis</u></a> showed that offshore wind would play a key role
in reaching the target, with an expected 6 gigawatts of offshore wind
generation getting New York about 15% of the way there. But so far, the
state has finalized contracts for only about 1.7 gigawatts. Though New
York has several additional contracts pending awards, none of those
potential projects has yet submitted construction plans to the federal
Bureau of Ocean Management. If that office freezes its offshore wind
work for the next four years, it’s possible none of them will be able to
start construction until the 2030s at the earliest.
</p>
<p>
“Four years may not be significant for project development time frames,”
Daniel Zarrilli, the former chief climate policy advisor for the city of
New York, told me. “But the state has these 2030 and 2040 goals, and so
many pieces of what makes up the ability to hit those goals are under
stress. So it’s certainly not good news.”
</p>
<p>
New Yorkers aren’t the only ones who will be affected by the pause.
Attentive Energy was also working on two additional offshore wind
projects that would send power to New Jersey. The developer had already
<a href="https://attentiveenergy.com/attentive-energy-two-celebrates-award-of-offshore-wind-contract-to-deliver-1-3-gw-of-clean-energy-and-thousands-of-jobs-into-new-jersey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>secured
a contract</u></a> to sell power into that state from a 1.3-gigawatt
project called Attentive Energy Two. In July, it
<a href="https://attentiveenergy.com/attentive-energys-proposal-to-new-jersey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>submitted
a bid</u></a> to New Jersey’s fourth offshore wind solicitation for an
additional, unnamed 1.3-gigawatt project. The New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities is expected to reach a decision on that solicitation this
month.
</p>
<p>
I reached out to TotalEnergies to ask whether all three projects were
paused or just the New York one, but the company said it would not
comment on Pouyanne’s speech. The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities
also did not respond as to whether Attentive had pulled either its
awarded contract or bid.
</p>
<p>
It’s true that developing these projects takes a long time, and that
anyone excited about Renewable Ravenswood should not have expected any
new clean power to come into the site until the end of this decade,
anyway. But further delays could have real consequences. “Any of these
projects faltering is just going to keep New York City reliant on an
aging and dirty fossil fleet,” said Zarrilli. The city is in a hole, he
said, after the Indian Point nuclear plant closed and made it even more
reliant on natural gas for electricity.
</p>
<p>
On my call with Plummer, he emphasized several times that the city has
“the thinnest reserve margins we’ve had in decades” — in other words, it
doesn’t have much wiggle room to meet increases in electricity demand.
Rise Light and Power has already shut down 17 small gas “peaker” plants
that were previously part of Ravenswood to make room for new renewable
energy infrastructure. The city will be in better shape in 2026,
assuming the Champlain Hudson Power Express finishes on time,
<a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2248793/2024-RNA-Report.pdf/0fe6fd1e-0f28-0332-3e80-28bea71a2344?t=1732195607468" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to the New York grid operator NYISO</u></a>. But by the early 2030s,
when additional peaker plants are expected to be shut down due to
pollution regulations, New York could be back on thin ice.
</p>
<p>
By then, the steam turbines at Ravenswood will be nearly 70 years old.
Unless significant additional generation comes online by then, Rise
Light and Power could be forced to re-invest in those gas generators
rather than retire them. “It’d be terrible if they were forced to make
that choice in the future,” said Zarrilli.

in UnitedHealthcare CEO killing charged with murder in New York, court
records show</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Altoona, Pennsylvania — After UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was gunned down
on a New York sidewalk, police searched for the masked gunman with dogs,
drones and scuba divers. Officers used the city’s muscular surveillance
system. Investigators analyzed DNA samples, fingerprints and internet
addresses. Police went door-to-door looking for witnesses.</p>
<p>When an arrest came five days later, those sprawling investigative
efforts shared credit with an alert civilian’s instincts. A Pennsylvania
McDonald’s customer noticed another patron who resembled the man in the
oblique security camera photos that New York police had publicized.</p>
<p>Luigi Nicholas Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a
prominent Maryland real estate family, was arrested Monday in the
killing of Brian Thompson, who headed one of the United States’ largest
medical insurance companies.</p>
<p>He remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged
with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false
identification to police. By late evening, prosecutors in Manhattan had
added a charge of murder, according to an online court docket. He’s
expected to be extradited to New York eventually.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Mangione has an attorney who can comment on the
allegations. Asked at Monday’s arraignment whether he needed a public
defender, Mangione asked whether he could “answer that at a future
date.”</p>
<p>Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after the McDonald’s
customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.
Police in Altoona, about 375 kilometers west of New York City, were soon
summoned.</p>
<p>They arrived to find Mangione sitting at a table in the back of the
restaurant, wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a laptop,
according to a Pennsylvania police criminal complaint.</p>
<p>He initially gave them a fake ID, but when an officer asked Mangione
whether he’d been to New York recently, he “became quiet and started to
shake,” the complaint says.</p>
<p>When he pulled his mask down at officers’ request, “we knew that was
our guy,” rookie Officer Tyler Frye said at a news conference in
Hollidaysburg.</p>
<p>New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a Manhattan news
conference that Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill
Thompson and the same fake ID the shooter had used to check into a New
York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.</p>
<p>NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione also had a
three-page, handwritten document that shows “some ill will toward
corporate America.”</p>
<p>A law enforcement official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the
investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed
to have acted alone.</p>
<p>“To the Feds, I’ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do
for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly
that I wasn’t working with anyone,” the document said, according to the
official.</p>
<p>It also had a line that said, “I do apologize for any strife or
traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it
coming.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania prosecutor Peter Weeks said in court that Mangione was
found with a passport and $10,000 in cash — $2,000 of it in foreign
currency. Mangione disputed the amount.</p>
<p>Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a
midtown Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Police quickly came
to see the shooting as a targeted attack by a gunman who appeared to
wait for Thompson, came up behind him and fired a 9 mm pistol.</p>
<p>Investigators have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on
ammunition found near Thompson’s body. The words mimic a phrase used to
criticize the insurance industry.</p>
<p>From surveillance video, New York investigators gathered that the
shooter fled by bike into Central Park, emerged, then took a taxi to a
northern Manhattan bus terminal.</p>
<p>Once in Pennsylvania, he went from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh,
“trying to stay low-profile” by avoiding cameras, Pennsylvania State
Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said.</p>
<p>A grandson of a wealthy, self-made real estate developer and
philanthropist, Mangione is a cousin of a current Maryland state
legislator. Mangione was valedictorian at his elite Baltimore prep
school, where his 2016 graduation speech lauded his classmates’
“incredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things.”</p>
<p>He went on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer
science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesperson
said.</p>
<p>“Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,” Mangione’s
family said in a statement posted on social media late Monday by his
cousin, Maryland lawmaker Nino Mangione. “We offer our prayers to the
family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all
involved.”</p>
<p>Luigi Nicholas Mangione worked for a time for the car-buying website
TrueCar and left in 2023, CEO Jantoon Reigersman said by email.</p>
<p>From January to June 2022, Mangione lived at Surfbreak, a “co-living”
space at the edge of Honolulu tourist mecca Waikiki.</p>
<p>Like other residents of the shared penthouse catering to remote
workers, Mangione underwent a background check, said Josiah Ryan, a
spokesperson for owner and founder R.J. Martin.</p>
<p>“Luigi was just widely considered to be a great guy. There were no
complaints,” Ryan said. “There was no sign that might point to these
alleged crimes they’re saying he committed.”</p>
<p>At Surfbreak, Martin learned Mangione had severe back pain from
childhood that interfered with many aspects of his life, from surfing to
romance, Ryan said.</p>
<p>“He went surfing with R.J. once but it didn’t work out because of his
back,” Ryan said, but noted that Mangione and Martin often went together
to a rock-climbing gym.</p>
<p>Mangione left Surfbreak to get surgery on the mainland, Ryan said,
then later returned to Honolulu and rented an apartment.</p>
<p>Martin stopped hearing from Mangione six months to a year ago.</p>
<p>Although the gunman obscured his face during the shooting, he left a
trail of evidence in New York, including a backpack he ditched in
Central Park, a cellphone found in a pedestrian plaza, a water bottle
and a protein bar wrapper.</p>
<p>In the days after the shooting, the NYPD collected hundreds of hours
of surveillance video and released multiple clips and still images in
hopes of enlisting the public’s eyes to help find a suspect.</p>
<p>“This combination of old-school detective work and new-age technology
is what led to this result today,” Tisch said at the New York news
conference.</p>

id="veteran-daniel-penny-is-acquitted-in-nyc-subway-chokehold-case-over-jordan-neelys-death">Veteran
Daniel Penny is acquitted in NYC subway chokehold case over Jordan
Neely’s death</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — A Marine veteran who used a chokehold on an agitated
subway rider was acquitted on Monday in a death that became a prism for
differing views about public safety, valor and vigilantism. </p>
<p>A Manhattan jury cleared Daniel Penny of criminally negligent
homicide in Jordan Neely’s 2023 death. A more serious manslaughter
charge was dismissed last week because the jury deadlocked on that
count. </p>
<p>Penny, who had shown little expression during the trial, briefly
smiled as the verdict was read. Both applause and anger erupted in the
courtroom, and Neely’s father and two supporters were ushered out after
audibly reacting. Another person also left, wailing with tears. </p>
<p>“It really, really hurts,” Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, said
outside the courthouse. “I had enough of this. The system is
rigged.” </p>
<p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, the Democrat whose office
brought the case, said prosecutors “followed the facts and the evidence
from beginning to end” and respect the verdict. </p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from lawyers for Penny, who rushed to
a waiting car after the verdict. The anonymous jury, which had started
deliberating Tuesday, was escorted out of court to a van. </p>
<p>Penny’s attorneys had said he was protecting himself and other subway
passengers from a volatile, mentally ill man who was making alarming
remarks and gestures. </p>
<p>The case amplified many American fault lines, among them race,
politics, crime, urban life, mental illness and homelessness. Neely was
Black. Penny is white. </p>
<p>There were sometimes dueling demonstrations outside the courthouse,
including Monday, when chants could be heard through the courtroom
window ahead of the verdict. High-profile Republican politicians
portrayed Penny as a hero while prominent Democrats attended Neely’s
funeral. </p>
<p>Penny, 26, served four years in the Marines and went on to study
architecture. </p>
<p>Neely, 30, was a sometime subway performer with a tragic life story:
His mother was killed and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a
teenager. </p>
<p>As a younger man, Neely did Michael Jackson tributes — complete with
moonwalks — on the city’s streets and subways. But Neely also struggled
with mental illness after losing his mother, whose boyfriend was
convicted of murdering her. </p>
<p>He subsequently was diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia, was
repeatedly hospitalized, and used the synthetic cannabinoid K2 and
realized it negatively affected his thinking and behavior, according to
medical records seen at the trial. The drug was in his system when he
died. </p>
<p>Neely told a doctor in 2017 that being homeless, living in poverty
and having to “dig through the garbage” for food made him feel so
hopeless that he sometimes thought of killing himself, hospital records
show. </p>
<p>About six years later, he boarded a subway under Manhattan on May 1,
2023, hurled his jacket onto the floor, and declared that he was hungry
and thirsty and didn’t care if he died or went to jail, witnesses said.
Some told 911 operators that he tried to attack people or indicated he’d
harm riders, and several testified that they were afraid. </p>
<p>Neely was unarmed, with nothing but a muffin in his pocket, and
didn’t touch any passengers. One said he made lunging movements that
alarmed her enough that she shielded her 5-year-old from him. </p>
<p>Penny came up behind Neely, grabbed his neck, took him to the floor
and “put him out,” as the veteran told police at the scene. </p>
<p>Passengers’ video showed that at one point during the roughly
six-minute hold, Neely tapped an onlooker’s leg and gestured to him.
Later, he briefly got an arm free. But he went still nearly a minute
before Penny released him. </p>
<p>“He’s dying,” an unseen bystander said in one video. “Let him
go!” </p>
<p>A witness who stepped in to hold down Neely’s arms testified that he
told Penny to free the man, though Penny’s lawyers noted the witness’
story changed significantly over time. </p>
<p>Penny told detectives shortly after the encounter that Neely
threatened to kill people and the chokehold was an attempt to
“de-escalate” the situation until police could arrive. The veteran said
he held on as long as he did because Neely periodically squirmed. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t trying to injure him. I’m just trying to keep him from
hurting anyone else. He’s threatening people. That’s what we learn in
the Marine Corps,” Penny told the detectives. </p>
<p>However, one of Penny’s Marine Corps instructors testified that the
veteran misused a chokehold technique he’d been taught. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Penny reacted far too forcefully to someone he
perceived as a peril, not a person. Prosecutors also argued that any
need to protect passengers quickly ebbed when the train doors opened at
the next station, seconds after Penny took action. </p>
<p>Although Penny himself told police he’d used “a choke” or “a
chokehold,” one of his lawyers, Steven Raiser, cast it as a
Marine-taught chokehold “modified as a simple civilian restraint.” The
defense lawyers contended that Penny didn’t consistently apply enough
pressure to kill Neely. </p>
<p>Contradicting a city medical examiner’s finding, a pathologist hired
by the defense said Neely died not from the chokehold but from the
combined effects of K2, schizophrenia, his struggle and restraint, and a
blood condition that can lead to fatal complications during
exertion. </p>
<p>Penny did not testify, but several of his relatives, friends and
fellow Marines did — describing him as an upstanding, patriotic and
empathetic man. </p>
<p>The manslaughter charge would have required proving that Penny
recklessly caused Neely’s death. Criminally negligent homicide involves
engaging in serious “blameworthy conduct” while not perceiving such a
risk. Both charges were felonies and carried the possibility of prison
time. </p>
<p>While the criminal trial played out, Neely’s father filed a wrongful
death suit against Penny.</p>

asks federal appeals court to bar enforcement of potential ban until
Supreme Court review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TikTok asked a federal appeals court on Monday to bar the Biden
administration from enforcing a law that could lead to a ban on the
popular platform until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge to the
statue. </p>
<p>The legal filing was made after a panel of three judges on the same
court sided with the government last week and ruled that the law, which
requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a
ban as soon as next month, was constitutional. </p>
<p>If the law is not overturned, both TikTok and its parent ByteDance,
which is also a plaintiff in the case, have claimed that the popular app
will shut down by Jan. 19, 2025. TikTok has more than 170 million
American users. </p>
<p>“Before that happens, the Supreme Court should have an opportunity,
as the only court with appellate jurisdiction over this action, to
decide whether to review this exceptionally important case,” attorneys
for the two companies wrote in the legal filing on Monday. </p>
<p>It’s not clear if the Supreme Court will take up the case. </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok the last time
he was in the White House, has said he is now against such action. </p>
<p>In their legal filing, the two companies pointed to the political
realities, saying that an injunction would provide a “modest delay” that
would give “the incoming Administration time to determine its position —
which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court
review.”</p>

Perez,’ ‘The Brutalist’ lead Golden Globe film nominations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEVERLY HILLS, California — Musical thriller “Emilia Perez” and
historical epic “The Brutalist” led the roster of films nominated on
Monday for the 2025 Golden Globes, the Hollywood honors that kick off
the movie awards season leading to the Oscars.</p>
<p>“Emilia Perez,” released by Netflix NFLX.O, scored 10 nods and “The
Brutalist,” from independent distributor A24, earned seven.</p>
<p>Taking home a Globe can help movies in the race to the Academy Awards
in March. Last year’s Hollywood strikes scrambled this year’s release
schedule, and awards pundits say there is no clear frontrunner for best
picture at the Oscars.</p>
<p>The Globe winners will be chosen by 334 entertainment journalists
from 85 countries and will be announced Jan. 5 at a ceremony broadcast
live on CBS and streamed on Paramount+.</p>
<p>“Emilia Perez” stars Zoe Saldana as a lawyer who helps a drug cartel
leader (Spanish actor Karla Sofía Gascón) fake his death and transition
from a man to a woman. Selena Gomez co-stars as the cartel leader’s
wife. All three were nominated for by Globes voters for acting
honors.</p>
<p>“The Brutalist” stars Adrien Brody in an epic tale of a Hungarian
immigrant who flees the horrors of World War Two to rebuild his life in
the United States.</p>
<p>Box office smash “Wicked,” adapted from a long-running Broadway play
about the witches in “The Wizard of Oz,” landed four nominations.</p>

Over the last 30 years, large swathes of land that were once lush and

report on global aridity</a> from the UN Convention to Combat
Desertification. The study found that more than 75% of all land on Earth
has become drier over the last three decades, and that during that time,
drylands expanded by an area the size of the Australian continent to
cover 40% of all the global land (excluding Antarctica). This is a very
bad trend. Aridity is different from drought. While drought eventually
recedes, aridity is “an unrelenting menace,” leading to land
degradation, water scarcity, biodiversity decline, crop losses, and
large-scale human migration. Human-caused climate change is the main
cause of the aridity crisis. “If the world fails in efforts to curb
greenhouse gas emissions,” the UN warned, “another 3% of the world’s
humid areas are projected to transform into drylands by the end of this

<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The Assad family ruled Syria for more than half a century, and that
dynasty has come to an end. The rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham, or
HTS, is consolidating control and will inherit an economy devastated by
a decade of brutal civil war that cost 500,000 lives. What could
economic recovery look like? Then, China preps for a U.S. trade war
under Trump, and global criminals utilize cryptocurrency to launder
money.

id="polarization-is-merriam-websters-2024-word-of-the-year">‘Polarization’
is Merriam-Webster’s 2024 word of the year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The results of the 2024 U.S. presidential election rattled the
country and sent shockwaves across the world — or were cause for
celebration, depending on who you ask. Is it any surprise then that the
Merriam-Webster word of the year is “polarization”?</p>
<p>“Polarization means division, but it’s a very specific kind of
division,” said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster’s editor at large, in
an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday’s
announcement. “Polarization means that we are tending toward the
extremes rather than toward the center.”</p>
<p>The election was so divisive, many American voters went to the polls
with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an existential threat to
the nation. According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000
voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat
concerned that Donald Trump’s views — but not Harris’ — were too
extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris
— but not Trump.</p>
<p>The Merriam-Webster entry for “polarization” reflects scientific and
metaphorical definitions. It’s most commonly used to mean “causing
strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings.”</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its
site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in
search and usage.</p>
<p>Last year’s pick was “authentic.” This year’s comes as large swaths
of the U.S. struggle to reach consensus on what is real.</p>
<p>“It’s always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind
of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody,” Sokolowski
said. “It’s a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news,
alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word’s
meaning in the culture.”</p>
<p>It’s notable that “polarization” originated in the early 1800s — and
not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about
science, Sokolowski said. He called it a “pretty young word,” in the
scheme of the English language. “Polarized is a term that brings
intensity to another word,” he continued, most frequently used in the
U.S. to describe race relations, politics and ideology.</p>
<p>“The basic job of the dictionary is to tell the truth about words,”
the Merriam-Webster editor continued. “We’ve had dictionaries of English
for 420 years and it’s only been in the last 20 years or so that we’ve
actually known which words people look up.”</p>
<p>“Polarization” extends beyond political connotations. It’s used to
highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends
and other industries.</p>
<p>All the scrutiny over Taylor Swift’s private jet usage? Polarizing.
Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarizing. The
International Olympic Committee’s decision to strip American gymnast
Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it:
polarizing.</p>
<p>Even lighthearted memes — like those making fun of Australian
breakdancer Rachael “Raygun” Gunn’s performance — or the proliferation
of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved
polarizing.</p>
<p>Paradoxically though, people tend to see eye to eye on the word
itself. Sokolowski cited its frequent use among people across the
political spectrum, including commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and
CNN.</p>
<p>“It’s used by both sides,” he said, “and in a little bit ironic twist
to the word, it’s something that actually everyone agrees on.”</p>
<p>Rounding out Merriam-Webster’s top 10 words of 2024:</p>
<p>Demure</p>
<p>TikToker Jools Lebron’s 38-second video describing her workday makeup
routine as “very demure, very mindful” lit up the summer with memes. The
video has been viewed more than 50 million times, yielding “huge spikes”
in lookups, Sokolowski said, and prompting many to learn it means
reserved or modest.</p>
<p>Fortnight</p>
<p>Taylor Swift’s song “Fortnight,” featuring rapper Post Malone,
undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks.
“Music can still send people to the dictionary,” Sokolowski said.</p>
<p>Totality</p>
<p>The solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are
tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico’s
Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of
totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully
blot out the sun. Generally, the word refers to a sum or aggregate
amount — or wholeness.</p>
<p>Resonate</p>
<p>“Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of
the word ‘resonate,’” Sokolowski said. This may be because the word,
which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional
way, can add gravitas to writing. But, paradoxically, artificial
intelligence “also betrays itself to be a robot because it’s using that
word too much.”</p>
<p>Allision</p>
<p>The word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March,
a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. “When you
have one moving object into a fixed object, that’s an allision, not a
collision. You’re showing that one of the two objects struck was not, in
fact, in motion,” Sokolowski said.</p>
<p>Weird</p>
<p>This summer on the TV news show “Morning Joe,” Minnesota Gov. Tim
Walz called Republican leaders “weird.” It may have been what launched
his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice presidential
nominee. Though it’s a word that people typically misspell — is it “ei”
or “ie”? — and search for that reason, its rise in use was notable,
Sokolowski said.</p>
<p>Cognitive</p>
<p>Whether the word was used to raise questions about President Joe
Biden’s debate performance or Trump’s own age, it cropped up often. It
refers to conscious intellectual activity — such as thinking, reasoning,
or remembering.</p>
<p>Pander</p>
<p>Pander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said.
“Conservative news outlets accused Kamala Harris of pandering to
different groups, especially young voters, Black voters, gun rights
supporters.” Whereas Walz said Trump’s visit to a McDonald’s kitchen
pandered to hourly wage workers. It means to say, do, or provide what
someone — such as an audience — wants or demands even though it is not
“good, proper, reasonable, etc.”</p>
<p>Democracy</p>
<p>In 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make “democracy” its first word
of the year. Since then, the word — which, of course, means a form of
government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions,
policies and laws — is consistently one of the dictionary’s most looked
up. “There’s a poignancy to that, that people are checking up on it,”
Sokolowski said. “Maybe the most hopeful thing that the curiosity of the
public shows, is that they’re paying attention.”</p>

<p>Both U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump

Center honors Coppola, the Grateful Dead, Raitt and Sandoval</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Celebrities, cultural icons and a few surprise guests
are gathering for the annual Kennedy Center Honors celebration Sunday
evening in Washington. </p>
<p>This year’s recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic
accomplishment are director and filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, the
Grateful Dead, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, and singer-songwriter
Bonnie Raitt. In addition, the venerable Harlem theater The Apollo,
which has launched generations of Black artists, is being
recognized. </p>
<p>There will be personalized tributes with performances and
testimonials from fellow artists during the gala at the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts. Medallions were presented during the
traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department. </p>
<p>The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients
themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat out lied to her
longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on
stage to perform Cher’s hit, “If I Could Turn Back Time.” </p>
<p>Several of the latest honorees have themselves participated in past
tributes to friends and colleagues at the Kennedy Center. </p>
<p>Coppola spoke during fellow director Martin Scorsese’s induction in
2007. Sandoval performed in the tribute to his mentor, jazz trumpet
legend Dizzy Gillespie. Raitt has taken part in tributes to Buddy Guy
and Mavis Staples. Raitt even attended the Kennedy Center Honors in the
1970s when her father, Broadway performer John Raitt, was taking part in
a tribute to composer Richard Rogers. </p>
<p>The tribute to the Grateful Dead is expected to double as a memorial
to the band’s founding bass player Phil Lesh, who died in October at age
84. </p>
<p>This could also be the last Kennedy Center Honors ceremony without
political intrigue for a while. </p>
<p>During Republican Donald Trump’s first four years in office, Kennedy
Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the
tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy
toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear
threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who
takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his
first term. </p>
<p>Democratic President Joe Biden is scheduled to host a reception for
the honorees at the White House and plans to attend the Kennedy Center
ceremony afterward. </p>
<p>The show will air on CBS on Dec. 22.</p>

id="biden-assads-syrian-collapse-a-fundamental-act-of-justice">Biden:
Assad’s Syrian collapse a ‘fundamental act of justice’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden declared Sunday that the sudden demise of
the Syrian government under Bashar Assad was a “fundamental act of
justice,” but that it was “a moment of uncertainty” for the Mideast.</p>
<p>Biden, speaking at the White House, said the collapse of the
decades-long iron rule by the Assad family was “the best opportunity in
a generation for the Syrian people to forge their own destiny.”</p>
<p>Biden said that action by the U.S. and its allies over the last two
years weakened Syria’s backers — Russia, Iran and Iran-supported
Hezbollah militants in Lebanon — to the extent that “for the first time”
they could no longer defend the Assad government.</p>
<p>“Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,”
Biden said, after a meeting with his national security advisers at the
White House.</p>
<p>U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that Assad had fled his
country, which his family had ruled for decades, because close ally
Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, “was not interested in protecting
him any longer.”</p>
<p>Trump’s comments on his social media platform came a day after he
decried the possibility that the U.S. might intervene militarily in
Syria to aid the rebels as they moved to oust Assad, declaring, “THIS IS
NOT OUR FIGHT.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration had no intention of intervening, according
to Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.</p>
<p>The U.S has about 900 troops in Syria, including forces working with
Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any
resurgence of the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>Biden said he intends for those troops to remain, adding that U.S.
forces on Sunday conducted “dozens” of what he called “precision
airstrikes” on Islamic State camps and operations in Syria.</p>
<p>Biden said the U.S. is “clear eyed” that ISIS will try to take
advantage of the situation in Syria.</p>
<p>The Syrian opposition that brought down Assad is led by Hayat Tahrir
al-Sham. The Biden administration has designated the group as a
terrorist organization and says it has links to al-Qaida, although Hayat
Tahrir al-Sham says it has since broken ties with al-Qaida.</p>
<p>“We will remain vigilant,” Biden said. “Make no mistake, some of the
rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of
terrorism and human rights abuses.” He added that the groups are “saying
the right things now.”</p>
<p>“But as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just
their words, but their actions,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Trump, who takes office January 20, linked the upheaval in Syria and
Russia’s war in Ukraine, noting that Assad’s allies in Moscow, as well
as in Iran, the main sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah, “are in a weakened
state right now.”</p>
<p>Vice President-elect JD Vance, a veteran of the U.S.-led war in Iraq,
wrote on his own social media Sunday to express skepticism about the
insurgents.</p>
<p>“Many of ‘the rebels’ are a literal offshoot of ISIS. One can hope
they’ve moderated. Time will tell,” he said.</p>
<p>With the collapse of the Assad regime, the family of missing U.S.
journalist Austin Tice renewed calls to find him.</p>
<p>“To everyone in Syria that hears this, please remind people that
we’re waiting for Austin,” Tice’s mother, Debra, said in comments that
hostage advocacy groups spread on social media. “We know that when he
comes out, he’s going to be fairly dazed &amp; he’s going to need lots
of care &amp; direction. Direct him to his family please!”</p>
<p>Tice disappeared in 2012 outside Damascus.</p>
<p>“We’ve remained committed to returning him to his family,” Biden told
reporters. “We believe he’s alive, we think we can get him back, but we
have no direct evidence to that yet. And Assad should be held
accountable.”</p>
<p>The president added: “We have to identify where he [Tice] is.”</p>
<p>Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

<h2 id="trump-picks-lawyer-to-serve-as-counselor-to-the-president">Trump
picks lawyer to serve as counselor to the president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday that
he had chosen Alina Habba, his personal attorney, to serve as counselor
to the president.</p>
<p>Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site, called Habba a “tireless
advocate for justice.”</p>
<p>“She has been unwavering in her loyalty and unmatched in her resolve
— standing with me through numerous ‘trials,’ battles and countless days
in Court,” Trump said. “Few understand the Weaponization of the
‘Injustice’ System better than Alina.”</p>
<p>Trump announced several other planned additions to his
administration, including Christopher Landau as his choice to serve as
deputy secretary of state. Landau was the U.S. ambassador to Mexico
during Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>Trump also said former National Security Council spokesman Michael
Anton will serve as the director of policy planning at the State
Department, while Michael Needham will serve as counselor of the State
Department.</p>
<p>Earlier Sunday, Trump vowed to make swift and sweeping changes as he
takes office on January 20, deporting millions of migrants in the
country illegally, imposing tariffs on imported goods that could raise
consumer prices for Americans and pardoning rioters who tried to upend
his 2020 reelection loss. </p>
<p>Six weeks ahead of taking office for a new four-year tenure in the
White House, Trump seemed emboldened by his victory last month, making
him only the second American president elected to a second,
nonconsecutive term after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.</p>
<p>“People like me now, you know?” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in an
interview conducted Friday in New York and broadcast Sunday.</p>
<p>“It’s different than the first — you know, when I won the first time
[in 2016], I wasn’t nearly as popular as this,” he said. “And one thing
that’s very important, in terms of the election, I love that I won the
popular vote, and by a lot,” with about a 2.3 million-vote margin in his
defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris out of the 155 million ballots
that were cast.</p>
<p>But Trump, a Republican, also lapsed into familiar grievances,
refusing as he has for four years to concede he lost the 2020 election
to Democrat Joe Biden because of unfounded claims of fraudulent
balloting and vote counting. Asked by NBC anchor Kristen Welker how, in
his view, Democrats were able to steal that election but not the one a
month ago, Trump said, “Because I think it was too big to rig.”</p>
<p>Trump blamed Biden for the nation’s political divide and heaped
insults on his perceived foes, including the nine-member House of
Representatives committee that spent more than a year examining the
January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters trying
to block lawmakers from certifying that Biden had won the 2020
election.</p>
<p>He called the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the
investigative panel “political thugs and, you know, creeps. For what
they did, honestly, they should go to jail.”</p>
<p>Trump said that on his first day in office he would be “acting very
quickly” to pardon many of the more than 1,200 people convicted of an
array of offenses linked to the rioting at the Capitol. Many of them
have already completed their prison sentences while others have years to
go or have to be tried. He has characterized those imprisoned as
“hostages” and called them “patriots.”</p>
<p>“These people are living in hell,” he said.</p>
<p>Yet Trump said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to
investigate Biden. “I’m not looking to go back into the past,” he said.
“Retribution will be through success.”</p>
<p>But he said that if the Senate confirms his choices of former Florida
state attorney general, Pam Bondi, as attorney general, and loyal
political supporter Kash Patel as FBI director, they would have autonomy
in deciding what to investigate and prosecute. Trump described special
counsel Jack Smith, who twice indicted him, as “very corrupt.”</p>
<p>Trump centered much of his campaign on closing the southwestern U.S.
border with Mexico and said mass deportations will begin quickly. First
will be convicted criminals, he said, while other incoming Trump
officials have said those with deportation orders will also be among the
first to be deported.</p>
<p>“I think you have to do it, and it’s a hard — it’s a very tough thing
to do. It’s — but you have to have, you know, you have rules,
regulations, laws. They came in illegally,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump made no exceptions for families with mixed immigration status,
where some family members are in the U.S. legally and some illegally. “I
don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break
up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all
back,” he declared.</p>
<p>Trump said the cost and logistical complexity of such a massive
deportation plan does not faze him.</p>
<p>“You have no choice,” he said. “First of all, they’re costing us a
fortune. But we’re starting with the criminals, and we’ve got to do it.
And then we’re starting with the others, and we’re going to see how it
goes.”</p>
<p>But he said he would attempt to work with Democratic lawmakers to
exempt so-called “dreamers” from deportation, young children who were
brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents and have little
connection to their native countries.</p>
<p>He also said he will attempt to end birthright citizenship in the
U.S., now embedded in the country’s Constitution, which guarantees
citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of the legality of
their parents being in the U.S.</p>
<p>Trump said he would keep a campaign promise to levy tariffs on
imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Mexico
and Canada. He acknowledged that he could not “guarantee American
families won’t pay more” as a result of his plan.</p>
<p>“I can’t guarantee anything,” Trump said. “I can’t guarantee
tomorrow.”</p>
<p>He said he is actively trying to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, “if I
can.” He said Kyiv may not get as much military assistance under his
administration as it has under Biden. During a political debate in
September, Trump declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war.</p>

id="moana-2-cruises-to-another-record-weekend-600-million-globally">‘Moana
2’ cruises to another record weekend, $600 million globally</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s animated film “Moana 2” remained at the top of
the box office in its second weekend in theaters as it brought in
another record haul. </p>
<p>The film added $52 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.
That brings its domestic total to $300 million, surpassing the original,
and its global tally to a staggering $600 million.</p>
<p>The amount set a record gross for a movie on the weekend following
Thanksgiving weekend, unseating “Frozen II,” which earned $35.2 million
in the same time frame in 2019. The numbers are not adjusted for
inflation. Originally conceived as a Disney+ series, “Moana 2” has
already broken into the top five highest grossing releases of the year.
Its performance means Disney has three films in this year’s top five,
including “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.” The studio also
has another big movie on the way before the year ends: Barry Jenkins’
“Mufasa,” out Dec. 20.</p>
<p>The weekend also showcased several new releases, including A24’s
horror comedy “Y2K” and the Jude Law crime thriller “The Order.” But
nothing was ever going to present significant competition to the
enticing Thanksgiving leftovers, “Moana 2,” “Wicked” and “Gladiator
II.”</p>
<p>Second place at the box office was occupied by “Wicked,” which added
$34.9 million, bringing its domestic total to $320.5 million in three
weeks. Globally, the musical adaptation released by Universal is at
$455.6 million. “Gladiator II” followed in third place with $12.5
million, while “Red One” came in fourth with $7 million.</p>
<p>“These holdovers are going to create the momentum that’s going to put
an $8.5 billion-plus box office year on the horizon,” said Paul
Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, $11 billion had become the annual norm for the movie
business. Since then, the closest the industry has gotten to that number
was last year, which cracked $9 billion. This year started off slow and
up to a few months ago, Dergarabedian said, even hitting $8 billion for
the year was in doubt. But in the two weeks since Thanksgiving, the
deficit from last year has narrowed by over 5%. </p>
<p>The newcomers struggled to make a significant impact. Even the 10th
anniversary rerelease of Christopher Nolan’s “Interstellar,” which
played in only 165 theaters, did better than “Y2K” ($2.1 million) and
“The Order” ($878,000) combined. Paramount reported that the science
fiction epic starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway brought in
an estimated $4.4 million. IMAX also noted that all the 70mm IMAX
presentations of “Interstellar” were sold out through the weekend.</p>
<p>“I was thrilled so many moviegoers took advantage of the original
IMAX experience of ‘Interstellar’ this weekend,” Nolan said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The biggest of the many newcomers was the Indian action pic “Pushpa:
The Rule – Part 2,” which earned $4.9 million. Sony and Crunchyroll’s
anime release, “Solo Leveling – ReAwakening,” made $2.4 million. Fathom
also released pop duo for KING + COUNTRY’s “A Drummer Boy Christmas”
concert in theaters where it made $2.1 million.</p>
<p>“It’s a really diverse marketplace,” Dergarabedian said. “There’s
event cinema, international cinema, a rerelease of a 10-year-old film.
It’s easily one of the most eclectic and interesting lineups I’ve ever
seen.”</p>
<p>Next weekend theaters are in for another influx of bigger movies,
with both Sony’s comic book film “Kraven the Hunter” and the animated
“The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim” opening in wide
release. Awards contenders “Nickel Boys” and “September 5” will also
open in a limited number of theaters.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

calls for ‘immediate ceasefire’ in Ukraine after meeting Zelenskyy in
Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KYIV — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday called for an
immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, shortly after a meeting in Paris with
French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming Kyiv “would like to make a deal”
to end the more than 1,000-day war. </p>
<p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Moscow and
Kyiv have both lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that
“should never have started.” </p>
<p>“There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should
begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families
destroyed,” he said, as he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to
act to bring the fighting to an end. </p>
<p>Trump’s remarks came after a meeting Saturday with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his French counterpart, Emmanuel
Macron, that Zelenskyy later described as “constructive”. </p>
<p>Speaking to reporters later that day, Zelenskyy insisted that any
peace deal “should be just” for Ukrainians, “so that Russia and Putin or
any other aggressors will not have the opportunity to return.” </p>
<p>In a separate social media update Sunday, Zelenskyy asserted that
Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since Moscow’s all-out invasion on
Feb. 24, 2022, while a further 370,000 have been wounded. </p>
<p>Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to publish official
casualty figures, but Western officials have said that the past few
months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant
record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and wounded
each month.</p>

oldest-known wild bird lays egg in Hawaii at age 74</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe
age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials
said. </p>
<p>The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to
Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the
Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg,
the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service said in a
Facebook post this week. </p>
<p>Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the
Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate
for life and lay one egg per year. But Akeakamai has not been seen for
several years, and Wisdom began interacting with another male when she
returned last week, officials said. </p>
<p>“We are optimistic that the egg will hatch,” Jonathan Plissner,
supervisory wildlife biologist at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge,
said in a statement. Every year, millions of seabirds return to the
refuge to nest and raise their young. </p>
<p>Albatross parents take turns incubating an egg for about two months.
Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They
spend most of their lives flying over the ocean and feeding on squid and
fish eggs. </p>
<p>Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956 and has raised as many as
30 chicks, Plissner said. </p>
<p>The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 68 years, according to
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

id="as-data-centers-proliferate-conflict-with-local-communities-follows">As
data centers proliferate, conflict with local communities follows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA — Richard Andre Newman thought he would live the
rest of his life in his quiet, leafy neighborhood in suburban Virginia.
He was born and raised in Bren Mar Park, where children ride their bikes
and neighbors wave hello.</p>
<p>But now, as he’s approaching 60, he’s considering selling his Fairfax
County home and moving away. That’s because he’s getting a new neighbor:
Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical
substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds
and a community center.</p>
<p>Newman feels helpless to stop it.</p>
<p>“I planned on staying here until I died,” he said, “until this came
up.”</p>
<p>The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed
servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and
computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape,
popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.</p>
<p>Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid
growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local
governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.
But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas,
abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents
are pushing back against the world’s most powerful corporations over
concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their
communities.</p>
<p>Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight
against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough
to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to
homes.</p>
<p>“All that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in
this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn’t
run residents away from their homes,” he said.</p>
<p>Dotting the hills in Northern Virginia</p>
<p>In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling
hills of the area’s westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular
Washington &amp; Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data
centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation’s
capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro.</p>
<p>Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on
neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners
association in the community.</p>
<p>The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm
founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials
promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent
positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction
and electrical jobs to build the facility.</p>
<p>Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022,
hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green
space.</p>
<p>But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping
out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for
the Plaza 500 project.</p>
<p>When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held
protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to
their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were
largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in
September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter
zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under
the old rules.</p>
<p>Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the
already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia
in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by
2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates
also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every
day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray
also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help
power the data centers’ hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into
the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the firm declined to respond to questions for this
story.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how a general resident, even someone who has been
engaging intently on an issue,” Ray said, “has any chance to go up
against the data center industry.”</p>
<p>Local leaders say data centers a financial boon</p>
<p>For local governments, attracting data centers to their
municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said
in 2024 that Virginia’s existing data centers brought in $1 billion in
tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech
companies that own them in 2023.</p>
<p>For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of
direct jobs — often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently
that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000
residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center
advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction,
technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In
that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730
indirect jobs.</p>
<p>Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of
Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her
estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax
County should reap the benefits.</p>
<p>“I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the
big picture,” Smith said. “Data centers are not going away.”</p>
<p>Amazon data centers welcomed by some in Oregon </p>
<p>On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon
Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the
4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland
flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia
river.</p>
<p>Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in
property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a
$66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in
two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another
$1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023.</p>
<p>That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and
bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a
new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras,
and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things.</p>
<p>Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals.
Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials
allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a
company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the
data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics
complaint against them.</p>
<p>Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the
relationships between the company and local officials, and raised
eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an
estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build
five new data centers.</p>
<p>Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS
officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant
in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River.</p>
<p>The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a
commissioner. “They said, ‘Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what
you need. Tell us what we can do for you,’” Doherty recalled. Other
former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS
didn’t ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy.</p>
<p>“We engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate
around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a
community’s goals,” said Kevin Miller, AWS’ Vice President of global
data centers. “This helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve
those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good
neighbors.”</p>
<p>Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said
they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new
data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to
negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of
AWS-suited lawyers.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to blow it up. We didn’t want to run them off,” said
Lindsay. “But there were better deals to be made.”</p>
<p>Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer and Police Chief Rick Stokoe say their
direct line to AWS allows them to get the most out of the company.</p>
<p>“This road right here? Wouldn’t happen if it wasn’t for AWS,” said
Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Stokoe’s cruiser, pointing out
the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.
Both Keefer and Stokoe have been in positions to vote on whether to
authorize tax breaks for AWS.</p>
<p>“These companies would not be here if they weren’t getting some kind
of incentive,” Stokoe said. “There wouldn’t be any money to talk
about.”</p>

House on guard against Islamic State resurgence in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The White House said Saturday that U.S. priorities in
Syria now are to ensure the country’s conflict does not encourage a
resurgence of the Islamic State militant group or lead to a
“humanitarian catastrophe.”</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and his team are monitoring the
“extraordinary events in Syria” are in touch with regional partners, the
White House said on Saturday.</p>
<p>“President Biden and his team are closely monitoring the
extraordinary events in Syria and staying in constant touch with
regional partners,” the White House said in a statement.</p>
<p>Spillover “is a concern,” said national security adviser Jake
Sullivan, with particular worry about the so-called Islamic State, also
known as ISIS.</p>
<p>In previous phases of Syria’s long-running civil war, “at its worst,
we saw the explosion of ISIS onto the scene,” he said at a conference in
Simi Valley, California run by the Reagan National Defense Forum.</p>
<p>The main priority is to ensure “that the fighting in Syria not lead
to a resurgence of ISIS,” Sullivan said. “We are going to take steps
ourselves, directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the
Kurds, to ensure that does not happen.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria, including U.S. forces working
with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any
resurgence of the Islamic State group, according to The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Gen. Bryan Fenton, head of U.S. Special Operations Command, told the
AP he would not want to speculate on how the upheaval in Syria would
affect the U.S. military’s footprint in the country. “It’s still too
early to tell,” he said.</p>
<p>What would not change is the focus on disrupting IS operations in
Syria and protecting U.S. troops, Fenton said during a panel at the
Reagan event.</p>
<p>Rebel forces are in the midst of a lightning offensive and say they
have begun to encircle Syria’s capital, Damascus.</p>
<p>Sullivan said the Biden administration is working to ensure allies
Israel, Jordan, Iraq and others in the region, “who would potentially
face spillover effects from Syria, are strong and secure, and we’re in
touch with them every day.”</p>
<p>Washington is also alert to stopping a “humanitarian catastrophe,
both in terms of civilians, access to life-saving necessities, and in
terms of the protection of religious and ethnic minorities in Syria,”
Sullivan said.</p>
<p>“Of course, an event like this happens and ISIS immediately looks to
take advantage. We have seen reports of ISIS trying … to reconstitute to
a certain extent.”</p>
<p>So the United States will seek to “contain the potential violence and
instability,” protect allies and ensure that ISIS not “get new oxygen
out of this” that could lead them to threaten US or allies’ interests,
Sullivan added.</p>
<p>Sullivan’s remarks come as Washington prepares for a transition of
power next month back to former president Donald Trump, who defeated
Biden in November’s election.</p>
<p>Trump, who visited Paris on Saturday, warned against US involvement
in Syria, saying the country is “a mess” and “not our friend.”</p>
<p>“THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.</p>
<p>Sullivan, addressing Trump’s remarks, agreed, saying “the United
States is not going to… militarily dive into the middle of a Syrian
civil war.”</p>
<p>Some material for this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

House to vote to provide $3 billion to remove Chinese telecoms
equipment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote next
week on an annual defense bill that includes just over $3 billion for
U.S. telecom companies to remove equipment made by Chinese telecoms
firms Huawei and ZTE 000063.SZ from American wireless networks to
address security risks.</p>
<p>The 1,800-page text was released late Saturday and includes other
provisions aimed at China, including requiring a report on Chinese
efforts to evade U.S. national security regulations and an intelligence
assessment of the current status of China’s biotechnology
capabilities.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission has said removing the insecure
equipment is estimated to cost $4.98 billion but Congress previously
only approved $1.9 billion for the “rip and replace” program.</p>
<p>Washington has aggressively urged U.S. allies to purge Huawei and
other Chinese gear from their wireless networks.</p>
<p>FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel last week again called on the U.S.
Congress to provide urgent additional funding, saying the program to
replace equipment in the networks of 126 carriers faces a $3.08 billion
shortfall “putting both our national security and the connectivity of
rural consumers who depend on these networks at risk.”</p>
<p>She has warned the lack of funding could result in some rural
networks shutting down, which “could eliminate the only provider in some
regions” and could threaten 911 service.</p>
<p>Competitive Carriers Association CEO Tim Donovan on Saturday praised
the announcement, saying “funding is desperately needed to fulfill the
mandate to remove and replace covered equipment and services while
maintaining connectivity for tens of millions of Americans.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Congress told the FCC to require U.S. telecoms carriers that
receive federal subsidies to purge their networks of Chinese telecoms
equipment. The White House in 2023 asked for $3.1 billion for the
program.</p>
<p>Senate Commerce Committee chair Maria Cantwell said funding for the
program and up to $500 million for regional tech hubs will be covered by
funds generated from a one-time spectrum auction by the FCC for advanced
wireless spectrum in the band known as AWS-3 to help meet rising
spectrum demands of wireless consumers.</p>

<p>PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII — Ira “Ike” Schab, a 104-year-old Pearl Harbor
attack survivor, was so determined to stand and salute during a
remembrance ceremony honoring those killed in the Japanese bombing that
thrust the U.S. into World War II some 83 years ago that he spent six
weeks in physical therapy to build the strength to do so.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Schab gingerly rose from his wheelchair and raised his
right hand, returning a salute delivered by sailors on a destroyer and a
submarine passing by in the harbor. His son and a daughter supported him
from either side.</p>
<p>“I was honored to do it. I’m glad I was capable of standing up,” he
said afterward. “I’m getting old, you know.”</p>
<p>Schab is one of only two servicemen who lived through the attack who
made it to an annual observance hosted by the U.S. Navy and National
Park Service on a grass field overlooking the harbor. A third survivor
had been planning to join them but had to cancel because of health
issues.</p>
<p>The December 7, 1941, bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen.
Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS
Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900
Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel.</p>
<p>Dozens of survivors once joined the event but their attendance has
declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living,
according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state
chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military
historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000
military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack.</p>
<p>Schab agreed when ceremony organizers asked him earlier this year to
salute on behalf of all survivors and World War II veterans.</p>
<p>“He’s been working hard, because this is his goal,” said his daughter
Kimberlee Heinrichs, who traveled to Hawaii with Schab from their
Beaverton, Oregon, home. “He wanted to be able to stand for that.”</p>
<p>Schab was a sailor on the USS Dobbin at the time of the attack,
serving as the tuba player in the ship’s band. He had showered and put
on a clean uniform when he heard the call for a fire rescue party.</p>
<p>He hurried topside to see Japanese planes flying overhead and the USS
Utah capsizing. He quickly went back below deck to join a daisy chain of
sailors feeding shells to an anti-aircraft gun topside.</p>
<p>Ken Stevens, 102, who served on the USS Whitney, joined Schab at the
ceremony. USS Curtiss sailor Bob Fernandez, 100, was unable to come due
to health issues.</p>
<p>Attendees observed a moment of silence at 7:54 a.m., the same time
the attack began eight decades ago. F-22 jets in missing man formation
flew overhead shortly after.</p>
<p>Fernandez, speaking in a phone interview from California, where he
lives with his nephew in Lodi, recalled feeling shocked and surprised as
the attack began.</p>
<p>“When those things go off like that, we didn’t know what’s what,”
Fernandez said. “We didn’t even know we were in a war.”</p>
<p>Fernandez was a mess cook on the Curtiss and his job that morning was
to bring sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast.
Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a
plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly
by.</p>
<p>Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and
other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing
12.7-centimeter, 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to
the ship’s guns.</p>
<p>He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow
sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above.</p>
<p>“I felt kind of scared because I didn’t know what the hell was going
on,” Fernandez said.</p>
<p>The ship’s guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its
cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber that then slammed into
the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on
fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command.</p>
<p>Fernandez’s ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its
sailors were injured.</p>
<p>Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn’t
view himself that way.</p>
<p>“I’m not a hero,” he said. “I’m just nothing but an ammunition
passer.”</p>

ruby slippers from ‘The Wizard of Oz’ auctioned for $28M</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS — A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy
Garland in The Wizard of Oz and stolen from a museum nearly two decades
ago fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday.</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions had estimated that they would fetch $3 million or
more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55
million, or $1.91 million including the buyer’s premium, a commission
that the buyer pays, said Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the
Dallas-based auction house. More than 800 people were tracking the
slippers, and the company’s web page for the auction had hit nearly
43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.</p>
<p>As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, The Ruby Slippers of Oz, puts it,
the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen “more twists
and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.”</p>
<p>They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of
Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to
smash the glass of the museum’s door and display case.</p>
<p>Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in
2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota,
wasn’t publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023.
He pleaded guilty in October 2023. He was in a wheelchair and on
supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served
because of his poor health.</p>
<p>His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin,
who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was
attempting to pull off “one last score” after an old associate with
connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real
jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence — a person
who buys stolen goods — later told him the rubies were just glass,
DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn’t
specify how.</p>
<p>The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis
suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair
and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He’s scheduled to
go on trial in January and hasn’t entered a plea, though his attorney
has said he’s not guilty.</p>
<p>The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael
Shaw, who had lent them to the museum. They were one of several pairs
that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to
have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to
click her heels three times and repeat, “There’s no place like
home.”</p>
<p>Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand
Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival
to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to
help the museum purchase the slippers.</p>
<p>The Wizard of Oz story has gained new attention in recent weeks with
the release of the movie Wicked, an adaptation of the megahit Broadway
musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked
Witch of the West.</p>
<p>The auction also included other memorabilia from The Wizard of Oz,
such as a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked
Witch of the West.</p>
