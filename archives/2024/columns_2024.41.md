## Pseudo code and kitchen table conversations

date: 2024-10-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Today's <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2024/10/07/pseudoCodeAndKitchenTableConversations.html">podcast</a> has nothing to do with the 30 year milestone, except that it is totally unscripted, stream of consciousness, for 30 minutes, on two topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea of what a programming language is, is about to be completely overturned. The verbs and nouns will, at least at first, be pretty much exactly like we do it now, but the way you specify how they work, how they interact both in the UI and on the backend, will be done more or less as you would document the user interface. The AI system is almost ready to work at that level. With a few more iterations by human designers it should all meet up in a place where the slogging type work I've been doing for 50+ years will be obsolete. We will all become anachronisms. All of us. Get ready for it. And btw I was the biggest skeptic of the idea of a higher level more human way of programming. Scoffed at the idea. Repeatedly. Never say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.</li>
<li>The second part is about kitchen-table conversations in families, the bored rantings of our ancestors, passed on lovingly from generation to generation. Should have realized that we did not turn a racial corner with the election of Obama, we all should have gotten prepared for the backlash from children of the slavers and fascists, who were raised alongside us as victims of slavery and fascism were raised to feel persecuted. We all revert to our comfortable roles. The question is can we rise above that and forget for a moment what our ancestors taught us as gospel and take an interest in going beyond that, or do we have to do another loop around the genocide and its consequences, which this time will be <i>far worse</i> than they were in the 1940s because of all the new war and computer tech and the damage done by the post-war growth. </li>
</ul>
<p>I feel good about this podcast, because it has nothing to do with the milestone. I have an idea of what it feels like to have been blogging for 30 years, but no conclusions to offer that would mean anything to me or anyone else, except perhaps a psychologist. </p>
<p>I've been watching a lot of sports recently and the interviews with star athletes saying the same predictable bullshit after being asked how it felt to do whatever heroic thing they just did. All of TV and news is like that, none of it is news, all of it is predictable bullshit. That is probably why they have so much trouble reporting the truth about Trump and Musk. It doesn't fit into their job description, it's not in anyone's job to tell the truth. And <i>that's</i> the truth. </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-10-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Interestingly, the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/07/mailClock.png">clock</a> at the bottom of the nightly emails does not agree with the clock on the home page of Scripting News. It's a hard thing to test in real life. And it's completely fitting, given the motto of the blog is "It's even worse than it appears," which could be the motto of programmers everywhere, and probably bloggers too. We always focus on the bad news, of course -- that's human nature -- but always remember, it could be worse. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">ðŸ˜„</span>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-10-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Today's the big day. Thanks to John Naughton's wonderful <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/the-blogosphere-is-in-full-bloom-the-rest-of-the-internet-has-wilted-dave-winer">piece</a> in the Guardian, I'm hearing from people all over the world about what blogging means to them. I appreciate all of the messages, but would appreciate them <i>even more</i> if they were on your blog. We need to keep using the tech. Blogging is kind of lost, and I would like to see that change. Every time you post something you're proud of on a social media site, how about taking a moment and posting it to your blog too. And while there, if appropriate, link to something from some part of your post, even though the social media sites don't support linking, the web is still there and it still does.

## How about those Mets, day 2

date: 2024-10-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I am reminded of 2015, when the Mets were so charmed -- they could be down 9-0 in the 8th inning and you would tune into the game to see how they'd win it. It's not the usual thing for the Mets, who pull defeat from the jaws of victory far more often than the other way. </p>
<p>And omg, 2024 is shaping up the same way. </p>
<p>Sit down and shut up, here come the Mets!</p>
<p>Briefly, because I have stuff to do -- the Mets were down 1-0 in the bottom of the 8th, having been thoroughly shut down by the amazing Zach Wheeler. Imagine someone throwing a ball at you at 100 mph that looks like it's going down but actually goes up and to the left. Or next time down and to the right. You could try to swing but you'd have to be very lucky to connect. And so it was for the first seven innings until they took out Wheeler (pitchers don't do complete games any longer, they used to). </p>
<p>The Mets were ready. Hit after hit after hit and before you knew it, it was 5-1. Alonso, the star of the last Milwaukee game drove in one of the runs with a long sacrifice fly to center.  </p>
<p>The Phillies and their fans who had been so confident of victory were shocked. And left to plan for today's game at 4PM on Fox. You gotta know where I'll be -- glued to the set and dreaming about the fate of this Mets team who shows real signs of strong <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mets+philosophy+site%3Ascripting.com">philosophy</a>. </p>

## WordPress destiny, day 2

date: 2024-10-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Glad I wrote the piece I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/05/142118.html?title=wordPressDestiny1">yesterday</a>. </p>
<p>I could have written it any time in the last year as I was investigating and developing on the WordPress API and back end, but now seemed to be a good time, with all the attention its getting, and Matt's interviews, I and others are getting a better idea of what the various components of the community are. I don't know about the rest of you, but I had only a vague idea of what WordPress is beyond a piece of software used for commerce and to a lesser extent these days, writing on the web.</p>
<p>A few ideas -- not in any particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>From my point of view, blogging and the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>, WordPress is being built <i>around</i> more than being built on, when it is such a <a href="https://textcasting.org/">potent</a> and surprisingly open <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+coral+reef">platform</a>. I took the time to look, and underneath the cluttered user interface is a strong foundation that you could build <i>any kind of writing software</i> on. </li>
<li>If a community developed at this level, writing tools, we'd be compatible at a very deep level, so the opportunities for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop">interop</a> are amazing. I don't say that lightly. (I had asked them to allow apps to attach their own data to posts for years, until I discovered earlier this year the API has that feature. If only they had listened to the question and answered it thoughtfully, we could have saved years. The company desperately needs an evangelism function.)</li>
<li>The WordPress platform could be a very strong part of the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>. The comparison between developer freedom on the WordPress platform and the Facebook one (which is what Threads is built on) is stark. I have worked on the Facebook platform, btw -- and from a software design perspective it's brilliant, a breakthrough, something to emulate, which I did in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity">wpidentity</a> package I wrote. But from a policy standpoint, after the 2016 election Facebook's API was radically restricted, not something many people know about (it was a fully public event). WordPress has an API that doesn't appear to have any such limits, and even if they imposed them, in theory their server could be cloned (it's open source) but it certainly could be emulated at an API level. </li>
<li>It's enticing. All those users -- there should be a market for writing tools there, but there isn't. Why is that??</li>
<li>I feel like we're like ships passing in the night. I thought I should point this out, at least once, as Matt and company go off in a direction I don't understand and don't see why I should want to. Did they care when the move to HTTPS undermined what remains of the original blogosphere? I don't see any evidence of it. It's like Walmart sought to build a shopping center on the remains of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>. People don't seem to have any respect for independent writing on the web, what we dreamed of in the beginning, and <i>the dream was realized.</i> No wonder the tech industry wants to tear it down. It contradicts a basic premise of the programming priesthood. And no wonder journalism doesn't defend it, they are offended by the idea of people writing for free, based on the incorrect assumption about what we do. We're their sources, dammit, not their competitors, at least if they would do their jobs (which is another problem altogether) and if they spent any time thinking and questioning before condeming.</li>
<li> Look at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/the-blogosphere-is-in-full-bloom-the-rest-of-the-internet-has-wilted-dave-winer">John Naughton's piece</a> today in the Guardian. He's doing more to focus attention on the web as a writing environment than the whole tech industry which is built on our work, especially Automattic. The ignorance and in some cases resentment in the industry is huge, something else Naughton points out so well. We can turn this around, I guess since WordPress is open source, it doesn't have to wait for Matt to turn in that direction. </li>
</ul>
<p>Just some thoughts as the world seems to be converging on something, not sure what. There are so many doors that are now open that never were before, the question is -- do we have the courage to connect the dots and work together, or do we all insist on going our own ways to a fairly dark future.  </p>
<p>PS: If you're a developer, this is the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity/blob/main/client/api2.js">API</a> you use in browser-JS code for the wpidentity package. This was the way Facebook packaged their API for developers, and it was far more efficient than the way Twitter did and WordPress too. So I added this to the stack, and built on it. </p>
