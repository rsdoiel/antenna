date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-17, from: Polygon Website

Christian Tafdrup’s taut 2022 Danish horror movie Speak No Evil (streaming on Shudder) has one of the all-time bleak movie endings, a sequence designed to stick in viewers’ memories and haunt their dreams. James Watkins’ 2024 English-language remake approaches that ending… and then adds another half-hour or so of cathartic run-and-gun action, leading up to [&#8230;]

## The new D&#038;D Player’s Handbook is a treasure, and we may never see its equal again

date: 2024-09-17, updated: 2024-09-17, from: Polygon Website

The journey to create the 2024 version of the Dungeons &#38; Dragons Player’s Handbook has been long and almost comically rocky. Where to even begin… Should we start with the OGL debacle, an attempted rug-pull that would have irrevocably damaged the franchise’s biggest third-party creators? Should we instead focus on the gutting layoffs that came [&#8230;]
