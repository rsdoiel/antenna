## We got a peek at the cozy Hobbit life sim game and it understands the damn brief

date: 2024-09-22, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website

We’re living in the middle of a bounty of Middle-earth media. Last year’s wretched Gollum game, 2026’s apparent Gollum duology, The Rings of Power’s elven kings, War of the Rohirrim’s horse maidens, and more video games of various scope and subject reportedly still on the way.  And yet none of the above is giving the [&#8230;]

## This little sci-fi movie takes time loops on a new track

date: 2024-09-22, updated: 2024-09-20, from: Polygon Website

In Groundhog Day, some unexplained force — maybe celestial, certainly moral — traps misanthropic weatherman Bill Murray in a single, repeated day until he sheds his attitude and becomes a better person. In Palm Springs, shiftless wedding guests Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti fall into a time-loop vortex, a freak of astrophysics, in a cave. [&#8230;]

## My Old Ass director says Aubrey Plaza didn’t need to look like her time-traveling younger self to be perfect

In the new time-travel comedy My Old Ass, Maisy Stella and Aubrey Plaza play two versions of the same character, Elliott: One is a young, confident teenager, and the other is her older self.

## Zack Snyder’s new Netflix show is his take on The Boys

“Fuck the gods” is a sentiment that feels like it’s everywhere right now, from the more literal interpretation of Netflix’s Kaos to the variety of “eat the rich” narratives tapping into the simmering anger at the present growing inequality. Ragnarök, the mythological end of many of the gods in a fit of brutal battle and [&#8230;]

## Hades is unmatched when it comes to video game storytelling

I’m often let down by game stories. With rare exceptions —&#160;Half-Life, Shadow of the Colossus, games that knew when to shut the hell up —&#160;I’ve found them tiresome, forgettable, and frustratingly aping film and television stories. Bad writing isn’t to blame. There are many smart, well-crafted stories in video games lessened by the need to [&#8230;]

Fall used to be clearer — a shift in the wind, a turn of the leaves, inescapable pumpkin spice bullshit.

## Rings of Power is wasting Middle-earth&#8217;s magic

Magic isn’t an easy thing to depict in fantasy television shows. There are plenty of reasons why the creators of Game of Thrones seemed so eager to shy away from that universe’s most fantastical elements in their adaptation. It breaks the sense of grounded realism that recent versions of these shows are so overly fond [&#8230;]

After seven live-action Transformers films of — I’ll say generously — varying quality, to call Transformers One the best film in the franchise may be damning with faint praise. But even I went into the animated Transformers One with low expectations. After all, I was in the midst of watching all five Michael Bay-directed Transformers movies [&#8230;]

## Crime Scene Cleaner is, ironically, my zen game of choice

Games like PowerWash Simulator and House Flipper are invitations to relax; they’re all about creating order from chaos.

## Tom Bombadil is powerful enough to expose the problems with The Rings of Power

Tom Bombadil isn’t wholly knowable. That’s how he was introduced to me, someone who read the Lord of the Rings books a long time ago as a kid, and has since mostly fielded Bombadilisms via friends better versed in the world of Tolkien.

In 2006, Dead Rising established a new zombie franchise for Capcom, shedding much of the implied seriousness of the Resident Evil franchise for a campier, more satirical take on the horror genre.

## Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket is for the art sickos
