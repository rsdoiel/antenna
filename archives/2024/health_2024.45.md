## Proteomics of circulating extracellular vesicles reveals diverse clinical presentations of COVID-19 but fails to identify viral peptides

date: 2024-11-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by virus-infected cells have the potential to encapsulate viral peptides, a characteristic that could facilitate vaccine development. Furthermore, plasma-derived EVs may elucidate pathological changes occurring in distal tissues during viral infections. We hypothesized that molecular characterization of EVs isolated from COVID-19 patients would reveal peptides suitable for vaccine development. Blood samples were collected from three cohorts: severe COVID-19 patients (G1), mild/asymptomatic cases (G2), and SARS-CoV-2-negative healthcare workers (G3). Samples were obtained at two time points: during the initial phase of the pandemic in early 2020 (m0) and eight months later (m8). Clinical data analysis revealed elevated inflammatory markers in G1. Notably, non-vaccinated individuals in G1 exhibited increased levels of neutralizing antibodies at m8, suggesting prolonged exposure to viral antigens. Proteomic profiling of EVs was performed using three distinct methods: immunocapture (targeting CD9), ganglioside-capture (utilizing Siglec-1) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Contrary to our hypothesis, this analysis failed to identify viral peptides. These findings were subsequently validated through Western blot analysis targeting the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein’s and comparative studies using samples from experimentally infected Syrian hamsters. Furthermore, analysis of the EV cargo revealed a diverse molecular profile, including components involved in the regulation of viral replication, systemic inflammation, antigen presentation, and stress responses. These findings underscore the potential significance of EVs in the pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19.

## Strain-level genomic analysis of serotype, genotype and virulence gene composition of group B streptococcus

date: 2024-11-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionGBS (group B streptococcus) is an opportunistic pathogen that can colonize healthy individuals but presents significant challenges in clinical obstetrics and gynecology, as it can cause miscarriage, preterm birth, and invasive infections in newborns. To develop specific and personalized preventative strategies, a better understanding of the epidemiological characteristics and pathogenic features of GBS is essential.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive strain-level genomic analysis of GBS, examining serotype and genotype distributions, as well as the composition and correlations of virulence genes using the blastn-short mode of the BLAST program(v2.10.0+), mlstsoftware (https://github.com/tseemann/mlst), Snippy (v4.6.0), FastTree (v2.1.11) and iTOL. The coding sequence region of virulence factors was annotated by Prodigal (v2.6.3) and Glimmer(v3.02b). We further identified host protein interacting with Srr2 by mass spectrometry analysis.ResultsWhile certain genotypes showed strong serotype consistency, there was no significant association between overall serotypes and genotypes. However, the composition of virulence genes was more closely related to the phylogeny of GBS, among which simultaneous presence of Srr2 and HygA exhibit significant association with hypervirulence. Tubulin emerged as the most distinct and abundant hit. The specific interaction of Tubulin with Srr2-BR, rather than Srr1-BR, was further confirmed by immunoblotting.DiscussionConsidering the impact of cytoskeleton rearrangement on GBS pathogenesis, this observation offers a plausible explanation for the hypervirulence triggered by Srr2. Collectively, our findings indicate that in the future clinical practice, virulence gene detection should be given more attention to achieve precise GBS surveillance and disease prevention.

## Cdc42 improve SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-induced cellular senescence through activating of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway

date: 2024-11-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionSARS-CoV-2 infection drove senescent cells and the senescence-associated phenotypes were reported playing roles in disease progression, which contributes to severe COVID-19 and related sequelae. Cdc42 is involved in the regulation of cellular senescence. This study, aimed to investigate the mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein regulating cellular senescence through Cdc42.MethodsK18-hACE2 mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4 or stimulated with spike protein through the airway, the senescent cells and Cdc42 expression in lung tissue were detected. Overexpression of spike protein or exogenous incubation of spike protein was used to simulate the induction of cellular senescence by spike protein. Mechanistic insights into the role of Cdc42 were mainly explored using Western Blot and qRT-PCR.ResultsSpike protein, SARS-CoV-2 infection related, accelerates cell aging by upregulating Cdc42 expression, which furtherly activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Conversely, treatment with ML141 in animal models, a Cdc42 inhibitor, reduced cellular senescence and ameliorated lung injury and inflammation. These results suggest that the upregulation of Cdc42 by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces cellular senescence and enhances β-catenin nuclear translocation.DiscussionThis study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying cellular senescence induced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, offering potential strategies to mitigate the inflammatory response and complications associated with COVID-19 in both the acute and long-term phases.

## Application of tongue image characteristics and oral-gut microbiota in predicting pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes with machine learning

date: 2024-11-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThis study aimed to characterize the oral and gut microbiota in prediabetes mellitus (Pre-DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients while exploring the association between tongue manifestations and the oral-gut microbiota axis in diabetes progression.MethodsParticipants included 30 Pre-DM patients, 37 individuals with T2DM, and 28 healthy controls. Tongue images and oral/fecal samples were analyzed using image processing and 16S rRNA sequencing. Machine learning techniques, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest, gradient boosting, adaptive boosting, and K-nearest neighbors, were applied to integrate tongue image data with microbiota profiles to construct predictive models for Pre-DM and T2DM classification.ResultsSignificant shifts in tongue characteristics were identified during the progression from Pre-DM to T2DM. Elevated Firmicutes levels along the oral-gut axis were associated with white greasy fur, indicative of underlying metabolic changes. An SVM-based predictive model demonstrated an accuracy of 78.9%, with an AUC of 86.9%. Notably, tongue image parameters (TB-a, perALL) and specific microbiota (Escherichia, Porphyromonas-A) emerged as prominent diagnostic markers for Pre-DM and T2DM.ConclusionThe integration of tongue diagnosis with microbiome analysis reveals distinct tongue features and microbial markers. This approach significantly improves the diagnostic capability for Pre-DM and T2DM.

## Hematologic cancers and infections: how to detect infections in advance and determine the type?

date: 2024-11-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Infection is one of the leading causes of death in patients with hematologic cancers. Hematologic cancer patients with compromised immune systems are already susceptible to infections, which come on even more rapidly and are difficult to control after they develop neutrophil deficiencies from high-dose chemotherapy. After patients have developed an infection, the determination of the type of infection becomes a priority for clinicians. In this review, we summarize the biomarkers currently used for the prediction of infections in patients with hematologic cancers; procalcitonin, CD64, cytokines, and CD14 et al. can be used to determine bacterial infections, and (1-3)-β-D-glucan and galactomannan et al. can be used as a determination of fungal infections. We have also focused on the use of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in infections in patients with hematologic cancers, which has excellent clinical value in infection prediction and can detect microorganisms that cannot be detected by conventional testing methods such as blood cultures. Of course, we also focused on infection biomarkers that are not yet used in blood cancer patients but could be used as a future research direction, e.g., human neutrophil lipocalin, serum amyloid A, and heparin-binding protein et al. Finally, clinicians need to combine multiple infection biomarkers, the patient’s clinical condition, local susceptibility to the type of infection, and many other factors to make a determination of the type of infection.

## Atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis: a new challenge to VL elimination in South-East Asia

date: 2024-11-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by L. donovani in South-East Asian endemic countries including India, Nepal and Bangladesh has been the primary focus of the ongoing VL elimination program. With a major reduction in VL cases resulting from the elimination program during the last two decades, the efforts are now focused on the challenges posed by potential reservoirs within the asymptomatic cases, HIV-co-infection VL cases and Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) cases that continue to sustain the parasite transmission cycle in known and newer endemic zones. This article brings attention to a new potential parasite reservoir in the form of atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) cases caused by novel L. donovani genetic variants. L. donovani mediated ACL is an emerging phenomenon in recent endemic sites that now justify a need for implementing molecular surveillance tools to identify region-specific L. donovani variants with dermotropic capabilities and potential to revert to visceral disease. A timely detection of novel ACL causing L. donovani genetic lineages in South-East Asian endemic regions is necessary to halt the spread of ACL and is potentially crucial for the sustainability of the advances made by the VL elimination.

## Quadrivalent HPV (4vHPV) vaccine immunogenicity and safety in women using immunosuppressive drugs due to solid organ transplant

date: 2024-11-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionImmunocompromised persons are at high risk of persistent Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection and associated diseases. Few studies evaluated HPV vaccines in immunocompromised persons. This study aimed to evaluate the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) immunogenicity and safety in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients, in comparison to immunocompetent women (IC).MethodsOpen-label clinical trial that enrolled SOT recipients and immunocompetent women aged 18 to 45 years. All participants received three doses of 4vHPV vaccine. Blood samples were drawn for evaluation of immune responses at baseline and one month after the third vaccination. Seroconversion rates and antibody geometric mean concentration (GMC) against HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 35, 52 and 58 were measured with in-house multiplexed serology assay (xMAP technology). Follow-up for the local and systemic adverse events (AEs) continued for seven days after each vaccination. Severe AEs were evaluated throughout the study.Results125 SOT and 132 immunocompetent women were enrolled; 105 (84%) SOT and 119 (90%) immunocompetent women completed the study. At baseline, HPV seropositivity was not significantly different between groups. Seroconversion rates were significantly lower in SOT (HPV18, 57%; HPV6 and 16, 69%; and HPV11, 72%) than in immunocompetent women (100% seroconversion to all vaccine types) (p<0.001). Antibody GMCs of all four HPV vaccine types were also significantly lower in SOT (p<0.001). Pain in the injection site and headache were the most frequent adverse event in both groups. Local pain was more frequent in immunocompetent women than in SOT recipients. Rates of other AEs were comparable in both groups.Conclusion4vHPV vaccine was well-tolerated by SOT recipients. We found strong evidence of lower humoral immune responses to 4vHPV vaccine in SOT compared to immunocompetent women, which strengthen recommendation of routine cervical cancer screening in SOT recipients regardless of HPV vaccination status.

## Insights into the role of Streptococcus oralis as an opportunistic pathogen in infectious diseases

date: 2024-11-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Streptococcus oralis, belonging to the viridans group streptococci (VGS), has been considered a member of normal flora mainly inhabiting the oral cavity. However, more recently, there has been growing recognition of its role as a causative agent in various life-threatening infectious diseases such as infective endocarditis (IE) and meningitis. Additionally, the differences in the prevalence, clinical features, and prognosis of opportunistic infections between S. oralis and other VGS species have been addressed. Particularly the predominance of S. oralis in IE has drawn critical attention. In potentially fatal infections, clinical neglect of S. oralis as an instigating agent might significantly impede early diagnosis and treatment. Nevertheless, to date, the infectious diseases associated with S. oralis have not yet been comprehensively described. Therefore, this review will give an overview of infectious diseases caused by S. oralis to uncover its hidden role as an opportunistic pathogen.

## Development and validation of a model for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with sepsis-associated kidney injury receiving renal replacement therapy: a retrospective cohort study based on the MIMIC-IV database

date: 2024-11-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSAKI is a common and serious complication of sepsis, contributing significantly to high morbidity and mortality, especially in patients requiring RRT. Early identification of high-risk patients enables timely interventions and improvement in clinical outcomes. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a predictive model for in-hospital mortality in patients with SAKI receiving RRT.MethodsPatients with SAKI receiving RRT from the MIMIC-IV database were retrospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to either the training cohort or the testing cohort in a 7:3 ratio. LASSO regression and Boruta algorithm were utilized for feature selection. Subsequently, three machine learning models—CART, SVM and LR—were constructed, and their predictive efficacy was assessed using a comprehensive set of performance indicators. Feature importance analysis was performed to determine the contribution of each feature to a model’s predictions. Finally, DCA was employed to evaluate the clinical utility of the prediction models. Additionally, a clinical nomogram was developed to facilitate the interpretation and visualization of the LR model.ResultsA total of 1663 adults were ultimately enrolled and randomly allocated into the training cohort (n = 1164) or the testing cohort (n = 499). Twenty-eight variables were evaluated for feature selection, with eight ultimately retained in the final model: age, MAP, RR, lactate, Cr, PT-INR, TBIL and CVP. The LR model demonstrated commendable performance, exhibiting robust discrimination in both the training cohort (AUROC: 0.73 (95% CI 0.70–0.76); AUPRC: 0.75 (95% CI 0.72–0.79); accuracy: 0.66 (95% CI 0.63–0.68)) and the testing cohort (AUROC: 0.72 (95% CI 0.68-0.76); AUPRC: 0.73 (95% CI 0.67–0.79); accuracy: 0.65 (95% CI 0.61–0.69)). Furthermore, there was good concordance between predicted and observed values in both the training cohort (χ2 = 4.41, p = 0.82) and the testing cohort (χ2 = 4.16, p = 0.84). The results of the DCA revealed that the LR model provided a greater net benefit compared to other prediction models.ConclusionsThe LR model exhibited superior performance in predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with SAKI receiving RRT, suggesting its potential utility in identifying high-risk patients and guiding clinical decision-making.

## Critical and diverse role of alarmin cytokines in parasitic infections

date: 2024-11-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Alarmin cytokines including IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) function as danger signals to trigger host immunity in response to tissue injury caused by pathogenic factors such as parasitic infections. Parasitic diseases also provide an excellent context to study their functions and mechanisms. Numerous studies have indicated that alarmin cytokine released by non-immune cells such as epithelial and stromal cells induce the hosts to initiate a type 2 immunity that drives parasite expulsion but also host pathology such as tissue injury and fibrosis. By contrast, alarmin cytokines especially IL-33 derived from immune cells such as dendritic cells may elicit an immuno-suppressive milieu that promotes host tolerance to parasites. Additionally, the role of alarmin cytokines in parasite infections is reported to depend on species of parasites, cellular source of alarmin cytokines, and immune microenvironment, all of which is relevant to the parasitic sites or organs. This narrative review aims to provide information on the crucial and diverse role of alarmin cytokines in parasitic infections involved in different organs including intestine, lung, liver and brain.
