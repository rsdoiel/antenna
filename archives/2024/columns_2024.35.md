## Can Crypto, China cause Dollardrums?

date: 2024-08-27, from: Om Malik blog

Link:&#160;The Changing Role of the&#160;U.S.&#160;Dollar / Brookings&#160; TLDR: Whether&#160;it’s&#160;sanctions overuse,&#160;U.S.&#160;political&#160;dysfunction or&#160;crypto-led fintech innovations,&#160;the&#160;dollar can’t take its preeminence for granted anymore. Key Points: My Thoughts: More than military dominance, the&#160;U.S.&#160;dollar&#160;has been&#160;the key instrument for America’s global dominance.&#160;It remains so,&#160;but it&#160;will&#160;increasingly come under pressure due to digitization and disaggregation of money.&#160;This&#160;is very much&#160;a&#160;continuation of the “routing around &#8230;

I don't want to give Trump any ideas, but he's complaining that Harris is forcing him to run as an incumbent, so he might as well take credit for all the things Biden did.

Then, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/185200/kamala-wins-inside-clever-strategy-causing-trump-unravel">Greg Sargent's podcast</a> gave me an idea. The oppressor in a fascist state doesn't need you to love them, so long as you don't love anyone else. The NYT isn't trying to make us love Trump, that's impossible. But they are trying to make us not fall in love with Harris. I doubt they foresaw that possibility. But our feelings about Harris are very much love. The NYT is our only master, they must think. There's no room for us to love someone else, because we might listen to them. In a sense they respond like a first born child on the arrival of their little sister or brother. I don't know. As I said it doesn't matter why. That's their problem. Our problem is to get them out of the way.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-08-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

The NYT et al aren't even doing a fair job of covering the election as a horserace, because they're making sure it's a virtual tie, so even if our team has overwhelming power, speed and depth, and gets on base in every at bat and plays by the rules, our odds are no better than the other team.

## The status of Twitter's API

date: 2024-08-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>The Twitter API still works, with some serious limits. Not easily incorporated into products, but useful for individuals with developer accounts. Not an insurmountable hurdle, it seems, though I was a developer from before. A few bullet points.</p>
<ul>
<li>My linkblog now reliably works on <a href="https://x.com/davewiner">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew">Threads</a>, in addition to <a href="https://social.masto.land/@dave">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>, <a href="http://data.feedland.org/feeds/davewiner.xml">RSS</a> and <a href="https://linkblog3.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>.   </li>
<li>I was confused about the status of the Twitter API, but it turns out it's still there, and there is a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-api-v2">package</a> that connects to it for Node apps. </li>
<li>It took me a few hours to add <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/textcasting.js#L543">support for Twitter</a> in my <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/tree/main">textcasting</a> server app which is how my software connects to all the various services. </li>
<li>I should probably add a plugin abilitiy for textcasting so that other services could easily be added, without modifying the core app. Totally doable. It's already factored that way internally.</li>
<li>I should probably write <a href="https://github.com/scripting/textcasting/blob/main/README.md">some docs</a> for it too. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></li>
<li>Anyway, the <a href="https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api">deal with Twitter</a> is that it's free for up to 1500 posts per month, as I read it, which seems manageable for one person (me), but no way is it enough for a community of users. </li>
<li>Why connect to Twitter? People are there. Until they aren't we're going to need a way to push stuff to Twitter.</li>
</ul>

## A tunnel in time

The last time I did any work on this code, or even in this area of computer science, was approx 1990. It comes right back, like riding a bike. I saw a tremendous amount of potential fun here, but I had to move on to runtime, object database, verbs, user interface -- for Frontier. In the 34 years between then and now -- a lot of software has been written, and I'm only looking at a fraction of it, limited to stuff that runs in Node, the browser and Electron. And I have to say I'm totally enjoying reading about what they've done. I'm learning about evolution of technology, a facet of development I am extremely drawn to, in a whole new way, as if viewed through a tunnel in time. </p>

## US Federal Court Rules Against Geofence Warrants

date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>This is a big deal. A US Appeals Court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/13/us-appeals-court-rules-geofence-warrants-are-unconstitutional/">ruled</a> that geofence warrants&#8212;these are general warrants demanding information about all people within a geographical boundary&#8212;are unconstitutional.</p>

## 2024-08-25 GoToSocial problems

date: 2024-08-26, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-25-gotosocial-problems">2024-08-25 GoToSocial problems</h1>

<p>So you&rsquo;re considering self-hosting? You heard good things about <a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial">GoToSocial</a>? I like it. I use it. This post is about the problems you should be expecting at the moment.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising, after all. This is a very prominent sentence in their README:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GoToSocial is still ALPHA SOFTWARE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what are the exact problems? Sometimes alpha software is good enough, right?</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Social_Media">#Social Media</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23GoToSocial">#GoToSocial</a></p>

<h2 id="major-annoyances">Major annoyances</h2>

<p><strong>No post editing</strong>. I hope you can handle your own typos. All you have is &ldquo;Delete and Redraft&rdquo;. But that orphans all replies, undoes all boosts, forgets all likes and removes posts from bookmarks. &ldquo;Delete and Redraft&rdquo; is a sledge hammer. &ldquo;Edit post&rdquo; is a delicate quill. And you don&rsquo;t get to have it. YOLO! (You only live once.)</p>

<p><strong>No filtering</strong>. You can mute and block and all that, but when everybody is posting about Monsterdon, the European Song Contest, the US elections, Caturday or Wordle, you can&rsquo;t filter those hashtags. You must endure the enthusiasm of the people you are following. (I think the developers are implementing things, but it does not seem to have an effect in the front-ends I use, so who knows.)</p>

<p><strong>Limited federation</strong>. This one is hard to spot. You want to follow this account and that account and it all seems to work until you go back and find that for one account, your follow request seems to hang in limbo, waiting. You cancel, and follow again. It seems to work. Come back later, back in limbo again, waiting. If you check the log, you&rsquo;ll find errors about signatures failing and what not. I have no idea. There are currently <a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+signature">8 open issues containing the word &lsquo;signature&rsquo;</a>. Something is not working and you&rsquo;ll have to have an alt (a separate account) on a different server that doesn&rsquo;t have this issue. That makes me sad. 😥</p>

<h2 id="minor-annoyances">Minor annoyances</h2>

<p><strong>No automatic post expiry</strong>. You&rsquo;ll have to use something like <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/mastodon-archive.git/">Mastodon Archive</a>.</p>

<h2 id="no-problem">No problem</h2>

<p><strong>No front-end</strong>. There is no front-end. I use apps like <a href="https://mastodon.social/@tootapp">Toot!</a> on my phone and <a href="https://semaphore.social/">Semaphore</a> on the web. I don&rsquo;t need anything fancy. And for the non-fancy options, I have <a href="https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el">mastodon.el</a> for Emacs, <a href="https://github.com/ihabunek/toot">toot</a> for the command-line, <a href="https://tuba.geopjr.dev/">tuba</a> for Gnome, <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/bitlbee-mastodon.git/">bitlbee-mastodon</a> for IRC, and so on. There are plenty of options.</p>

<h2 id="the-good-stuff">The good stuff</h2>

<p><strong>Markdown</strong> in your posts. I like my code blocks.</p>

<p><strong>SQLite</strong> on the server. It&rsquo;s currently 8.4G. The media stuff is 11G.</p>

<p><strong>Memory footprint</strong>. I use Monit to monitor processes and this process uses 185.6 MB.</p>

<p><strong>No admin</strong>. I haven&rsquo;t had to run any administration task. Not once. ❤️</p>

The problem with the state-by-state abortion laws that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/08/politics/donald-trump-abortion-2024/index.html">Trump says</a> he favors: 1. The women in states that ban abortion who will die as a result of the bans, and many more who will be severely injured, and all will have their freedoms severely restricted. 2. He's lying.

So many people have worked on curbing climate change. What have we got to show for it? For starters: The projected warning has decreased by 0.9C.
