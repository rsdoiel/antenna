Reading Puloma Ghosh‚Äôs debut collection, <strong>Mouth</strong>, brought
me back to the pandemic and the months spent in lockdown. To be clear,
not one of the eleven stories in the book takes place during or refers
to COVID, but isolation and loneliness are so central to Ghosh‚Äôs work,
her protagonist‚Äôs aching for intimacy, that my thoughts were cast

Beetlejuice: Sequel Magic or Missed Opportunity? A Movie Review by Erin

Tim Burton returns to direct <strong>Beetlejuice 2</strong> (2024), also
known as <strong>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</strong>, in this wickedly wild
sequel that takes on the 1988 classic, starring Michael Keaton, Winona
Ryder, and Jenna Ortega. Since so many remakes and sequels this year
have fallen flat, despite media buzz and excitement, it was easy to be
skeptical about this film. Could it live up to the original? With Tim
Burton, most of

characters talking more business and making morally questionable
decisions that create palpable drama, hooking the audience.

‚ÄúI think what Tim [Burton] does is he‚Äôs always trying to simplify.
That‚Äôs the essence of a classic filmmaker. People think he‚Äôs wild and
crazy and does all these things. His movies are brilliantly composed
frames and he‚Äôs always looking for simplicity. All of his big movies,
they‚Äôre really family dramas dressed up in whatever genre he‚Äôs in.
That‚Äôs really what they are. And I think people think he‚Äôs always
strange and weird and likes dark things, but no! It‚Äôs a classic story
with good drama. And then he brings his sensibility to it,‚Äù says about
the biggest lesson Al Gough has learned working with director Tim Burton
on both the TV show <em>Wednesday</em> and the new film <em>Beetlejuice
Beetlejuice</em>.

There‚Äôs a common piece of advice for writers, and that‚Äôs to always be
writing. Showrunner Joe Henderson (<em>Lucifer</em>) got a jump start on
those words of wisdom as he was already writing stories in second grade,
never knowing where those stories, and that creativity, would take him.
Henderson recalls:<br><br><em>‚ÄúI was reading Dungeons and Dragons books
and would write stories that either took place in that world or extended
it out. I moved on to Star Wars novels and would write my versions of
that. I was just always writing.‚Äù</em>
