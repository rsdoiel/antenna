<p>date: 2024-03-04, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p><em>This post was updated March 3 at 10:55 p.m. </em> LOS ANGELES –
Coach John Savage dubbed his team’s recent stretch of the schedule as
“hell week” – five games in six days, all against different opponents. 
After rain resulted in the cancelation of Saturday’s contest against San
Diego, UCLA had the chance to take “Blue Heaven on Earth” by storm and
finish the week 3-1.  Instead, “hell week” reached its conclusion as the
Bruins familiarized themself with “Blue Hell on Earth.”   Unable to
recover from UC Irvine outfielder Caden Kendle’s seventh-inning grand
slam, UCLA baseball (5-5) fell 5-2 to UC Irvine (9-0) at Dodger Stadium
on Sunday in the Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic finale.</p>
