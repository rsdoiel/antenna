## The Great When by Alan Moore: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

<p><strong>The Great When</strong>, Alan Moore (Bloomsbury 978-1-63557-884-3, $29.99, 336pp, hc) October 2024.</p>
<p>By now there are so many mystical-magical ‘‘hidden London’’ novels that it’s getting hard to keep up – though admittedly there’s something delicious about the notion that in any great city, you’re only being shown what they want you to see, with the real city available only at certain access points for certain chosen adventurers.

<p>Characters are essential to storytelling. They drive conflict, provide a point of view for the story, and become the audience’s reason to stay rooted in the experience. But what kind of character are you writing to motivate your story?</p>

## Write On: Seth Sherwood Horror Masterclass

date: 2024-10-24, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-seth-sherwood-horror-masterclass" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Write%20On%20Seth%20Sherwood%20Horror%20Masterclass.jpg" alt="Write On Podcast logo with Seth Sherwood featured" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<div>
  “Comedy and scares are so similar. I’ve found that in a lot of my scripts, it’s almost like you’re taking the peaks and valleys of humor, and the peaks and valleys of scares, and flipping them on each other. So, you have the scare that you come down from for a moment of brevity and humor, or just character work, and then you do another scare. You’ve relaxed them and then scare them again. The effect is that you’re making the audience have a good time,” says Seth Sherwood, author of 
 <em>The Scary Movie Writer’s Guide</em>. 
 <br> 
 <br>In this episode, we speak with Seth Sherwood, writer of horror movies like 
 <em>Leatherface</em> and 
 <em>Hell Fest</em>. He was also nominated for an Emmy for writing the TV show 
 <em>Light as a Feather</em>. I chat with him about the long process of making 
 <em>Hell Fest</em> with producer Gale Ann Hurd, the difference between internal and external horror and his definition of grounded horror that’s so popular these days. He also gives his advice on what he thinks is the single best thing an emerging horror writer can do to help their career.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>“Right now, the industry is in a retraction, there’s an implosion and streaming is dying. When people ask me now how to break in, I say I don’t know, but I think you’ll never go wrong in actually trying to make stuff like short films. I know it’s a whole other path and it’s a difficult thing to do but people will always watch stuff before they read stuff if they’re not writers. And those people are the gatekeepers. I always wanted to make my own films, but my writing career took off and I’m actually in a spot where I’m going backwards, where I have done so many writing assignments in the last few years but things aren’t getting made – so, I’m going to go make a microbudget horror film on my own with my friends. The thing that I wanted to do when I was 20 years old. Because at least it’s a thing that can be seen. And that has more weight than a script right now,” he says.&nbsp; 
 <br> 
 <br>To hear more about horror writing from Sherwood’s perspective, listen to the podcast.

## Dakini Atoll by Nikhil Singh: Review by Nedine Moonsamy

<p><strong>Dakini Atoll</strong>, Nikhil Singh (Luna Press Publishing 978-1-91555-634-9, £22.99, 252pp, hc) June 2024. Cover by Elena Romenkova.</p>
<p>Nikhil Singh has carved out a niche within African SF by bringing the full range of his artistic talents into play in his worldbuild­ing. The dystopian underworlds explored in his earlier works create the unique effect of falling into a sensorial swamp, an enticing feature that is only enhanced in Singh’s third  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/dakini-atoll-by-nikhil-singh-review-by-nedine-moonsamy/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Repeat Room by Jesse Ball: Review by Jake Casella Brookins

date: 2024-10-23, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Repeat Room</strong>, Jesse Ball (Catapult 978-1-64622-140-0, 256pp, $27.00, hc) Cover by Sara Wood. September 2024.</p>
<p>We have such a cornucopia of dystopias right now, fictional and otherwise, that they’ve really got to do something different to catch my attention. <strong>The Repeat Room</strong>, the latest novel from the prolific Jesse Ball, captured it thoroughly: haunting, spare, and inventive, it’s a bleak tale that’s nonetheless rich with sparkling turns  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/the-repeat-room-by-jesse-ball-review-by-jake-casella-brookins/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## New Star Rating Control

date: 2024-10-22, from: IF Database News

<p>There's a new star rating control, designed for accessibility. We'd love to get your feedback on it <a href="https://intfiction.org/t/ifdb-has-a-new-star-rating-control/71812">on the intfiction.org forum</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The new star controls are designed to be bigger, easier to tap on on touchscreens.</li>
<li>Theyre also designed to be keyboard accessible. You can use tab to focus on the star control, and then use arrow keys to select a rating. (When you do this, you have to tab over to the new Submit Rating button to submit your selection.)</li>
<li>Under the hood, theyre secretly radio buttons, so users of screen readers will interact with them like radio buttons.</li>
<li>Weve replaced the little star icons with new SVG icons. I think theyre nicer to look at, especially on high-resolution screens (like phones).</li>

## The Mercy of God by James S.A. Corey: Review by Russell Letson

date: 2024-10-20, from: Locus Magazine
