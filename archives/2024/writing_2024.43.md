## New Star Rating Control

date: 2024-10-22, from: IF Database News

<p>There's a new star rating control, designed for accessibility. We'd love to get your feedback on it <a href="https://intfiction.org/t/ifdb-has-a-new-star-rating-control/71812">on the intfiction.org forum</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The new star controls are designed to be bigger, easier to tap on on touchscreens.</li>
<li>Theyre also designed to be keyboard accessible. You can use tab to focus on the star control, and then use arrow keys to select a rating. (When you do this, you have to tab over to the new Submit Rating button to submit your selection.)</li>
<li>Under the hood, theyre secretly radio buttons, so users of screen readers will interact with them like radio buttons.</li>
<li>Weve replaced the little star icons with new SVG icons. I think theyre nicer to look at, especially on high-resolution screens (like phones).</li>
</ul>

## The Mercy of God by James S.A. Corey: Review by Russell Letson

date: 2024-10-20, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Mercy of Gods</strong>, James S.A. Corey (Orbit 978-0-31652-557-2, $30.00, 423 pp, hc) August 2024.</p>
<p>The longer I review science fiction, the more I notice how it much it depends on recycling tropes – not just repeating but extending and varying and inverting them – and, I suspect, refitting them to reflect current anxieties or hopes, conscious or not. This time the recognition lights have been set flashing by  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/10/the-mercy-of-god-by-james-s-a-corey-review-by-russell-letson/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
