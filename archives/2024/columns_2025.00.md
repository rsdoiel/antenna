## Why are hobbyist 21st century 8-bit computers so constrained?

date: 2024-12-31, from: Liam on Linux

I learned about a new DIY machine to me, the <a href="https://www.codycomputer.org/">Cody Computer</a>.&nbsp;<br /><div role="heading" aria-level="3" class="comment_text"><p>It looks kind of fun, but once again, it does make me wonder  why it&rsquo;s so constrained. Extremely low-res graphics, for instance. TBH I  would have sneered at this for being low-end when I was about 13 years  old. (Shortly before I got my first computer, a 48K ZX Spectrum.)</p> <p>Why isn&rsquo;t anyone trying to make an easy home-build high-end  eight-bit? Something that really pushes the envelope right out there &ndash;  the sort of dream machine I wanted by about the middle of the 1980s.</p> <p>In 1987 I owned an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PCW#PCW_9512_and_9256" rel="ugc">Amstrad PCW9512</a>:</p> <ul> <li>4MHz Z80A</li> <li>512 kB RAM, so 64kB CP/M 3 TPA plus something over 400kB RAMdisc as drive M:</li> <li>720 x 256 monochrome screen resolution, 90 x 30 characters in text mode</li> </ul> <p>Later&nbsp;in 1989 I bought an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_Coup%C3%A9" rel="ugc">MGT SAM Coup&eacute;</a>:</p> <ul> <li>6MHz Z80B</li> <li>256 kB RAM</li> <li>256 x 192 or 512 x 192 graphics, with 1/2/4 bits per pixel</li> </ul> <p>Both had graphics easily outdone by the MSX 2 and later Z80 machines,  but those had a dedicated GPU. That might be a reach but then given the  limits of a 64 kB memory map, maybe a good one.</p> <p>Another aspirational machine was the BBC Micro: a expandable, modular  OS called MOS; an excellent BASIC, BBC BASIC, with structured flow,  named procedures, with local variables, enabling recursive programming,  and inline assembly language so if you graduated to machine-code you  could just enter and edit it in the BASIC line editor. (Which was weird,  but powerful &ndash; for instance, 2 independent cursors, one source and one  destination, eliminating the whole &ldquo;clipboard&rdquo; concept.)  Resolution-independent graphics, and graphics modes that cheerfully used  most of the RAM, leaving exploitation as an exercise for the developer.  Which they rose to magnificently.</p> <p>The BBC Micro supported <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro_expansion_unit" rel="ugc">dual processors</a> over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tube_(BBC_Micro)" rel="ugc">Tube interface</a>, so one 6502 could run the OS, the DOS, and the framebuffer, using most of its 64 kB, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_BASIC#BBC_Micro" rel="ugc">Hi-BASIC</a> could run on the 2nd 6502 (or Z80!) processor, therefore having most of 64 kB to itself.</p> <p>In a 21st century 8-bit, I want something that comfortably exceeds a 1980s 8-bit, let alone a 1990s 8-bit.</p> <p>(And yes, there were new 8-bit machines in the 1990s, such as the <a href="https://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Plus" rel="ugc">Amstrad CPC Plus range</a>, or <a href="https://www.msx.org/wiki/MSX_turbo_R" rel="ugc">MSX Turbo R</a>.)</p> <p>So my wish list would include&hellip;</p> <ul> <li><em>At least</em> 80-column legible text, ideally more. We can forget  analog TVs and CRT limitations now. Aim to exceed VGA resolutions. 256  colours in some low resolutions but a high mono resolution is handy too.</li> <li>Lots of RAM with some bank-switching mechanism, plus mechanisms to  make this useful to BASIC programmers not just machine code developers. A  RAMdisc is easy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_BASIC" rel="ugc">Beta BASIC</a>  on the ZX Spectrum 128 lets BASIC declare arrays kept in the RAMdisc,  so while a BASIC program is limited to under 30 kB of RAM, it can  manipulate 100-odd kB of data in arrays. That&rsquo;s a simple, clever hack.</li> <li>A really world-class BASIC with structured programming support.</li> <li>A fast processor (double-digit megahertz doesn&rsquo;t seem too much to ask).</li> <li>Some provision for 3rd party OSes. There are some impressive ones out there now, such as <a href="http://www.symbos.de/" rel="ugc">SymbOS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki" rel="ugc">Contiki</a>, and <a href="https://www.fuzix.org/" rel="ugc">Fuzix</a>. GEOS is open source now, too.</li> </ul></div><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=93665" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## The Enlightened Economist Prize for 2024

date: 2024-12-31, from: Enlightenment Economics blog

This decision &#8211; again, entirely arbitrary and my own &#8211; was harder than ever this year because I left the long/shortlisting so late I had little time to mull it over.

## Gift Card Fraud

date: 2024-12-31, updated: 2024-12-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>It&#8217;s becoming an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chinese-organized-crime-gift-cards-american-retail">organized crime tactic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Card draining is when criminals remove gift cards from a store display, open them in a separate location, and either record the card numbers and PINs or replace them with a new barcode. The crooks then repair the packaging, return to a store and place the cards back on a rack. When a customer unwittingly selects and loads money onto a tampered card, the criminal is able to access the card online and steal the balance.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>In card draining, the runners assist with removing, tampering and restocking of gift cards, according to court documents and investigators...</p></blockquote>

## The mindset of more (series introduction)

date: 2024-12-31, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

I&#8217;ve been playing the game Satisfactory with my sister for about the past year. Neither of us have played games much, and that mostly pre-2000. It&#8217;s been slow going as we learn what tools are available to us, how to interact with the world, and what goals we&#8217;re meant to pursue. But another thing we&#8217;re [&#8230;]

## The Real Intention Economy

date: 2024-12-30, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

As a noun phrase, &#8220;The intention economy&#8221; first appeared in a Linux Journal column by that title, written by me in March 2006. A few months later, when I became a fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Berkman Klein Center, I started ProjectVRM for the purpose of making that economy happen. Six years after that, I wrote this book, [&#8230;]

## Twenty Twenty-Four

date: 2024-12-30, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>For <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/01/twenty-twenty-three/">last year’s check-in</a>, I foreshadowed a year of changes for ol’ Dave Rupert and boy was I not kidding. New job, new car, new pets. But before we get into all that – for accountability’s sake – let’s check in on my resolutions from last year and see how I did…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activate an active lifestyle</strong> - Nope.</li>
<li><strong>Write more shitty sci-fi</strong> - Nope.</li>
<li><strong>Draw more</strong> - Nope.</li>
<li><strong>Write for other publications</strong> - Yes, I wrote for <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/">Frontend Masters’ Boost blog</a> and <a href="https://multipa.ge/">Wilto’s Multipage Version</a>  zine.</li>
<li><strong>Survive the 2024 US Election</strong> - Yes, but what a disappointment.</li>
<li><strong>Make a video game?</strong> - Yes, <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/12/my-little-games-workshop/">I made and released a few</a> but also went beyond video games a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final score: 50%-ish. That’s better than I expected. What did I do with the other 50% of my time if I wasn’t crushing it on my SMART goals? Let’s see…</p>
<h2>A month-by-month recap</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jan-April</strong> - Unemployed, interviewing for jobs 👎</li>
<li><strong>April</strong> - Saw the solar eclipse 👍</li>
<li><strong>May</strong> - Went to South Dakota for my nephew’s graduation 👍</li>
<li><strong>May</strong> - Started my new job at Microsoft 👍</li>
<li><strong>July</strong> - Went to San Diego - first week 👍, second week whole family got sick 👎</li>
<li><strong>Aug</strong> - Adopted two dogs 👍, they are a handful and I’m allergic 👎</li>
<li><strong>Aug</strong> - <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/08/vibe-check-34/">Frostapalooza</a> 👍</li>
<li><strong>Sept</strong> - Wife had knee surgery 👎</li>
<li><strong>Oct</strong> - Deleted my Twitter account 👍</li>
<li><strong>Nov</strong> - Went to Redmond and met my coworkers IRL for the first time 👍</li>
<li><strong>Nov</strong> - Bought a new car 👍</li>
<li><strong>Nov</strong> - <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/11/goodbye-moogs/">Moogs passed away</a> 👎</li>
<li><strong>Nov</strong> - <a href="https://daverupert.com/2024/12/adhd/">Diagnosed with ADHD</a> 👌</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding a job dominated the first half of my year. After some ups and downs I ended up in a good place at Microsoft. There’s a lot of positives going from self-employment to the corporate world (hey! actual benefits! stocks even!) but also a lot of organizational bureaucracy that I’m not used to navigating. I’m happy with the work I’m doing and feel lucky to get to work on web components each day.</p>
<p>My wife and I’s trip to Pittsburgh for Frostapalooza was a big crescendo for the year. Months and months of practicing culminating in one big night. It’s hard to describe it other than some kind of nerd-flavored camp reunion but with guitars instead of computers. We had such a good time and the amount of music filling our house on a daily basis has increased ten-fold this year. For that I’m thankful.</p>
<p>I often judge years based on if we hit our health insurance deductible and we hit it again this year. A lot of medium grade background stress: job hunt stress, new job stress, healthcare stress, election stress, etc. Thankfully – and I could be basking in the limelight of a good Christmas holiday and a week off from work – I hardly remember that stress anymore. It feels like I’ve shedded those layers of anxiety.</p>
<h2>Stats for 2024</h2>
<p>With all the qualitative out of the way, let’s get more quantitative about what we did this year…</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/">52 books</a> - Still in the book-a-week club. I’m comfortable here but need to mix it up. I’m becoming cynical when I hear the same ten facts and sociological studies regurgitated to meet some new popular science zeitgeist. Political biographies are all the same five liberal or conservative party tent poles supported by some personal anecdote. I think I’m going to lean hard into sci-fi “snacks” – short, easy books – for the next year while supplementing with beefier book recommendations from trusted peers.</li>
<li><a href="https://daverupert.com/archive/">61 blog posts</a> - Not a record but I’m happy with that number. Over a post a week is a good pace for me, doubly so if you consider that I fell off a blogging cliff since going corporate.</li>
<li>9 gunpla - Way down from my 2023 peak.</li>
<li>3 releases - <a href="https://mundango.daverupert.com/">Mundango</a>, <a href="https://pentablaster.daverupert.com/">Pentablaster</a>, and <a href="https://hardcodesoftskills.daverupert.com/">Hard Code &amp; Soft Skills</a>. My previous record was one, so this is stellar.</li>
<li><a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">49 episodes of ShopTalk</a> - I love hanging out with <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">my friend Chris</a>.</li>
<li>3 guest appearances - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azUEOy8_GHo">Bad @ CSS</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hXmRkM7dsQ">Smashing Hour</a>, and <a href="https://changelog.com/friends/72">Changelog &amp; Friends</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A pretty good year for me and it’d be great to maintain that pace next year. To be totally honest, my actual goal would be to do less next year. Sounds crazy, I know, numbers should only go up and to the right. But hear me out… what if they didn’t? Have we considered that option?</p>
<p>I didn’t play video games as much as I would have liked to this year, so I’ll need to remedy that. I’ve got a backlog brewing but I’m having a good time <em>making</em> games and that’s a time tradeoff I’m okay with. But from a “great writers read” perspective, I should play more games. Related, I had to quit late night gaming with the boys because it effected my sleep and stress levels, but I want to get back to that. AAA gaming is in a rough state though.</p>
<h2>Hopes for 2025</h2>
<p>There’s five focus areas I’d like to pursue next year and I already have traction on most of these feel achievable, But I’ve been wrong about that in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Seize work opportunities -</strong> It’s been a great first 7 months at Microsoft but I have some big projects shipping in the next quarter so I need to shift out of my “learning the ropes” mode into a more melee combat ready position.</p>
<p><strong>Hunker down and be creative</strong> - I’m not excited about the state of the union right now, so I’m going to trust my instinct to burrow. I’ve got some apps, games, and shitty sci-fi ideas that I’d be happy to work on instead of doomscrolling the news. I feel okay about pursuing those ideas rather than getting mired in political headlines.</p>
<p><strong>Slow down to 1x mode</strong> - The ability to consume books, podcasts, and videos at 2x is a super power but I feel a nudge to take life slower. Slowing down would hopefully increase the time-cost and make me more discerning about what I choose to consume. The fact that I view listening at 1x as a challenge tells me I should probably pursue it.</p>
<p><strong>Join a club</strong> - Inspired by the documentary <a href="https://www.joinordiefilm.com/">Join or Die</a>, I think I need to join a club and participate in IRL more. Clubs give me an opportunity to burst my personal/internet bubble and meet people who don’t share my background, income, or political beliefs. But I can’t even think of what I’d want to do. Perhaps something hobby-related? Join a lodge? Volunteer at a food bank? I feel woefully unprepared that I don’t even have the beginning of an answer here.</p>
<p><strong>Understand myself</strong> - Beyond work and side projects, the biggest project I’ll be undertaking in 2025 is going to be… me. Since the Summer, I’ve been on a mission to understand myself at a clinical level.  Last year I lost a lot of weight, more than half of it has come back without much change in diet. I want to know what’s in this mountain of flesh and bones and brains that God gave me. I want to begin to untangle the Gordian Knot of Anxiety, Weight, and ADHD. This has meant seeing a new doctor, getting blood work done, seeing a therapist, evaluating medication, and a whole lot more. I even made it a “Project” in Notion so  I’d actually follow through on it. My ideal outcome is to come up with a plan to get through the next five, ten, fifteen, thirty years and beyond. In the immediate future an unexpected medical malady has presented itself and I’ll probably have to undergo surgery next year.</p>
<h2>We’ll take a cup of kindness yet, for auld lang syne</h2>
<p>I know some had an awful 2024. I’d say mine was hard but good over the long haul. 2025 seems primed to bring its own existential challenges and I hope you find shelter. Tech is still in shambles right now but I’m starting to see hints of the icy job market thawing, but I’m unsure if it will ever go back to “normal”. And politics… oof. We’re already seeing the outputs of the self-inflicted chaos machine. Keep in mind that chaos is the goal; chaos to exhaust and disarm us, to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation">flood the zone with shit</a>. So hold fast to your principles and conserve energy for the long haul. Keep your hand on the plow and keep your eyes on the prize. Hold on.</p>

I'm <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lej4s4kysc2u">playing</a> with using Bluesky as a very simple feed reader. 1. Running up against its lack of style and formatting. Very bare bones. Not sure if people will like.
2. What's the rate limit? My app is getting rate-limited with not very many posts. (According to their <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/rate-limits">docs</a> on rate limits, I don't think my project is anywhere near the limit. It's creating posts. I'll start counting them, I guess.)

## curl with partial files

Back in September 2023, we extended the curl command line tool with a new fairly advanced and flexible variable system. Using this, users can use files, environment variables and more in a powerful way when building curl command lines in ways not previously possible &#8211; with almost all existing command line options. curl command lines &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/12/30/curl-with-partial-files/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">curl with partial files</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## How about if Canada annexes Blue America? 

date: 2024-12-30, from: Robert Reich's blog

It&#8217;s a perfect way out for Trump, who doesn&#8217;t like these states anyway.

## The Kraken Won

date: 2024-12-30, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Imagine what would have happened had Martin Winterkorn not imploded, and if Volkswagen, under his watch, had not become a datakraken (data sea-monster, or octopus), spying on drivers and passengers—just like every other car company. What would the world now be like if Volkswagen since 2014 had established itself as the only car maker not [&#8230;]

## Panama Is Back in the News. That Can be a Good Thing.

The Panama Canal and its home country should be newly important to Americans. But in the opposite way from what Donald Trump has been talking about.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Here's a list of <a href="https://viewfeedlist.opml.org/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedland.social%2Fopml%3Fscreenname%3Ddavewiner%26catname%3Dblogroll">all the feeds in my blogroll</a>, with links to the XML version. I've wanted to have a nice non-XML way of viewing the feeds in an OPML subscription list. I took the time today to put one together. I had all the pieces, it was just a matter of putting them all in one place. You can use it if you want, if you want to show someone what feeds are in an OPML subscription list. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/29/screenshotopmllistviewer.png">Screen shot</a>.

OpenAI is to this decade’s generative-AI revolution what Netscape was to the 1990s’ internet revolution.

## What are they really seeking?

Trump, Musk, Sachs, and the other billionaires taking over in three weeks and one day want to do something quite different from what the previous generation of conservatives sought.

Three comments. 1. There are no masses. You can see this by looking at the stats for each tweet, available on most platforms. 2. Most users on the social web are trying to get attention for themselves, the only reason they read the posts is to see if there's a place for them to attach their message. 3. A simple tweak to the software would make it so that only the author of the post being responded to could see the replies. Then they could RT a reply if they thought everyone should see it. This would make the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> a lot more useful imho.

Today&#8217;s Observer column: If 2024 was the year of large language models (LLMs), then 2025 looks like the year of AI “agents”.
