induces aneuploidy-mediated tolerance in Candida albicans that is
dependent on Hsp90 and calcineurin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Antifungal resistance and antifungal tolerance are two distinct terms
that describe different cellular responses to drugs. Antifungal
resistance describes the ability of a fungus to grow above the minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a drug. Antifungal tolerance describes
the ability of drug susceptible strains to grow slowly at inhibitory
drug concentrations. Recent studies indicate antifungal resistance and
tolerance have distinct evolutionary trajectories. Superficial
candidiasis bothers millions of people yearly. Miconazole has been used
for topical treatment of yeast infections for over 40 years. Yet, fungal
resistance to miconazole remains relatively low. Here we found different
clinical isolates of Candida albicans had different profile of tolerance
to miconazole, and the tolerance was modulated by physiological factors
including temperature and medium composition. Exposure of non-tolerant
strains with different genetic backgrounds to miconazole mainly induced
development of tolerance, not resistance, and the tolerance was mainly
due to whole chromosomal or segmental amplification of chromosome R. The
efflux gene CDR1 was required for maintenance of tolerance in wild type
strains but not required for gain of aneuploidy-mediated tolerance. Heat
shock protein Hsp90 and calcineurin were essential for maintenance as
well as gain of tolerance. Our study indicates development of
aneuploidy-mediated tolerance, not resistance, is the predominant
mechanism of rapid adaptation to miconazole in C. albicans, and the
clinical relevance of tolerance deserves further investigations.</p>

of silver nanoparticles for H. pylori infection: modulation of CagA
function and signaling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori infection poses a significant health
burden worldwide, and its virulence factor CagA plays a pivotal role in
its pathogenesis.MethodsIn this study, the interaction between H.
pylori-infected AGS cells and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was
investigated, with a focus on the modulation of CagA-mediated responses,
investigated by western blotting. Both, the dose-dependent efficacy
against H. pylori (growth curves, CFU assay) and the impact of the
nanoparticles on AGS cells (MTT assay) were elucidated.ResultsAGS cells
infected with H. pylori displayed dramatic morphological changes,
characterized by elongation and a migratory phenotype, attributed to
CagA activity. Preincubation of H. pylori with AgNPs affected these
morphological changes in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting a
correlation between AgNPs concentration and CagA function.ConclusionOur
study highlights the nuanced interplay between host-pathogen
interactions and the therapeutic potential of AgNPs in combating H.
pylori infection and offers valuable insights into the multifaceted
dynamics of CagA mediated responses.</p>

analysis of intestinal microbiota composition between free-ranged
captive yak populations in Nimu County</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The intestinal microbiota assumes a pivotal role in modulating host
metabolism, immune responses, overall health, and additional
physiological dimensions. The structural and functional characteristics
of the intestinal microbiota may cause alterations within the host’s
body to a certain extent. The composition of the gut microbiota is
associated with environmental factors, dietary habits, and other
pertinent conditions. The investigation into the gut microbiota of yaks
remained relatively underexplored. An examination of yak gut microbiota
holds promise in elucidating the complex relationship between microbial
communities and the adaptive responses of the host to its environment.
In this study, yak were selected from two distinct environmental
conditions: those raised in sheds (NS, n=6) and grazed in Nimu County
(NF, n=6). Fecal samples were collected from the yaks and subsequently
processed for analysis through 16S rDNA and ITS sequencing
methodologies. The results revealed that different feeding styles result
in significant differences in the Alpha diversity of fungi in the gut of
yaks, while the gut microbiota of captive yaks was relatively conserved.
In addition, significant differences appeared in the abundance of
microorganisms in different taxa, phylum Verrucomicrobiota was
significantly enriched in group NF while Firmicutes was higher in group
NS. At the genus level, Akkermansia, Paenibacillus, Roseburia, Dorea,
UCG_012, Anaerovorax and Marvinbryantia were enriched in group NF while
Desemzia, Olsenella, Kocuria, Ornithinimicrobium and Parvibacter were
higher in group NS (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). There was a significant
difference in the function of gut microbiota between the two groups. The
observed variations are likely influenced by differences in feeding
methods and environmental conditions both inside and outside the pen.
The findings of this investigation offer prospective insights into
enhancing the yak breeding and expansion of the yak industry.</p>

of human microglia and resident T cells in the brain of humanized DRAGA
mice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Humanized mouse models are valuable tools for investigating the human
immune system in response to infection and injury. We have previously
described the human immune system (HIS)-DRAGA mice
(HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2RgKO.NOD) generated by infusion of Human
Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-matched, human hematopoietic stem cells from
umbilical cord blood. By reconstituting human cells, the HIS-DRAGA mouse
model has been utilized as a “surrogate in vivo human model” for
infectious diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
Influenza, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), scrub typhus, and
malaria. This humanized mouse model bypasses ethical concerns about the
use of fetal tissues for the humanization of laboratory animals. Here
in, we demonstrate the presence of human microglia and T cells in the
brain of HIS-DRAGA mice. Microglia are brain-resident macrophages that
play pivotal roles against pathogens and cerebral damage, whereas the
brain-resident T cells provide surveillance and defense against
infections. Our findings suggest that the HIS-DRAGA mouse model offers
unique advantages for studying the functions of human microglia and T
cells in the brain during infections, degenerative disorders, tumors,
and trauma, as well as for testing therapeutics in these pathological
conditions.</p>

and validation of a prediction model for mortality in critically ill
COVID-19 patients</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundEarly prediction of prognosis may help early treatment
measures to reduce mortality in critically ill coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) patients. The study aimed to develop a mortality prediction
model for critically ill COVID-19 patients.MethodsThis retrospective
study analyzed the clinical data of critically ill COVID-19 patients in
an intensive care unit between April and June 2022. Propensity matching
scores were used to reduce the effect of confounding factors. A
predictive model was built using logistic regression analysis and
visualized using a nomogram. Calibration and receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were used to estimate the accuracy and
predictive value of the model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to
examine the value of the model for clinical interventions.ResultsIn
total, 137 critically ill COVID-19 patients were enrolled; 84 survived,
and 53 died. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses
revealed that aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, and
myoglobin levels were independent prognostic factors. We constructed
logistic regression prediction models using the seven least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator regression-selected variables
(hematocrit, red blood cell distribution width-standard deviation,
procalcitonin, AST, creatinine, potassium, and myoglobin; Model 1) and
three independent factor variables (Model 2). The calibration curves
suggested that the actual predictions of the two models were similar to
the ideal predictions. The ROC curve indicated that both models had good
predictive power, and Model 1 had better predictive power than Model 2.
The DCA results suggested that the model intervention was beneficial to
patients and patients benefited more from Model 1 than from Model
2.ConclusionThe predictive model constructed using characteristic
variables screened using LASSO regression can accurately predict the
prognosis of critically ill COVID-19 patients. This model can assist
clinicians in implementing early interventions. External validation by
prospective large-sample studies is required.</p>

characteristics, viral dynamics, and antibody response of monkeypox
virus infections among men with and without HIV infection in Guangzhou,
China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMonkeypox virus (MPXV) is spreading globally and nearly
half of the infected people were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
positive. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the effects of HIV
infection on the outcomes of MPXV infection is urgently needed. This
study aimed to explore the clinical features, viral dynamics, and
antibody response to MPXV infections in men who had sex with men (MSM)
with and without HIV co-infection.Design or methodsMPXV-infected
patients diagnosed by PCR were recruited in this study and were divided
into MPXV and MPXV + HIV groups based on whether they were co-infected
with HIV. Clinical data and samples were collected during of the
hospital stay and follow up interviews. The symptoms and signs,
laboratory examinations, viral shedding in various body fluids or swabs,
antibody dynamics were tracked and compared between the two
groups.ResultsA total of 41 MPXV patients were recruited through June
2023 to September 2023 in Guangzhou. The MPXV group and MPXV + HIV group
comprised 20 and 21 MSM, respectively. Patients in the two groups
exhibited similar clinical characteristics except for pruritus and
eschar, both were significantly fewer in MPXV + HIV group than in MPXV
only group. Among the 355 clinical samples collected, MPXV DNA was
detected in 100% of scabs, 97.4% of skin swabs, and 92.3% of exudate
swabs from lesions, while the positive rate was 87.5% from oropharyngeal
swabs, 59% from saliva, 51.3% from anal swabs, 50% from feces, 30.6%
from urine samples, 37.5% of semen, and 28.2% from sera. Dynamics
analysis revealed that viral DNA was undetectable in most patients 20
days after symptom onset. IgM and IgG antibodies to MPXV were detected
in all patients with 3–5 days earlier in the MPXV group than in the MPXV
+ HIV group.ConclusionThis cohort analysis based on a large outbreak
among MSM in Guangzhou indicated no obvious differences in clinical
symptoms, viral DNA data, but antibody responses were 3–5 days later in
mpox patients with HIV infection.</p>

and mutational analysis of H10N3 avian influenza A virus in China:
potential threats to human health</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In recent years, the avian influenza virus has emerged as a
significant threat to both human and public health. This study focuses
on a patient infected with the H10N3 subtype of avian influenza virus,
admitted to the Third People’s Hospital of Kunming City on March 6,
2024. Metagenomic RNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
analysis were conducted on the patient’s sputum, confirming the H10N3
infection. The patient presented severe pneumonia symptoms such as
fever, expectoration, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough.
Phylogenetic analysis of the Haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)
genes of the virus showed that the virus was most closely related to a
case of human infection with the H10N3 subtype of avian influenza virus
found in Zhejiang Province, China. Analysis of amino acid mutation sites
identified four mutations potentially hazardous to human health.
Consequently, this underscores the importance of continuous and vigilant
monitoring of the dynamics surrounding the H10N3 subtype of avian
influenza virus, utilizing advanced genomic surveillance techniques.</p>

osmoregulated metabolism of trehalose contributes to production of type
1 fimbriae and bladder colonization by extraintestinal Escherichia coli
strain BEN2908</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In Escherichia coli, the disaccharide trehalose can be metabolized as
a carbon source or be accumulated as an osmoprotectant under osmotic
stress. In hypertonic environments, E. coli accumulates trehalose in the
cell by synthesis from glucose mediated by the cytosolic enzymes OtsA
and OtsB. Trehalose in the periplasm can be hydrolyzed into glucose by
the periplasmic trehalase TreA. We have previously shown that a treA
mutant of extraintestinal E. coli strain BEN2908 displayed increased
resistance to osmotic stress by 0.6 M urea, and reduced production of
type 1 fimbriae, reduced invasion of avian fibroblasts, and decreased
bladder colonization in a murine model of urinary tract infection. Since
loss of TreA likely results in higher periplasmic trehalose
concentrations, we wondered if deletion of otsA and otsB genes, which
would lead to decreased internal trehalose concentrations, would reduce
resistance to stress by 0.6 M urea and promote type 1 fimbriae
production. The BEN2908ΔotsBA mutant was sensitive to osmotic stress by
urea, but displayed an even more pronounced reduction in production of
type 1 fimbriae, with the consequent reduction in adhesion/invasion of
avian fibroblasts and reduced bladder colonization in the murine urinary
tract. The BEN2908ΔtreAotsBA mutant also showed a reduction in
production of type 1 fimbriae, but in contrast to the ΔotsBA mutant,
resisted better than the wild type in the presence of urea. We
hypothesize that, in BEN2908, resistance to stress by urea would depend
on the levels of periplasmic trehalose, but type 1 fimbriae production
would be influenced by the levels of cytosolic trehalose.</p>
