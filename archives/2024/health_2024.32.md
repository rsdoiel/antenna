## IL-17 in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in non-neutropenic patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis

date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of IL-17 detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma samples from nonneutropenic patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.MethodsWe retrospectively collected data on non-neutropenic patients who were suspected to have IPA admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between March 2020 to January 2023. IL-17 and GM were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.ResultsA total of 281 patients were enrolled in this study, of which 62 had proven or probable IPA and the remaining 219 patients were controls. The plasma and BALF IL-17 levels were significantly higher in the IPA group compared with the control group. The plasma GM, plasma IL17, BALF GM, and BALF IL17 assays had sensitivities of 56.5%, 72.6%, 68.7%, and 81.2%, respectively, and specificities of 87.7%, 69.4%, 91.9%, and 72.6%, respectively. The sensitivity of IL17 in plasma and BALF was higher than that of GM. Plasma GM in combination with IL-17 increases the sensitivity but does not decrease the diagnostic specificity of GM testing. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of BALF GM combined with IL-17 for IPA in non-neutropenic patients were greater than 80% and there was a significant increase in sensitivity compared with BALF GM.ConclusionsPlasma and BALF IL-17 levels were significantly higher in non-neutropenic patients with IPA. The sensitivity of plasma and BLAF IL-17 for diagnosing IPA in non-neutropenic patients was superior to that of GM. Combined detection of lavage fluid GM and IL17 significantly improves the diagnosis of IPA in non-neutropenic patients. The combined detection of GM and IL-17 in plasma also contributes to the diagnosis of IPA in patients who cannot tolerate invasive procedures.

## Study on the effects of intestinal flora on gouty arthritis

date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Gouty arthritis (GA), a metabolic and immunologic disease, primarily affects joints. Dysbiosis of intestinal flora is an important cause of GA. The metabolic disorders of intestinal flora leading to GA and immune disorders might play an important role in patients with hyperuricemia and established GA. However, the exact mechanisms, through which the dysbiosis of intestinal flora causes the development of GA, are not fully understood yet. Moreover, several therapies commonly used to treat GA might alter the intestinal flora, suggesting that modulation of the intestinal flora might help prevent or treat GA. Therefore, a better understanding of the changes in the intestinal flora of GA patients might facilitate the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The current review article discusses the effects of intestinal flora dysbiosis on the pathogenesis of GA and the cross-regulatory effects between gut flora and drugs for treating GA. This article also highlights the modulatory effects of gut flora by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to lower uric acid levels and relieve joint pain as well as provides a summary and outlook, which might help guide future research efforts.

## A high functional cure rate was induced by pegylated interferon alpha-2b treatment in postpartum hepatitis B e antigen-negative women with chronic hepatitis B virus infection: an exploratory study

date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Background and aimsLimited data have been reported on achieving functional cure using pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) alpha-2b treatment for postpartum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative women with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of Peg-IFN alpha-2b in HBV postpartum women without HBeAg and identify factors linked to the functional cure.MethodsA total of 150 HBeAg-negative postpartum women were retrospectively recruited.47 patients received Peg-IFN alpha-2b [Peg-IFN(+) group] and 103 patients did not [Peg-IFN(-) group]. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to adjust the baseline imbalance between the two groups. The patients were followed for at least 48 weeks. The primary endpoints were hepatitis B surface antigen(HBsAg) loss and HBsAg seroconversion at 48 weeks. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with HBsAg loss at 48 weeks.ResultsAt week 48,the HBsAg loss and seroconversion rate in Peg-IFN(+) group were 51.06%(24/47) and 40.43%(19/47), respectively. Even after PSM, Peg-IFN(+) group still showed higher HBsAg loss rate (50.00% vs 7.14%,p<0.001) and higher HBsAg seroconversion rate (38.10% vs 2.38%,p<0.001). Baseline HBsAg levels (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.051, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.003-0.273, P=0.010), HBsAg at week 24 (OR:0.214, 95%CI:0.033-0.616, P=0.022), HBsAg decline at week 24 (OR:4.682, 95%CI: 1.624-30.198, P=0.022) and postpartum flare (OR:21.181, 95%CI:1.872-633.801, P=0.030) were significantly associated with HBsAg loss at week 48 after Peg-IFN alpha-2b therapy. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) showed that the use of baseline HBsAg<182 IU/mL, HBsAg at week24 < 4 IU/mL and HBsAg decline at week24>12IU/mL were good predictors of HBsAg loss. No serious adverse events were reported.ConclusionPeg-IFN alpha-2b treatment could achieve a high rate of HBsAg loss and seroconversion in HBeAg-negative postpartum women with reliable safety, particularly for patients experience postpartum flare and have low baseline HBsAg levels.

## Real-time fluorescent multiple cross displacement amplification for rapid and sensitive Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection

date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a significant pathogen responsible for community-acquired pneumonia, predominantly affecting children and adolescents. Here, we devised a rapid method for M. pneumoniae that combined multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) with real-time fluorescence technology. A set of ten primers, which were specifically designed for M. pneumoniae detection, were employed in a real-time fluorescence MCDA reaction. Of these, one primer incorporated a restriction endonuclease recognition sequence, a fluorophore, and a quencher, facilitating real-time fluorescence detection. The real-time (RT)-MCDA reactions were monitored in a simple real-time fluorescence instrument and conducted under optimised conditions (64°C for 40 min). The detection limit of the M. pneumoniae RT-MCDA assay for genomic DNA extracted from M. pneumoniae culture was down to 43 fg/µl. This assay accurately identified M. pneumoniae strains without cross-reacting with other bacteria. To validate its practical application, we tested the M. pneumoniae RT-MCDA assay using genomic DNA extracted from clinical samples. The assay’s detection capability proved comparable with real-time PCR, MCDA-based biosensor detection, and visual inspection under blue light. The entire process, including rapid DNA extraction and real-time MCDA detection, was completed within 1 h. Overall, the M. pneumoniae RT-MCDA assay reported here is a simple and effective diagnostic tool for rapid M. pneumoniae detection, which holds significant potential for point-of-care testing and in resource-limited regions.

date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is the major cause of respiratory infections that threaten the health of children and adolescents worldwide. Therefore, an early, simple, and accurate detection approach for MP is critical to prevent outbreaks of MP-induced community-acquired pneumonia.MethodsHere, we explored a simple and accurate method for MP identification that combines loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with the CRISPR/Cas12b assay in a one-pot reaction.ResultsIn the current study, the whole reaction was completed within 1 h at a constant temperature of 57°C. The limit of detection of this assay was 33.7 copies per reaction. The specificity of the LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12b method was 100%, without any cross-reactivity with other pathogens. Overall, 272 clinical samples were used to evaluate the clinical performance of LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12b. Compared with the gold standard results from real-time PCR, the present method provided a sensitivity of 88.11% (126/143), specificity of 100% (129/129), and consistency of 93.75% (255/272).DiscussionTaken together, our preliminary results illustrate that the LAMP-CRISPR/Cas12b method is a simple and reliable tool for MP diagnosis that can be performed in resource-limited regions.

## Gut microbiota, circulating inflammatory proteins and sepsis: a bi-directional Mendelian randomization study

date: 2024-08-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundGut microbiota is closely related to the occurrence and development of sepsis. However, the causal effects between the gut microbiota and sepsis, and whether circulating inflammatory proteins act as mediators, remain unclear.MethodsGut microbiota, circulating inflammatory proteins, and four sepsis-related outcomes were identified from large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) summary data. Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) was the primary statistical method. Additionally, we investigated whether circulating inflammatory proteins play a mediating role in the pathway from gut microbiota to the four sepsis-related outcomes.ResultsThere were 14 positive and 15 negative causal effects between genetic liability in the gut microbiota and four sepsis-related outcomes. Additionally, eight positive and four negative causal effects were observed between circulating inflammatory proteins and the four sepsis-related outcomes. Circulating inflammatory proteins do not act as mediators.ConclusionsGut microbiota and circulating inflammatory proteins were causally associated with the four sepsis-related outcomes. However, circulating inflammatory proteins did not appear to mediate the pathway from gut microbiota to the four sepsis-related outcomes.

## Risk factors related to low-level viraemia in chronic hepatitis B patients receiving entecavir treatment

date: 2024-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAbout 20% of on-treatment patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) experienced low-level viraemia (LLV), which is associated with persistent low-grade inflammation, fibrosis progression, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. We aimed to investigate the high-risk factors related to LLV.MethodsIn this retrospective study, patients receiving entecavir (ETV) treatment from January 2018 to January 2023 were enrolled, and were divided into a LLV (HBV DNA 20-2000 IU/mL) cohort and a complete virological response (CVR) (HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL) cohort according to the virological response at week 48 posttreatment. Treatment baseline characteristics were retrieved from electronic medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was performed.ResultsTotally, 1653 patients were enrolled, male patients accounted for 73.0%; the median age was 44 years; the mean HBV DNA level was 5.9 Log10 IU/ml. Among them, 472 (28.6%) experienced LLV. Multivariate analysis showed that HBeAg positivity (OR = 2.650, 95% CI: 2.000-3.511, p < 0.001), HBV DNA ≥ 6.0 Log10 IU/mL (OR = 1.370, 95% CI: 1.054-1.780, p = 0.019), qHBsAg ≥ 9000 IU/mL (OR = 4.472, 95% CI: 3.410-5.866, p < 0.001), cirrhosis (OR = 1.650, 95% CI: 1.234-2.207, P = 0.001), LSM ≥ 13.0 kPa (OR = 1.644, 95% CI: 1.203-2.246, p = 0.002), and PLT < 100×109/L (OR = 1.450, 95% CI: 1.094-1.922, p = 0.010) at baseline were related to the development of LLV.ConclusionsHigh HBV DNA/HBsAg quantification/LSM, low PLT, HBeAg positivity, and liver cirrhosis were high-risk factors associated with LLV in patients receiving entecavir treatment.

## Gut microbiota and psoriasis: pathogenesis, targeted therapy, and future directions

date: 2024-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPsoriasis is one of the most common autoimmune skin diseases. Increasing evidence shows that alterations in the diversity and function of microbiota can participate in the pathogenesis of psoriasis through various pathways and mechanisms.ObjectiveTo review the connection between microbial changes and psoriasis, how microbial-targeted therapy can be used to treat psoriasis, as well as the potential of prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, diet, and Traditional Chinese Medicine as supplementary and adjunctive therapies.MethodsLiterature related to the relationship between psoriasis and gut microbiota was searched in PubMed and CNKI.ResultsAdjunct therapies such as dietary interventions, traditional Chinese medicine, and probiotics can enhance gut microbiota abundance and diversity in patients with psoriasis. These therapies stimulate immune mediators including IL-23, IL-17, IL-22, and modulate gamma interferon (IFN-γ) along with the NF-kB pathway, thereby suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and ameliorating systemic inflammatory conditions.ConclusionThis article discusses the direction of future research and clinical treatment of psoriasis from the perspective of intestinal microbiota and the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine, so as to provide clinicians with more comprehensive diagnosis and treatment options and bring greater hope to patients with psoriasis.

## Antifungal susceptibility pattern of Candida species isolated from pregnant women

date: 2024-08-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCandida species, opportunistic yeast, are the second most common cause of female vulvovaginal candidiasis. This study aimed to evaluate the antifungal susceptibility profile of the isolated Candida species in pregnant women in Hajjah governorate, Yemen.MethodsA hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 396 pregnant women attending Authority AL-Gumhorri Hospital Hajjah between February and July 2023. Vaginal swabs were collected, and Candida species were isolated and identified based on the standard laboratory method. Furthermore, the antifungal drug susceptibility of Candida species was determined by the Kirby-Bauer technique.Results and discussionThe prevalence of vaginal Candida infection among pregnant women was 61.4%. Candida albicans was the most predominant species (59.26%), followed by Candida krusei(13.58%), Candida Tropicalis (11.12%), Candida Grabata (9.87%), and Candida dubliniensis (6.17%). The highest rate of Candida infections was among women aged 24–30 years (71.9%) who finished primary school (77.8%), with the third trimester (80%), multigravida (66.1%), and recurrent infection (67.7%) showing significant differences (P < 0.05). The Candida albicans isolates were resistant to clotrimazole and itraconazole at 34.7% and 23.6%, respectively.In addition, the resistance of Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, and Candida dublinensis isolates to fluconazole, voriconazole, voriconazole, and nystatin was 57.6%, 63%, 43.8%, and 60%, respectively. Additionally, approximately 46.2% of isolated Candida albicans exhibited one kind of antifungal drug resistance, whereas 38.7% of isolated non-albicans exhibited resistance to three different antifungal agents. According to the above findings, Candida infection is highly prevalent in Yemen and quite widespread. Interventions in health education are advised to increase women’s knowledge of vaginitis and its prevention. The antifungal susceptibility test may also be helpful in determining the best medication for each patient.

## Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing and targeted metagenomic next-generation sequencing in diagnosing pulmonary infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology has been widely used to diagnose various infections. Based on the most common pathogen profiles, targeted mNGS (tNGS) using multiplex PCR has been developed to detect pathogens with predesigned primers in the panel, significantly improving sensitivity and reducing economic burden on patients. However, there are few studies on summarizing pathogen profiles of pulmonary infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients in Jilin Province of China on large scale.MethodsFrom January 2021 to December 2023, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or sputum samples from 546 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia were collected. Pathogen profiles in those patients on whom mNGS was performed were summarized. Additionally, we also evaluated the performance of tNGS in diagnosing pulmonary infections.ResultsCombined with results of mNGS and culture, we found that the most common bacterial pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with high detection rates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. For fungal pathogens, Pneumocystis jirovecii was commonly detected in patients, while fungal infections in immunocompetent patients were mainly caused by Candida albicans. Most of viral infections in patients were caused by Human betaherpesvirus 5 and Human gammaherpesvirus 4. It is worth noting that, compared with immunocompetent patients (34.9%, 76/218), more mixed infections were found in immunocompromised patients (37.8%, 14/37). Additionally, taking final comprehensive clinical diagnoses as reference standard, total coincidence rate of BALF tNGS (81.4%, 48/59) was much higher than that of BALF mNGS (40.0%, 112/280).ConclusionsOur findings supplemented and classified the pathogen profiles of pulmonary infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients in Jilin Province of China. Most importantly, our findings can accelerate the development and design of tNGS specifically used for regional pulmonary infections.

## Novel 3D human trophoblast culture to explore T. cruzi infection in the placenta

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionHuman trophoblastic cell lines, such as BeWo, are commonly used in 2D models to study placental Trypanosoma cruzi infections. However, these models do not accurately represent natural infections. Three-dimensional (3D) microtissue cultures offer a more physiologically relevant in vitro model, mimicking tissue microarchitecture and providing an environment closer to natural infections. These 3D cultures exhibit functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, morphogenesis, and gene expression that resemble in vivo conditions.MethodsWe developed a 3D culture model using the human trophoblastic cell line BeWo and nonadherent agarose molds from the MicroTissues® 3D Petri Dish® system. Both small (12–256) and large (12–81) models were tested with varying initial cell numbers. We measured the diameter of the 3D cultures and evaluated cell viability using Trypan Blue dye. Trophoblast functionality was assessed by measuring β-hCG production via ELISA. Cell fusion was evaluated using confocal microscopy, with Phalloidin or ZO-1 marking cell edges and DAPI staining nuclei. T. cruzi infection was assessed by microscopy and quantitative PCR, targeting the EF1-α gene for T. cruzi and GAPDH for BeWo cells, using three parasite strains: VD (isolated from a congenital Chagas disease infant and classified as Tc VI), and K98 and Pan4 (unrelated to congenital infection and classified as Tc I).ResultsSeeding 1000 BeWo cells per microwell in the large model resulted in comparable cellular viability to 2D cultures, with a theoretical diameter of 408.68 ± 12.65 μm observed at 5 days. Functionality, assessed through β-hCG production, exceeded levels in 2D cultures at both 3 and 5 days. T. cruzi infection was confirmed by qPCR and microscopy, showing parasite presence inside the cells for all three tested strains. The distribution and progression of the infection varied with each strain.DiscussionThis innovative 3D model offers a simple yet effective approach for generating viable and functional cultures susceptible to T. cruzi infection, presenting significant potential for studying the placental microenvironment.

## The use of glucocorticoid in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome: a retrospective cohort study

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionSevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is prevalent in East Asia. However, the use of glucocorticoids (GCs) in the treatment of SFTS remains controversial.MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we collected the data from patients with SFTS at Wuhan Union Hospital to evaluate the effect of GC therapy. Mortality and secondary infections were compared as outcomes. After searching public databases, we also included articles that examined GC use in patients with SFTS for meta-analysis.ResultsPatients treated with GC had higher fatality rates (21.1% vs. 11.9%, respectively; P=0.006) and a longer length of stay (10.6 ± 5.1 vs. 9.5 ± 4.2, respectively; P=0.033). In cohorts adjusted using propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting, no significant differences in fatality rates and length of stay were observed. A meta-analysis of 4243 SFTS patient revealed that those treated with GCs had significantly higher mortality (OR=3.46, 95% CI =2.12-5.64, P<0.00001) and secondary infection rate (OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.45-2.67, P<0.0001).DiscussionGC should be used cautiously when treating SFTS. No significant differences were identified in terms of mortality and secondary infection rates between patients with SFTS treated with or without GC.

## Two cinnamoyl hydroxamates as potential quorum sensing inhibitors against Pseudomonas aeruginosa

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionPseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous pathogen that causes various infectious diseases through the regulation of quorum sensing (QS). The strategy of interfering with the QS systems of P. aeruginosa, coupled with a reduction in the dosage of conventional antibiotics, presents a potential solution to treating infection and mitigating antibiotic resistance. In this study, seven cinnamoyl hydroxamates were synthesized to evaluate their inhibitory effects on QS of P. aeruginosa. Among these cinnamic acid derivatives, we found cinnamoyl hydroxamic acid (CHA) and 3-methoxy-cinnamoyl hydroxamic acid (MCHA) were the two most effective candidates. Furtherly, the effect of CHA and MCHA on the production of virulence factors and biofilm of P. aeruginosa were evaluated. Ultimately, our study may offer promising potential for treating P. aeruginosa infections and reducing its virulence.MethodsThe disc diffusion test were conducted to evaluate inhibitory effects on QS of seven cinnamoyl hydroxamates. The influence of CHA and MCHA on the production of virulence and flagellar motility of P. aeruginosa was furtherly explored. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiment were conducted to evaluate the suppression of CHA and MCHA on the formed biofilm of P. aeruginosa. RT-qPCR was used to detect rhlI, lasA, lasB, rhlA, rhlB, and oprL genes in P. aeruginosa. In silico docking study was performed to explore the molecular mechanism of CHA and MCHA. The synergistic effects of CHA with gentamicin were detected on biofilm cell dispersal.ResultAfter treatment of CHA or MCHA, the production of multiple virulence factors, including pyocyanin, proteases, rhamnolipid, and siderophore, and swimming and swarming motilities in P. aeruginosa were inhibited significantly. And our results showed CHA and MCHA could eliminate the formed biofilm of P. aeruginosa. RT-qPCR revealed that CHA and MCHA inhibited the expression of QS related genes in P. aeruginosa. Molecular docking indicated that CHA and MCHA primarily inhibited the RhlI/R system in P. aeruginosa by competing with the cognate signaling molecule C4-HSL.Additionally, CHA exhibited potent synergistic effects with gentamicin on biofilm cell dispersal.DiscussionP. aeruginosa is one of the most clinically and epidemiologically important bacteria and a primary cause of catheter-related urinary tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia. This study aims to explore whether cinnamoyl hydroxamates have inhibitory effects on QS. And our results indicate that CHA and MCHA, as two novel QSIs, offer promising potential for treating P. aeruginosa infections and reducing its virulence.

## Exploring extracellular vesicles in zoonotic helminth biology: implications for diagnosis, therapeutic and delivery

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as key intercellular communication and pathogenesis mediators. Parasitic organisms’ helminths, cause widespread infections with significant health impacts worldwide. Recent research has shed light on the role of EVs in the lifecycle, immune evasion, and disease progression of these parasitic organisms. These tiny membrane-bound organelles including microvesicles and exosomes, facilitate the transfer of proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs between cells. EVs have been isolated from various bodily fluids, offering a potential diagnostic and therapeutic avenue for combating infectious agents. According to recent research, EVs from helminths hold great promise in the diagnosis of parasitic infections due to their specificity, early detection capabilities, accessibility, and the potential for staging and monitoring infections, promote intercellular communication, and are a viable therapeutic tool for the treatment of infectious agents. Exploring host-parasite interactions has identified promising new targets for diagnostic, therapy, and vaccine development against helminths. This literature review delves into EVS’s origin, nature, biogenesis, and composition in these parasitic organisms. It also highlights the proteins and miRNAs involved in EV release, providing a comprehensive summary of the latest findings on the significance of EVs in the biology of helminths, promising targets for therapeutic and diagnostic biomarkers.

## Revealing the link between gut microbiota and brain tumor risk: a new perspective from Mendelian randomization

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRecent studies have shown that gut microbiota may be related to the occurrence of brain tumors, but direct evidence is lacking. This study used the Mendelian randomization study (MR) method to explore the potential causal link between gut microbiota and brain tumors.MethodWe analyzed the genome-wide association data between 211 gut microbiota taxa and brain tumors, using the largest existing gut microbiota Genome-Wide Association Studies meta-analysis data (n=13266) and combining it with brain tumor data in the IEU OpenGWAS database. We use inverse-variance weighted analysis, supplemented by methods such as Mendelian randomization-Egger regression, weighted median estimator, simple mode, and weighted mode, to assess causality. In addition, we also conducted the Mendelian randomization-Egger intercept test, Cochran’s Q test, and Mendelian randomization Steiger directionality test to ensure the accuracy of the analysis. Quality control includes sensitivity analysis, horizontal gene pleiotropy test, heterogeneity test, and MR Steiger directionality test.ResultOur study found that specific gut microbial taxa, such as order Lactobacillales and family Clostridiaceae1, were positively correlated with the occurrence of brain tumors, while genus Defluviitaleaceae UCG011 and genus Flavonifractor were negatively correlated with the occurrence of brain tumors. The Mendelian randomization-Egger intercept test showed that our analysis was not affected by pleiotropy (P>0.05).ConclusionThis study reveals for the first time the potential causal relationship between gut microbiota and brain tumors, providing a new perspective for the prevention and treatment of early brain tumors. These findings may help develop new clinical intervention strategies and point the way for future research.

## FosA3 emerging in clinical carbapenemase-producing C. freundii

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Fosfomycin (FOS) is an effective antibiotic against multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales, but its effectiveness is reducing. Little is known on the current prevalence of FosA enzymes in low-risk pathogens, such as Citrobacter freundii. The aim of the study was the molecular characterization of a carbapenemase- and FosA-producing C. freundii collected in Italy. AK867, collected in 2023, showed an XDR profile, retaining susceptibility only to colistin. AK867 showed a FOS MIC >128 mg/L by ADM. Based on WGS, AK867 belonged to ST116 and owned a wide resistome, including fosA3, blaKPC-2, and blaVIM-1. fosA3 was carried by a conjugative pKPC-CAV1312 plasmid of 320,480 bp, on a novel composite transposon (12,907 bp). FosA3 transposon shared similarities with other fosA3-harboring pKPC-CAV1312 plasmids among Citrobacter spp. We report the first case of FosA3 production in clinical carbapenemase-producing C. freundii ST116. The incidence of FosA3 enzymes is increasing among Enterobacterales, affecting even low-virulence pathogens, as C. freundii.

ObjectiveThis study used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to explore the genetic diversity, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance determinants of string test-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) over a 4-year surveillance period in Huzhou, China.MethodsIn total, 632 clinical isolates were collected via hospital surveillance from 2020 to 2023; 100 were positive in the string test and these 100 strains were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using an agar dilution method followed by WGS.ResultsThe resistance rates to cefotaxime (77.0%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (67.0%), and nalidixic acid (64.0%) were high. Multilocus sequence typing revealed high genetic diversity; there were 33 sequence types (STs) and 15 capsular serotypes. The most common ST was ST23 (16.0%) and the most common capsular serotype was K1 (22.5%). Virulome analysis revealed among-strain differences in virulence factors that affected bacterial adherence, efflux pump action, iron uptake, nutritional factors, metabolic regulation, the secretion system, and toxin production. The Kleborate strain-specific virulence scores of all 100 string test-positive KPs were derived: 28 strains scored 5, 28 scored 4, 21 scored 3, 12 scored 1, and 11 scored 0. All 77 strains with scores of 3 to 5 contained the iucA gene. The phylogeny based on whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (wgSNPs) indicated high clonality; the string test-positive KP strains were grouped into six clades. Closely related isolates in each genetic cluster usually shared STs.ConclusionThe present study highlights the significance of the KP iucA gene in terms of hypervirulence and the diverse genotypes of string test-positive KP strains isolated in Huzhou hospitals.

## Development of a multienzyme isothermal and lateral flow dipstick combination assay for the rapid detection of goose astrovirus II

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionGoose astrovirus (GAstV) is a newly emerging pathogen that is currently widespread among geese, causing visceral gout and leading to substantial gosling mortalities, posing a severe threat to the waterfowl industry. GAstV II is the predominant epidemic strain, characterized by its high morbidity and mortality rate. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to develop an effective diagnostic approach to control the dissemination of GAstV II, particularly in clinical farms with limited laboratory resources.MethodsIn this study, a novel multi-enzyme isothermal rapid amplification (MIRA) and lateral flow dipstick (LFD) combined assay was developed. Different primers designed specific targeting a highly conserved region within the viral RdRp gene for the detection of GAstV II. Primers optimized and MIRA-LFD assay analyzed its performance regarding limits of detection, specificity, and efficiency of detection.ResultsThe developed MIRA amplification is conducted at a constant temperature and accomplished within 10 minutes. Subsequent naked-eye observation of the LFD strips merely takes 5 minutes. The established MIRA-LFD method exhibits high specificity, with no cross-reaction with other pathogens and attains a detection sensitivity of 1 copy/μl, which is consistent with the reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay. Further evaluation with clinical samples indicates that the accuracy of this MIRA-LFD method correlates well with RT-qPCR for the detection of GAstV II. ConclusionIn summary, the convenience, sensitivity, and rapidity of this newly developed detection method offer a significant advantage for on-site diagnosis of GAstV II.
