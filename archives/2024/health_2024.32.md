## Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing and targeted metagenomic next-generation sequencing in diagnosing pulmonary infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology has been widely used to diagnose various infections. Based on the most common pathogen profiles, targeted mNGS (tNGS) using multiplex PCR has been developed to detect pathogens with predesigned primers in the panel, significantly improving sensitivity and reducing economic burden on patients. However, there are few studies on summarizing pathogen profiles of pulmonary infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients in Jilin Province of China on large scale.MethodsFrom January 2021 to December 2023, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or sputum samples from 546 immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia were collected. Pathogen profiles in those patients on whom mNGS was performed were summarized. Additionally, we also evaluated the performance of tNGS in diagnosing pulmonary infections.ResultsCombined with results of mNGS and culture, we found that the most common bacterial pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients with high detection rates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. For fungal pathogens, Pneumocystis jirovecii was commonly detected in patients, while fungal infections in immunocompetent patients were mainly caused by Candida albicans. Most of viral infections in patients were caused by Human betaherpesvirus 5 and Human gammaherpesvirus 4. It is worth noting that, compared with immunocompetent patients (34.9%, 76/218), more mixed infections were found in immunocompromised patients (37.8%, 14/37). Additionally, taking final comprehensive clinical diagnoses as reference standard, total coincidence rate of BALF tNGS (81.4%, 48/59) was much higher than that of BALF mNGS (40.0%, 112/280).ConclusionsOur findings supplemented and classified the pathogen profiles of pulmonary infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients in Jilin Province of China. Most importantly, our findings can accelerate the development and design of tNGS specifically used for regional pulmonary infections.

## Novel 3D human trophoblast culture to explore T. cruzi infection in the placenta

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionHuman trophoblastic cell lines, such as BeWo, are commonly used in 2D models to study placental Trypanosoma cruzi infections. However, these models do not accurately represent natural infections. Three-dimensional (3D) microtissue cultures offer a more physiologically relevant in vitro model, mimicking tissue microarchitecture and providing an environment closer to natural infections. These 3D cultures exhibit functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, morphogenesis, and gene expression that resemble in vivo conditions.MethodsWe developed a 3D culture model using the human trophoblastic cell line BeWo and nonadherent agarose molds from the MicroTissues® 3D Petri Dish® system. Both small (12–256) and large (12–81) models were tested with varying initial cell numbers. We measured the diameter of the 3D cultures and evaluated cell viability using Trypan Blue dye. Trophoblast functionality was assessed by measuring β-hCG production via ELISA. Cell fusion was evaluated using confocal microscopy, with Phalloidin or ZO-1 marking cell edges and DAPI staining nuclei. T. cruzi infection was assessed by microscopy and quantitative PCR, targeting the EF1-α gene for T. cruzi and GAPDH for BeWo cells, using three parasite strains: VD (isolated from a congenital Chagas disease infant and classified as Tc VI), and K98 and Pan4 (unrelated to congenital infection and classified as Tc I).ResultsSeeding 1000 BeWo cells per microwell in the large model resulted in comparable cellular viability to 2D cultures, with a theoretical diameter of 408.68 ± 12.65 μm observed at 5 days. Functionality, assessed through β-hCG production, exceeded levels in 2D cultures at both 3 and 5 days. T. cruzi infection was confirmed by qPCR and microscopy, showing parasite presence inside the cells for all three tested strains. The distribution and progression of the infection varied with each strain.DiscussionThis innovative 3D model offers a simple yet effective approach for generating viable and functional cultures susceptible to T. cruzi infection, presenting significant potential for studying the placental microenvironment.

## The use of glucocorticoid in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome: a retrospective cohort study

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionSevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is prevalent in East Asia. However, the use of glucocorticoids (GCs) in the treatment of SFTS remains controversial.MethodsIn this retrospective cohort study, we collected the data from patients with SFTS at Wuhan Union Hospital to evaluate the effect of GC therapy. Mortality and secondary infections were compared as outcomes. After searching public databases, we also included articles that examined GC use in patients with SFTS for meta-analysis.ResultsPatients treated with GC had higher fatality rates (21.1% vs. 11.9%, respectively; P=0.006) and a longer length of stay (10.6 ± 5.1 vs. 9.5 ± 4.2, respectively; P=0.033). In cohorts adjusted using propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting, no significant differences in fatality rates and length of stay were observed. A meta-analysis of 4243 SFTS patient revealed that those treated with GCs had significantly higher mortality (OR=3.46, 95% CI =2.12-5.64, P<0.00001) and secondary infection rate (OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.45-2.67, P<0.0001).DiscussionGC should be used cautiously when treating SFTS. No significant differences were identified in terms of mortality and secondary infection rates between patients with SFTS treated with or without GC.

## Two cinnamoyl hydroxamates as potential quorum sensing inhibitors against Pseudomonas aeruginosa

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionPseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous pathogen that causes various infectious diseases through the regulation of quorum sensing (QS). The strategy of interfering with the QS systems of P. aeruginosa, coupled with a reduction in the dosage of conventional antibiotics, presents a potential solution to treating infection and mitigating antibiotic resistance. In this study, seven cinnamoyl hydroxamates were synthesized to evaluate their inhibitory effects on QS of P. aeruginosa. Among these cinnamic acid derivatives, we found cinnamoyl hydroxamic acid (CHA) and 3-methoxy-cinnamoyl hydroxamic acid (MCHA) were the two most effective candidates. Furtherly, the effect of CHA and MCHA on the production of virulence factors and biofilm of P. aeruginosa were evaluated. Ultimately, our study may offer promising potential for treating P. aeruginosa infections and reducing its virulence.MethodsThe disc diffusion test were conducted to evaluate inhibitory effects on QS of seven cinnamoyl hydroxamates. The influence of CHA and MCHA on the production of virulence and flagellar motility of P. aeruginosa was furtherly explored. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiment were conducted to evaluate the suppression of CHA and MCHA on the formed biofilm of P. aeruginosa. RT-qPCR was used to detect rhlI, lasA, lasB, rhlA, rhlB, and oprL genes in P. aeruginosa. In silico docking study was performed to explore the molecular mechanism of CHA and MCHA. The synergistic effects of CHA with gentamicin were detected on biofilm cell dispersal.ResultAfter treatment of CHA or MCHA, the production of multiple virulence factors, including pyocyanin, proteases, rhamnolipid, and siderophore, and swimming and swarming motilities in P. aeruginosa were inhibited significantly. And our results showed CHA and MCHA could eliminate the formed biofilm of P. aeruginosa. RT-qPCR revealed that CHA and MCHA inhibited the expression of QS related genes in P. aeruginosa. Molecular docking indicated that CHA and MCHA primarily inhibited the RhlI/R system in P. aeruginosa by competing with the cognate signaling molecule C4-HSL.Additionally, CHA exhibited potent synergistic effects with gentamicin on biofilm cell dispersal.DiscussionP. aeruginosa is one of the most clinically and epidemiologically important bacteria and a primary cause of catheter-related urinary tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia. This study aims to explore whether cinnamoyl hydroxamates have inhibitory effects on QS. And our results indicate that CHA and MCHA, as two novel QSIs, offer promising potential for treating P. aeruginosa infections and reducing its virulence.

## Revealing the link between gut microbiota and brain tumor risk: a new perspective from Mendelian randomization

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRecent studies have shown that gut microbiota may be related to the occurrence of brain tumors, but direct evidence is lacking. This study used the Mendelian randomization study (MR) method to explore the potential causal link between gut microbiota and brain tumors.MethodWe analyzed the genome-wide association data between 211 gut microbiota taxa and brain tumors, using the largest existing gut microbiota Genome-Wide Association Studies meta-analysis data (n=13266) and combining it with brain tumor data in the IEU OpenGWAS database. We use inverse-variance weighted analysis, supplemented by methods such as Mendelian randomization-Egger regression, weighted median estimator, simple mode, and weighted mode, to assess causality. In addition, we also conducted the Mendelian randomization-Egger intercept test, Cochran’s Q test, and Mendelian randomization Steiger directionality test to ensure the accuracy of the analysis. Quality control includes sensitivity analysis, horizontal gene pleiotropy test, heterogeneity test, and MR Steiger directionality test.ResultOur study found that specific gut microbial taxa, such as order Lactobacillales and family Clostridiaceae1, were positively correlated with the occurrence of brain tumors, while genus Defluviitaleaceae UCG011 and genus Flavonifractor were negatively correlated with the occurrence of brain tumors. The Mendelian randomization-Egger intercept test showed that our analysis was not affected by pleiotropy (P>0.05).ConclusionThis study reveals for the first time the potential causal relationship between gut microbiota and brain tumors, providing a new perspective for the prevention and treatment of early brain tumors. These findings may help develop new clinical intervention strategies and point the way for future research.

## FosA3 emerging in clinical carbapenemase-producing C. freundii

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Fosfomycin (FOS) is an effective antibiotic against multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales, but its effectiveness is reducing. Little is known on the current prevalence of FosA enzymes in low-risk pathogens, such as Citrobacter freundii. The aim of the study was the molecular characterization of a carbapenemase- and FosA-producing C. freundii collected in Italy. AK867, collected in 2023, showed an XDR profile, retaining susceptibility only to colistin. AK867 showed a FOS MIC >128 mg/L by ADM. Based on WGS, AK867 belonged to ST116 and owned a wide resistome, including fosA3, blaKPC-2, and blaVIM-1. fosA3 was carried by a conjugative pKPC-CAV1312 plasmid of 320,480 bp, on a novel composite transposon (12,907 bp). FosA3 transposon shared similarities with other fosA3-harboring pKPC-CAV1312 plasmids among Citrobacter spp. We report the first case of FosA3 production in clinical carbapenemase-producing C. freundii ST116. The incidence of FosA3 enzymes is increasing among Enterobacterales, affecting even low-virulence pathogens, as C. freundii.

## Molecular epidemiology of string test-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates in Huzhou, China, 2020-2023

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis study used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to explore the genetic diversity, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance determinants of string test-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) over a 4-year surveillance period in Huzhou, China.MethodsIn total, 632 clinical isolates were collected via hospital surveillance from 2020 to 2023; 100 were positive in the string test and these 100 strains were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using an agar dilution method followed by WGS.ResultsThe resistance rates to cefotaxime (77.0%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (67.0%), and nalidixic acid (64.0%) were high. Multilocus sequence typing revealed high genetic diversity; there were 33 sequence types (STs) and 15 capsular serotypes. The most common ST was ST23 (16.0%) and the most common capsular serotype was K1 (22.5%). Virulome analysis revealed among-strain differences in virulence factors that affected bacterial adherence, efflux pump action, iron uptake, nutritional factors, metabolic regulation, the secretion system, and toxin production. The Kleborate strain-specific virulence scores of all 100 string test-positive KPs were derived: 28 strains scored 5, 28 scored 4, 21 scored 3, 12 scored 1, and 11 scored 0. All 77 strains with scores of 3 to 5 contained the iucA gene. The phylogeny based on whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (wgSNPs) indicated high clonality; the string test-positive KP strains were grouped into six clades. Closely related isolates in each genetic cluster usually shared STs.ConclusionThe present study highlights the significance of the KP iucA gene in terms of hypervirulence and the diverse genotypes of string test-positive KP strains isolated in Huzhou hospitals.

## Development of a multienzyme isothermal and lateral flow dipstick combination assay for the rapid detection of goose astrovirus II

date: 2024-08-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionGoose astrovirus (GAstV) is a newly emerging pathogen that is currently widespread among geese, causing visceral gout and leading to substantial gosling mortalities, posing a severe threat to the waterfowl industry. GAstV II is the predominant epidemic strain, characterized by its high morbidity and mortality rate. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to develop an effective diagnostic approach to control the dissemination of GAstV II, particularly in clinical farms with limited laboratory resources.MethodsIn this study, a novel multi-enzyme isothermal rapid amplification (MIRA) and lateral flow dipstick (LFD) combined assay was developed. Different primers designed specific targeting a highly conserved region within the viral RdRp gene for the detection of GAstV II. Primers optimized and MIRA-LFD assay analyzed its performance regarding limits of detection, specificity, and efficiency of detection.ResultsThe developed MIRA amplification is conducted at a constant temperature and accomplished within 10 minutes. Subsequent naked-eye observation of the LFD strips merely takes 5 minutes. The established MIRA-LFD method exhibits high specificity, with no cross-reaction with other pathogens and attains a detection sensitivity of 1 copy/μl, which is consistent with the reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay. Further evaluation with clinical samples indicates that the accuracy of this MIRA-LFD method correlates well with RT-qPCR for the detection of GAstV II. ConclusionIn summary, the convenience, sensitivity, and rapidity of this newly developed detection method offer a significant advantage for on-site diagnosis of GAstV II.
