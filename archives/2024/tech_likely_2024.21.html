<h2 id="what-to-do-about-the-climate">2024-05-12 What to do about the

<p>date: 2024-05-22, from: Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-05-12-what-to-do-about-the-climate">
2024-05-12 What to do about the climate?
</h1>
<p>
The main problem seems to me that nobody knows. So how do we find a way
out of this uncertainty? What should or
<a href="priorities">priorities</a> be?
</p>
<p>
Before we even start, let me just say that I‚Äôm never interested in
debating climate change. <a href="2024-01-14-climate">It‚Äôs real, it‚Äôs
here</a>, and people denying it are just trying to waste our time.
</p>
<p>
The first category of action, I think, would be political: Vote green,
on all levels of government. And by ‚Äúgreen‚Äù I mean the most radical
green possible but not necessarily a Green Party member. It all depends
on the voting system, on the actual parties you have. If you live in a
one or two party state or if your Green Party is run by fascists, I have
no idea what you should do. Something about political change, something
about local politics, and so on.
</p>
<p>
On the individual level, I think uncertainty arises because we‚Äôre not
sure. No littering looks nice but probably doesn‚Äôt help much against the
climate. Perhaps it helps against the micro-plastic? But how many
plastic bags from land-locked Switzerland actually end up in the ocean?
How much plastic is that compared to the fishing nets lost at sea? The
oil spills? And here‚Äôs the moment where it spirals out of control. Stop!
I need to stop because there‚Äôs no ‚Äúthinking it through‚Äù when things are
so complex unless you‚Äôre a scientist working on it. I hope the
scientists can do their research, and somebody else can compile the
research into arguments, with weights attached, so that politicians and
individuals know what to tackle first.
</p>
<p>
This is why I appreciate lists of priorities, even if they are slightly
wrong. They don‚Äôt have to be perfect because perfection is a goal used
to derail the conversation. If you think the top priority is to get rid
of cars, and you have a lot of arguments against cars, then getting
involved in a discussion where the other party argues about electric
vehicles, lithium batteries, hydrogen storage, road access for emergency
vehicles, mobility for the disabled, then yes to all of that, but also:
get rid of cars. We can have nuance as long as we also start doing
something. We can start by making large, private cars illegal. Then
medium, private cars. Then add fees for long haul trucks. Build
railways. Build trams. Get rid of public parking spaces without special
permits. And on and on. This allows us to pull back out of car society
with grace. We can get started and keep the things that we think are
precious.
</p>
<p>
The alternative is living as we do, followed by uncontrolled collapse, I
fear.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it‚Äôs expensive. Not doing anything, however, is fatal.
</p>
<p>

<p>
The full report of <em>Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate
Change</em> is a PDF with 2042 pages. So there‚Äôs an answer if anybody is
claiming that we don‚Äôt know what to do. But also: there‚Äôs your answer if
you‚Äôre wondering why nobody is doing anything. Politicians at the top
need people who read this report for them and my guess is ‚Äì given what
little I know about Swiss politics, for example ‚Äì that there is only a
very small number of people that have actually read this report, let
alone understand enough of it in order to make informed decisions.
</p>
<p>
This is why a public ‚Äúchain of trust‚Äù needs to lead from interviews with
public figures to interviews with experts. The media, including social
media, needs to mediate this. Then people can at least go along with
people they trust, even if this trust is built on public appearance,
hollow campaign promises, good looks, height and whatever else engenders
trust in people.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, number one: üö´ Live car free. If you can. Make the kind of
choices that make this easier in the future, or for your children, or
for your friends and family. If you can. But this is one of the goals we
need to pursue. We need to get our <a href="priorities">priorities</a>
right.
</p>
<p>
(We don‚Äôt need them to perfectly right, as discussed above. But we
cannot save the planet and car culture, both. One of them will have to
go.)

to make Google‚Äôs new ‚ÄúWeb‚Äù search option the default in your
browser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last week, Google unveiled a new little feature in Google Search,
called ‚ÄúWeb‚Äù. Residing alongside the various other options like ‚ÄúAll‚Äù,
‚ÄúImages‚Äù, ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù, and so on, its goal is to effectively strip Google
Search results from everything we generally don‚Äôt like, and just present
a list of actual links to actual websites. It turns out it‚Äôs quite
simple to set this as your default search ‚Äúengine‚Äù in your browser, so
somebody made a website to make that process a little easier. On May
15th Google released a new ‚ÄúWeb‚Äù filter that removes ‚ÄúAI Overview‚Äù and
other clutter, leaving only traditional web results. Here is how you can
set ‚ÄúGoogle Web‚Äù as your default search engine. ‚Ü´ TenBlueLinks.org It‚Äôs
important to note that this is not some separate search engine, and that
no data is flowing any differently than when using regular Google. All
this does is append the parameter UDM=14 to the URL, which loads the
option ‚ÄúWeb‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="my-blogging-workflow">My blogging workflow</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://birming.com/posts/our-blogging-workflow&quot;&gt;Robert&lt;/a&gt; told me about this blogging workflow trend that‚Äôs currently happening in a bunch of blogs around the web and since I thought it‚Äôs a neat idea I‚Äôm gonna share mine.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I‚Äôm gonna split it into two because this blog serves as both my home on
the web as well as a home for the
<a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs series</a>.
</p>
<h2>
My posts
</h2>
<p>
I have two types of posts on this site: regular blog posts and
‚Äúmoments‚Äù. Moments are my personal Instagram, posts with an image and a
short caption. As the name suggests, those are moments in time and so
there is no real planning behind them. This is how it works:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I take a picture with my iPhone
</li>
<li>
I do some light editing using Snapseed
</li>
<li>
I log into my site‚Äôs dashboard
</li>
<li>
I create a new post
</li>
<li>
I write a title that always starts with ‚ÄúA moment‚Ä¶‚Äù
</li>
<li>
I upload the picture and I write the short post directly on the admin
interface
</li>
<li>
I hit save
</li>
</ol>
<p>
There‚Äôs no proofreading involved, no drafts, no nothing. I take a photo,
I upload it, write something and move on with my day.
</p>
<p>
As for the regular posts, those are handled a bit differently. My blog
has no structure behind its schedule. I post about whatever I find
interesting at any point in time. I have a to-do list with a bunch of
random ideas that usually appear in my head out of nowhere when I‚Äôm
outside for a walk. Those entries in my to-do are either a single
line‚Äîfor example <em>Taxonomy of personal websites</em>‚Äîor a combination
of title + short description‚Äî<em>Good conversations: What‚Äôs the ideal
workflow for a good conversation online</em>.
</p>
<p>
When I feel in the mood to post something I either pick one of those
entries or, like I‚Äôm doing now, I write about something else, usually in
response to something I read somewhere else. The workflow is the
following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I open iA Writer
</li>
<li>
I write my post
</li>
<li>
When I feel I‚Äôm done I copy-paste into Grammarly to check for typos or
other silly issues
</li>
<li>
I open my site‚Äôs dashboard
</li>
<li>
I create a new post
</li>
<li>
I copy-paste from Grammarly and I hit publish
</li>
<li>
I then log into Buttondown.email, create a new email, paste the content
of the new post and hit send because there are some 100 or so people who
want to get my posts via email
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Again, I don‚Äôt do drafts, don‚Äôt do editing. I have an idea, I write it
down, check for silly issues with Grammarly and then I post it online.
That‚Äôs how my blog works.
</p>
<h2>
People and Blogs
</h2>
<p>
As I mentioned before, my site also hosts the People and Blogs
interviews. The workflow for those posts is a bit different and it goes
like this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I have a list of potential guests on Airtable
</li>
<li>
I cold email a bunch of people and ask if they want to be part of the
series
</li>
<li>
If they say yes I send them the questions
</li>
<li>
When I get back the answers I create a new post
</li>
<li>
I format their answers in markdown and add the intro and outro and store
it as a draft
</li>
<li>
On the week the interview is scheduled to go live I send a link to the
draft to the guest to give them time to do a final check and to also
give them a final chance to add or remove anything from the answers
</li>
<li>
Once the interview is good to go I log into the Buttondown account,
create the interview and schedule it to go live on Friday
</li>
<li>
5 minutes before it‚Äôs time to go live a reminder rings on my phone to
make sure I don‚Äôt forget to publish the post
</li>
<li>
I log into my dashboard and hit publish
</li>
</ol>
<p>
And that‚Äôs how it works for P&amp;B. Could I add an auto-publish feature
on my site? Sure. Would that save me time? Maybe 20 seconds a week. Is
it worth it? Absolutely not.
</p>
<p>
And those are my workflows. Nothing fancy, very few tools and very
little automation. As always if you have questions you can

a macOS application to prevent iTunes or Apple Music from launching</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>noTunes is a macOS application that will prevent iTunes or Apple
Music from launching. Simply launch the noTunes app and iTunes/Music
will no longer be able to launch. For example, when bluetooth headphones
reconnect. You can toggle the apps functionality via the menu bar icon
with a simple left click. ‚Ü´ noTunes GitHub page Apparently, this is such
a common complaint that an application had to be made just to gain some
semblance of control over what some people still refer to as ‚Äútheir‚Äù
computer. For both macOS and Windows, there‚Äôs a giant industry ‚Äì you
can‚Äôt really call it a cottage industry anymore at this point ‚Äì of
tools, applications, and fixes just to deal with or avoid all the
user-hostile, anti-choice garbage Apple and Microsoft shove into their
respective operating systems. As a Linux user ‚Äì and recent OpenBSD
convert ‚Äì I find this absolutely wild. Following any Apple podcast, or
reading any Windows website, makes it so clear just how many hoops these
people have to jump through and how many weirdly-shaped holes they have
to contort into just to be able to gain some vague semblance of
ownership of their own hardware. I‚Äôm not judging ‚Äì we all have areas in
our lives where we do this, they just differ from person to person ‚Äì but
it‚Äôs still confronting to see it so clearly, all the time.</p>

you have it, it starts solving problems you never thought would be
associated with AI. But there it is. You just have to sit down and start

<p>Lawyers for Scarlett Johansson are demanding that OpenAI disclose how
it developed an AI personal assistant voice that the actress says sounds
uncannily similar to her own. Johansson‚Äôs legal team has sent OpenAI two
letters asking the company to detail the process by which it developed a
voice the tech company dubbed ‚ÄúSky,‚Äù Johansson‚Äôs publicist told NPR in a
revelation that has not been previously reported. ‚Ü´ Bobby Allyn at NPR
This story highlights just how much disdain techbros have for the work
of creative people. Here‚Äôs the timeline: Techbros like Sam Altman deeply
despise and undervalue the work of creatives, believing human creativity
to be merely an equation to be solved, definable by an algorithm. To
people like him, creative work has no value, and as such, is up for
grabs to be taken and cut up for his algorithms to spit out as ‚Äúnew‚Äù
works. This story highlights this perfectly. The sleaze runs deep with
Altman and OpenAI.</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/05/21/teslaModelY.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Here‚Äôs
what I‚Äôve learned from
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+tesla">owing</a>
a Tesla Model Y with
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/10/230303.html">Full Self
Driving</a>. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs safe. It absolutely does require your
full attention at all times. You are still driving the car. I‚Äôve seen it
do crazy stuff in simple situations. I‚Äôve seen it panic, basically throw
its hands in the air and say Dave this is your problem. That‚Äôs why you
always have to be ready, as if you were driving the car yourself because
at any moment you could be. You never know when it‚Äôs going to happen.
Now focus on that moment. Your car has given up and turned the driving
over to you. How much experience do you have with that? Do you know
where to look? Do you hit the brakes or veer to the left or right? If
you‚Äôre an experienced driver, a lot of these reactions are completely
programmed into the lower levels of the brain. You don‚Äôt have to think
at all. When the car panics, I tend to panic. If I had 10 or 20 years
experience with this connection, then I guess it‚Äôs probably safe. But
not the way it is.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm amazed there aren‚Äôt more terrible accidents with FSD, and that Tesla
still promotes this as ‚Äúself-driving,‚Äù which it is not.
</p>
<p>
Also, I love my Tesla. Every time I get into that mofo I feel
privileged. It looks like a Toyota Camry but drives like a muscle car. I
might still switch to a
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/ev9">Kia EV9</a>, at some
point, if it drives as well as the Tesla, simply because the nearest
Telsa dealer is over an hour away, and the
<a href="https://www.romeokia.com/">Kia dealer</a> is in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_New_York">Kingston</a>
which is practically in the neighborhood.

GHC release plans
</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">
Zubin Duggal - 2024-05-21
</h4>
<p>
This post sets out our plans for upcoming releases in the next few
months.
</p>
<p>
Given limited time and resources, we plan to prioritise work on the 9.6,
9.10 and master branches of GHC for the next few months.
</p>
<h2 id="section">
9.10
</h2>
<p>
With the release of 9.10.1, we look forward to the broader adoption of
this release.
</p>
<p>
New releases in this series will continue at the usual rate depending on
if and when any significant regressions or issues arise.
</p>
<h2 id="section-1">
9.6
</h2>
<p>
9.6.5 seems to be a relatively stable release so far and we plan to
prioritise fixes given the relatively higher adoption of this branch. We
know of one significant issue
(<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/22210">#22210</a>)
to do with object merging arising from the interactions between GHC and
cabal on certain platforms including Darwin with a
<code>brew</code>-provisioned clang toolchain.
</p>
<p>
The upcoming 9.6.6 release will include a fix for this issue along with
others that may arise. The 9.6.6 release is tentatively scheduled for
the end of June, to allow for sufficient time following the 9.6.5
release for bugs and issues to be reported and addressed.
</p>
<h2 id="section-2">
9.8
</h2>
<p>
We plan to continue supporting this release series for the near future,
but updates to this series might proceed at a slower rate than usual as
we prioritise the new release (9.10) and supporting earlier releases
with high uptake (9.6).
</p>
<p>
The next release in this series will likely be scheduled after the 9.6.6
release.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
We hope that this clarfies the current state of our release branches. If
you have any questions or comments then please be in touch via

<h2 id="xeon-phi-support-removed-in-gcc-15-compiler">Xeon Phi support
removed in GCC 15 compiler</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about Intel aiming to remove Xeon Phi support in
GCC 15 with the products being end-of-life and deprecated in GCC 14.
While some openly wondered whether the open-source community would allow
it given the Xeon Phi accelerators were available to buy just a few
years ago and at some very low prices going back years so some
potentially finding use still out of them especially during this AI boom
(and still readily available to buy used for around ~$50 USD), today the
Intel Xeon Phi support was indeed removed. ‚Ü´ Michael Larabel Xeon Phi
PCIe cards are incredibly cheap on eBay, and every now and then my mouse
hovers over the buy button ‚Äì but I always realise just in time that the
cards have become quite difficult to use, since support for them,
already sparse to begin with, is only getting worse by the day. Support
for them was already removed in Linux 5.10, and now GCC is pulling he
plug too, so the only option is to keep using old kernels, or pass the
card on to a VM running an older Linux kernel version, which is a lot of
headache for what is essentially a weird toy for nerds at this point.
GCC 15 will also, sadly, remove support for Itanium, which, as I‚Äôve said
before, is a huge disgrace and a grave mistake. Itanium is the future,
and will stomp all over crappy architectures like x86 and ARM. With this
deprecation, GCC relegates itself to the dustbin of history.</p>

AntennaPod code structure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>AntennaPod has been around for a long time ‚Äì the first bit of code
was published in 2011. Since then, the app has grown massively and had
several main developers. The beauty of open-source is that so many
people can contribute and make a great app together. But sometimes
having many people work on a project can lead to different ways of
thinking about how to structure the project. Because of this, AntennaPod
gradually grew to have a number of weird code constructs. Our latest
release, version 3.4, fixes this. ‚Ü´ ByteHamster The AntennaPod team had
an incredible task ahead of itself, and while it took them a few years,
they pulled it off. The code structure graphs from before and after the
code restructuring illustrate better than words ever could what they
achieved. Thy changed 10000 lines of source code in 62 pull requests for
this restructuring alone, while still adding new major features in the
meantime. Pretty incredible.</p>

id="microsoft-gives-windows-new-compiler-kernel-scheduler-and-x86-translation-layer-on-arm">Microsoft
gives Windows new compiler, kernel, scheduler, and x86 translation layer
on ARM</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft‚Äôs developer conference Build is taking place this week, so
there‚Äôs been some major Windows news and announcements, and for once ‚Äì
we‚Äôre not talking about more ads in your operating system, or even ‚ÄúAI‚Äù
shoehorned into, I don‚Äôt know, Phone Dialer or Windows Fax and Scan.
First and foremost, Windows is going to get a new compiler, kernel, and
scheduler, but despite such massive low-level changes, the marketing
version number won‚Äôt jump from 11 to 12. Of course, we all know the
marketing version number has nothing to do with the actual Windows NT
version number, which currently sits at 10. The Windows NT version
number, meanwhile, is actually also meaningless, since it magically
jumps around left and right too, going from 6.2 to 10 between Windows
8.1 and Windows 10, where it has stayed ever since. ‚ÄúWe really focused
on modernizing this update of Windows 11,‚Äù said Microsoft Corporate Vice
President of Windows and Devices Pavan Davuluri at a technical briefing
on Microsoft‚Äôs campus in mid-April. ‚ÄúWe engineered this update of
Windows 11 with a real focus on AI inference and taking advantage of the
Arm64 instruction set at every layer of the operating system stack. For
us, what this meant really was building a new compiler in Windows. We
built a new kernel in Windows on top of that compiler. We now have new
schedulers in the operating system that take advantage of these new SoC
architecture.‚Äù ‚Ü´ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica The focus is clearly
on ARM here, which coincides with the launch of Qualcomm‚Äôs Snapdragon X
Elite, a new SoC that finally seems to truly make ARM laptops that
aren‚Äôt from Apple a real, competitive thing ‚Äì so much so that Qualcomm
is even breaking with tradition and taking Linux support very seriously
for this new chip. Microsoft also unveiled the name for its new x86
translation layer for Windows on ARM: Prism. Microsoft told Ars Technica
that Prism is as fast as Apple‚Äôs Rosetta 2, which is interesting because
Apple‚Äôs M series chips contain special silicon to speed up the
translation process, making me wonder if Qualcomm has done the same, or
is just brute-forcing it. Performance like this means the apps customers
love work great. Microsoft has partnered closely with developers across
the globe to optimize their applications for this processor. In
addition, the powerful new Prism emulation engine delivers a 2x
performance boost compared to Surface Pro 9 with 5G. On the new Surface
Pro and Surface Laptop, powered by Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X
Plus processors, experiences like Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365
and Chrome will feel snappy, quick and responsive. ‚Ü´ Pete Kyriacou on
the Windows blog The new Windows on ARM machines using the Snapdragon X
Elite will be marketed under the new Copilot+ brand name, which brings
with it some requirements, the biggest of which is the neural processing
unit: it must be capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second.
At the time of writing, the only Windows-capable processor that can
boast such numbers is, of course, the new Snapdragon X Elite. AMD and
Intel need not apply. They simply cannot match this. Microsoft tied a
bow on all this stuff by unveiling the new Surface Pro and new Surface
Laptop, both powered by the new Snapdragon SoCs. You can preorder them
today, but they won‚Äôt be available until 18 June.</p>

Here‚Äôs
<a href="https://x.com/davewiner/status/1792237882679156983">something</a>
you may find funny if you study the evolution of software technology.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
In the 80s there were all kinds of ideas about how to do hypertext.
Mostly they called for two-way links, so you could walk the graph in any
direction you like. These were hard to implement and required the two
parties work with each other, and that never happened.
</li>
<li>
In the early 90s along comes Tim Berners-Lee, a random NextStep
developer who wanted to play and he for whatever reason didn‚Äôt wait to
figure out how to boil the ocean with two-way links, he just did one-way
links and instead of inventing a new protocol he just implemented it on
top of TCP/IP. While the purists were debating its purity it took off,
broke all records, made a lot of people very rich.
</li>
<li>
A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee, the same guy who made the web, wants
to layer a new protocol on top of the web ‚Äì the Semantic Web. He wanted
people to be able to query the web the way you query a database. ‚Äúshow
me all the widgets on sale in urbana for less than $20.‚Äù Like that.
</li>
<li>
It never happened for the same reason the two-way hyperlinks didn‚Äôt, it
required cooperation. You couldn‚Äôt just throw together a demo in an
afternoon as a fun side project like you could with the web (I speak
from experience, my first success with the web took five freaking
minutes).
</li>
<li>
Now when Google or some other browser maker integrates ChatGPT-like
functionality in their browser, as a side-effect, you will get TBL‚Äôs
Semantic Web. It won‚Äôt require any cooperation and that‚Äôs why it will
work.

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6-comes-to-openbsd">KDE Plasma 6 comes to
OpenBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last year marked a significant milestone for both myself and the
OpenBSD desktop community, as we successfully ported KDE Plasma 5 and
all dependencies to OpenBSD. With the release of OpenBSD 7.5 on April 5,
2024, KDE Plasma in version 5.27.10 has become a part of our lovely
operating system. This success is the result of years of development
work and commitment to achieving this goal. KDE launched version 6 of
its Plasma desktop environment on February 28, 2024, bringing numerous
updates and features as well as the major switch to Qt6. I am immensely
proud that the OpenBSD team has managed to prepare for this major update
so swiftly. All necessary components have been committed to our CVS
tree, and the packages will soon be available. ‚Ü´ Rafael Sadowski
Excellent news for OpenBSD users who don‚Äôt wish to be using GNOME, Xfce,
or one of the smaller build-it-yourself desktop environments. My
dual-Xeon workstation, which I switched over from Fedora KDE to OpenBSD,
runs Xfce, because I feel a smaller desktop environment is a more
natural fit for OpenBSD, but I‚Äôm very happy to know that I have KDE to
fall back on in case Xfce turns out not to be a good fit for me in the
long term. I‚Äôll give the OpenBSD developers an other experts in that
community some more time to iron out any wrinkles, and then I‚Äôll
probably give it a go to see just how well KDE will be integrated with
the OpenBSD base system.</p>

Server 2025 to ship with DTrace by default</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows Server 2025 comes equipped with dtrace as a native tool.
DTrace is a command-line utility that enables users to monitor and
troubleshoot their system‚Äôs performance in real-time. DTrace allows
users to dynamically instrument both the kernel and user-space code
without any need to modify the code itself. This versatile tool supports
a range of data collection and analysis techniques, such as
aggregations, histograms, and tracing of user-level events. To learn
more, see DTrace for command line help and DTrace on Windows for
additional capabilities. ‚Ü´ What‚Äôs new in Windows Server 2025 DTrace was
originally developed by Sun as part of Solaris, but eventually made its
way to other operating systems as Sun collapsed in on itself and Oracle
gave it the final push. DTrace is available for the various surviving
Solars-based operating systems, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, macOS, and QNX,
and Microsoft ported DTrace from FreeBSD to Windows back in 2018. With
Windows Server 2025, DTrace will be shipped out of the box.</p>

<h2 id="pg_dumpbinary-v2.17-released">pg_dumpbinary v2.17 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-20, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<strong>Grenoble, France - Mai 20, 2024</strong>
</p>
<h2>
pg_dumpbinary
</h2>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary
format. The resulting dump must be restored using
<code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.
</p>
<p>
This release adds two new options to command pg_restorebinary:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add option <code>-C, ‚Äìcreate</code> to pg_restorebinary to create the
database before restoring into it. Like with pg_restore you must provide
a database to connect using the <code>-d</code> option.
</li>
<li>
Add <code>‚Äìdump-create</code> to print to stdout the create and alter
database statements.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because
the total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.
</li>
<li>
You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but
data are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text. In this case pg_dump
truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data
loss.
</li>
<li>
Other cases where a binary output format is useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases the
pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are preferred.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.

Over the last year and a half I ran the entirety of the River Thames! In
total it took 20 runs for a total of over 440km.

Let‚Äôs get the obvious question out the way first: ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù And I, errr,
don‚Äôt have a good reason. It‚Äôs
<a href="/blog/2021/5/3/visiting-the-eu/">not the first time</a> I‚Äôve
done a big themed running project, but it‚Äôs by far the biggest I‚Äôve
<em>ever</em> done.
</p>
<p>
Second obvious question: ‚Äúwas it a good idea?‚Äù Kinda‚Ä¶ I really enjoyed
running through a lot of the countryside, and for the most part the
Thames Path is very easy to run on. It‚Äôs also mostly well connected with
public transport, which makes the point-to-point nature of the runs
manageable. But on the other hand I often spent far more time travelling
than running, which made it a much larger time commitment than ‚Äújust‚Äù 20
weekend half marathons.
</p>
<p>
The best part of this project was seeing the contrast in landscapes and
communities across the length of the river. Until now my only
familiarity with the Thames was with its murky, curvy path through
London or the college boathouses in Oxford.
</p>

<p>
An interesting historical pattern with the Thames ‚Äî as with
<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/713101">many
English cities</a> ‚Äî is that effluence flows downstream and affluence
upstream. A lot of this has to do with the Thames‚Äôs role in London‚Äôs
history: for centuries waste water was literally dumped in the river.
Land up river became more desirable. It‚Äôs no historical accident that
the royal court at Hampton Court Palace was far west of the City of
London.
</p>
<p>
Those historical trends are reflected today, even as sewage practices
have improved
(<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-67357566">a
little</a>) and London de-industrialised. House prices are twice as high
in Richmond-upon-Thames in south-west London than Bexley, in south-east
London. Further out of London, on an Essex-bound train I overheard a
group of men lamenting the loss of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_men%27s_club">working
men‚Äôs clubs</a>, an important
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place">third place</a> in
their communities, whilst in Oxfordshire I sat near a
<em>frightfully</em> posh former Home Secretary concluding with a group
of friends that taking the train to a party was a ‚Äúterrifically smart‚Äù
decision. (Decisions they made in government weren‚Äôt quite so clever.)
</p>
<p>
Deeper into the country the Thames cuts a path through ‚Äúgreen and
pleasant‚Äù English countryside. Over the course of my 20 runs I developed
a newfound appreciation for it. I‚Äôve genuinely come to believe that
we‚Äôre <em>incredibly</em> fortunate in the UK to be so well connected to
so much accessible, open space.

Gear
</h2>
<p>
I ran with a running vest, a 1.5L Osprey water bladder, a handful of
snacks (Clif bars in particular), gels, AirPods, iPhone, and Apple Watch
Ultra. I experimented with cheaper water bladders but they‚Äôre a false
economy: after a few runs they‚Äôd start to leak and I‚Äôd have to replace
them.

<p>
The Watch was the MVP of all these: I used
<a href="https://pedometer.app">Pedometer++</a> to display my planned
route and route taken throughout each run. The app supports both
OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey tiles; I generally preferred the
former as they were clearer on the small display.
</p>
<p>
For the most part I was following the Thames Path, but I often deviated
around it to either explore other countryside or take shortcuts on
routes that would otherwise be too long in one go.
</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thamesconditions">
Conditions
</h2>
<p>
I ran mostly in winter and spring 2023 and spring 2024. In the winter
months the path was often <em>very</em> muddy, whilst in spring there
were sections with very overgrown grass (which was joyless with my
hayfever). The Thames burst its banks last year, flooding parts of the
path. The
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-restrictions-and-closures">Environment
Agency has pages monitoring current river conditions</a>.
</p>
<p>
Towards the source of the river the Thames Path is often just a trodden
path along the edge of fields. This makes for a very uneven surface: I
had to slow down to avoid turning an ankle.
</p>
<p>
I only ran in the summer once, but even in spring it was often 20¬∫+ and
sunny. Most of the route is <em>very</em> exposed: by the end I
regularly ran with a baseball cap.
</p>
<h2 id="2024-05-19-running-the-river-thameslogistics">
Logistics
</h2>
<p>
I live in London, which made travel to and from each run easy. (Cities
in the UK are well connected by rail to London and <em>far</em>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts">less well to one
another</a>.) All in I spent about ¬£400 on train tickets, local buses,
and (only twice) taxis. I used a railcard to decrease costs but
otherwise I generally optimised for time. I‚Äôve no doubt that booking
advance singles, split tickets, or cheaper train lines could reduce the
cost by at least ¬£100.
</p>
<p>
At the end of each run I made a tradition of buying a meal deal (or
equivalent) and extra snacks: I spent a further ¬£200 on these.
</p>
<p>
Between Lechlade, Gloucestershire and Teddington, London the Thames is
interrupted by dozens of locks. These locks often have extra facilities
for boaters, which
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/river-thames-locks-and-facilities-for-boaters">the
Environment Agency lists here</a>. I learned way, way too late
(literally at the <em>last</em> lock I ran past) that this often
includes drinking water taps that you can use to refill water bottles. A
lock keeper recommended running the tap for 30s before using it.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve posted GPX files for all the routes below.

For all the London and Kent routes I took South Western trains, TfL
services, or High Speed 1.
</p>
<p>
The best sections were from Battersea Power Station to Greenwich: you
get far more diversity in the built environment on this leg than any
other section of the Thames (beyond these points London is mostly just
suburbs).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_1_N_Teddington_Lock_to_Barnes_Bridge.gpx">[1/20]
Teddington to Barnes Bridge (12.7km)</a>: I started by running west with
one of the shortest runs. All of the London sections were very flexible
as the Thames path is rarely more than a few hundred meters from a TfL
connection. Teddington is the final lock on the River Thames and
therefore the start of the ‚Äútidal Thames‚Äù.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_2_N_Barnes_Bridge_to_Tower_Bridge.gpx">[2/20]
Barnes Bridge to Tower Bridge (21.2km)</a>: By far the busiest section
as it includes the Southbank. Stopped at Battersea Power Station
halfway.

Abbey Wood (the end of the Elizabeth line) but didn‚Äôt have enough energy
on the day.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_4_N_Woolwich_to_Dartford.gpx">[4/20] Woolwich
to Dartford (21.4km)</a>: The Thames Path deviates quite far from the
River Thames as it‚Äôs interrupted by the Darent from the south.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_5_N_Dartford_to_Gravesend.gpx">[5/20] Dartford
to Gravesend (20.3km)</a>: This was by far the least pleasant section to
run: the sewage treatment plants along the river stink, and the marshes
aren‚Äôt much better. Gravesend definitely wins ‚Äúworst place name‚Äù of
anywhere I went.

For all the Essex routes I took c2c trains from West Ham and Fenchurch
Street. I chose to cross to running on the north side of the river and
run the Thames Estuary Path instead of the Thames Path as it was
<em>far</em> better connected to London.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_6_N_Tilbury_to_Stanford_le_Hope.gpx">[6/20]
Tilbury to Stanford-le-Hope (17km)</a>: I ran fairly far inland from the
river (the land immediately next to the river was marshy). I wouldn‚Äôt
recommend this path in winter.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_7_N_Stanford_le_Hope_to_Benfleet.gpx">[7/20]
Stanford-le-Hope to Benfleet (19.7km)</a>: This section was again quite
muddy when I ran it in early spring 2023. Benfleet Station was my
starting connection for the next 2 runs.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_8_N_Canvey_Island_Loop.gpx">[8/20] Canvey
Island (23.6km)</a>: I ran a lap of Canvey Island because I‚Äôm followed
by a group of pedants on Strava who would‚Äôve called me out if I skipped
it.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_9_N_Benfleet_to_Southend_on_Sea_completed_the_tidal_Thames_.gpx">[9/20]
Benfleet to Southend-on-Sea (12km)</a>: I concluded I‚Äôd reached the end
of the Thames when I reached a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stone_(riparian)">London
Stone</a> at Chalkwell, which marks the end of the Port of London‚Äôs
Authority. However I continued to Southend-on-Sea because I figured if
they‚Äôre claiming it‚Äôs at the seaside rather than the estuary-side that
was good enough for me. Finished with fish and chips and ice cream on
the beach.

Teddington to Chertsey (24.2km)</a>: For all the remaining runs I ran
west. At Weybridge I had to cross the river via a ferry. Although it
felt delightfully old-fashioned to cross the river by ringing a bell to
call the ferryman, it was still 2023 so he took Apple Pay.

<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_11_N_Chertsey_to_Windsor.gpx">[11/20] Chertsey

<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_14_N_Henley_on_Thames_to_Pangbourne.gpx">[14/20]
Henley-on-Thames to Pangbourne (30.9km)</a>: Around this time I grew a

short at Reading. The area around Reading was the last busy part of the
Thames Path.

<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_15_N_Pangbourne_to_Wallingford_and_Chorley_.gpx">[15/20]
Pangbourne to Wallingford (25.1km)</a>: I ran a lot of this on

Ridgeway</a> rather than the Thames Path. I originally plotted this
route with a plan to take a train back from Wallingford Station ‚Ä¶ only

from nearby Chorley.

a bus to Wallingford for the start of this one. The Thames Path crosses
the river at Benson Lock but at the time the footbridge was closed; a
ferry operated across the river instead. I suffered my worst hay fever
reaction ever towards the end of this run so my pace dropped completely
and I walked the last few kilometers back to Radley, where I then took a
train to Oxford and another back to London.

<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_17_N_Radley_to_Appleton_via_Oxford_.gpx">[17/20]
Radley to Appleton (31.4km)</a>: This section loops through Oxford, so
aside from colleges‚Äô dreaming spires you also see Port Meadow, The Trout
Inn (which features prominently in Philip Pullman‚Äôs <em>The Book of
Dust</em>), and the ruins of Godstow Abbey (which features prominently
in <em>Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again</em>). I‚Äôd argue these are the last
tourist attractions on the run: the remainder is all through countryside
and very small towns. I had virtually no service for the second half of
the run which made navigating back to Oxford a bit of a challenge; I
eventually walked to the A420 and got a local bus back.
</li>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_18_N_Bablock_Hythe_to_Lechlade.gpx">[18/20]
Bablock Hythe to Lechlade (33.1km)</a>: The Thames Path switches to the
opposite side of the river between Bablock Hythe and Appleton. I believe
<a href="https://theferrymaninn.co.uk">the pub at Bablock Hythe</a>
operates a ferry service, but at the time I was running it was closed. I
therefore took a taxi from Oxford to start this run. St John‚Äôs Lock is
the final (or first!) lock on the river, about a kilometer downstream
from Lechlade. At Lechlade I took a local bus to Swindon and trains back
from there.

For all the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire runs I took trains to or via
Swindon and then either local buses or taxis to reach towns or villages
on the Thames.

<ul>
<li>
<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_19_N_Lechlade_to_Cricklade.gpx">[19/20]
Lechlade to Cricklade (18.2km)</a>: Lechlade marks the end of the
‚Äúnavigable Thames‚Äù and aside from a few narrowboats anchored around
Lechlade; I only saw one more rowing boat on the rest of the river. This
was the quietest section: I only saw a handful of walkers and no other
runners.

<a href="/gpx/The_Thames_20_20_Cricklade_to_Thames_Head.gpx">[20/20]
Cricklade to Thames Head (22km)</a>: For the final leg through the
Cotswolds I didn‚Äôt push the pace at all. The Thames Path hugged the
river tightly but my route deviated slightly from it. The only challenge
I had was when I encountered a herd of cows that took a little too much
interest in me for my liking ‚Ä¶ the correct solution was <em>not</em> to
climb through a barbed wire fence but instead to walk around them
calmly, which I unfortunately learned the hard way.
</p>
<p>
By May the spring at Thames Head had dried up, but I instead found the
spring that was the current source of the Thames tucked away in some
woodland between the A433 and the A429. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing what
I did, which was to wade through the Thames (it was only a few
centimeters deep here!), cut myself on a whole bunch of brambles, and
then get stung by a bunch of stinging nettles to find it. But on the
other hand there was no chance I was going to run 400km and <em>not</em>
find the start.
</p>
<p>
I continued on to Thames Head, the traditional start of the river and of
the Thames Path. There I met a friendly group of walkers and runners,
most of whom were about to set off down the path in the opposite
direction. I considered getting a pint in at the Thames Head Inn nearby,
but instead opted to avoid train delays and cancellations so I caught
the train back to London from Kemble.

<p>
The final obvious question: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ A break?! The lesson from
this project has been that I don‚Äôt mind travel for runs, just so long as
the travel doesn‚Äôt take significantly more time than the run itself.
That said, I‚Äôve definitely got a couple more daft projects in the
pipeline‚Ä¶

I were desiging a system to compete with Twitter, I‚Äôd implement a
one-click Block button. It should be as easy to block someone as it is
to follow them. It would make a statement to trolls and users alike. To
users it would say that blocking is a common thing, don‚Äôt think about it
too much, and certainly don‚Äôt be intimidated into not doing it. It must
be almost as easy to undo. A command to review the list of recent
blocks. Facebook comes closest to this. It is very easy to block an
account but not quite this easy. I think they‚Äôre probably heading
there.</p>

<p>Today the Knicks play a game 7 vs the Indiana team at the Garden. If
the Knicks win, they go on to the next round vs the Celtics, starting on
Tuesday. If they lose, we relax for four months or so, when it

feel that way, but that‚Äôs how I feel right now. During the game, if
we‚Äôre losing, based on recent experience I won‚Äôt like that so much.

<h2 id="borg-backups">25. Borg backups</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-19, from: Blair‚Äôs Science Desk</p>
<p>I haven‚Äôt posted here in a while! Today, I thought I‚Äôd get back in
the habit by posting my Borg backup script. Borg is a command-line
backup app written in Python. It‚Äôs blazing fast and features great
de-duplication. To get started with Borg, follow the installation
instructions here. Then, initialize a backup with this command: borg
init /path/to/backup Here‚Äôs my backup script. First we make a backup of
my /home directory:</p>
