Truth 42: Using our $$$ to beat a DEAD Horse!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-25, updated: 2024-04-25, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>THE TRUTH of the matter is most adults have heard of the wisdom in
“beating a dead horse or throwing good money after bad,” which is what
WE the People continue experiencing with the IPI fiasco! Like most
citizens I KNOW that gambling is NOT the direction we should be pursuing
ever since it surfaced under the leadership of the late Most Reverend
Bishop Thomas Camacho’s teachings. I was honored &amp; glad to have
helped him fight against the casino and I was even more glad to see the
Chinese Government ordering the dismantling of IPI’s mother company and
their previous statement that “the Chinese Government was NOT going to
allow their citizens to travel to the CNMI for the purpose of
gambling.”   Now if I’m missing something, I hope someone will speak up
and rectify what I see as pure political &amp; economic dichotomies
(contradictions) with IPI determined to continue with a casino and the
Chinese Government is virtually saying NO!  The question is WHAT is our
government going to do and I pray not to just sit, watch &amp; wait for
someone in China to decide our fate for us AGAIN! When are WE going to
be the Masters-of-our-economic-fate, which is what we teach children to
do in school — duh!!!</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-24, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Google recently made headlines globally because its chatbot Gemini generated images of people of color instead of white people in historical settings that featured white people. Adobe Firefly&amp;#8217;s image creation tool saw similar issues. This led some commentators to complain that AI had gone &amp;#8220;woke.&amp;#8221; Others suggested these issues resulted from faulty efforts to fight AI bias and better serve a global audience.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>“NO good deed goes unpunished.” This idiom conveys the idea even when
we do something with the best of intentions, it doesn’t always guarantee
that the outcome will be positive. Despite initial efforts to do good
the recipients of the good intentions may find themselves facing
unanticipated challenges, resentment or ingratitude. This is certainly
true of the disaster grants awarded to the CNMI by the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Economic Development Administration, Seattle Regional
Office.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Joe Biden famously ran a basement campaign during his successful 2020 presidential bid. But he emerged to participate in two debates with his opponent, Donald Trump. Will he agree to share the stage this fall? He&amp;#8217;d better.&lt;/p&gt;

For that accomplishment, this is her &amp;#8220;reward&amp;#8221;: having the traditional valedictory speech canceled at the May 10 commencement over concerns about maintaining &amp;#8220;security and safety.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The phrase, &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t waste a crisis,&amp;#8221; has almost become a cliche, and we use it in reference to many things, especially economic crises. Indeed, when we experience a crisis, we should always learn what we can from it in the hopes of not experiencing it again. Experiencing a medical crisis often leads us to pay greater attention to our health. An economic crisis may lead us to make better decisions about spending and saving.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The 49 Senate Republicans spent Wednesday afternoon furiously sputtering that they weren&amp;#8217;t allowed to debate if Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security, duly and formally impeached by the House, should be tried in the upper chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Dodging four men pushing a cart full of honeydew melons, I step out of the noisy traffic of Istanbul, pass through the horseshoe-arched door, and trade one commotion for another. Suddenly the air &amp;#8212; heated by millions of watts of electric bulbs &amp;#8212; is several degrees warmer. Like carnivorous flowers, merchants seduce from glittering shops. They say &amp;#8220;Welcome to the Grand Bazaar.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
