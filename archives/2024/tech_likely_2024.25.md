## On “What Money Can’t Buy”

date: 2024-06-19, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I finished listening to the audio version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sandel">Michael Sandel</a>’s “<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/sandel/publications/what-money-cant-buy-moral-limits-markets">What Money Can’t Buy</a>” a few days ago. Great book, I hated every second of it. The topic is very interesting but most of the concepts and examples were infuriating. The book touches on pretty much everything I hate about the current state of the world when it comes to its relationship with money and advertising. Still, was good company on a few long road trips and I love when the audiobooks are narrated by the author. Thanks for suggesting the book <a href="https://johnjago.com">John</a>!</p>                <hr>

Technical note. I made a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/19/datesoff.png">mistake</a> in converting local time to GMT in the code that builds the feed. My times were off by four hours. So I corrected them. And now instead of three items in the feed, according to my own feed software, there are now six. I bet all the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298">other</a> systems will do the same thing because the guid is a function of the creation date of the item, and they changed. Oh well. At least the <a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">RSS version</a> only has three items. I think I should change how the guid works.

## The next patriotic kitten

date: 2024-06-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I loved being my own DJ with Napster, and none of the execs or journalists figured out that this was the appeal of getting all the music out from behind the incredibly obsolete and brutal paywall that the music industry had concocted. They didn't give a shit about the users except they wanted our money, there was no love in the connection between the creativity of the artists and the creativity of the users. We supposedly didn't have any. </p>
<p>I'm like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Chapman">Emmett Chapman</a>, an accomplished musician who created a new kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Stick">musicial instrument</a> for himself and others to use. That's what I do with software. I play the tools I make. But what I really get off on is the music the users make. I was thinking about my father yesterday, it would have been his 95th birthday. He died at 80, so there's been plenty of time to process his life as I knew it. The best connection he and I had was silent. I inherited my love for outliners from him, yet that love was latent probably for hundreds of generations in our family. I had the skill and creativity to create such a tool, and finally the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">technology</a> existed, and he let his son turn his mind upside down and inside out. For that he would say Every day is Father's Day. That may be my greatest accomplishment.</p>
<p>I was chatting with my brother yesterday, ChatGPT came up, and I thought (and said) I bet dad would have loved ChatGPT. Then I thought of our uncle Ken, on my mother's side, and said he would have shit his pants over ChatGPT. Ken spent literally hours every day with the meager reference tools he owned in his off the grid cottage near St Augustine. The way I love ChatGPT is the way he would have loved it. I'm absolutely sure of it. My paternal grandfather would have loved it, and I expect my great uncle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt">Arno</a> who was a pioneer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">zettlekasten</a> would have also lost his shit over ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the art of a user of ChatGPT (which really needs a shorter name). People's first reaction is that by creating art with ChatGPT I'm stealing. Bollocks. I'm creating. I'm not even going to validate that with a rebuttal. I am proving it with the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Patriotic+Kitten%22">Patriotic Kitten</a> thread, the next of which I will now entertain you with. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/19/patrioticKitten2.png"></center>The second patriotic kitten. </div></p>

## The FeedLand stack

date: 2024-06-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>One of the cool things about the way I designed FeedLand internally is that there are various levels of feed stuff. If you want to start over at any level, you can, and today I'm doing exactly that. But first here's the stack:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the lowest level is the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/reallysimple">reallysimple package</a>, which reads any feed and returns a consistent JavaScript object, so the database code only ever sees one kind of feed. All the differences between RSS and Atom are flattened, and features from the source <a href="https://source.scripting.com/">namespace</a> are included, where they are present.  </li>
<li>Above that level is the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedlanddatabase">feedlanddatabase package</a>, which has a Node API that does all the stuff with the SQL database that FeedLand runs off. So if all you want to do is add feeds, subscribe to them, add a user, subscribe to a reading list, build a river, all that stuff is at this level. This is the level at which I'm going to start building today.</li>
<li>Next level up is the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedland">feedland package</a>, which implements the REST interface, and handles all the runtime stuff that the FeedLand client needs.</li>
<li>And the final level is the one the user interacts with, it runs in the browser, and makes the REST calls to the feedland server. All the rendering of the objects coming out of the database via the REST interface happens here.  </li>
</ol>
<p>In an <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/16.html#a112207">application</a> I'm working on, I found myself reimplementing features of FeedLand, and I stopped myself and said, nooooo use the API that's already there. The advantages are many, including I will be able to use FeedLand to manage the data structures. So that's what I'm doing. Wish me luck.</p>

## DeepComputing announces third-party RISC-V mainboard for the Framework 13 laptop

date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News

Framework, the company making modular, upgradeable, and repairable laptops, and DeepComputing, the same company that&#8217;s making the DC ROMA II RISC-V laptop we talked about last week, have announced something incredibly cool: a brand new RISC-V mainboard that fits right into existing Framework 13 laptops. Sporting a RISC-V StarFive JH7110 SoC, this groundbreaking Mainboard was independently designed and developed by DeepComputing. It’s the main component of the very first RISC-V laptop to run Canonical’s Ubuntu Desktop and Server, and the Fedora Desktop OS and represents the first independently developed Mainboard for a Framework Laptop. ↫ The DeepComputing website For a company that was predicted to fail by a popular Apple spokesperson, it seems Framework is doing remarkably well. This new mainboard is the first one not made by Framework itself, and is the clearest validation yet of the concept put into the market by the Framework team. I can&#8217;t recall the last time you could buy a laptop powered by one architecture, and then upgrade to an entirely different architecture down the line, just by replacing the mainboard. The news of this RISC-V mainboard has made me dream of other possibilities &#8211; like someone crazy enough to design, I don&#8217;t know, a POWER10 or POWER11 mainboard? Entirely impossible and unlikely due to heat constraints, but one may dream, right?

## Update on Newton, the Wayland-native accessibility project

date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News

There&#8217;s incredibly good news for people who use accessibility tools on Linux, but who were facing serious, gamebreaking problems when trying to use Wayland. Matt Campbell, of the GNOME accessibility team, has been hard at work on an entirely new accessibility architecture for modern free desktops, and he&#8217;s got some impressive results to show for it already. I’ve now implemented enough of the new architecture that Orca is basically usable on Wayland with some real GTK 4 apps, including Nautilus, Text Editor, Podcasts, and the Fractal client for Matrix. Orca keyboard commands and keyboard learn mode work, with either Caps Lock or Insert as the Orca modifier. Mouse review also works more or less. Flat review is also working. The Orca command to left-click the current flat review item works for standard GTK 4 widgets. ↫ Matt Campbell One of the major goals of the project was to enable such accessibility support for Flatpak applications without having to pass an exception for the AT-SPI bus. what this means is that the new accessibility architecture can run as part of a Flatpak application without having to break out of their sandbox, which is obviously a hugely important feature to implement. There&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done, though. Something like the GNOME shell doesn&#8217;t yet support Newton, of course, so that&#8217;s still using the older, much slower AT-SPI bus. Wayland also doesn&#8217;t support mouse synthesizing yet, things like font, size, style, and colour aren&#8217;t exposed yet, and there&#8217;s a many more limitations due to this being such a new project. The project also isn&#8217;t trying to be GNOME-specific; Campbell wants to work with the other desktops to eventually end up with an accessibility architecture that is truly cross-desktop. The blog post further goes into great detail about implementation details, current and possible future shortcomings, and a lot more.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I'm highly motivated to support the newly released Threads API, but a quick look indicates that it's a fairly large project. All I want to do is cross-post, along with Masto and Bluesky. I did both those a loooong time ago. But I really want my links to go to threads, and also create a thread-writer for it like the one I did for Twitter and Bluesky. There's no shortage of really interesting projects now, so I think I'm going to have to wait to do this for a while. If anyone makes a really simple Hello World for Threads for Node.js that would make my day. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## KDE Plasma 6.1 released

date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News

After the very successful release of KDE Plasma 6.0, which moved the entire desktop environment and most of its applications over to Qt 6, fixed a whole slow of bugs, and streamlined the entire KDE desktop and its applications, it&#8217;s now time for KDE Plasma 6.1, where we&#8217;re going to see a much stronger focus on new features. While it&#8217;s merely a point release, it&#8217;s still a big one. The tentpole new feature of Plasma 6.1 is access to remote Plasma desktops. You can go into Settings and log into any Plasma desktop, which is built entirely and directly into KDE&#8217;s own Wayland compositor, avoiding the use of third party applications of hacky extensions to X.org. Having such remote access built right into the desktop environment and its compositor itself is a much cleaner implementation than in the before time with X. Another feature that worked just fine under X but was still missing from KDE Plasma on Wayland is something they now call &#8220;persistent applications&#8221; &#8211; basically, KDE will now remember which windows you had open when you closed KDE or shut down your computer, and open them back up right where you left off when you log back in. It&#8217;s one of those things that got lost in the transition to Wayland, and having it back is really, really welcome. Speaking of Wayland, KDE Plasma 6.1 also introduces two major new rendering features. Explicit sync removes flickering and glitches most commonly seen on NVIDIA hardware, while triple buffering provides smoother animations and screen rendering. There&#8217;s more here, too, such as a completely reworked edit desktop view, support for controlling keyboard LED backlighting traditionally found in gaming laptops, and more. KDE Plasma 6.1 will find its way to your distribution of choice soon enough, but of course, you can compile and install it yourself, too.

## The history of DR-DOS

date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve always found the world of DOS versions and variants to be confusing, since most of it took place when I was very young (I&#8217;m from 1984) so I wasn&#8217;t paying much attention to computing quite yet, other than playing DOS games. One of the variants of DOS I never quite understood where it was from until much, much later, was DR-DOS. To this day, I pronounce this as &#8220;Doctor DOS&#8221;. If you&#8217;re also a little unclear on what, exactly, DR-DOS was,&#160;Bradford Morgan White has an excellent article detailing the origins and history of DR-DOS, making it very easy to get up to speed and expand your knowledge on DOS, which is surely a very marketable skill in the days of Electron and Electron for Developers. DR DOS was a great product. It was superior to other DOS versions in many ways, and it is certainly possible that it could have been more successful were it not for Microsoft Windows having been so wildly successful. Starting with Windows 95, the majority of computer users simply didn’t much care about which DOS loaded Windows so long as it worked. There’s quite a bit of lore regarding legal battles and copyrights surrounding CP/M and DOS involving Microsoft and Digital Research. This has been covered in previous articles to some extent, but I am not really certain how much would have changed had Microsoft and Digital Research got on. Gates and Kildall had been quite friendly at one point, and we know that the two mutually chose not to work together due to differences in business practices and beliefs. Kildall chose to be quite a bit more friendly and less competitive while Gates very much chose to be competitive and at times a bit ruthless. Additionally, Kildall sold DRI rather than continue the fight, and DRI had never really attempted to combine DR DOS with GEM as a cohesive product to fight Windows before Windows became the ultimate ruler of the OS market following Windows 3.1’s release. Still, it was an absolutely brilliant product and part of me will always feel that it ought to have won. ↫ Bradford Morgan White I can definitely imagine an alternative timeline in which Digital Research managed to combine DR-DOS with GEM in a more attractive way, stealing Microsoft&#8217;s thunder before Gates&#8217; balls got rolling properly with Windows 3.x. It&#8217;s one of the many, many what-ifs in this sector, but not one you often hear or read about.

## Adobe’s hidden cancellation fee is unlawful, FTC suit says

date: 2024-06-18, from: OS News

To lock subscribers into recurring monthly payments, Adobe would typically pre-select by default its most popular &#8220;annual paid monthly&#8221; plan, the FTC alleged. That subscription option locked users into an annual plan despite paying month to month. If they canceled after a two-week period, they&#8217;d owe Adobe an early termination fee (ETF) that costs 50 percent of their remaining annual subscription. The &#8220;material terms&#8221; of this fee are hidden during enrollment, the FTC claimed, only appearing in &#8220;disclosures that are designed to go unnoticed and that most consumers never see.&#8221; ↫ Ashley Belanger at Ars Technica There&#8217;s a sucker for every corporation, but I highly doubt there&#8217;s anyone out there who would consider this a fair business practice. This is so obviously designed to hide costs during sign-up, and then unveil them when the user considers quitting. If this is deemed legal or allowed, you can expect everyone to jump on this bandwagon to scam users out of their money. It goes further than this, though. According to the FTC, Adobe knew this practice was shady, but continued it anyway because altering it would negatively affect the bottom line. The FTC is actually targeting two Adobe executives directly, which is always nice to hear &#8211; it&#8217;s usually management that pushes such illegal practices through, leaving the lower ranks little choice but to comply or lose their job. Stuff like this is exactly why confidence in the major technology companies is at an all-time low.

## Cinnamon 6.2 released

date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News

Cinnamon, the popular GTK desktop environment developed by the Linux Mint project, pushed out Cinnamon 6.2 today, which will serve as the default desktop for Linux Mint 22. It&#8217;s a relatively minor release, but it does contain a major new feature which is actually quite welcome: a new GTK frontend for GNOME Online Accounts, part of the XApp project. This makes it possible to use the excellent GNOME Online Accounts framework, without having to resort to a GNOME application &#8211; and will come in very handy on other GTK desktops, too, like Xfce. The remainder of the changes consist of a slew of bugfixes, small new features, and nips and tucks here and there. Wayland support is still an in-progress effort for Cinnamon, so you&#8217;ll be stuck with X for now.

Pretty neat. For the rest, it&#8217;s small changes and bug fixes for this venerable window manager.

## Meta halts plans to train machine learning on Facebook, Instagram posts in EU

date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News

It seems that if you want to steer clear from having Facebook use your Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. data for machine learning training, you might want to consider moving to the European Union. Meta has apparently paused plans to process mounds of user data to bring new AI experiences to Europe. The decision comes after data regulators rebuffed the tech giant&#8217;s claims that it had &#8220;legitimate interests&#8221; in processing European Union- and European Economic Area (EEA)-based Facebook and Instagram users&#8217; data—including personal posts and pictures—to train future AI tools. ↫ Ashley Belanger These are just the opening salvos of the legal war that&#8217;s brewing here, so who knows how it&#8217;s going to turn out. For now, though, European Union Facebook users are safe from Facebook&#8217;s machine learning training.

## Vinix now runs Solitaire

date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News

Way, way back in the cold and bleak days of 2021, I mentioned Vinix on OSNews, an operating system written in the V programming language. A few days ago, over on Mastodon, the official account for the V programming language sent out a screenshot showing Solitaite running on Vinix, showing off what the experimental operating system can do. The project doesn&#8217;t seem to really publish any changelogs or release notes, so it&#8217;s difficult to figure out what, exactly, is going on at the moment. The roadmap indicates they&#8217;ve already got a solid base going to work from, such as mlibc, bash, GCC/G++, X and an X window manager, and more &#8211; with things like Wayland, networking, and more on the roadmap.

## Microsoft starts beating the Windows 11 PR drum in face of reluctant Windows 10 users

date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News

I have a feeling Microsoft is really starting to feel some pressure about its plans to abandon Windows 10 next year. Data shows that 70% of Windows users are still using Windows 10, and this percentage has proven to be remarkably resilient, making it very likely that hundreds of millions of Windows users will be out of regular, mainstream support and security patches next year. It seems Microsoft is, therefore, turning up the PR campaign, this time by publishing a blog post about myths and misconceptions about Windows 11. The kind of supposed myths and misconceptions Microsoft details are exactly the kind of stuff corporations with large deployments worry about at night. For instance, Microsoft repeatedly bangs the drum on application compatibility, stating that despite the change in number &#8211; 10 to 11 &#8211; Windows 11 is built on the same base as its predecessor, and as such, touts 99.7% application compatibility. Furthermore, Microsoft adds that if businesses to suffer from an incompatibility, they can use something call App Assure &#8211; which I will intentionally mispronounce until the day I die because I&#8217;m apparently a child &#8211; to fix any issues. Apparently, the visual changes to the user interface in Windows 11 are also a cause of concern for businesses, as Microsoft dedicated an entire entry to this, citing a study that the visual changes do not negatively impact productivity. The blog post then goes on to explain how the changes are actually really great and enhance productivity &#8211; you know, the usual PR speak. There&#8217;s more in the blog post, and I have a feeling we&#8217;ll be seeing more and more of this kind of PR offensive as the cut-off date for Windows 10 support nears. Windows 10 users will probably also see more and more Windows 11 ads when using their computers, too, urging them to upgrade even when they very well cannot because of missing TPMs or unsupported processors. I don&#8217;t think any of these things will work to bring that 70% number down much over the next 12 months, and that&#8217;s a big problem for Microsoft. I&#8217;m not going to make any predictions, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Microsoft will simply be forced by, well, reality to extend the official support for Windows 10 well beyond 2025. Especially with all the recent investigations into Microsoft&#8217;s shoddy internal security culture, there&#8217;s just no way they can cut 70% of their users off from security updates and patches.

## Mobile comms via satellite for backcountry and maritime safety

date: 2024-06-17, from: OS News

Stranded on a desert island; lost in the forest; stuck in the snow; injured and unable to get back to civilization. Human beings have used their ingenuity for millennia to try to signal for rescue. there&#8217;s been a progression of technological innovations: smoke signals, mirrors, a loud whistle, a portable radio, a mobile phone. With each invention, it&#8217;s been possible to venture a little farther from populated areas and still have peace of mind about being able to call for help. But once you get past the range of a terrestrial radio tower, whether it&#8217;s into the wilderness or out at sea, it starts to get more complicated and expensive to be able to call for rescue. In the next year or so, it&#8217;s going to become a lot simpler and less expensive. Probably enough to become ubiquitous. Hardware infrastructure is already in place, and the relevant software and service support is rolling out now. It&#8217;s been possible for decades for adventurers to keep in contact via satellite. The first commercial maritime satellite communications was launched in 1976. Globalstar and Iridium launched in the late 90s and drove down the device size and service cost of satellite phones. However, the service was a lot more expensive than cellular phone service, and not enough people were willing to pay for remote comms to be able to overcome the massive infrastructure costs, and both companies went bankrupt. Their investors lost their money, but the satellites still worked, so once the bankruptcies were hashed out they fulfilled their promise, as least technologically. On a parallel track, in the late 1980s International Cospas-Sarsat Programme was set up to develop a system for satellite aided search and rescue system that detects and locates emergency beacons activated by aircraft, ships and people engaged in recreational activities in remote areas, and then sends these distress alerts to search-and-rescue (SAR) authorities. Many types of beacons are available, and nowadays they send exact GPS coordinates along with the call for rescue. In the 2010s, the Satellite Emergency Notification Device or SEND device was brought to market. These are portable beacons that connect to the Globalstar and Iridium networks and allow people in remote areas not only to call for help in emergencies, but also to communicate via text messaging. Currently the two most popular SEND devices are the Garmin inReach Mini 2 and the Spot X. These devices cost $400 and $250 USD respectively, and require monthly service fees of $12-40. For someone undertaking a long and dangerous expedition into the backcountry, these are very reasonable costs, especially for someone who does it often. But for most people, it&#8217;s just not practical to pay for and carry a device like that &#8220;just in case.&#8221; In 2022, the iPhone 14 included a feature that was the first step in taking satellite-based communication into the mainstream. It allows iPhone users to share their location via Find My feature with new radio hardware that connects to the Globalstar service. So if you&#8217;re out adventuring, your friends can keep track of where you are. And if there&#8217;s an emergency, you can make an emergency SOS. It&#8217;s not just a generic Mayday: you can text specific details about your emergency and it will be transmitted to the local authorities. You can also choose to notify your personal emergency contacts. Last week, at WWDC, Apple announced the next stage: in iOS 18, iMessage users will be able to send text messages over satellite, using the same Globalstar network as its SOS features. Initially at least, this feature is expected to be free. With this expansion, iPhone users will have the basic functionality of a SPOT or inReach device, without special hardware or a monthly fee. SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink, which first offered service in 2021, has much higher bandwidth and lower latency than the Globalstar and Iridium networks. Starlink&#8217;s current offering requires a dinner plate sized antenna and conventional networking hardware to enable high bandwidth mobile internet. It&#8217;s great for a vehicle, but impractical for a backpacker. However, SpaceX has announced 2nd generation satellites that can connect to 1900MHz spectrum mobile phone radios, and T-Mobile has announced that it will be enabling the service for its customers in late 2024, and Apple, Google, and Samsung devices are confirmed to be supported. Initially, like Apple&#8217;s service, this will be restricted to text messaging and other low-bandwidth applications. Phone calls and higher bandwidth internet connectivity are promised in 2025. The other two big US carriers, AT&#38;T and Verizon, have announced they will be partnering with a competing service, AST SpaceMobile, but it&#8217;s unlikely those plans will come to fruition very soon. Mobile phone users outside the US will also need to wait. Apple&#8217;s Message via satellite is only announced for US users, as is T-Mobile&#8217;s offering. So if you&#8217;re in the US, and have an iPhone, or are a T-Mobile subscriber with an Apple, Samsung, or Google device, you&#8217;ll soon be able to point your phone at the sky, even in remote areas, to call for help, give your friends an update on your expedition, or just stay in touch. Pretty soon, Tom Hanks won&#8217;t have to make friends with a volleyball when he crash lands on a deserted island, at least not until his battery dies.

## Twenty years ago today

date: 2024-06-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I was talking with a friend over the weekend about the origins of podcasting, and how, in June of 2004, I finally decided to do an audio post, to get my feet wet, and to prove all you needed was a laptop and a little software and you could be doing radio almost as easily as writing a blog post. </p>
<p>That was <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/06/11.html#When:9:13:45AM">June 11, 2004</a>. </p>
<p>Then it hit me, it's June <i>2024</i> now, it's been <i>twenty freaking years</i>. </p>
<p>In hindsight, that podcast was the start of the bootstrap that saw a dozen shows by September and then hundreds and thousands, and now here we are, podcasting has been through quite a few bursts of growth and it's still as open as it was back in June 2004. </p>
<p><b>Anyone with a laptop can do a podcast</b>. That was the goal. You don't need anyone's permission. That was a breakthrough in radio. Prior to that, you had to get a lot of approval, and every step made it less real and less interesting, imho. </p>
<p>My partner in this at the time was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Adam+Curry">Adam Curry</a>. Sometime in that period he started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Source_Code">The Daily Source Code</a>, and then we did a podcast together for a few months called <a href="http://secrets.scripting.com/">Trade Secrets</a>. My own podcast was called <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning Coffee Notes</a>. </p>
<p>So I thought, why not do a Serial-like podcast over the next few months, with the actual programs from 2004, along with the Trade Secrets shows. I think I have them all archived. And it would be great if Adam did the same with his shows, starting when they started. And Dawn & Drew, Dave Slusher. This can go on forever if you like. (I promise mine won't.)</p>
<p>So here's the URL for the podcast.</p>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml</a></p>
<p>I'm sure there will be a lot of cringeworthy moments, but what the heck. I'll hopefully have the feed up before the end of the day, and I'll register it with Apple so will hopefully be transcripts. </p>
<p>I hope I can count on you to spread the word, this is how the podcasting bootstrap happened. If you want to learn how two weird geek hippie types like Adam and myself, can have an idea, and then by constantly trying out new approaches, eventually it sticks and becomes a new medium that's still thriving twenty years later. </p>
<p>It should be quite a story! :-)</p>
<p>Here's a picture of myself and Adam at Gnomedex in the summer of 2004. And that's the laptop I used to make all these podcasts. I was living in Seattle at the time. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/17/gnomedexDaveAdam.png"></center>Dave and Adam at Gnomedex in 2004.</div></p>

## 2024-06-15 Old tech: UUCP

date: 2024-06-17, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-15-old-tech-uucp">2024-06-15 Old tech: UUCP</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.sdfeu.org/@lkh" title="@lkh@social.sdfeu.org">@lkh</a>, <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp">@kyonshi</a> and I have been trying to connect our servers using old tech for quite a while.</p>

<h2 id="uucp">UUCP</h2>

<p>The latest effort has been in connecting our servers using <em>Unix to Unix copy</em> (UUCP).
The benefit is that once you have that, you can also have <em>remote command execution over UUCP</em> using <code>uux</code> and it is as terrifying as it sounds.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see whether I can reconstruct my setup.</p>

<p>I use Debian.</p>

<p>lkh has a &ldquo;travelling laptop&rdquo; that is mostly offline, but sometimes it&rsquo;s online. That&rsquo;s when he wants to exchange stuff with us.
The laptop is called Dwalin.</p>

<p>My server is Campaign Wiki.</p>

<p>The documentation for peering between news servers via UUCP is available via <code>man 8 send-uucp</code>.</p>

<h3 id="var-spool-uucp-ssh-authorized-keys">/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys</h3>

<p>This allows Dwalin to connect via ssh.</p>

<p>lkh sent me this.</p>

<pre><code># dwalins public key, ssh executes the remote
# uucico and hands over my login:
restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Udwalin -l&quot; ssh-rsa another-long-string-of-stuff uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-uucp-passwd">/etc/uucp/passwd</h3>

<p>This is where Dwalin&rsquo;s password is stored. This is important because there&rsquo;s no actual Dwalin user on my system.</p>

<p>lkh sent me this.</p>

<pre><code># dwalins login on campaignwiki
Udwalin	some-long-string-of-stuff
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-sys">/etc/sys</h3>

<p>I kept the defaults and added Dwalin.</p>

<pre><code># dwalins system entry, no Port or
# credentials are given, since dwalin
# is expected to always call in.
system dwalin
called-login Udwalin
local-send /
local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
time any
forward ANY
protocol i
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-uucp-config">/etc/uucp/config</h3>

<p>This is where I set my own node name.</p>

<p>lkh sent me some spool related entries. I&rsquo;m not sure whether I needed them.</p>

<pre><code>nodename campaignwiki

spool     /var/spool/uucp
pubdir    /var/spool/uucppublic
lockdir   /var/spool/uucp/Lock
logfile   /var/spool/uucp/Log     # The UUCP log file
statfile  /var/spool/uucp/Stats   # The UUCP statistics file
debugfile /var/spool/uucp/Debug   # The UUCP debugging file
</code></pre>

<h3 id="testing-it">Testing it</h3>

<p>In our case, lkh&rsquo;s Dwalin is connected to kyonshi&rsquo;s Erebor system and here&rsquo;s me sending a file to Erebor via Dwalin (since I&rsquo;m not connected to Erebor directly):</p>

<pre><code>uucp some-local-file 'dwalin!ereborbbs.duckdns.org!~/'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="news">News</h2>

<p>Yes, we want to exchange news. That means we need to install INN.</p>

<p>Look at the requisites:</p>

<pre><code>perldoc /usr/lib/news/bin/send-uucp.pl
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-news-send-uucp-cf">/etc/news/send-uucp.cf</h3>

<p>This define the sites to send news to, how to compress them and how big the batches should be.</p>

<p>Add the following:</p>

<pre><code>dwalin      gzip        1048576
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-news-newsfeeds">/etc/news/newsfeeds</h3>

<p>Determine the newsgroups to send to Dwalin:</p>

<pre><code># newsfeed entry for dwalin
dwalin\
    :casa.*,campaignwiki.*,erebor.*\
    :Tf,Wnb,B4096/1024:
</code></pre>

<h3 id="var-lib-news-active">/var/lib/news/active</h3>

<p>Add the new newsgroups. We don&rsquo;t do control messages.</p>

<p>Use <code>ctlinnd</code> to control the INN daemon.</p>

<pre><code>ctlinnd newgroup erebor.talk y
ctlinnd newgroup erebor.test y
</code></pre>

<h3 id="var-lib-news-newsgroups">/var/lib/news/newsgroups</h3>

<p>Give the new newsgroups a tag line.</p>

<p>Add the following:</p>

<pre><code>erebor.talk             General talk for EreborBBS
erebor.test             Testing connectivity with EreborBBS
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-news-readers-conf">/etc/news/readers.conf</h3>

<p>Make sure the users connecting via NNTP can read the new groups, too.
This is not necessary if you read news via the local spool, I think.</p>

<p>Add <code>erebor.*</code> to the &ldquo;readonly&rdquo; section.</p>

<pre><code>auth &quot;foreignokay&quot; {
    auth: &quot;ckpasswd -f /var/lib/news/newsusers&quot;
    default: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
}

access &quot;authenticatedpeople&quot; {
    users: &quot;*&quot;
    newsgroups: &quot;*,!junk,!control,!control.*&quot;
}

access &quot;readonly&quot; {
    users: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
    read: &quot;local.*,campaignwiki.*,casa.*,cosmic.*,erebor.*,rec.*,de.*,alt.*&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="e-mail">E-Mail</h2>

<p>Oh yes, we do.</p>

<p>Debian comes with Exim. Exim uses Perl&rsquo;s &ldquo;taint&rdquo; mechanism wherein user-supplied values cannot be used for commands. They must be untainted by a lookup. For example, a user supplied sender name like &ldquo;alex&rdquo; is tainted, but if you look it up in <code>/etc/passwd</code> it becomes untainted. Perl keeps track of this for you, if you want to. Once you run into the error, however, you need to figure out where you could be looking up the values you have. Is the local part a user on the system, is the domain a local domain? I spent way too much time on this.</p>

<h3 id="etc-exim4-update-exim4-conf-conf">/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf</h3>

<p>A new router for UUCP mail that has to come before <code>200_exim4-config_primary</code>.
If it comes after the primary, then it won&rsquo;t work because the primary router ends with <code>no_more</code>
and as the comment at the end of the file says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <code>no_more</code> above means that all later routers are for domains in the local_domains list</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This router only accepts mail destined for domains listed in the new file <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>.</p>

<pre><code>### uucp      
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

uucp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: uucp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver=accept
    require_files = +/usr/bin/uux
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/uucp
    transport = rsmtp
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-exim4-uucp">/etc/exim4/uucp</h3>

<p>This is a file that translates the domain names I use for recipients to UUCP names.</p>

<p>It only works for Dwalin:</p>

<pre><code>dwalin	dwalin
</code></pre>

<p>This means that a mail for <code>lkh@dwalin</code> gets recognised as such (because of the first column) and it will be sent to the UUCP system <code>dwalin</code> (because of the second column).</p>

<p>The UUCP system <code>dwalin</code> is correct because <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> has a section for <code>system dwalin</code> (see above).</p>

<h3 id="etc-exim-conf-d-transport-40-exim4-config-uucp">/etc/exim/conf.d/transport/40_exim4-config_uucp</h3>

<p>The route above says that the transport to use is <code>rsmtp</code>.</p>

<p>Define this using a new transport config file:</p>

<pre><code>### uucp
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

rsmtp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: rsmtp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver=pipe
    command = /usr/bin/uux - -r -a${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}} -gC $domain_data!rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 100
</code></pre>

<p>This was the biggest problem for me. The examples I saw for the <code>-a</code> argument to <code>uux</code> used <code>$sender_address</code>, resulting in an error about the third argument to <code>uux</code> being tainted. You can see these error messages in the exim main log (followed by a log entry showing that exim sends me a en error message):</p>

<pre><code>2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBd-26 &lt;= alex@alexschroeder.ch U=alex P=local S=461

</code></pre>

<p>I guess the examples I had seen would only work for older Exim versions that didn&rsquo;t do taint checking.</p>

<p>The code I&rsquo;m using means that I&rsquo;m looking up the sender local part (&ldquo;alex&rdquo; or &ldquo;root&rdquo;) in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and if a match is found, the untainted key is returned (instead of the value from the password list).</p>

<p>You can test these expressions on the command-line:</p>

<pre><code>exim -d+all -be '${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}'
</code></pre>

<h3 id="testing-it-2">Testing it</h3>

<p>As an ordinary user, use <code>mail</code> on the command line to send mail to <code>lkh@dwalin</code>.</p>

<p>Poor <code>lkh</code>. So many test mails.</p>

<p>As <code>root</code>, check the exim log:</p>

<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus:~# tail /var/log/exim4/mainlog
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a mail being enqueued successfully:</p>

## Peter Easthope opened issue #141: SystemTools module. at Felix Oliver Friedrich / Oberon A2

date: 2024-06-16, updated: 2024-06-16, from: Oberon A2 at CAS


<p dir="auto">Hi,<br/>
The Oberon subsystem opens in revision.10272 but the &lt;delete&gt; key doesn&#39;t delete, &lt;F1&gt; doesn&#39;t set the star and &lt;F2&gt; doesn&#39;t clear marks.  HotKeys has preempted the familiar Oberon key functionalities?</p>
<p dir="auto">I found a note that &lt;F12&gt; should disable or toggle HotKeys.  In 10272 &lt;F12&gt; gives a report in the log that a SystemTools command doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p dir="auto">SystemTools was omitted inadvertently?</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks,               ... Peter E.</p>

## Blocking bots

date: 2024-06-16, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>The other day I was emailing with <a href="https://starbreaker.org/">Matthew “Starbreaker” Graybosch</a> about his recent post titled <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/robots-txt-nuclear-option/index.html">“robots.txt: the Nuclear Option”</a>. If you’re a regular reader of this site you know I love this kind of stuff and I especially love nuclear options when it comes to fighting silly tech.</p>
<p>I experimented with blocking everything in the past but this recent exchange made me want to revisit this idea. With perfect timing, Robb Knight posted <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/">“Perplexity AI Is Lying about Their User Agent”</a> and that was all the extra motivation I needed to join the fun.</p>
<p>I already had a 403 in place for Mastodon because I don’t want to get a shit ton of traffic coming my way every time someone posts a link of mine but I loved Matthew’s idea of returning a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/402">402</a>.</p>
<p>So I grabbed 180 or so entries from the <a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents">Dark Visitors’s agents list</a> and set up an NGINX redirect based on those UA. Gonna be interesting to see if this has any effect on the server so I’ll write a follow-up.</p>
<p>I tried to leave out all the RSS fetchers because I love RSS, RSS is great and if you’re using RSS in 2024 you’re an awesome person BUT I might have inadvertently broken some RSS feed out there with this move. If you notice something not working properly let me know and I’ll fix it.</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## StreamOS source code republished 15 years later

date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News

Way, way, way back in 2009, we reported on a small hobby operating system called StreamOS &#8211; version 0.21-RC1 had just been released that day. StreamOS was a 32-bit operating system written in Object Pascal using the Free Pascal Compiler, running on top of FreeDOS. It turns out that its creator, Oleksandr Natalenko (yes, the same person), recovered the old code, and republished it on Codeberg for posterity. It&#8217;s not a complete history, rather a couple of larger breadcrumbs stuck together with git. I didn&#8217;t do source code management much back in the days, and there are still some intermediate dev bits scattered across my backup drive that I cannot even date properly, but three branches I pushed (along with binaries, btw; feel free to fire up that qemu of yours and see how it crashes!) should contain major parts of what was done. ↫ Oleksandr Natalenko It may not carry the same import as Doom for the SNES, but it&#8217;s still great to see such continuity 15 years apart. I hope Natalenko manages to recover the remaining bits and bobs too, because you may never know &#8211; someone might be interested in picking up this 15 year old baton.

## Doom for SNES full source code released by former Sculptured Software employees

date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News

The complete source code for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) version of Doom has been released on archive.org. Although some of the code was partially released a few years ago, this is the first time the full source code has been made publicly available. ↫ Shaun James at GBAtemp The code was very close to being lost forever, down to a corrupted disk that had to be fixed. It&#8217;s crazy how much valuable, historically relevant code we&#8217;re just letting rot away for no reason.

## A brief history of Mac enclaves and exclaves

date: 2024-06-16, from: OS News

Howard Oakley has written an interesting history of secure enclaves on the Mac, and when he touches upon &#8220;exclaves&#8221;, a new concept that doesn&#8217;t have a proper term yet, he mentions something interesting. While an enclave is a territory entirely surrounded by the territory of another state, an exclave is an isolated fragment of a state that exists separately from the main part of that state. Although exclave isn’t a term normally used in computing, macOS 14.4 introduced three kernel extensions concerned with exclaves. They seem to have appeared first in iOS 17, where they’re thought to code domains isolated from the kernel that protect key functions in macOS even when the kernel becomes compromised. This in turn suggests that Apple is in the process of refactoring the kernel into a central micro-kernel with protected exclaves. This has yet to be examined in Sequoia. ↫ Howard Oakley I&#8217;m not going to add too much here since I&#8217;m not well-versed enough in the world of macOS to add anything meaningful, but I do think it&#8217;s an interesting theory worth looking into by people who posses far more knowledge about this topic than I do.

## Imagine RSS as a cover story

date: 2024-06-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> has never been on the cover of a magazine, so you can't say ChatGPT is stealing this from anyone. In fact I'm offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press has chosen to focus on the idea that it's plagiarizing journalists. The ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If they're doing their jobs, they're reporting facts that exist whether or not they wrote a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a local paper that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series">NLCS</a>. I don't owe a news org anything if I wrote that the Mets won, because I read the news on their site. The news doesn't belong to them. </p>
<p>The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn't so far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no billionaires involved, so they didn't consider it newsworthy I guess. Some day we're going to have to accept that we have to make our own news, in the sense of Scoop Nisker's famous line -- "If you don't like the news go out and make some of your own." So here we go. I asked ChatGPT to imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story. </p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/16/rssCover.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've written a crawler for the network of blogrolls via <a href="https://opml.org/blogroll.opml">connective links</a> in HTML and/or RSS feeds. When I started the project, I had no idea what I'd find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don't know the extent of it, but there's a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I'm thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the blogrolls, and see what we get from that. And I'm beginning to see the utility of <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> as a feed operating system, which is what I wanted it to be. It's not just a feed reader. It's able to do things most feed readers don't do, maybe none do. We don't have a good grasp of the depth of the feed products either. I will of course share the results when they are shareable.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Three movies I've watched in the last few days: 1. Fight Club. 2. The Matrix. 3. The Devil's Advocate. I had seen all of them before. But they go together. And they're all about the same thing, about choosing to live in a dream, or to live the life you're actually living. All three are excellent movies that I watched straight through from beginning to end, which is really unusual for me these days.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zicGxU5MfwE">This would make a great campaign ad</a>. Remember how lost we were. Understand what you're voting for when you go MAGA and what you could get if you sit this one out or cast a protest vote of some kind.

## CloudNativePG 1.23.2, 1.22.4 and 1.21.6 Released!

date: 2024-06-16, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> is thrilled to announce a new update for the
<strong>CloudNativePG Operator</strong>, now available for the supported versions 1.23,
1.22, and 1.21.</p>
<p>Thanks to comprehensive refactoring and enhancement activities, we've
significantly improved the reliability of our automated End-to-End (E2E) tests.
With contributions from <a href="https://enterprisedb.com">EDB</a>, we've tested the
operator on all major cloud providers, identified several defects, and resolved
them in these new releases, ensuring a more stable and resilient software.</p>
<p><strong>Versions 1.23.2, 1.22.4, and 1.21.6</strong> are patch releases that contain crucial
bug fixes, addressing issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unnecessary reloads and shutdowns of PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Excessive CPU usage on fenced instances, due to busy waiting loop</li>
<li>The primary instance manager hanging indefinitely after a stop and subsequent
  failure</li>
<li>Autovacuum not working correctly due to an issue between
  <code>hot_standby_feedback</code> and our managed cluster-level replication slots
  implementation</li>
<li><code>pgaudit.log_rows</code> not functioning as intended</li>
</ul>
<p>With this update, version 1.21 has reached End-of-Life (EOL). Version 1.21.6
marks the final release for the 1.21 minor version.</p>
<p>We highly recommend updating the operator at your earliest convenience to
benefit from these improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>For a detailed list of changes, please refer to the release notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.23/release_notes/v1.23/">Release notes for 1.23.2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.22/release_notes/v1.22/">Release notes for 1.22.4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.21/release_notes/v1.21/">Release notes for 1.21.6</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we are pleased to announce that macOS users can now install the
<code>cnpg</code> plugin for <code>kubectl</code> via Homebrew with the command: <code>brew install
kubectl-cnpg</code>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support. We look forward to your seamless
experience with the updated CloudNativePG Operator.
If you are using it in production, please consider
<a href="https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md">adding your organization as an adopter of the project</a>.</p>
<p>Your support helps us grow and improve!</p>
<h2>About CloudNativePG</h2>
<p><a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a> stands as a groundbreaking
open-source Kubernetes Operator designed explicitly for PostgreSQL workloads.
Seamlessly orchestrating the entire life cycle of a PostgreSQL cluster,
CloudNativePG takes charge from bootstrapping and configuration to ensuring
high availability, connection routing, and comprehensive backup and disaster
recovery mechanisms.
Leveraging PostgreSQL's native streaming replication, CloudNativePG efficiently
distributes data across pods, nodes, and zones, using standard Kubernetes
patterns. This enables seamless scaling of replicas in a Kubernetes-native
manner, with the operator autonomously and safely reconfiguring replication as
needed.
Originally conceived and supported by <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/">EDB</a>,
CloudNativePG represents a paradigm shift in managing PostgreSQL workloads
within Kubernetes environments.</p>
