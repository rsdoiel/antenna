## The history of RISCOSbits at WROCC â€“ 2nd October

date: 2024-09-29, from: RiscOS Story

It doesn&#8217;t seem to be very long ago that we first saw Andy Marks appear at the Wakefield Show with his &#8216;Acorn and RISC OS Spares and Extras&#8217; stand, referred to with an acronym that had people with a childish sense of humour laughing (er&#8230; guilty, your honour! Very, very guilty!), and those without asking &#8220;do you realise what that says?&#8221; Not long after, &#8216;ARSE&#8217; (snort) became RISCOSbits, supplying a variety of cases and computers to the RISC OS market &#8211; with more than a few having playful designations that&#8230;

## MACadd adds French, German

date: 2024-09-29, from: RiscOS Story

With apologies to Kevin Wells for a bit of a delay mentioning the first of these updates (the bunker has been unattended for a couple of weeks), there are two updates to report on MACadd, his application that can be used to look up information about MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. MAC addresses are twelve digit base 16 (hexadecimal) codes assigned to network interfaces that are on board devices of all sorts, and intended to be unique. Their purpose is to ensure all such devices can be identified and treated&#8230;
