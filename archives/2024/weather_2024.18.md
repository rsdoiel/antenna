Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0747 AM CDT Wed May 01 2024

Valid 011300Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN WESTERN
OKLAHOMA...THE EASTERN TEXAS PANHANDLE AND NORTHWEST/WEST-CENTRAL
TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
The greatest threat today for large to very large hail, severe
thunderstorm gusts and a few tornadoes will be in western Oklahoma,
the eastern Texas Panhandle and northwest/west-central Texas.

...Synopsis...
An elongated, mid/upper-level cyclone -- currently astride the
Canadian border of MT/ID -- is expected to consolidate somewhat and
move eastward slowly through the period.  By 12Z, the main
circulation center should be along the MT/SK line or slightly
further north into southern SK.  A series of mostly low-amplitude
shortwaves will traverse the associated, amplifying, cyclonic flow
field across the Intermountain West and Rockies.  While these
perturbations should remain apart from the severe-outlook areas
today, the broader/associated regime of height falls and southwest
flow aloft will spread out over much of the central/southern Plains
through the period.  A weak, but potentially important, southern-
stream trough was apparent in moisture-channel imagery from the
southern part of the AZ/NM line south-southeastward across western
Chihuahua.  By 00Z, this feature is expected to reach the Big
Bend/Serranias del Burro region of southwest TX and northern
Coahuila, respectively.

The 11Z surface analysis showed a frontal-wave low near GUY, with
cold front across the northwestern/west-central TX Panhandle to
northeastern NM.  A warm to stationary front was drawn from the low
across extreme southern KS to southern MO, and should shift
northward as a warm front over central/northern KS today as the low
moves northeastward and weakens, while a new low forms over
southeastern CO.  An outflow boundary was drawn from western AR
across north-central TX to northwest TX and the eastern Panhandle,
with some active reinforcement underway by convection over central/
southern OK that is elevated, per 12Z OUN sounding.  A dryline
initially over the Llano Estacado near the TX/NM line should shift
eastward today to the eastern Panhandle and South Plains regions,
while remaining over the Permian Basin.

...Central/southern Plains...
Isolated, marginally severe hail is possible from elevated
convection this morning over portions of OK.  Later, a potentially
complex, messy and episodic convective threat is evident over the
southern Plains, from midafternoon through overnight.  The 30% area
has been modified southward somewhat but remains over what appears
to be the most favorable environment for concentrated wind/hail
threats.  Swaths of strong to severe gusts are possible across a
broader area of TX/OK into late tonight, and the 15% area has been
expanded mainly on the southeast side.

Scattered thunderstorms are expected to form near the dryline this
afternoon from southwestern/central KS to southwest TX, and move
generally eastward, with a blend of supercell and multicell modes
during the first few hours.  This is when large to very large hail
will be most probable.  Damaging-wind potential should start on a
localized basis with those more-discrete early storms, then increase
from late afternoon into evening as activity congeals into a few
clusters or complexes between the Edwards Plateau and western OK.  A
few tornadoes also may occur, especially with any sustained/discrete
supercells and storms near the dryline/warm-front intersection. 
Additional development is possible late this afternoon into tonight
ahead of the dryline -- across parts of south TX and the Serranias
del Burro region ahead of the southern-stream perturbation aloft. 
This also may grow upscale into strong-severe clusters, forward
propagating eastward over south-central/southeast TX, with damaging
gusts being the main concern.

A substantial factor (and lingering uncertainty) in bounding
substantial severe potential on the north end will be the position
and character of the outflow boundary/boundaries from yesterday
night's MCS activity in southern and northern OK.  Each complex
yielded substantial theta-e deficits in their resulting cold pools,
with related drying still manifest as upper 50s to low 60s F surface
dewpoints from the DFW Metroplex across much of OK.  Return flow of
much richer moisture is expected around the western rim of that
modified air mass, which itself should advect northward through
parts of OK today.  Strong heating, steep low/middle-level lapse
rates and favorable moisture should yield MLCAPE in the 2500-3500
J/kg range near the moist axis, amidst 25-40-kt effective-shear
magnitudes and somewhat-favorable hodographs for supercells. 
However, the most-favorable sector over the western OK/eastern
Panhandle region -- and especially into KS south of the warm front
-- may be narrow, limiting eastward extent of organized severe
threats after initial dryline activity.  Farther south, more
clustering and forward propagation are expected with greater
eastward reach, with the moist sector having not been modified as
much, or at all, by the prior MCS outflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0584
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0844 PM CDT Tue Apr 30 2024

Areas affected...Northern/Western Missouri

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 166...

Valid 010144Z - 010315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 166
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong/severe storms will linger, mainly across
northern Missouri this evening.

DISCUSSION...Convective trends are down early this evening, partly
due to cooling boundary-layer conditions. Convection that developed
along/ahead of the cold front/dryline has advanced east-southeast
across the instability axis. This activity is encountering a less
buoyant environment and updrafts are gradually weakening. Latest
trends suggest convection near the IA border may linger a bit
longer, primarily due to the southern influence of the upper MS
Valley short-wave trough. Even so, marginally severe hail may become
the primary risk over the next hour or so.

0755 PM CDT Tue Apr 30 2024

Areas affected...Southeast IA...Northwest IL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 163...

Valid 010055Z - 010230Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 163 continues.

SUMMARY...Convection should gradually weaken as it spreads toward
the Mississippi River Valley. New watch is not anticipated
downstream.

DISCUSSION...A few supercells linger across southern IA, along the
southern fringe of large-scale support, in association with ejecting
short-wave trough. Most notable, longer-lived supercell is
propagating east across Appanoose County is approaching an air mass
that is increasingly hostile to surface-based updrafts. While
low-level lapse rates were steep at 00z/DVN, MLCAPE was only 40
J/kg, and nocturnal cooling will limit further destabilization.
While this lead storm may produce marginally severe hail, or perhaps
a brief tornado over the next hour or so, current thinking is
convection should gradually weaken as the evening progresses.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0800 PM CDT Tue Apr 30 2024

Valid 010100Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms, capable of large hail (possibly above 2 inches in
diameter), damaging wind gusts, and a few tornadoes are expected
this evening from the upper Mississippi Valley south-southwestward
into the southern Plains.

...Central Plains/Lower Missouri Valley/Upper Mississippi Valley...
The latest surface analysis has a 1002 mb low over southwest Iowa,
with a narrow corridor of maximized low-level moisture from near the
low southwestward into eastern Kansas. The RAP has moderate
instability along this corridor with MLCAPE estimated to be in the
1500 to 3000 J/kg range. Scattered strong to severe storms are
ongoing along and near the instability axis. These storms will
continue to move eastward toward the upper Mississippi Valley and
Ozarks this evening. In addition to the instability, WSR-88D VWPs
near the instability axis from northwest Missouri southwestward into
southeast Kansas have 0-6 km shear in the 35 to 40 knot range.
Within this area, RAP forecast soundings suggest that 700-500 mb
lapse rates are in the 7 to 7.5 C/km range. This will continue to be
favorable for supercells with large hail over the next few hours.
The more dominant supercells could produce hailstones greater than 2
inches in diameter. Strong low-level shear was also evident on the
WSR-88D VWPs suggesting a few tornadoes could develop. Severe wind
gusts also could occur with supercells or short line segments. The
severe threat is expected to continue through much of the evening,
but should become more isolated and marginal, especially toward late
evening.

...Southern Plains...
Westerly mid-level flow is evident on water vapor imagery over the
southern Plains this evening. At the surface, a moist airmass exists
throughout much of Texas and Oklahoma. Scattered thunderstorms are
ongoing to the east of a dryline, near the western edge of the moist
airmass, from western Oklahoma into west-central Texas. The 00Z
soundings at Norman and Midland are showing MLCAPE in the 2000 to
3500 J/kg range. Regional WSR-88D VWPs show moderate deep-layer
shear over much of the southern Plains, with 0-6 km shear generally
in the 40 to 45 knot range. This, along with 700-500 mb lapse rates
near 7.5 C/km, will support supercell development this evening, with
a potential for large hail. Hailstones of greater than 2 inches in
diameter will be possible with the more intense cells. An isolated
tornado threat could continue in southwest Oklahoma for another hour
or so. A few damaging wind gusts could also occur. The severe threat
should become more isolated during the mid to late evening, as a cap
begins to build in across much of the southern Plains.

...Mid-Atlantic To Far Southwest New England...
The latest radar imagery shows a cluster of strong to severe
thunderstorms located over far eastern Pennsylvania and northwestern
New Jersey. This cluster was located just to the north of a 1009 mb
low, along the northeastern edge of a pocket of maximized low-level
moisture. Within this pocket, surface dewpoints are in the mid to
upper 50s F, an MLCAPE is estimated to be in the 250 to 500 J/kg
range, according to the RAP. This cluster of storms should weak, as
it moves east-southeastward toward the coast this evening. A few
marginally severe wind gusts will be possible.

  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms will likely
develop through the late afternoon into the early evening near and
east of the dryline.  Some of the stronger storms will probably
become supercellular and pose a risk for large to very large hail
and severe gusts.  A narrow window of time may exist for a brief
tornado towards the early evening mainly over the Oklahoma portion
of the Watch.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles northwest of
Ponca City OK to 130 miles south southwest of Altus OK. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0411 PM CDT Tue Apr 30 2024

Valid 021200Z - 081200Z

A series of mid-level shortwave troughs will move through the
northern Plains later this week with a large trough moving into the
western CONUS over the weekend. As this trough and the associated
jet streak emerge over the Southwest and into the Plains early next
week, fire weather concerns will increase across New Mexico and the
southern High Plains.

...D3/Thu - central and eastern New Mexico...
Northwesterly flow is expected to strengthen across New Mexico on
Friday as a lee cyclone develops in the southern High Plains.
Sustained winds of 15 to 20 mph are expected with relative humidity
in the single digits. Elevated to potentially critical fire weather
conditions are likely.

...D7/Mon-D8/Tue - southern High Plains...
Operational and ensemble guidance has come into agreement for a
strong mid-level trough to move into the western CONUS over the
weekend. The threat for critical fire weather conditions will
increase as strong to very strong mid-level flow overspreads the
well-mixed airmass in the Southwest. There still remains
considerable uncertainty with respect to the exact timing and
character of the mid-level trough. However, most solutions favor
strong mid-level flow across the Southwest with both the EPS and
GEFS ensembles showing an ensemble mean of 45+ knots which is a very
strong signal for Day7/8. Therefore, have added 70% Critical
probabilities for Day 7/Monday and 40% probabilities for
Day8/Tuesday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

Added an Elevated delineation to portions of eastern Montana and
southwest North Dakota. Minimal precipitation has fallen across this
region over the past 2 weeks with significant drying of fine fuels.
Some scattered showers/thunderstorms are possible tonight which may
lead to wetting rain in some areas. However, this precipitation is
expected to be sparse enough that dry fuels should remain tomorrow.
Therefore, sustained 20 to 25 mph winds and relative humidity of 15
to 20 percent may result in some elevated large fire threat.

..Bentley.. 04/29/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024/

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced mid-level flow will spread across the Northern
Rockies from an upper-low across the northwestern US on Tuesday. A
cold frontal passage will bring widespread wetting rainfall across
much of eastern Montana and Wyoming. Behind the cold front, a dry
continental air mass will overspread this region, with relative
humidity dropping as low as 15 percent amid sustained winds 15-20
mph. Fuels in this region are expected to be marginal before
additional rainfall. However, some potential for drying of grasses
and fine fuels may support localized fire weather concerns. For now,
this potential is too low to include any areas with this outlook.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Valid 292000Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE LOWER
MS VALLEY...SOUTH TEXAS...AND SOUTHEAST LOWER MI...

...SUMMARY...
Marginally severe wind gusts and hail will be possible today across
south Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and southeast Lower
Michigan.

...20Z Update...
Overall forecast reasoning remains unchanged. Only adjustment to the
previous outlook was to trim behind the line in southern MS.

Ongoing line across southwest IN will likely continue
eastward/northeastward. Widespread clouds have limited heating
downstream across IN and OH, which has limited buoyancy as well.
This limited buoyancy should temper the overall severe potential,
although a damaging gust or two is possible if storms briefly
intensify.

..Mosier.. 04/29/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1113 AM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024/

...LA/MS/AL...
A decaying linear MCS is moving slowly southeastward across southern
LA, with the most active part of the line well offshore.  The
leading outflow boundary extends northward across southeast LA into
central MS, with a warm/moist low-level air mass in place to the
east.  Some rejuvenation of thunderstorms along this line is
expected this afternoon, with storms tracking eastward toward
southwest AL this evening.  Mid-level lapse rates are weak in this
area, along with weak to moderately strong low to mid-level wind
fields.  This suggests some risk of gusty or possibly damaging winds
with these storms, but the threat is expected to remain rather
isolated.

...Southeast Lower MI...
Visible satellite imagery shows strong heating occurring over
southeast Lower MI today, but with a broad area of clouds and light
precipitation approaching from the southwest.  Several morning CAM
solutions show scattered afternoon thunderstorms developing along
the leading edge of this cloud deck.  Storms will sweep across the
area rather quickly, with steepening low-level lapse rates posing a
risk of locally gusty/damaging wind gusts in the strongest cells. 
An isolated tornado cannot be ruled out as well - especially along a
surface boundary that extends across the Thumb area.

...South TX...
A moist and moderately unstable air mass is present today across
south TX, ahead of a weak front.  The coverage of thunderstorms is
expected to be quite limited today in this region, but any storm
that forms could pose a risk of large hail for a few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0572
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1258 PM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Areas affected...the Michigan Thumb vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 291758Z - 292000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...The evolution of an isolated supercell accompanied by at
least some potential for a tornado, in addition severe hail and
wind, appears possible across the Michigan Thumb vicinity near Bad
Axe through 3-5 PM EDT.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of larger-scale mid-level troughing, with an
embedded low, migrating northeastward into/through the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes vicinity, a strong south-southwesterly mid-level
jet (40-70 kt in the 700-500 mb layer) is in the process of
propagating across lower Michigan.  In association with this
feature, an area of stronger surface pressure falls (2-3+ mb 2
hourly) has generally begun to shift across Lake Huron, but still
extends along an axis as far south as the Flint MI vicinity.  This
is near a weak surface frontal low which is forecast to migrate
across and northeast of the Bad Axe vicinity through 19-21Z.

South of the front, boundary-layer moistening (including surface dew
points around 60f) has been sufficient to contribute to weak
destabilization (including mixed-layer CAPE increasing up to 500
J/kg).  Although further heating and mixing may reduce this some to
the south of the front, this may be maintained along the front, just
ahead of the low, which may gradually provide a focus for
intensifying convection.  Given the strength of the vertical shear,
including sizable clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, and
localized forcing for ascent, the evolution of a supercell appears
possible, which may pose at least some risk for producing a tornado,
in addition to marginally severe hail and wind.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1231 PM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTHWEST
MN...WESTERN IA...FAR NORTHWEST MO...EASTERN KS...EASTERN NE AND FAR
SOUTHEAST SD...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible on Tuesday from parts of the
mid/upper Mississippi Valley into the central/southern Plains. The
greatest threat is expected from eastern Nebraska into parts of
western Iowa and southwest Minnesota, with a risk of very large
hail, severe wind gusts, and a few tornadoes.

...Synopsis...
An upper cyclone is forecast to be centered over southeastern
British Columbia/southwest Alberta early Tuesday morning. A series
of shortwave troughs are expected to traverse the moderate mid-level
flow is extended throughout the base of this cyclone. The lead wave
in this series will likely move from the central High Plains
northeastward across the northern/central Plains into the Upper
Midwest throughout the day, accompanied by gradually strengthening
mid-level flow. A weak cold front and associated surface troughing
will precede this shortwave, with consolidation into more prominent
low anticipated from the Mid MO Valley into the Upper Midwest during
the afternoon and evening. Northern portion of this front near the
surface low will remain progressive, continuing eastward through the
Upper Midwest overnight. However, southern portion of the front will
slow and eventually stall across KS, with additional surface
cyclogenesis possible along the western portion of this boundary
over western KS and the eastern TX/OK Panhandles.

Farther east, a shortwave trough is expected to gradually shift
eastward from the Lower OH Valley/Mid-South across the TN Valley and
Southeast states, reaching the Mid-Atlantic States by early
Wednesday morning. Some phasing between this wave and a separate
low-amplitude shortwave farther north over the Lower Great
Lakes/southwestern Ontario is possible. Isolated thunderstorms are
anticipated ahead of both of these waves across much of the eastern
CONUS (i.e. from the Upper OH Valley/Northeast States into the
Southeast). However, limited buoyancy and weak shear should temper
the overall severe potential across the majority of the area,
although a locally increased risk is possible from central NY
through eastern PA and from eastern GA through SC.

...Mid MO Valley into Eastern KS...
Low-level moisture is expected to advect quickly northward
throughout the day, ahead of the approaching shortwave trough and
associated surface trough/cold front. Consensus among the guidance
brings low 60s dewpoints into the northeastern KS/northwest
MO/southeastern NE border vicinity by the mid afternoon, with upper
50s  northward along the NE/IA border. This low-level moisture
combined with modest daytime heating and steep mid-level lapse rates
will support moderate buoyancy (i.e. 1500 to 2000 J/kg).
Thunderstorm development is anticipated along the front during the
afternoon, beginning across eastern SD/southwestern MN then
extending southwestward across eastern NE. Given the moderate
buoyancy, robust updrafts should develop quickly, and vertical shear
will be strong enough to support organized storm structures. Large
to very large hail is likely with initial development before the
storms undergo a relatively quick upscale growth, with the
transition to a more linear mode favoring strong gusts. Some gusts
to 75 mph are possible. The tornado threat is a bit more complex.
There is enough low-level curvature to support tornadogenesis, but
the overall potential may be limited by the quick upscale growth and
relatively short time duration storms will be in a discrete mode.
That being said, some tornado threat is possible within the line as
well, particularly across western IA during the early evening (i.e.
around 00Z) as the low-level jet increases. 

...Central KS southwestward across Western OK into Southwest TX...
Most of the stronger large-scale forcing for ascent is anticipated
farther north, but persistent low-level convergence along the
dryline could result in isolated to widely scattered thunderstorm
initiation. Any storms that mature could produce large to very large
hail and damaging downbursts. Guidance has trended towards a bit
more thunderstorm coverage from northwest into southwest TX, but the
lack of stronger large scale forcing limits forecast confidence,
precluding the introduction of higher probabilities with this
outlook.

Fire weather concerns are expected to remain low across the CONUS
today. Weak lee surface troughing will continue to bring localized
breezes across portions of the southern High Plains. Height rises
and weakening flow aloft should keep coverage of this threat
limited, precluding the need to include any areas at this time.
Afternoon relative humidity will still drop as low as 15 percent
with localized periods of Elevated fire weather, main across eastern
New Mexico.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1113 AM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Valid 291630Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH LATE
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE LOWER MS VALLEY...SOUTH TX...AND SOUTHEAST
LOWER MI...

...SUMMARY...
Marginally severe wind gusts and hail will be possible today across
south Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and southeast Lower
Michigan.

...LA/MS/AL...
A decaying linear MCS is moving slowly southeastward across southern
LA, with the most active part of the line well offshore.  The
leading outflow boundary extends northward across southeast LA into
central MS, with a warm/moist low-level air mass in place to the
east.  Some rejuvenation of thunderstorms along this line is
expected this afternoon, with storms tracking eastward toward
southwest AL this evening.  Mid-level lapse rates are weak in this
area, along with weak to moderately strong low to mid-level wind
fields.  This suggests some risk of gusty or possibly damaging winds
with these storms, but the threat is expected to remain rather
isolated.

...Southeast Lower MI...
Visible satellite imagery shows strong heating occurring over
southeast Lower MI today, but with a broad area of clouds and light
precipitation approaching from the southwest.  Several morning CAM
solutions show scattered afternoon thunderstorms developing along
the leading edge of this cloud deck.  Storms will sweep across the
area rather quickly, with steepening low-level lapse rates posing a
risk of locally gusty/damaging wind gusts in the strongest cells. 
An isolated tornado cannot be ruled out as well - especially along a
surface boundary that extends across the Thumb area.

...South TX...
A moist and moderately unstable air mass is present today across
south TX, ahead of a weak front.  The coverage of thunderstorms is
expected to be quite limited today in this region, but any storm
that forms could pose a risk of large hail for a few hours.
