Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

Added an Elevated delineation to portions of eastern Montana and
southwest North Dakota. Minimal precipitation has fallen across this
region over the past 2 weeks with significant drying of fine fuels.
Some scattered showers/thunderstorms are possible tonight which may
lead to wetting rain in some areas. However, this precipitation is
expected to be sparse enough that dry fuels should remain tomorrow.
Therefore, sustained 20 to 25 mph winds and relative humidity of 15
to 20 percent may result in some elevated large fire threat.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024/

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced mid-level flow will spread across the Northern
Rockies from an upper-low across the northwestern US on Tuesday. A
cold frontal passage will bring widespread wetting rainfall across
much of eastern Montana and Wyoming. Behind the cold front, a dry
continental air mass will overspread this region, with relative
humidity dropping as low as 15 percent amid sustained winds 15-20
mph. Fuels in this region are expected to be marginal before
additional rainfall. However, some potential for drying of grasses
and fine fuels may support localized fire weather concerns. For now,
this potential is too low to include any areas with this outlook.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Valid 292000Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE LOWER
MS VALLEY...SOUTH TEXAS...AND SOUTHEAST LOWER MI...

...SUMMARY...
Marginally severe wind gusts and hail will be possible today across
south Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and southeast Lower
Michigan.

...20Z Update...
Overall forecast reasoning remains unchanged. Only adjustment to the
previous outlook was to trim behind the line in southern MS.

Ongoing line across southwest IN will likely continue
eastward/northeastward. Widespread clouds have limited heating
downstream across IN and OH, which has limited buoyancy as well.
This limited buoyancy should temper the overall severe potential,
although a damaging gust or two is possible if storms briefly
intensify.

..Mosier.. 04/29/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1113 AM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024/

...LA/MS/AL...
A decaying linear MCS is moving slowly southeastward across southern
LA, with the most active part of the line well offshore.  The
leading outflow boundary extends northward across southeast LA into
central MS, with a warm/moist low-level air mass in place to the
east.  Some rejuvenation of thunderstorms along this line is
expected this afternoon, with storms tracking eastward toward
southwest AL this evening.  Mid-level lapse rates are weak in this
area, along with weak to moderately strong low to mid-level wind
fields.  This suggests some risk of gusty or possibly damaging winds
with these storms, but the threat is expected to remain rather
isolated.

...Southeast Lower MI...
Visible satellite imagery shows strong heating occurring over
southeast Lower MI today, but with a broad area of clouds and light
precipitation approaching from the southwest.  Several morning CAM
solutions show scattered afternoon thunderstorms developing along
the leading edge of this cloud deck.  Storms will sweep across the
area rather quickly, with steepening low-level lapse rates posing a
risk of locally gusty/damaging wind gusts in the strongest cells. 
An isolated tornado cannot be ruled out as well - especially along a
surface boundary that extends across the Thumb area.

...South TX...
A moist and moderately unstable air mass is present today across
south TX, ahead of a weak front.  The coverage of thunderstorms is
expected to be quite limited today in this region, but any storm
that forms could pose a risk of large hail for a few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0572
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1258 PM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Areas affected...the Michigan Thumb vicinity

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 291758Z - 292000Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...The evolution of an isolated supercell accompanied by at
least some potential for a tornado, in addition severe hail and
wind, appears possible across the Michigan Thumb vicinity near Bad
Axe through 3-5 PM EDT.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of larger-scale mid-level troughing, with an
embedded low, migrating northeastward into/through the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes vicinity, a strong south-southwesterly mid-level
jet (40-70 kt in the 700-500 mb layer) is in the process of
propagating across lower Michigan.  In association with this
feature, an area of stronger surface pressure falls (2-3+ mb 2
hourly) has generally begun to shift across Lake Huron, but still
extends along an axis as far south as the Flint MI vicinity.  This
is near a weak surface frontal low which is forecast to migrate
across and northeast of the Bad Axe vicinity through 19-21Z.

South of the front, boundary-layer moistening (including surface dew
points around 60f) has been sufficient to contribute to weak
destabilization (including mixed-layer CAPE increasing up to 500
J/kg).  Although further heating and mixing may reduce this some to
the south of the front, this may be maintained along the front, just
ahead of the low, which may gradually provide a focus for
intensifying convection.  Given the strength of the vertical shear,
including sizable clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, and
localized forcing for ascent, the evolution of a supercell appears
possible, which may pose at least some risk for producing a tornado,
in addition to marginally severe hail and wind.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1231 PM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTHWEST
MN...WESTERN IA...FAR NORTHWEST MO...EASTERN KS...EASTERN NE AND FAR
SOUTHEAST SD...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms will be possible on Tuesday from parts of the
mid/upper Mississippi Valley into the central/southern Plains. The
greatest threat is expected from eastern Nebraska into parts of
western Iowa and southwest Minnesota, with a risk of very large
hail, severe wind gusts, and a few tornadoes.

...Synopsis...
An upper cyclone is forecast to be centered over southeastern
British Columbia/southwest Alberta early Tuesday morning. A series
of shortwave troughs are expected to traverse the moderate mid-level
flow is extended throughout the base of this cyclone. The lead wave
in this series will likely move from the central High Plains
northeastward across the northern/central Plains into the Upper
Midwest throughout the day, accompanied by gradually strengthening
mid-level flow. A weak cold front and associated surface troughing
will precede this shortwave, with consolidation into more prominent
low anticipated from the Mid MO Valley into the Upper Midwest during
the afternoon and evening. Northern portion of this front near the
surface low will remain progressive, continuing eastward through the
Upper Midwest overnight. However, southern portion of the front will
slow and eventually stall across KS, with additional surface
cyclogenesis possible along the western portion of this boundary
over western KS and the eastern TX/OK Panhandles.

Farther east, a shortwave trough is expected to gradually shift
eastward from the Lower OH Valley/Mid-South across the TN Valley and
Southeast states, reaching the Mid-Atlantic States by early
Wednesday morning. Some phasing between this wave and a separate
low-amplitude shortwave farther north over the Lower Great
Lakes/southwestern Ontario is possible. Isolated thunderstorms are
anticipated ahead of both of these waves across much of the eastern
CONUS (i.e. from the Upper OH Valley/Northeast States into the
Southeast). However, limited buoyancy and weak shear should temper
the overall severe potential across the majority of the area,
although a locally increased risk is possible from central NY
through eastern PA and from eastern GA through SC.

...Mid MO Valley into Eastern KS...
Low-level moisture is expected to advect quickly northward
throughout the day, ahead of the approaching shortwave trough and
associated surface trough/cold front. Consensus among the guidance
brings low 60s dewpoints into the northeastern KS/northwest
MO/southeastern NE border vicinity by the mid afternoon, with upper
50s  northward along the NE/IA border. This low-level moisture
combined with modest daytime heating and steep mid-level lapse rates
will support moderate buoyancy (i.e. 1500 to 2000 J/kg).
Thunderstorm development is anticipated along the front during the
afternoon, beginning across eastern SD/southwestern MN then
extending southwestward across eastern NE. Given the moderate
buoyancy, robust updrafts should develop quickly, and vertical shear
will be strong enough to support organized storm structures. Large
to very large hail is likely with initial development before the
storms undergo a relatively quick upscale growth, with the
transition to a more linear mode favoring strong gusts. Some gusts
to 75 mph are possible. The tornado threat is a bit more complex.
There is enough low-level curvature to support tornadogenesis, but
the overall potential may be limited by the quick upscale growth and
relatively short time duration storms will be in a discrete mode.
That being said, some tornado threat is possible within the line as
well, particularly across western IA during the early evening (i.e.
around 00Z) as the low-level jet increases. 

...Central KS southwestward across Western OK into Southwest TX...
Most of the stronger large-scale forcing for ascent is anticipated
farther north, but persistent low-level convergence along the
dryline could result in isolated to widely scattered thunderstorm
initiation. Any storms that mature could produce large to very large
hail and damaging downbursts. Guidance has trended towards a bit
more thunderstorm coverage from northwest into southwest TX, but the
lack of stronger large scale forcing limits forecast confidence,
precluding the introduction of higher probabilities with this
outlook.

No changes.  See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 04/29/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Mon Apr 29 2024/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain low across the CONUS
today. Weak lee surface troughing will continue to bring localized
breezes across portions of the southern High Plains. Height rises
and weakening flow aloft should keep coverage of this threat
limited, precluding the need to include any areas at this time.
Afternoon relative humidity will still drop as low as 15 percent
with localized periods of Elevated fire weather, main across eastern
New Mexico.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH LATE
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE LOWER MS VALLEY...SOUTH TX...AND SOUTHEAST
LOWER MI...

...SUMMARY...
Marginally severe wind gusts and hail will be possible today across
south Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and southeast Lower
Michigan.

...LA/MS/AL...
A decaying linear MCS is moving slowly southeastward across southern
LA, with the most active part of the line well offshore.  The
leading outflow boundary extends northward across southeast LA into
central MS, with a warm/moist low-level air mass in place to the
east.  Some rejuvenation of thunderstorms along this line is

Valid 291300Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH LATE
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE LOWER MS VALLEY...SOUTH TX...AND SOUTHEAST
LOWER MI...

...SUMMARY...
Marginally severe wind gusts and hail will be possible today across
south Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley and southeast Lower
Michigan.

...Lower MS Valley/Gulf coast today...
A midlevel shortwave trough over northwest TX/western OK will
progress eastward to the lower MS Valley by early tonight.  This
wave is preceded by a large MCS now over southern LA and the
adjacent northwest Gulf of Mexico.  Outflow with this convection
will continue moving southeastward through day, with some additional
storm development possible into southeast LA/southern MS on the
eastern flank of the MCS today.  Surface heating in cloud breaks,
lingering midlevel lapse rates at or above 7 C/km, and
boundary-layer dewpoints of 68-72 F will contribute to moderate
buoyancy and the potential for strong updrafts along the leading
edge of the MCS.  Vertical shear will not be particularly strong,
but the stronger storms will be capable of producing isolated
downburst wind damage through this afternoon.

Farther north, the residual effects of prior and ongoing convection
will be reduced lapse rates and low-level moisture, which along with
lingering clouds will tend to limit buoyancy.  Thunderstorm
development will be still be possible this afternoon/evening from AR
into western TN/KY along and in advance of a weak surface front and
the midlevel trough approaching from OK.  However, severe storms are
not expected as a result of both weak buoyancy and relatively weak
vertical shear.

...South TX this afternoon...
A weak front will drift southward into south TX by this afternoon,
providing a potential focus for isolated thunderstorm development. 
Rich moisture, steep midlevel lapse rates and modest deep-layer
vertical shear (straight hodographs) could support isolated large
hail/wind damage if storms do form.  

...Lower MI this afternoon...
A midlevel trough will continue northeastward from the upper MS
Valley to the upper Great Lakes, while an associated/weak surface
cyclone and cold front move across WI/MI this afternoon through
tonight.  Southeast Lower MI will be located within the warm sector
and could have an opportunity for some surface heating/
destabilization just east of the weakening rain band from IN into
western Lower MI.  MLCAPE up to 500 J/kg, steepening low-level lapse
rates and 50 kt midlevel flow support a low-end threat for wind
damage this afternoon.
