with using Bluesky as a very simple feed reader. 1. Running up against
its lack of style and formatting. Very bare bones. Not sure if people
will like. 2. What’s the rate limit? My app is getting rate-limited with
not very many posts. (According to their
<a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/rate-limits">docs</a>
on rate limits, I don’t think my project is anywhere near the limit.
It’s creating posts. I’ll start counting them, I guess.)</p>

new fairly advanced and flexible variable system. Using this, users can
use files, environment variables and more in a powerful way when
building curl command lines in ways not previously possible – with
almost all existing command line options. curl command lines …

to have a nice non-XML way of viewing the feeds in an OPML subscription

it was just a matter of putting them all in one place. You can use it if
you want, if you want to show someone what feeds are in an OPML

took me a long time to figure out that when people respond to you on
twitter-like systems they aren’t actually speaking to <i>you,</i>
they’re talking over your shoulder to the masses they imagine are
reading what you posted. Three comments. 1. There are no masses. You can
see this by looking at the stats for each tweet, available on most
platforms. 2. Most users on the social web are trying to get attention
for themselves, the only reason they read the posts is to see if there’s
a place for them to attach their message. 3. A simple tweak to the
software would make it so that only the author of the post being
responded to could see the replies. Then they could RT a reply if they
thought everyone should see it. This would make the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> a lot more useful
imho.</p>
