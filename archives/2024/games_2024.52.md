## Premium live-service games are failing. Why is Diablo 4 a success?

date: 2024-12-26, updated: 2024-12-23, from: Polygon Website

Live-service gaming is in a difficult, transitional moment. Even as the sector consumes more and more millions of player hours, successful new launches are few and far between, and the frequency of shutdowns has increased. Franchises like Destiny and Overwatch have pivoted to free-to-play models in an attempt to keep their player numbers buoyant, and [&#8230;]

## This YouTube scientist makes knives out of random stuff and it’s mesmerizing

Do you know how knives are made? Do you know how knives are made of milk? Unless you’ve seen this video — or any others on YouTube channel kiwami japan — you don’t. The channel is dedicated to the art of knifemaking, but most of the videos are detailed step-by-steps of the creator’s successful attempts [&#8230;]

[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for the end of Squid Game season 2.] Squid Game season 2 has come to an end with a bit of a bang and a whimper. Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) has effectively lost his attempt at gaining control of the game, and the aggressive cut on the ending leaves a [&#8230;]

## Giratina counters, weakness, and best moveset in Pokémon Go

date: 2024-12-26, updated: 2024-12-26, from: Polygon Website

Giratina is a hot target in Pokémon Go raids, and whether you’re fighting its Origin Forme or Altered Forme, you’ll want the same counters. When the creepy Pokémon is in its Origin Forme (the one that looks like a snake), it’s one of the strongest ghost-type attackers in the game. On the other hand, Altered [&#8230;]

## Pitch Perfect 237 takes a hilarious Kubrick-level microscope to the a cappella franchise

date: 2024-12-25, updated: 2024-12-20, from: Polygon Website

Room 237 is a documentary that plumbs the depths of The Shining, using various people’s voice-overs to guide the viewer through interpretations of Stanley Kubrick’s seminal 1980 horror film. I have no real thoughts on it; I love The Shining, but have avoided Room 237 mostly by nature of having heard about so much of [&#8230;]

Holidays come with a lot of family talk.

## Best Ultra League teams to use in Pokémon Go

date: 2024-12-24, updated: 2024-12-20, from: Polygon Website

The Ultra League in Pokémon Go’s Go Battle League and its 2,500 CP limit is where more “regular” Pokémon have their time in the spotlight, compared to the almost Legendary-dominated Master League and lower levels of the Great League. In this League, every Pokémon has a chance to make a splash — but that’s not [&#8230;]

## YouTube’s best ‘how music works’ channel taught me so much about media I love

date: 2024-12-24, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website

YouTube is packed with “How do I…” and “How did they…” channels. SEO masterminds chase Google glory on basic questions like “How to change a tire.” Lifestyle gurus explain how to change your life. Documentarians lay out series on how specific products are made. Comedians mix straight-faced how-tos with pointed irony. Entire channels are dedicated [&#8230;]

## Werewolves director on his practical monsters: ‘If the werewolves don’t work, the movie doesn’t work’

If you’ve ever complained about the dominance of digital special effects in modern Hollywood movies, Werewolves was made for you. The new action-horror movie, now available for digital rental or purchase, has a delicious premise — a year ago, a supermoon turned a billion people into werewolves for one night.

## Nosferatu director needed Bill Skarsgård’s vampire to look like a creepy corpse

Count Orlok looms over Nosferatu like the Cloverfield monster. While he is among the first voices we hear, and the first faces we see, the full reveal of Orlok’s form comes much later. When we see him in all his glory — with all the sores, sylphlike limbs, and ponderous movements — he looks like [&#8230;]

## Where to unlock Cloud of Darkness (Chaotic) in FFXIV

Cloud of Darkness (Chaotic) is a high-end duty in Final Fantasy 14, added as part of patch 7.15.

## The state birds are garbage, but this video about them is genius

date: 2024-12-24, updated: 2024-12-20, from: Polygon Website

One of my favorite things about YouTube is discovering a channel that has this one stellar video unlike anything else they’ve done. Bill Wurtz’s “history of japan” is a classic example, the 80 million-view juggernaut from a channel that typically posts bite-sized neon surrealist animations. But I’d like to turn your attention to another absurdist [&#8230;]
