## Gaming with expensive AR smart glasses is first-class fun

date: 2024-12-23, updated: 2024-12-23, from: Polygon Website

One of my favorite Steam Deck upgrades costs more than a Steam Deck. I’ve been testing out Xreal’s new $499 One AR glasses, which can serve as an external display for the console by connecting a USB-C cable between the two.

date: 2024-12-22, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website

The trendsetters online might have moved on from playing Gartic Phone, but my family has not. Developed by Onrizon, Gartic Phone combines the children’s game Telephone with the board game Pictionary.
