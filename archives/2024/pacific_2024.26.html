Some targets are far from our homeland (in Europe), some are closer (in South America), and others share our border (Canada, Mexico). The United States is, of course, a target, too.

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK &amp;#8212; Hundreds of LGBTQ+ donors and activists gathered in midtown Manhattan for a fundraiser supporting President Joe Biden on Friday, but the president&amp;#8217;s debate performance cast an anxious shadow over what normally would have been an energizing political event. As they mingled in a lavender-lit event space at the Manhattan Center, many donors huddled in small groups and fretted over what they had all witnessed on television the night before. The debate was &amp;#8220;definitely the main topic of conversation,&amp;#8221; said one attendee, who declined to be named because he works in Democratic politics.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO &amp;#8212; The Los Angeles Dodgers&amp;#8217; talent can lead to some quirky things. Miguel Rojas, by all accounts, has been a valuable member of yet another first-place club. After serving as the emergency everyday shortstop for a 100-win club last summer, he willingly ceded the role to a former MVP who hadn&amp;#8217;t played the position regularly since high school in Mookie Betts. Rojas has had one of his finest seasons as a big leaguer at 35 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
