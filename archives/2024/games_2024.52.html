with expensive AR smart glasses is first-class fun</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-23, updated: 2024-12-23, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>One of my favorite Steam Deck upgrades costs more than a Steam Deck.
I’ve been testing out Xreal’s new $499 One AR glasses, which can serve
as an external display for the console by connecting a USB-C cable
between the two. The One glasses work with other devices capable of
pushing video from a USB-C […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-23, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Life is stressful. Sometimes it’s difficult to unwind. For me, a
surefire method to improve my mood when I’m feeling down has been
watching Australian radio station Triple J’s Like A Version series,
which includes a regular segment where established and up-and-coming
artists alike cover classic or new hits.  Sometimes the covers are close
to […]</p>

<p>[Ed. note: This story contains spoilers for Dune: Prophecy season 1.]
Dune: Prophecy has blown it all up. Not literally — but in a season that
started with careful backroom deals and manipulations, Prophecy’s finale
putting all the maneuvering into the open is a dramatic tone shift for
the series. With season 1 ending with Valya […]</p>

<p>In the weeks before the release of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, comedian and
actor Ben Schwartz sat down with Polygon to confront the shadows that
lurk in every hedgehog. In this, the third installment of the Polygon x
Ben Schwartz Sonic Interview Series, each question has its own, more
existentially challenging “shadow question.” Ben tackles […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-22, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Movies and video games have always had a somewhat tumultuous
relationship. From the famous failings of video game movie adaptations
to the even more famous struggle to make good movie versions of games,
it’s rare that the two mediums see eye to eye. Which is why it’s so
funny that there are a few rare […]</p>

<p>All is well at Terror Camp. The author Julian Sancton has just
finished speaking about his book Madhouse at the End of the Earth, which
documents the ill-equipped and ill-fated Belgian Antarctic expedition of
1897. The conference attendees are watching via Zoom, and flooding the
accompanying Discord chat with hearts and hand-clap emojis when Allegra

<p>date: 2024-12-22, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>For decades, the Star Wars Holiday Special was a misbegotten artifact
of a specific era of network TV variety-show thinking, and Lucasfilm
seemed content to pretend it never happened. Fans considered it a black
mark on George Lucas’ franchise, and made it the butt of endless fandom
jokes. But that’s changed over the past decade […]</p>

<p>Pokémon Go’s “Dual Destiny” season has begun, lasting from Dec. 3
until March 4, 2025. This means that there’s a new set of Special
Research to complete, though all the steps won’t be immediately
available. The steps will likely be themed around different events that
occur during the season, so while you may only be […]</p>

<p>Pokémon Go is having the second half of its holiday event (literally
called “Holiday Part 2”) from Dec. 22-27, adding more festive Pokémon to
the already-long list of costumed critters, alongside some pretty good
event bonuses. All players will be able to get doubled XP from catching
Pokémon and 50% more XP from raiding. All […]</p>

<p>The trendsetters online might have moved on from playing Gartic
Phone, but my family has not. Developed by Onrizon, Gartic Phone
combines the children’s game Telephone with the board game Pictionary.
It might sound a bit simple, but this lighthearted game is a genuine
delight. More importantly, it’s the perfect game to share with family
