## An insight into the vaginal microbiome of infertile women in Bangladesh using metagenomic approach

date: 2024-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe dysbiosis of vaginal microbiota is recognized as a potential underlying factor contributing to infertility in women. This study aimed to compare the vaginal microbiomes of infertile and fertile women to investigate their relationship with infertility. MethodsMetagenomic analysis was conducted on samples from 5 infertile and 5 fertile individuals using both amplicon 16S and metagenomics shotgun sequencing methods.Results and discussionIn the infertile group, the bacterial community was primarily represented by three major bacterial genera: Lactobacillus (79.42%), Gardnerella (12.56%) and Prevotella (3.33%), whereas, the fertile group exhibited a more diverse composition with over 8 major bacterial genera, accompanied by significantly reduced abundance of Lactobacillus (48.79%) and Gardnerella (6.98%). At the species level, higher abundances of L. iners, L. gasseri and G. vaginalis were observed in the infertile group. Regarding the microbiome composition, only one fertile and two infertile subjects exhibited the healthiest Community State Types, CST-1, while CST-3 was observed among two infertile and one fertile subject, and CST-4 in three other fertile and one infertile subject. Overall, alpha diversity metrics indicated greater diversity and lower species richness in the control (fertile) group, while the infertile group displayed the opposite trend. However, beta-diversity analysis did not show distinct clustering of samples associated with any specific group; instead, it demonstrated CST-type specific clustering. Shotgun metagenomics further confirmed the dominance of Firmicutes, with a greater abundance of Lactobacillus species in the infertile group. Specifically, L. iners and G. vaginalis were identified as the most dominant and highly abundant in the infertile group. Fungi were only identified in the control group, dominated by Penicillium citrinum (62.5%). Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) corroborated read-based taxonomic profiling, with the taxon L. johnsonii identified exclusively in disease samples. MAG identities shared by both groups include Shamonda orthobunyavirus, L. crispatus, Human endogenous retrovirus K113, L. iners, and G. vaginalis. Interestingly, the healthy microbiomes sequenced in this study contained two clusters, Penicillium and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, not found in the public dataset. In conclusion, this study suggests that lower species diversity with a higher abundance of L. iners, L. gasseri and G. vaginalis, may contribute to female infertility in our study datasets. However, larger sample sizes are necessary to further evaluate such association.

## Bacterial aggregation facilitates internalin-mediated invasion of Listeria monocytogenes

date: 2024-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Dissemination of food-borne L. monocytogenes in the host relies on internalin-mediated invasion, but the underlying invasion strategies remain elusive. Here we use live-cell microscopy to follow single cell interactions between individual human cells and L. monocytogenes and elucidate mechanisms associated with internalin B (InlB)-mediated invasion. We demonstrate that whilst a replicative invasion of nonphagocytic cells is a rare event even at high multiplicities of invasion, L. monocytogenes overcomes this by utilising a strategy relaying on PrfA-mediated ActA-based aggregation. We show that L. monocytogenes forms aggregates in extracellular host cell environment, which promote approximately 5-fold more host cell adhesions than the non-aggregating actA-ΔC mutant (which lacks the C-terminus coding region), with the adhering bacteria inducing 3-fold more intracellular invasions. Aggregation is associated with robust MET tyrosine kinase receptor clustering in the host cells, a hallmark of InlB-mediated invasion, something not observed with the actA-ΔC mutant. Finally, we show via RNA-seq analyses that aggregation involves a global adaptive response to host cell environment (including iron depletion), resulting in metabolic changes in L. monocytogenes and upregulation of the PrfA virulence regulon. Overall, our analyses provide new mechanistic insights into internalin-mediated host-pathogen interactions of L. monocytogenes.

## Pathoimmunological analyses of fatal E11 infection in premature infants

date: 2024-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

E11 causes acute fulminant hepatitis in newborns. We investigated the pathological changes of different tissues from premature male twins who died due to E11 infection. The E11 expression level was higher in the liver than in other tissues. IP10 was upregulated in liver tissue in the patient group, and might be regulated by IFNAR and IRF7, whereas IFNα was regulated by IFNAR or IRF5.

## Assessment of Bacillus species capacity to protect Nile tilapia from A. hydrophila infection and improve growth performance

date: 2024-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The present study evaluated the capacity of three Bacillus species to improve health status and growth performance of Nile Tilapia fed with high levels of soybean meal and challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila. In vitro experiments showed that β-hemolysin and metalloprotease enzymes were produced by A. hydrophila throughout the exponential growth phase. In vivo experiments showed that 107 colony-forming units (CFUs)/ml of this pathogen killed 50% of control group fishes in 13 days. To evaluate the influence of Bacillus strains on health status and growth performance in Nile Tilapia, 180 fishes (33.44 + 0.05 g) were distributed in 12 tanks of 200 L each, and animals were fed twice per day until satiety. 1) Control group without Bacillus, 2) Bacillus sp1, 3) Bacillus sp2, and 4) Bacillus sp3 groups were formulated containing 106 CFU/g. After 40 days of feeding, the fishes were intraperitoneally injected with 1 ml of A. hydrophila at 2 × 107 CFU/ml, and mortality was recorded. The results showed that cumulative mortality rate was significantly (p< 0.05) lower in the Bacillus sp1 (25%), sp2 (5%), and sp3 (15%) groups, than the control group (50%). Weight gain was also significantly better (p< 0.05) in the Bacillus sp1 (36%), sp2 (67%), and sp3 (55%) groups with respect to the control group (30%). In conclusion, functional diet formulated with high levels of soybean meal and supplemented with Bacillus sp2 could be an alternative to protect Nile tilapia cultures from A. hydrophila infections and improve fish growth performance.

## Clinical characteristics and risk factors for mortality in pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome patients: a single center retrospective cohort study

date: 2024-07-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPathogenic diversity may have contributed to the high mortality of pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (p-ARDS). Metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) serves as a valuable diagnostic tool for early pathogen identification. However, its clinical utility in p-ARDS remains understudied. There are still limited researches on the etiology, clinical characteristics and risk factors for 28-day mortality in p-ARDS patients.MethodsA single center retrospective cohort study of 75 p-ARDS patients was conducted. Patients were categorized into survival and deceased groups based on their 28-day outcomes. A comprehensive clinical evaluation was conducted, including baseline characteristics, laboratory indicators, outcomes and pathogen identification by mNGS and traditional microbiological testing. We then evaluated the diagnostic value of mNGS and identified clinical characteristics and risk factors for 28-day mortality in p-ARDS.ResultThe overall ICU mortality was 26.67%, and the 28-day mortality was 57.33%, with 32 cases (42.67%) in the survival group, and 43 cases (57.33%) in the deceased group. Patients in the deceased group were older than those in the survival group (68(59,73) years vs. 59(44,67) years, P=0.04). The average lengths of ICU and hospital stay were 9(5,13) days and 14(7,21) days, respectively. The survival group had longer lengths of ICU and hospital stay (ICU: 11(7,17) days and hospital: 17(9,27) days) compared to the deceased group (ICU: 8(4,11) days and hospital: 12(6,19) days) (P<0.05). Survival patients exhibited lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on the 3rd and 7th days, higher lymphocyte counts, higher CD3+ and CD8+ T cell counts compared to deceased patients (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified age, APACHE II scores on 3rd and 7th days, CD8+ T cell count and length of ICU as independent risk factors for 28-day mortality in p-ARDS patients. mNGS demonstrated a significantly higher overall pathogen detection rate (70/75, 93.33%) compared to the traditional method (50/75, 66.67%, P=0.022). The average turnaround time (TAT) for mNGS was significantly shorter at 1(1,1) day compared to 4(3,5) days for the traditional method (P<0.001).ConclusionMetagenome next-generation sequencing can be used as a valuable tool for identifying pathogens in p-ARDS, reducing diagnostic time and improving accuracy. Early application of mNGS alongside traditional methods is recommended for p-ARDS. Furthermore, older age, higher APACHE II scores, lower lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte subset counts were associated with increased mortality in p-ARDS patients, highlighting the importance of timely assessment of immune status and disease severity, especially in elderly.

## Differential role of M cells in enteroid infection by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium

date: 2024-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Infection of ruminants such as cattle with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne’s disease, a disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestine and diarrhoea. Infection with MAP is acquired via the faecal-to-oral route and the pathogen initially invades the epithelial lining of the small intestine. In this study we used an in vitro 3D mouse enteroid model to determine the influence of M cells in infection of the gut epithelia by MAP, in comparison with another bacterial intestinal pathogen of veterinary importance, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The differentiation of M cells in the enteroid cultures was induced by stimulation with the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), and the effects on MAP and Salmonella uptake and intracellular survival were determined. The presence of M cells in the cultures correlated with increased uptake and intracellular survival of Salmonella, but had no effect on MAP. Interestingly neither pathogen was observed to preferentially accumulate within GP2-positive M cells.

## A prediction model for secondary invasive fungal infection among severe SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in ICU

date: 2024-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over seven million deaths, and IFI can further complicate the clinical course of COVID-19. Coinfection of COVID-19 and IFI (secondary IFI) pose significant threats not only to healthcare systems but also to patient lives. After the control measures for COVID-19 were lifted in China, we observed a substantial number of ICU patients developing COVID-19-associated IFI. This creates an urgent need for predictive assessment of COVID-19 patients in the ICU environment for early detection of suspected fungal infection cases.MethodsThis study is a single-center, retrospective research endeavor. We conducted a case-control study on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients. The cases consisted of patients who developed any secondary IFI during their ICU stay at Jilin University China-Japan Union Hospital in Changchun, Jilin Province, China, from December 1st, 2022, to August 31st, 2023. The control group consisted of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients without secondary IFI. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed, and a logistic regression prediction model for secondary IFI in COVID-19 patients was established. Additionally, we observed an increased incidence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) during this pandemic. Therefore, we conducted a univariate subgroup analysis on top of IFI, using non-CAPA patients as the control subgroup.ResultsFrom multivariate analysis, the prediction model identified 6 factors that are significantly associated with IFI, including the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for more than 2 weeks (aOR=4.14, 95% CI 2.03-8.67), fever (aOR=2.3, 95%CI 1.16-4.55), elevated log IL-6 levels (aOR=1.22, 95% CI 1.04-1.43) and prone position ventilation (aOR=2.38, 95%CI 1.15-4.97) as independent risk factors for COVID-19 secondary IFI. High BMI (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2) (aOR=0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.94) and the use of COVID-19 immunoglobulin (aOR=0.45, 95% CI 0.2-0.97) were identified as independent protective factors against COVID-19 secondary IFI. The Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of this model was 0.81, indicating good classification.ConclusionWe recommend paying special attention for the occurrence of secondary IFI in COVID-19 patients with low BMI (BMI < 28 kg/m2), elevated log IL-6 levels and fever. Additionally, during the treatment of COVID-19 patients, we emphasize the importance of minimizing the duration of broad-spectrum antibiotic use and highlight the potential of immunoglobulin application in reducing the incidence of IFI.
