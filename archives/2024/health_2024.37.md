## Head-to-head comparison of two human papillomavirus vaccines for efficacy against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and adenocarcinoma in situ—population-based follow-up of two cluster-randomized trials

date: 2024-09-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionWe report head-to-head comparison of the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccine efficacies against immediate precursors of cervical cancer from 15 years’ country-wide cancer registry follow-up of phase III trial cohorts and an age-aligned cohort of unvaccinated women.MethodsThese individually and/or clusterrandomized cohorts of HPV6/11/16/18- and HPV16/18-vaccinated and unvaccinated women were enrolled, respectively, in 2002, 2004, and 2003/2005. The trial cohorts comprised initially 16- to 17-year-old HPV6/11/16/18-vaccinated FUTURE II (NCT00092534) participants (866) and HPV16/18-vaccinated PATRICIA (NCT00122681) and 012 trial (NCT00169494) participants (2,465), and 16,526 initially 16- to 19-year-old unvaccinated controls. After active 4-year clinical follow-up, passive, country-wide Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR) follow-up for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) was based on consented use of unique personal identifiers and started 6 months after the end of the FUTURE II and PATRICIA trials in 2007 and 2009, and ended at the end of 2019. The follow-up with altogether 229,020 follow-up years was age-aligned to ensure that similarly aged cohorts were passively followed up for 15 years post=vaccination for the intention-to-treat analyses of vaccine efficacy.ResultsOverall, we identified 5 and 16 CIN3 (no AIS) cases in the HPV6/11/16/18 and HPV16/18 cohorts, respectively, during the FCR-based follow-up. In the unvaccinated cohort, we identified 281 CIN3 cases, 20 AIS cases, and 13 cases with invasive cervical cancer. Vaccine efficacies against CIN3+ were 68.4% and 64.5% for the quadrivalent and the bivalent vaccines, respectively, with overlapping confidence intervals.DiscussionLong-term follow-up of randomized, initially adolescent HPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts shows, in this head-to-head setting, that the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines are equally effective against immediate precursors of cervical cancer.

## Vaginal microbiota of pregnant women with Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis infections

date: 2024-09-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe association between preterm birth and Mycoplasma species such as Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum has been extensively investigated. In a clinical setting, conventional diagnostic methods for them involve culture methods for Mycoplasma spp. and Ureaplasma spp., along with PCR tests. However, the clinical utility of these tests remains controversial, highlighting the necessity for more robust and reliable methods for identifying and understanding Mycoplasma infections.ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess the distribution of microbiota in pregnant women with Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infection by the comparison of conventional diagnostic methods with vaginal microbial community analysis.Study DesignThis prospective case–control study involved 228 Korean pregnant women and utilized vaginal microbial community analysis, Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma culture, and 12-multiplex PCR for sexually transmitted diseases. Cross-correlation analysis in SPSS 27 compared the results of two conventional methods with vaginal microbial community analysis. R software generated box plots depicting the relative abundance of microorganisms. Network analysis was conducted using Cytoscape.ResultsPositive Ureaplasma urealyticum culture findings were observed in 60.2% of patients, with 76.4% positive for Ureaplasma parvum PCR and 13.2% positive for Ureaplasma urealyticum PCR. Mycoplasma hominis culture was positive only in two patients, while Mycoplasma hominis PCR was positive in eight women. Vaginal microbial community analysis identified significant differences in relative abundances of Gardnerella species type I and Fannyhessea vaginae between the Ureaplasma urealyticum PCR positive and negative groups. Mycoplasma hominis PCR positive patients exhibited significant differences in 11 bacterial species, including Gardnerella species I and Fannyhessea vaginae.ConclusionThis study suggests that STD-PCR may be more accurate than Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma culture for the diagnosis of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infection. Also, the presence of Gardnerella species I and Fannyhessea vaginae implies their potential influences on Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis infections based on results of vaginal microbial community analysis. Therefore, vaginal microbial community analysis may give the more information of their pathophysiology.
