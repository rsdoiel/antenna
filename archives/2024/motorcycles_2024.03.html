<h2 id="how-i-learn-making-games-for-the-playdate">How I learn (making
games for the Playdate)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-17, from: Herman Bear Blog</p>
<p>
I (finally) received my Playdate, after about a year and a half of
waiting. To be honest, I’d kinda forgotten that I’d ordered it and was
pleasantly surprised when it showed up.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Playdate" src="https://static-cdn.play.date/static/images/social-card-3.d239ab818725.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
For those who don’t know, the Playdate is a niche handheld gaming
console, similar to a Gameboy. It has a black and white screen, and an
odd crank on the side. This crank isn’t a dynamo for charging the
device, or anything like that. Instead, it’s a fairly novel input
controller which can be used in a game mechanic to do things like reel
in fish; crank open doors; and control the flow of time.
</p>
<p>
This seemed like the perfect gaming device for me. Not necessarily
because I wanted to <em>play</em> games on it, but because I wanted to
<em>make</em> games for it.
</p>
<p>
I’ve <a href="/the-creative-agency-of-small-projects/">written
previously</a> about the power of constraints when building creative
products. By having a narrow focus and sometimes arbitrary boundaries it
can be easier to experiment and do something novel within this smaller
possibility space. With traditional game engines the possibility space
is huge. You can build anything from a Pac-Man clone, to a real-time,
first-person MMORPG.
</p>
<p>
The Playdate, by comparison, has a much tighter set of constraints:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Everything is 1-bit (black and white, no shades of grey). This is pretty
neat since I got to play around with 1-bit pixel art and learnt about
dithering.
</li>
<li>
The screen is tiny at only 400x240 pixels.
</li>
<li>
The processor isn’t powerful enough to do anything more complex than 2D
or (very) simple 3D rendering, so it relegates all games to the 2D space
(unless you <em>really</em> set your mind to it).
</li>
<li>
And there’s the crank. This isn’t technically a constraint, but it was
for me. If there’s a crank, you can be damn sure that I’m going to find
a way to use it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On to the learning!
</p>
<p>
I was completely unfamiliar with the Playdate SDK, and had never coded
in Lua prior to this project. All the game engines I’d used before had
visual scene interfaces and object hierarchies with attached scripts and
attributes. The Playdate SDK, by comparison, has no interface at all, so
I had to get down and dirty.
</p>
<p>
When learning a new language or framework I like to break it down into 2
steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Figure out what is possible.
</li>
<li>
Build a small project.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Too many novice programmers get stuck in the tutorial phase of learning.
The issue here is that the guardrails never allow them to make mistakes.
Mistakes are where the learning happens. Instead the tutorials lead them
along the happy path the whole way, and in so doing generally teach them
very little.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an analogy: There’s good evidence to suggest that using apps like
Google Maps for turn-by-turn navigation can make it harder for someone
to learn their way around their city. On the other hand, if instead they
check the location of the destination and try to self-navigate they,
naturally, become more familiar with that area. They need that friction.
They need to actually think about what they’re doing.
</p>
<p>
Tutorials are the turn-by-turn navigation of learning. It’ll get you to
the end of the tutorial, but there’s a good chance you won’t be able to
navigate that language/framework/library once completed.
</p>
<h2 id="figure-out-what-is-possible">
Figure out what is possible
</h2>
<p>
So while I don’t find tutorials useful for learning, what they can do is
show me what is possible. I like to watch a handful of them prior to
jumping into building just so when I’m confronted with a problem I know
what to look for to solve it.
</p>
<p>
This is like looking at the map prior to heading off on my journey. I
don’t know the area, but I have a rough approximation of how to get
where I’m going. This doesn’t necessarily have to be a tutorial, I could
theoretically read the documentation, but that’s really dull.
</p>
<p>
After a short bit of scouting I found a great YouTube
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SquidGodDev" target="_blank">playlist</a>
by SquidGodDev that perfectly illustrated what is possible with the
Playdate SDK, and watched about an hour of his videos before continuing.
</p>
<h2 id="build-a-small-project">
Build a small project
</h2>
<p>
During my time teaching, one pattern I noticed consistently was new
programmers learning a new tool (let’s say a game engine) would bite off
way more than they could chew for their first project. Instead of
creating a small game about trying to cross a busy road, they’d try to
build a multiplayer FPS. This generally broke down pretty quickly since
they’d get stuck on one complex problem early on, and after a bunch of
spinning, give up entirely.
</p>
<p>
Instead, having a small scope with a pretty solid definition of “done”
is an ideal way to learn. Taking a project from start to finish gives a
good overview of the larger picture. In the case of the Playdate, it
meant building a small game, publishing it for free, and getting actual
people to play it.
</p>
<p>
I also time-capped it at 4 weeks. I had to have something playable and
published before Christmas.
</p>
<p>
And so I created
<a href="https://herman-the-merman.itch.io/night-raid" target="_blank">NIGHT
RAID</a>, a game set in World War II where you control an anti-aircraft
gun (using the crank), as well as a set of spotlights to hold off waves
of Axis bombers, zeppelins, tanks, and a few other enemy types.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="NIGHT RAID" src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMjQyOTk0MS8xNDM4NTg3My5wbmc=/794x1000/ld%2FJXL.png"/>
</p>
<p>
There are no levels, just an algorithmic increase in difficulty and a
high-score system, which meant that I could focus on learning without
spending too much time on level design.
</p>
<p>
And I did it! And it was super fun! Not only did I learn a great deal
about Lua and the Playdate SDK, but also about 1-bit pixel art,
animation systems, and optimising code for slow devices. I even tried my
hand at sound effects but eventually just bought a big ol’ library of
sounds.
</p>
<p>
By taking the small project from concept to publishing also taught me
about distribution methods of Playdate games, and introduced me to the
community. There’s a good subreddit and Discord group for Playdate
developers, and it’s a niche enough device that the players are actually
friendly.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
This method of learning isn’t universally good, but I find it great for
craft-specific learning. To apply it to carpentry would look something
like:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Watch a bunch of carpentry tutorials on YouTube (preferably involving
only the tools you have access to).
</li>
<li>
Choosing a small project to build, such as a side table, or jewellery
box (as opposed to a vanity or large office desk).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
And that’s how I (usually) learn new skills.
</p>
<p>
This year I’m going to be working on a Playdate game I’ve had in the
back of my mind for quite a while. Something something ninja something
kitty. Stay tuned!
