## 2024-06-23 Adjudicating the difficulty

date: 2024-06-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-06-23-adjudicating-the-difficulty">2024-06-23 Adjudicating the difficulty</h1>

<p>I was listening in on an exchange between <a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social">@phf</a> and <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@kyonshi" title="@kyonshi@dice.camp">@kyonshi</a>. They were talking about <a href="Traveller">Traveller</a> and Peter noted that he didn&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;somewhat mysterious difficulty classes of some tests&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t like this, either! It&rsquo;s exhausting. I feel drained when I do it.</p>

<p>I started thinking about this for a while and maybe the following provides for an interesting way to talk about rules in role-playing games.</p>

<p>Note that the problem shows up in many places. For example, I don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;the ladder&rdquo; in <a href="Fudge">Fudge</a> and <a href="Fate">Fate</a> games where I as the referee need decide whether opponents are &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;very good&rdquo; at fighting the player characters. For me, this is the same problem, except it happens behind the screen. Player&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t know about this.</p>

<p>Using classic D&amp;D or similar rules and running a megadungeon is comparatively easy, because the monster hit dice are tied to dungeon levels. Once I know the dungeon level, I can pick appropriate monsters and their stats automatically determine &ldquo;the difficulty classes of some tests.&rdquo; This might be one of the reasons that makes it easier to run D&amp;D with self-made dungeons.</p>

<p>So this is the first solution to the problem of having to assign difficulties to rolls: The game can have a small number of actions that require a dice roll. Each roll has clear conditions of success. The referee doesn&rsquo;t have to assess the difficulty as soon as the situation is established. D&amp;D would be an example of this kind of game. You roll to hit, to do damage, to save, and all the target numbers are known once the monster is on the table. In classic D&amp;D, traps have only one difficulty setting so thieves only need to know a single number. Hidden doors are either concealed or secret. Those are the two difficult settings for finding the hidden door and thus the referee only needs to know two numbers (1-in-6 or 2-in-6). Of course it breaks down sometimes when a module tells you that a particular door is harder to find (&ldquo;1-in-8&rdquo;) or that a lock is harder to pick (&ldquo;add 20% to the check&rdquo;). But generally speaking, as a referee, very little thought is required. The trade-of is that characters don&rsquo;t have many &ldquo;skills&rdquo;. They have their attack rolls, their saves, the thieves skills, some other d6 abilities like opening doors and listening, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>As soon as skills are introduced, the situations in which dice can be rolled explodes. One way to solve the problem of having to decide the difficulty of every single roll is to a provide a long list of examples from which to extrapolate. I haven&rsquo;t played any game that does that well. Zweihänder provides seven example uses of the skill, one for each difficulty rating. That is amazing.</p>

<p>A game that has a single roll for every skill (great idea) but then provides a lot of help adjudicating the rolls in general isn&rsquo;t helping. I found this to be the case for the few Basic Role-Playing, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, Rolemaster and HARP games I tried. I didn&rsquo;t try many of them. I just checked HARP again and there are examples for some of the skills and not for others, so I&rsquo;d have to play it again to remember whether this was even a problem.</p>

<p>Perhaps one possible solution is to just ignore difficulties and to assume all skill rolls at the default difficulty to be appropriate for adventures. As far as I can remember, this is how we often played these games.</p>

<p>Mongoose Traveller isn&rsquo;t helping, either. There, the target number is always an eight. Almost all the modifiers appear to obvious and well explained, but with the Task Difficulty Dice Modifiers the &ldquo;somewhat mysterious difficulty classes of some tests&rdquo; is back.</p>

<p>Classic Traveller is worse it leans into the referee making up the roll. Sometimes an examples of a skill is provided (&ldquo;navigation expertise can be used as a DM of +1 per level on a throw to determine the needed information&rdquo;) but most of the time it&rsquo;s simply a description of where the skill might be applicable and it&rsquo;s up to the referee to call for an appropriate throw, if at all. At the very beginning, skills are explained as follows: &ldquo;The acquired skills table provides four basic types of results: characteristic alterations (such as +1 strength), weapons expertise (such as blade combat), transport skills (such as ATV), and basic skills (such as navigation).&rdquo; That is to say, sometimes the skill simply means that something can be done. The example that comes to mind is how to recover from serious wounds: &ldquo;Recovery is dependent on medical attention (a medical facility and an individual with medical-3 skill; recuperation to full strength without medical attention is not possible).&rdquo; The medic doesn&rsquo;t have to roll at all. Having the skill is all that counts.</p>

<p>This brings me to the last category: negotiation. This what I learned from Burning Wheel: Before a roll is made, players declare what they want and the referee determines the difficulty of the roll and explains the consequences of failure. Then players decide whether they want to make the roll. Implicitly, they can change their mind, declare a different goal and see whether they like the odds and consequences better. I like this a lot.</p>

<p>Of course, turning every skill roll into a negotiation can be tiresome. If people remember what the previous result of similar negotiations was, the system takes on aspects of case law. As soon as the people of the table realize that a similar situation was resolved using this or that, and there are no circumstances that warrant a change, then the negotiation is skipped.</p>

<p>Then again, a long lists of conditions and modifiers can also take on aspects of case law.</p>

<p>So perhaps this is what I think all these rules texts evolve into: Any rule system where referees set the difficulty imply a system where players can enter a short negotiation. In order to avoid future negotiations, the table remembers the outcomes and uses them as shortcuts for future situations.</p>

<p>Once you know this, the approach by some games to simply do a fixed difficulty roll such as 50% rate of success makes sense if you assume that there is some sort of negotiation and case law powering it all. Sometimes the penalty of failure is scorn and insults, sometimes it&rsquo;s death. It depends on the situation but there&rsquo;s always a way to negotiate for the two outcomes that seem acceptable to the table.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t found a perfect solution, for me. I like it both ways. A game like <a href="Halberds_and_Helmets">Halberts &amp; Helmets</a> is much like D&amp;D where as a game like <a href="Halberts">Halberts</a> is one where all effects outside of combat have to be negotiated but it&rsquo;s not as wild and free as Classic Traveller.</p>

## The Name ‘Siddhartha’

date: 2024-06-24, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>Since Vivian was a teenager, apparently, it&rsquo;s been his long-held dream to name a son Siddhartha and call him Sid for short, so as to honour both his Hindu heritage <em>and</em> Syd Barrett, his rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll idol. Pretty much as soon as Viv told me this dream, I poured cold water on it. Honestly, I did not believe that &ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo; was a name that actual, real-life human beings are given. Vivian insisted it was, so after a few years of back-and-forth, I finally deigned to search the internet to see if I could find any actual, real-life human beings with this name. The result was that every single &ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo; I found was a French speaker (of Indian heritage) – professionals living in cities like Lyon, Geneva, Montreal&hellip; so of course I took this back to Vivian and said all accusatorily, &ldquo;You want to give our child a French name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This turns out to be a really good way to wind him up – I can say this, because he&rsquo;s compelled me to make the same argument repeatedly since – because he starts whining, &ldquo;Nooooo, it&rsquo;s an Indian name!&rdquo; and I tell him that random LinkedIn profiles on the internet don&rsquo;t lie, and our child is not getting a French name.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It&rsquo;s really funny how worked up he gets about it. Anyway.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;re actually <em>having</em> a child, of course, we&rsquo;re having all these discussions again, even though we don&rsquo;t know Baby&rsquo;s sex yet. &ldquo;Sid&rdquo; has been Viv&rsquo;s pet name for the growing creature in my belly, and I do often go along with it, although I also point out regularly that that&rsquo;s <em>never</em> going to be their actual name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he jokes, &ldquo;when you die in childbirth, there&rsquo;ll be no one to stop me putting whatever I want on the birth certificate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha-ha,&rdquo; I retort, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not gambling on those odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, we <em>have</em> started putting together an <em>actual</em> shortlist, consisting of names that are Indian in origin, but are either <em>also</em> English/Irish names <em>or</em>, at least, don&rsquo;t sound markedly foreign in English. This is what Viv said he really liked about the whole &ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo;/&ldquo;Sid&rdquo; thing, and I think <em>that&rsquo;s</em> a fair enough goal&hellip; just not the actual name &ldquo;Siddhartha&rdquo;. Un­for­tun­ately, Viv&rsquo;s next favourite name isn&rsquo;t so much &ldquo;an Irish name&rdquo; as &ldquo;the Irish word for &lsquo;bread&rsquo;&rdquo;, but we&rsquo;ll get there.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Actually, as far as <em>girls&rsquo;</em> names go there are a number of French-origin names I like – I&rsquo;m talking ones well-assimilated into English though – but regardless, I think I have to stand on my principles now.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

## Episode 134 - Beyond the Punch

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">This episode I'm opening up my research vault to present some interesting pre-digital technology. Back before computers us humans used to write everything down on paper. Over time that lead to some organizational issues. By 1890 punch cards show up to solve one aspect of this problem, but that technology had it's limitations. We will be looking at other paper-based approaches to data management, as I slowly try and explain a realization I've come to about the early history of hypertext.</p>

## Mozilla acquires ad analytics company, for some reason

date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News

One of my biggest concerns regarding the state of the web isn&#8217;t ads (easily blocked) or machine learning (the legal system isn&#8217;t going to be kind to that), but the possible demise of Firefox. I&#8217;ve long been worried that with the seemingly never-ending downward marketshare spiral Firefox is in &#8211; it&#8217;s at like 3% now on desktop, even less on mobile &#8211; Mozilla&#8217;s pretty much sole source of income will eventually pull the plug, leaving the already struggling browser effectively for dead. I&#8217;ve continuously been warning that the first casualty of the downward spiral would be Firefox on platforms other than Windows and macOS. So, what do we make of Mozilla buying an online advertising analytics company? Mozilla has acquired Anonym, a trailblazer in privacy-preserving digital advertising. This strategic acquisition enables Mozilla to help raise the bar for the advertising industry by ensuring user privacy while delivering effective advertising solutions. ↫ Laura Chambers They way Mozilla explains buying an advertising network is that the company wants to be a trailblazer privacy-conscious online advertising, since the current brand of online advertising, which relies on massive amounts of data collection, is unsustainable. Anonym instead employs a number of measures to ensure that privacy is guaranteed, from anonymous analytics to employing differential privacy when it comes to algorithms, ensuring data can&#8217;t be used to tack individual users. I have no reason to doubt Mozilla&#8217;s intentions here &#8211; at least for now &#8211; but intentions change, people in charge change, and circumstances change. Having an ad network integrated into the Mozilla organisation will surely lead to temptations of weakening Firefox&#8217; privacy features and ad-blocking abilities, and just overall I find it an odd acquisition target for something like Mozilla, and antithetical to why most people use Firefox in the first place. What really doesn&#8217;t help is who originally founded Anonym &#8211; two former Facebook executives, backed by a load of venture capital. Do with that little tidbit of information as you please.

## Fighting bots

date: 2024-06-23, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>With great timing, a post by Nicolas titled “<a href="https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/06/23/should-i-remove-this-blog-from-google-search">Should I remove this blog from Google Search?</a>” landed in my RSS feed earlier today. I’ve been thinking a lot about the current phase the web is going through, especially after reading all the various news related to Perplexity AI. I don’t think they’re especially bad or wrong in what they’re doing, I’m sure the other companies are equally as bad and they’re also not giving half of a fuck about ingesting whatever they can find if it helps make their products better. They don’t care about book authors, they don’t care about journalists and they for sure don’t care about small personal bloggers.</p>
<p>That brings up the question: what do we do? What even can we do? It’s obvious that robots.txt is no longer an option because most companies don’t even bother checking it. We can try to block the user agents at a server level but they can avoid that by simply sending a generic UA. We could de-list our sites but that would make it very hard for actual users to find our content and I suspect the point of writing for most of us is to share and connect with others. The legal system sure ain’t gonna fix this situation anytime soon. So what’s left? I guess there are only two options left:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept the fact that some dickheads will do whatever they want because that’s just the world we live in</li>
<li>Make everything private and only allow actual human beings access to our content</li>
</ol>
<p>Both solutions are suboptimal. Reading Nicolas's post made me also think about something else. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of Perplexity for example, a company that obviously steals content, lies, doesn’t really credit its sources, and — on top of it all — ignores the robots.txt rules from websites. If I were the TechCrunch, the New York Times, and the Financial Times of the world, I would simply stop reporting on the company. Not a blip on the radar, radio silence, except for their next fuck up. And then good luck finding investors if no one talks about you. They had their chance, they blew it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What if Google decided to do that? What if Google decided to not return any result related to a company like Perplexity? I know it’s obviously not going to happen but wouldn’t that be funny?</p>                <hr>

## Go West

date: 2024-06-23, from: Status-Q blog

We&#8217;ve been away for the last week or so on the south coast of Cornwall, and it was a great trip. We had our folding e-bikes inside the van, and our little boat behind, which meant it wasn&#8217;t always the easiest setup to take along narrow Cornish lanes, especially if we found ourselves needing to <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/06/23/12084/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## Andrew S. Tanenbaum receives ACM Software System Award

date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News

Andrew S. Tanenbaum, professor emeritus of Computer Science at VU Amsterdam, receives the ACM Software System Award for MINIX, which influenced the teaching of Operating Systems principles to multiple generations of students and contributed to the design of widely used operating systems, including Linux. Tanenbaum created MINIX 1.0 in 1987 to accompany his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation. MINIX was a small microkernel-based UNIX operating system for the IBM PC, which was popular at the time. It was roughly 12,000 lines of code, and in addition to the microkernel, included a memory manager, file system and core UNIX utility programs. It became free open-source software in 2000. ↫ VU Amsterdam website Definitely a deserved award for Tanenbaum, and it&#8217;s a minuscule bit of pride that VU Amsterdam happens to be my Alma mater. He also wrote an article for OSNews way back in 2006, detailing MINIX 3, which is definitely a cool notch to have on our belt.
