## Tropical Storm Hector Forecast Discussion Number 4

Tropical Storm Hector Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082024
500 AM HST Mon Aug 26 2024

Microwave imagery continues to show evidence of northerly shear 
over the cyclone, with the mid-level center displaced a little to 
the south of the surface center.  However, the overall cloud 
pattern appears to be slightly better organized than it was 
yesterday with some evidence of banding features over the eastern 
portion of the circulation.  The advisory intensity has been 
increased a bit, to 45 kt, in agreement with subjective Dvorak 
Current Intensity Numbers from TAFB and SAB.
 
Center fixes from geostationary and microwave imagery give a 
westward motion at around 270/9 kt.  A weak low- to mid-level ridge 
is currently situated to the north of Hector, and the global 
models suggest that the ridge will build a little in a few days.  
The track guidance calls for a west-northwestward to westward 
heading with a slight increase in forward speed for the next 3-5 
days.  The official forecast is similar to the previous one and 
follows the dynamical model consensus predictions.

Although the vertical shear is not forecast to be very strong, 
Hector is expected to traverse marginal SSTs for the next few days 
while it moves over or near the oceanic wake of Hurricane Gilma.  
Also, the global models show the system encountering increasingly 
dry air at low- to mid-levels.  The intensity guidance does not 
call for much additional strengthening and the official 
forecast is at the high end of the model predictions.  With the
expected less favorable environment, a weakening trend is likely to 
begin in a couple of days.  Simulated satellite imagery from the 
ECMWF and GFS models show little or no deep convection associated 
with Hector by the end of the forecast period, so the official 
forecast calls for the system to become a remnant low at that time.

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTH DAKOTA...EXTREME NORTHERN NEBRASKA...MINNESOTA...AND
WISCONSIN...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SURROUNDING THE
ENHANCED RISK...AND ACROSS PORTIONS OF NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm gusts, large to very large hail and a few
tornadoes are possible today and tonight across parts of South
Dakota, extreme northern Nebraska, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

...Synopsis...
In mid/upper levels, a persistent and large anticyclone has shifted
its center across the southern Plains to the lower Missouri Valley,
with ridging northeastward across the Lake Superior and James Bay
regions.  The ridge will shift eastward across the Upper Great Lakes
and southern QC through the period.  This will occur in response to
these developments on either side:
1.  A broad but not very intense cyclone -- initially centered near
the western ME/QC border -- will pivot roughly eastward to the
adjoining parts and the Canadian Maritimes through the period.  As
this occurs, a shortwave trough/vorticity lobe -- now in the western
semicircle of the cyclone over the St. Lawrence Valley -- should dig
southward across eastern NY and extreme western New England today,
then weaken and move offshore from the southern New England Coast
tonight.
2.  A strong shortwave trough -- initially over western MT,
southeastern ID and northern UT -- should move to eastern MT and
central WY by 00Z, then to the western Dakotas within 12 more hours.
This will foster the northeastward ejection of two weak
perturbations, now apparent in moisture-channel imagery over the
western NE Panhandle/southeastern WY region into southwestern SD,
the other over central/eastern CO.  By 00Z, these features should
reach eastern ND and eastern/southern SD, respectively.

At the surface, 11Z analysis showed a low near FSD, with cold front
arching southwestward across the NE Sandhills then northwestward to
another low over east-central WY near CPR.  A quasistationary
frontal zone was drawn from the low northeastward over western/
northern MN.  The low should move slowly eastward today while the
poleward frontal extension moves little, and the cold front moves
southeastward into northwestern IA and eastern/central NE.  The
western segment of that front should hang up over northwestern NE
and east-central WY amid mass response to the approaching shortwave
trough, which also should induce a surface trough and perhaps
secondary/reinforcing baroclinic zone across the lee of the
north-central Rockies over eastern WY and into southeastern MT.

...North-central Plains to Upper Midwest...
Two main rounds of severe-thunderstorm potential are apparent today,
each crossing portions of the main risk area, which represents an
aggregated severe potential from both complexes.  From east to west:

1.  Strong-severe thunderstorms should develop over eastern SD near
or north/northwest of the surface low this afternoon -- perhaps
arising as early and far west as central SD during midday.  This
activity will be related to maximized low-level lift associated with
the low, and a plume of large-scale ascent preceding the weaker
shortwave troughs, and already supporting convection at this time
over western SD.  Whether the ongoing convection will be continuous
with later activity is uncertain.  In either event, this eastern
complex should intensify substantially over the southeastern
SD/southwestern MN/northwestern IA vicinity as it crosses the
low-level baroclinic zone and encounters a strongly unstable, richly
moist boundary layer, with upper 60s to mid 70s surface dewpoints. 
Beneath steep lower-middle-level lapse rates, this should contribute
to a corridor of 3500-5000 J/kg MLCAPE near I-90 from the FSD area
to near the Mississippi River, decreasing to a still-favorable
2000-4000 J/kg in central MN.  Supercells with destructive hail,
potentially significant-severe gusts, and a few tornadoes are
possible, though so is fairly quick upscale expansion.

2.  An area of convection may develop as early as late morning to
midday well behind the surface cold front, in higher terrain of
northern/central WY, initially with a marginal severe threat.  This
convection should be supported by at least modest low/middle-level
moisture, and strong cooling/destabilization aloft, related to the
swath of strong large-scale DCVA/ascent immediately preceding the
northern Rockies shortwave trough.  This activity may be an
outgrowth or extension of nonsevere thunderstorms now over extreme
western WY near the Star and Hams Fork Valleys and adjacent ranges. 
These thunderstorms should organize into an MCS and expand/intensify
as activity proceeds into greater moisture, instability and
storm-relative/post-frontal low-level flow to the east, on the High
Plains and near the Black Hills.

Northeasterly to easterly flow behind the front and near the trough,
beneath strengthening southwest flow aloft, will support 45-60 kt
effective-shear magnitudes.  Buoyancy will increase eastward as the
convection -- which may already have evolve into an outflow-dominant
arc by the time it gets into greater moisture east of the Black
Hills -- further intensifies into the northern part of a corridor of
1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE and still-favorable storm-relative boundary-
layer flow.  Some of this convection may be supercellular to the
extent it can remain at least somewhat discrete, with severe wind
and large to very large hail possible. With time, wind will dominate
as the main threat.  This activity should encounter the outflow from
the other complex somewhere over southeastern SD or southern MN
tonight.

Mesoscale uncertainty over the positioning and strength of the
outflow (and thus threat of severe to its poleward side) preclude
greater unconditional probabilities at this time.  Still, a focused
corridor of destructive winds remains a possibility across southern
parts of SD/MN, some of it potentially affecting areas struck by the
first complex.

...Northeastern CONUS...
Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms should develop over
portions of eastern NY and New England, as well as parts of
western/central PA and northwestern MD -- each moving southward to
southeastward through a favorable airmass for organized convection. 
Strong to locally severe gusts are possible, along with severe hail.

Over the New England part of the outlook, cold air aloft, overlying
low-level moisture represented by mid/upper 50s F surface dewpoints,
should combine with limited diurnal heating to remove MLCINH, and
support peak/preconvective MLCAPE ion the 1000-1500 J/kg range. 
Though low-level flow will be modest, relatively straight/lengthy
hodographs will support some hail potential.  Further southwest,
greater low-level moisture (dewpoints mostly mid/upper 60s to near
70 F at lower elevations) but weaker mid/upper-level lapse rates
will be present, yielding similar CAPE values but with different
vertical distribution of buoyancy (more skewed to low levels). 
Still, enough deep/speed shear will be present to support organized
multicells and at least transient/isolated supercells.

## Tropical Storm Hone Forecast Discussion Number 16

date: 2024-08-26, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>

000
WTPA41 PHFO 260850
TCDCP1
 
Tropical Storm Hone Discussion Number  16
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Hone appears quite disorganized on satellite and radar this 
evening. However, the earlier exposed low level circulation center 
is once again obscured by layered cloud, and a ragged band of deep 
convection has redeveloped around a portion of the low level 
circulation center. The current intensity has been reduced to 60 kt, 
which is a blend of the unanimous data-T numbers and current 
intensity estimates from the fix agencies. This could be generous, 
given Hone's messy appearance.

The initial motion is 280/12. Deep layer ridging to the north of 
Hone is expected to maintain the system on a westerly track the 
next few days. Later in the forecast period, Hone is expected to be 
increasingly steered by the low level tradewind flow to the south 
of a vast subtropical ridge spanning much of the Pacific. The track 
guidance remains tightly clustered and the latest official forecast 
is very similar to the previous.

The UW-CIMSS shear analysis shows Hone is already in an environment 
of moderate shear. Over the next few days, Hone will continue to 
skirt along the southern periphery of the subtropical jet, 
subjecting the system to increasing westerly shear. This should 
continue the weakening trend, despite a gradual increase in sea 
surface temperatures along the forecast track. The intensity 
forecast continues to agree well with the statistical and dynamical 
guidance, and dissipation is expected as a remnant low late in the 
week.

Mahalo to both the U.S. Air Force Reserve and NOAA Hurricane 
Hunters for gathering much critical data from Tropical Cyclone Hone 
the last few days.

## Hurricane Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 33

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  33
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
This evening's satellite presentation consists of a ragged
partially obscured eye with a small inner core open in the south
semi-circle.  Gilma's cloud pattern continues to deteriorate slowly
and has shed most of the associated convective bands with the
exception of fragmented curved band wrapping in from the south.
The initial intensity is lowered to 85 kt and is based on the
Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB and a blend
of the UW-CIMSS ADT, AiDT, and DMINT objective estimates, yielding
83 kt.
 
Water vapor imagery and global model RH/700mb fields indicate that
the cyclone is moving toward a dry, stable air mass, indicative of
a large low-level stratocumulus cloud deck intruding from the
northwest in the GOES-18 Proxy-VIS images.  Subsequently, the
statistical GFS/ECMWF SHIPS indicated a mid-level/700-500mb RH of
42 percent.  This inhibiting thermodynamic contribution, along with
increasing west-to-west-southwesterly shear noted in the
statistical SHIPS intensity guidance, particularly beyond 36 hrs,
should cause Gilma to weaken at a quicker rate through day 5.
The NHC intensity forecast is a compromise of the Decay-SHIPS and
the IVCN intensity consensus and shows Gilma degenerating to a
post-tropical cyclone in 4 days.
 
Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 280/8 kt,
and is moving in the southern periphery of a mid-tropospheric
subtropical ridge extending westward across the tropical-eastern
Pacific from northwestern Mexico.  The global and regional models
are fairly clustered together and indicate a slightly to the right
of the initial track motion, or west-northwestward beyond the 60 hr 
period, and the official forecast follows suit.  Along-track 
differences continue to be a model inconsistency, but following the 
skilled TVCE and HCCA consensus models have been the best track 
forecast solution so far.
 
Gilma's 50 kt wind radii have been slightly adjusted based on a 
0559 UTC METOP-C ASCAT overpass.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CDT Mon Aug 26 2024

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify and traverse the northern Rockies
tomorrow (Tuesday), encouraging strong surface gradient winds over
the Pacific Northwest in response to a deepening surface lee trough.
Dry and windy conditions are likely along and to the lee of the
Cascades, where fuels are at least modestly receptive to wildfire
spread. Here, 15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds may overlap
with dry fuels and 15-25 percent RH for at least a few hours. As
such, Elevated highlights have been added to address the regionally
favorable wildfire-spread threat.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 PM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS
OF FAR NORTHERN NEBRASKA...EXTREME NORTHWEST IOWA...EASTERN SOUTH
DAKOTA...SOUTHERN/CENTRAL MINNESOTA...AND FAR WESTERN WISCONSIN...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected to evolve within a zone extending from
the northern/central High Plains eastward to Wisconsin Monday
afternoon into the nighttime hours. Large to very large hail, and
swaths of severe, potentially damaging, gusts are expected,
especially across South Dakota into Minnesota.  A few severe storms
producing strong gusts and hail are also expected across southern
New England.

...South Dakota into MN/WI and vicinity...

An upper shortwave trough will develop east/northeast from the
Intermountain West to the Dakotas on Monday. This will flatten the
upper ridge over the Upper Midwest and a belt of enhanced
southwesterly mid/upper flow (50-60 kt at 500 mb) will overspread
the region. By late afternoon, 700 mb flow is expected to increase
to around 40-50 kt. Vertical wind profiles, and effective shear
magnitudes increasing to greater than 40 kt, will support supercell
thunderstorms. 

At the surface, a cold front will extend from northern MN
southwestward into western SD during the morning. The front will
develop southeast through the day and into the evening, becoming
positioned from western WI/IA to the NE/KS border by Tuesday
morning. Ahead of the front, a very moist airmass (upper 60s to mid
70s F dewpoints) will be in place across portions of MN/WI/IA and
eastern SD, while a dryslot will be oriented over NE nosing into far
southeast SD/western IA. With increasing ascent through the day, and
persistent low-level warm advection, MLCIN should gradually erode.
MLCAPE values across warm/moist sector are forecast as high as
3000-5000 J/kg, decreasing with southwest extent into the drier
airmass. Steep midlevel lapse rates will within the strong to
extremely unstable airmass will support robust updrafts, and initial
supercell thunderstorms are expected to develop along the cold front
from SD into MN. Large to very large (isolated stones greater than 2
inches diameter) will be possible. While damaging gusts will also be
possible with cellular activity, one or more bowing segments/MCSs
are expected to develop into the evening hours as convection shifts
northeast across eastern SD/MN and eventually WI. As this occurs,
potential for severe/damaging wind swaths will increase and a few
gusts greater than 65 kt/75 mph are possible. Tornado potential is a
bit more uncertain, but would likely be locally increased near and
east of the surface low where low-level flow will remain more
southeasterly. This will enhance low-level SRH and frontal
convergence and a few tornadoes are possible with either supercells
or within mesovortex formation along bowing segments.

...Northern/Central High Plains...

Within the drier boundary-layer across southeast MT/eastern WY
southward into eastern CO/western KS/western NE, scattered
thunderstorms are expected to develop as the main upper trough
overspreads the area during the afternoon. High-based thunderstorms 
amid steep low-level lapse rates will pose a risk for
strong/isolated severe outflow winds. Isolated large hail also is
possible, mainly from eastern WY into western SD/NE.

...New England and portions of the Upper OH Valley/Mid-Atlantic...

Modestly enhanced deep-layer northwesterly flow on the back side of
an upper trough will overspread the region. Pockets of 60 F
dewpoints and cool temperatures aloft will support modest
destabilization during the afternoon and thunderstorm bands/clusters
are expected. Locally strong gusts will be possible with the
activity. Isolated large hail also may be possible, especially over
southern New England where forecast hodographs show more favorable
vertical shear and elongated/straight hodographs.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1156 AM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

Based on the latest observational data and high-resolution guidance,
an Elevated area was added over portions of southwest/central Utah
with this update. Here, breezy southwesterly surface winds
(sustained 20-25 mph) will overlap 15-20 percent RH ahead of a cold
front this afternoon. Despite slightly cooler temperatures and
higher RH than previous days, the breezy/gusty winds amid a couple
ongoing fire incidents warrant the highlights. Elsewhere, the
previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Weinman.. 08/25/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level trough is forecast to gradually shift from the
Northern Great Basin into the Northern Rockies through tonight.
Ascent associated with the trough should foster isolated to widely
scattered thunderstorms this afternoon/evening across portions of
Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, and Nevada. While a mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms is expected, fast-moving thunderstorms atop receptive
fuels may promote new ignitions, especially along the periphery of
any heavier thunderstorm precipitation cores. In addition, gusty and
erratic outflow winds are possible with the strongest storms. Please
see the SPC Day 1 Convective Outlook for more information on the
nearby severe thunderstorm risk across portions of Wyoming.

Day 1 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1138 AM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Valid 251630Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN PLAINS/UPPER MIDWEST AND CENTRAL ROCKIES...

CORRECTED FOR NDFD THUNDER

...SUMMARY...
Severe wind gusts and hail are most probable today over parts of the
Four Corners to southwestern Wyoming, and this evening over portions
of the eastern Dakotas and western Minnesota.

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop along/ahead of the
cold front and near a South Dakota surface wave, primarily this
evening after 00Z/7pm CDT, although enough moistening and heating
may occur for isolated late-afternoon development. Some supercells
and bowing lines/clusters are expected, with large hail and severe
wind gusts possible.

Intensifying thunderstorm development should occur as the front
encounters what is left of a diurnally well-heated and
still-unstable boundary-layer airmass. Forecast soundings indicate
the moist layer should deepen through the day beneath strong capping
and steep mid-level lapse rates, MLCAPE in the 3000-4000 J/kg range
possible. This will occur with gradually strengthening
west-southwesterly winds aloft with 30-45 kt effective shear.

Additional severe storms may occur late this afternoon into evening
within an evolving post-frontal environment across northeast Wyoming
into northwest South Dakota/southwest North Dakota, with moderate
buoyancy and very long/straight hodographs potentially supporting
storms capable of hail and possibly severe-caliber wind gusts.

...Central/southern Rockies...
Scattered thunderstorms are ongoing early today across eastern Utah
and western Colorado in advance of an upper-level trough centered
over Nevada. A greater coverage and intensity of storms should occur
into the afternoon as the boundary layer further warms/destabilizes.
Relatively strong mid/high-level southwesterlies will support ample
deep-layer/effective shear, with supercells and bowing clusters
possible in a corridor spanning portions of the Four Corners area to
northern Colorado/southwest Wyoming. Elongated and semi-straight
hodographs will support large-hail potential aside from a broader
regional risk for severe-caliber wind gusts.

...South-central High Plains...
Scattered slow-moving thunderstorms are expected this afternoon
particularly across eastern Colorado and northeast New Mexico.
Hot/well-mixed boundary layers within the pre-convective environment
will support the possibility of strong to locally severe-caliber
wind gusts through late afternoon until around sunset.

Mesoscale Discussion 1987
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1127 AM CDT Sun Aug 25 2024

Areas affected...parts of eastern Utah...adjacent northwestern
Colorado and southwestern Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251627Z - 251830Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying renewed thunderstorm development is possible
across much of eastern Utah by 1-2 PM MDT.  Widely scattered
stronger storms may pose a risk for severe hail and wind while
spreading northeastward and eastward through late afternoon.  While
it is still not yet certain that a severe weather watch will be
needed, trends are being monitored for this possibility.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of a seasonably vigorous short wave trough
slowly progressing east-northeastward through the Great Basin, a
narrow band of large-scale ascent continues to gradually spread east
of the Wasatch.  This is in the wake of initial low-level warm
advection driven convection now spreading spreading northeastward
through the Colorado and adjacent Wyoming Rockies, with insolation
across a relatively moist boundary layer over much of eastern Utah
contributing to increasing destabilization.

Through 18-20Z, models suggest that mixed-layer CAPE may increase to
500-1000 J/kg, coincident with further strengthening of south to
southwesterly mid/upper wind fields (including 30-70+ kt in the
700-300 mb layer).  As new thunderstorm development begins to
initiate, it appears that this regime will become potentially
conducive to evolution of isolated supercells.  In addition to
posing a risk for large hail, stronger storms may become capable of
producing locally severe wind gusts, particularly as they spread
across the more strongly heated and deeply mixed lower elevations
through late afternoon.

## Hurricane Gilma Forecast Discussion Number 30

date: 2024-08-25, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

Hurricane Gilma Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072024
500 AM HST Sun Aug 25 2024

Over the last 6 hours, Gilma's eye has continued to be present on 
most of the infrared and proxy vis images. However, the eye has 
become a bit more cloud-filled, and the convection over the 
southwestern eyewall is slightly less robust. Although the CI 
numbers from TAFB and SAB are still T-6.0/115 kt, the respective 
Final T numbers are lower than that. Recent UW-CIMSS objective 
intensity estimates range from 84 to 113 kt. Based on a blend of the 
subjective and objective intensity estimates, the initial intensity 
is nudged down slightly to 110 kt for this advisory.

Gilma is currently moving very near the 26C isotherm and is located 
in an environment of low vertical wind shear. The middle troposphere 
is fairly dry in the environment surrounding Gilma, but the cyclone 
has been able to prevent the dry air from entraining into the center 
enough to significantly disrupt the hurricane. The environmental 
conditions are not forecast to become more conducive for 
strengthening. Westerly vertical wind shear is forecast to increase 
slightly by late tonight or early Monday. SSTs should decrease 
slightly along the path of Gilma by late Monday or Monday night. 
Based on these factors, only slow weakening is forecast for the next 
24 h followed by more steady weakening after that. The confidence in 
the intensity forecast seems slightly below average in the 
short-term while Gilma straddles the 26C SST isotherm and remains in 
relatively low shear. In the 24 to 96 h time frame, Gilma should be 
weakening, but the rate at which it weakens is a bit uncertain. By 
day 4, vertical wind shear increases to moderate to strong, making 
it likely that Gilma should be significantly weaker in the 4- to 
5-day time frame. Gilma is forecast to lose its convection and 
become a remnant low by day 5. The NHC intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous one, perhaps showing a slightly slower rate of 
weakening in the 36-72 h period, closer to the latest intensity 
consensus guidance.

Gilma's initial motion is estimated to be westward, or 275/8 kt. A 
strengthening mid-tropospheric subtropical ridge situated to the 
north of the hurricane should steer Gilma on a westward to 
west-northwestward track through the forecast period. The official 
forecast is nearly unchanged from the previous advisory and is close 
to a blend of the TVCE and GFEX.

## Hurricane Hone Forecast Discussion Number 13

date: 2024-08-25, from: Central Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>

WTPA41 PHFO 251436
TCDCP1
 
Hurricane Hone Discussion Number  13
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012024
500 AM HST Sun Aug 25 2024
 
Hone is passing by around 40 nautical miles south of South Point on 
the Big Island of Hawaii this morning, where it is within radar 
range. Combined radar, and data from an Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance aircraft mission earlier this morning, support 
raising the initial intensity of Hone to 75 knots, keeping it a 
Category 1 Hurricane. Despite recent subjective Dvorak estimates 
suggesting a slightly lower intensity, the satellite presentation 
has evolved markedly overnight, with cold cloud tops near -75 C 
reinforcing the radar and aircraft-based intensities. The initial 
intensity is raised to 75 kt for this advisory.
 
The initial motion of Hone is set at 280/07. This westward 
trajectory is expected to persist over the coming days, influenced 
by a subtropical ridge to the north. However, as Hone remains near 
the Big Island through the early morning hours today, the 
mountainous terrain could influence local steering currents, 
potentially leading to localized and short-term deviations in the 
storm's motion and intensity. As we move into the early to mid 
portion of the week, Hone is projected to encounter increasing 
vertical wind shear, which is expected to weaken the storm and make 
it more shallow. This change in conditions will allow the low-level 
trade wind flow to steer the system toward the west-southwest. The 
official forecast track remains nearly identical to the previous 
advisory and is closely aligned with the tightly clustered consensus 
guidance.
 
Environmental conditions affecting Hone will remain steady over the 
next 12 to 24 h, with sea surface temperatures between 26 C and 27 
C, light to moderate vertical wind shear, and sufficient mid-level 
moisture. This supports maintaining a steady trend in intensity 
through the morning hours today. Although sea surface temperatures 
are forecast to rise to around 27 C tonight and beyond as Hone 
continues westward, increasing vertical wind shear will translate to 
a gradual weakening trend later today through the middle of the 
week. The intensity forecast closely follows dynamical consensus 
guidance.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical Storm conditions will continue on the Big Island through 
the morning hours. Winds are expected to be strongest downslope of 
higher terrain, over headlands, and through passes.
 
2. Hone is expected to produce storm total rainfall of 6 to 12
inches over mainly windward and southeast facing slopes of the Big
Island, with locally higher amounts possible. Rainfall totals of 2
to 4 inches will be possible over portions of the smaller islands,
mainly windward.
 
3. Swells generated by Hone will continue today as this system 
continues westward. Expect dangerous conditions with 
life-threatening surf and rip currents.
