## AlphaBirds, our favorite office game

date: 2024-07-16, from: John August blog

Back in 2017, friends and I came up with a fun little game called AlphaBirds.1 We&#8217;ve been playing it in the office nearly every Friday since then. It’s a word game like Scrabble or Wordle, but faster and more fun. And it&#8217;s ridiculously simple to learn. On your turn, draw two cards. Play one card [&#8230;]

## Niall Harrison Reviews Beyond the Light Horizon by Ken MacLeod

date: 2024-07-14, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Beyond the Light Horizon</strong>, Ken MacLeod (Orbit 978-0-356-51482-6, £10.99, 336 pp, tp) May 2024. Cover by Duncan Spilling. (Pyr 978-1-64506-066-6, $21.00, 336pp, tp) June 2024.</p>
