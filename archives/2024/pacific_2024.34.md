## OPINION ǀ A special response to the article on the cannabis tourism industry — it’s a joke & a DISASTER!

date: 2024-08-21, updated: 2024-08-22, from: Marianas Variety

THE TRUTH of the matter is NEVER underestimate a Teacher, as it has been teachers who touch &amp; shape the future every day. Yet, there are those who still want to apply the old Chamorro strategy of “making your name bad” to try and stop the teacher. The Governor called me and ASKED me to help him fix the Cannabis Tourism Industry and to help get the Hemp Industry started because he knew from when he was the Senate President that if anyone could fix these industries it was Ambrose M. Bennett.  However, with any change being implemented there will always be those who are AGAINST the change and in this case, it was the very Cannabis Commission and a certain Dispensary who have the monopoly of local consumers. But how sad it is the saboteurs were successful in getting the Governor to stop me all because of one article in the newspaper that highlighted my record over the need to fix the industry. They were successful in getting the governor to put a stop to my efforts but that will never erase the problems with the industry and how the People’s money is being USED and even wasted. The CNMI government is NOT turning a profit and I can run circles around the Cannabis Commission, as you will see — just keep reading!

## As Canada braces for rail stoppage, truckers scramble to meet demand

date: 2024-08-21, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>TORONTO &#8212; As Canada braced for a freight rail stoppage that could hit industries ranging from autos to agriculture, the trucking sector said it faced higher demand it could not meet. Unless labor agreements are reached, Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City &#8212; which hold a duopoly &#8212; plan to indefinitely halt operations on Thursday at the same time, marking a first. Canada relies heavily on railways to transport goods and commodities, but trains are already winding down in anticipation of a strike or lockout. Daman Grewal, a senior operations manager with British Columbia-based Centurion Trucking, would normally expect 20 or 30 online postings from shippers seeking trips east across Canada on an August Monday. On Monday morning, he saw more than 500. &#8220;Last week is when a lot of the panic started to set in,&#8221; said Grewal, noting trips for which he charged C$7,000 ($5,139) a few days ago now cost up to C$9,000. &#8220;Similar to COVID, you see the scarcity in supply chain.&#8221; Grewal said Centurion could increase capacity 10% to 20%, largely by reducing driver downtime. &#8220;We would just have to turn the drivers around a little bit quicker,&#8221; he said. </p>

				<p>Last month, for the first time since March 2021, the consumer price index&#8212; the indicator of inflation &#8212; fell below 3% annual increase, hitting 2.9% for July.
