Powell, 2024 superstar, is thinking a lot about friendships and
feelings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There is no such thing as “normal,” but talking to Twisters actor
Glen Powell raises the possibility that… there might be?  Powell, who
has formed a tight relationship with naturalist filmmaker Richard
Linklater over films like Everybody Wants Some!! and this year’s Hit
Man, has resuscitated the art of movie stardom through Regular Guy
swagger. […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Let’s be honest: This fall will, almost objectively, be a turbulent
time, online and off. But if there’s one thing we know to be true about
Polygon readers, it’s that at the end of the day, we all love games,
movies, TV, and weirdo internet lore. None of that goes away in the
challenging moments, […]</p>

<p>The leaves are turning, and the air conditioner is getting put back
into storage — it’s autumn, folks, and that means it’s time to get cozy
with a mug of cider and your Steam Deck. Or whatever your gaming
platform of choice may be. My point is, it’s indoor kids’ time to shine.

<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-23, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>In summer, movie-studio thinking aims toward big-screen spectacles
and as many explosions as possible. In fall, though, the studios’ focus
shifts toward darker fare: melancholy stories for fall and winter, a
huge influx of horror movies around Halloween, and a wave of grimmer
dramas vying for early awards attention. The rest of 2024
isn’t all about dark […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>I’ve been primed, lately, to ask a question that feels important to
understanding Star Wars Outlaws, and it’s this: What is Star Wars,
really? What is the core essence, the Star Wars-ness, of the grand dame
of the space opera genre? Disney’s streaming shows set in the Star Wars
universe — Andor in particular — […]</p>

<p>My hands-on demo for Sid Meier’s Civilization 7 ended at the turning
point of a decisive military operation. At arm’s length from the
station, I continued clicking the mouse as I stood and packed my bag,
desperately trying to claim the capital of Ashoka, leader of the Maurya
Empire. Like in any promising Civilization campaign, […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s been less than a year since Konami released Metal Gear Solid:
Master Collection, a compilation that keeps the first five games in the
series playable on modern hardware. That easy availability is hardly a
given thanks to the wider industry’s disregard for game preservation.
But the collection’s technical limitations and lack of modernization
left […]</p>

<p>Few stories in the history of the world are as famous or have been
told as many times as the tale of Sun Wukong. In fact, a new adaptation
of the story, Black Myth: Wukong, is currently taking the world by
storm, racking up record-breaking numbers on Steam. The game is a

<p>Fields of Mistria, a new farming sim and RPG inspired by the Harvest
Moon series and Stardew Valley, contains its fair share of charms. Its
world has blossoming pink and purple flowers, a witchy bathhouse
decorated with crystals, and a lively cast of characters ready to take
you in and help your character get settled. […]</p>

<p>In the world of TV, you don’t get much more influential than
Homicide: Life on the Street. This police procedural, which ran for
seven seasons on NBC starting in 1993, started the television career of
David Simon, creator of The Wire, and began his work mapping out the
