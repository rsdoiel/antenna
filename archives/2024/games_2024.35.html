Genshin Impact 5.0 release?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Genshin Impact’s 5.0 patch is coming soon, adding the new region of
Natlan, more story quests to complete, and new characters to collect.
Below, we explain when Genshin Impact maintenance starts and ends,
alongside the release time of version 5.0. We’ve also added some details

<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There is no franchise quite like Yakuza. It’s an epic story about the
criminal underworld centered around the stoic and virtuous Kazuma Kiryu,
a.k.a. the Dragon of Dojima, that has a strong dash of surreal and
comical substories. Right now, GOG is offering a massive discount on the
mainline Yakuza series on PC. Through Sept. […]</p>

<p>Last week Dungeons &amp; Dragons publisher Wizards of the Coast
rolled out a controversial changelog for the iconic tabletop
role-playing game’s digital toolset. In it, the Hasbro-owned company
stated that the launch of its revised 5th edition ruleset would require
byzantine workarounds to keep legacy content functioning properly inside
the app. Then, late Sunday night, […]</p>

<p>Nintendo will broadcast a new Nintendo Direct presentation on
Tuesday, Aug. 27, a two-part stream that’s one half Partner Showcase,
one half Indie World. That means you can expect the new Nintendo
Direct’s focus to be on games from major third-party publishers and
games from smaller, independent developers. Tuesday’s Nintendo

<p>There is no such thing as “normal,” but talking to Twisters actor
Glen Powell raises the possibility that… there might be?  Powell, who
has formed a tight relationship with naturalist filmmaker Richard
Linklater over films like Everybody Wants Some!! and this year’s Hit
Man, has resuscitated the art of movie stardom through Regular Guy
swagger. […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-26, updated: 2024-08-26, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Let’s be honest: This fall will, almost objectively, be a turbulent
time, online and off. But if there’s one thing we know to be true about
Polygon readers, it’s that at the end of the day, we all love games,
movies, TV, and weirdo internet lore. None of that goes away in the
challenging moments, […]</p>

<p>The leaves are turning, and the air conditioner is getting put back
into storage — it’s autumn, folks, and that means it’s time to get cozy
with a mug of cider and your Steam Deck. Or whatever your gaming
platform of choice may be. My point is, it’s indoor kids’ time to shine.

<p>In summer, movie-studio thinking aims toward big-screen spectacles
and as many explosions as possible. In fall, though, the studios’ focus
shifts toward darker fare: melancholy stories for fall and winter, a
huge influx of horror movies around Halloween, and a wave of grimmer
dramas vying for early awards attention. The rest of 2024
isn’t all about dark […]</p>

<p>I’ve been primed, lately, to ask a question that feels important to
understanding Star Wars Outlaws, and it’s this: What is Star Wars,
really? What is the core essence, the Star Wars-ness, of the grand dame
of the space opera genre? Disney’s streaming shows set in the Star Wars
universe — Andor in particular — […]</p>

<p>My hands-on demo for Sid Meier’s Civilization 7 ended at the turning
point of a decisive military operation. At arm’s length from the
station, I continued clicking the mouse as I stood and packed my bag,
desperately trying to claim the capital of Ashoka, leader of the Maurya
Empire. Like in any promising Civilization campaign, […]</p>

<p>It’s been less than a year since Konami released Metal Gear Solid:
Master Collection, a compilation that keeps the first five games in the
series playable on modern hardware. That easy availability is hardly a
given thanks to the wider industry’s disregard for game preservation.
But the collection’s technical limitations and lack of modernization
left […]</p>

<p>Few stories in the history of the world are as famous or have been

<p>Fields of Mistria, a new farming sim and RPG inspired by the Harvest
