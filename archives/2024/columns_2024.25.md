## Standards Kitty

date: 2024-06-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Here is the image of the cute yet sad "Standards Kitty." She feels the pain of someone reinventing something while claiming to support open standards. Despite her tears, she's still really adorable.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Why did the Podcast 2.0 people reinvent <a href="http://home.rsscloud.co/">rssCloud</a>? That's the kind of bullshit Google does. We don't do that in the open formats and protocols world. What really pains me is they claim to follow <a href="https://this.how/standards/">my</a> Rules for Standards-makers. Imho they do not. Two rules apply. <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798753000">Rule #1</a> says the only reason we do this is interop. It's called Rule #1 for a reason. And the <a href="https://this.how/standards/#1497798940000">one way</a> is better rule a little further down the page. I've seen this happen twice where people say they abide by the RFSM but then do exactly the opposite of what it says to do. We have to do this better people. Come on. Also come up with something more humble than the name you've chosen. We've been down this path too. The only way it ends is in tears. Meanwhile you've made the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/20/134901.html?title=standardsKitty">Standards Kitty</a> cry.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Now that I'm publishing a podcast feed designed to be read in commercial podcast clients, I'm learning for the first time how they work. For example, they seem to list shows not in the order they discovered them, as I do in my products, rather in order of pubDate. So when I set the dates on the shows from 2004 to their actual dates, that would have worked if I hadn't made a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/19.html#a151601">mistake</a> in GMT-encoding the dates. Stupid programmer (me). Now they will show up first in the lists forever unless I switch to that form of dates. This so totally sucks. I wish there were something in RSS to say "Hey readers dump your cache now, let's start over, because I fcuked up." It wouldn't have mattered anyway, I'm sure none of them would listen, right?

## Sneak Peek: Mundango

date: 2024-06-20, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><tt>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt></p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mundango.png" alt="Screenshot of a Mundango bingo board" width="1200" height="719">
<p><a href="https://mundango.daverupert.com/" class="button">Play Mundango</a></p>
<p>I’ve got something for you. Lately I’ve been getting a lot of joy from life’s small moments; like texting an old friend, seeing a cool bug, or a watching the cardinals zip through my backyard. To nudge my brain towards absorbing more of these mundane pleasures, I built a little game.</p>
<p>Mundango is a game about finding life’s normal things. Each day you get a new game of moments to capture and enjoy. It’s up to you how you play. You can play it like Pokémon Go and try to catch ‘em all or you can visit the board at the end of the day for a bit of reflection. Me? I plunk on it when I’ve got a few spare minutes throughout the day.</p>
<p>I’ve got a couple feature requests on deck but it’s at a point where I’d love more feedback. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davatron5000/112611154594927376">The activities were crowdsourced on Mastodon</a> so if you have some more suggestions of small simple moments that bring you joy, I’d love to hear them. Or if you have general ideas about what would this more interesting (e.g., a turtle mascot), let me know.</p>

ChatGPT is the Ozempic of online info-finding. Neither is a panacea, there are side-effects, but both make possible great feats that weren't possible before, and both have come about just in the last year or two.

## Facebook APIs are a sad place

date: 2024-06-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I started to write the code to hook up my linkblogger to Threads, but it led me to the same website with all my broken Facebook apps, the ones that stopped working when they shut down the API after the 2016 election. A reminder that this is still Facebook. And while I don't blame them for shutting down the APIs, the whole experience left a really bad feeling. </p>
<p>So I backed out of the project to give it some more thought. Do I really want to go down this road?</p>
<p>And of course I had the cute little kitten illustrate.</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/20/kittenStartledByThreadsAPI.png"></center>The kitten is startled by the Facebook developer site.</div></p>
<p>A cute little kitten is sitting at a desk with a laptop, preparing to write an app. The laptop screen shows code for the Threads API from Meta. The kitten has a surprised and concerned expression as she looks at the developer site on another screen, which shows a Facebook logo and reminds her of the events of 2016. In the background, a calendar shows the year 2024. The scene is set in a cozy room with soft lighting and a few toys scattered around, giving it a homely feel.</p>

People of my generation (born 1955) are at the point in our lives when we would feel better if we got credit for our accomplishments, good intentions, the ways we made the world better, but it’s dawning on us that we didn’t make as much of a difference as we hoped to, and what little we did accomplish will largely go unrecognized. Even worse, none of it, even in the short term, made much of a difference. 😂Threads API reminds me wh

## Inside 22,734 Steam games

About a year ago I blogged about games that use curl. In that post I listed a bunch of well-known titles I knew use curl and there was a list of 136 additional games giving credit to curl. Kind of amazing that over one hundred games decided to use curl!

## Recovering Public Keys from Signatures

date: 2024-06-20, updated: 2024-06-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting summary of various ways to <a href="https://keymaterial.net/2024/06/15/reconstructing-public-keys-from-signatures/">derive the public key</a> from digitally signed files.</p>
<blockquote><p>Normally, with a signature scheme, you have the public key and want to know whether a given signature is valid. But what if we instead have a message and a signature, assume the signature is valid, and want to know which public key signed it? A rather delightful property if you want to attack anonymity in some proposed &#8220;everybody just uses cryptographic signatures for everything&#8221; scheme.</p></blockquote>

## Good idea?

date: 2024-06-20, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

The power of blogging! 🦾Trying to explain it to someone else is also a good way to quickly purge bad ideas! Many a time I have realized midway through explanation that it is silly or rooted in unjustified anxieties.

**@Jessica Smith's blog** (date: 2024-06-20, from: Jessica Smith's blog)

<p>So I think my Plex Media Server is basically kaput. The computer got unplugged somehow, and when I tried rebooting it, the unattended upgrades have broken the Linux install to the point that not even &ldquo;recovery mode&rdquo; works any more. I thought Linux Mint was supposed to be kind of idiot-proof but clearly not, lol. Next time I think I&rsquo;ll try Debian Stable&hellip; because clearly what I need is something <strong>stable</strong>! Geez.</p>
<p>Anyway, I cancelled my Spotify subscription a few months ago so I guess I&rsquo;m resorting to YouTube Music now. The experience of using this instead of Plexamp will surely boot my arse into gear to re-setup the Plex server sooner rather than later 😐</p>

## June 19, 2024 

date: 2024-06-20, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Today is the federal holiday honoring Juneteenth, the celebration of the announcement in Texas on June 19th, 1865, that enslaved Americans were free. That announcement came as late as it did because, while General Robert E. Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia to General Ulysses S. Grant of the U.S. Army on April 9, 1865, it was not until June 2 that General Edmund Kirby Smith surrendered the Trans-Mississippi Department, the last major army of the Confederacy, to the United States, in Galveston, Texas. Smith then fled to Mexico.

## New Blog Moderation Policy

date: 2024-06-19, updated: 2024-06-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>There has been a lot of toxicity in the comments section of this blog. Recently, we&#8217;re having to delete more and more comments. Not just spam and off-topic comments, but also sniping and personal attacks. It&#8217;s gotten so bad that I need to do something.</p>
<p>My options are limited because I&#8217;m just one person, and this website is free, ad-free, and anonymous. I pay for a part-time moderator out of pocket; he isn&#8217;t able to constantly monitor comments. And I&#8217;m unwilling to require verified accounts.</p>
<p>So starting now, we will be pre-screening comments and letting through only those that 1) are on topic, 2) contribute to the discussion, and 3) don&#8217;t attack or insult anyone. The standard is not going to be &#8220;well, I guess this doesn&#8217;t technically quite break a rule,&#8221; but &#8220;is this actually contributing.&#8221;...</p>

Technical note. I made a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/19/datesoff.png">mistake</a> in converting local time to GMT in the code that builds the feed. My times were off by four hours. So I corrected them. And now instead of three items in the feed, according to my own feed software, there are now six. I bet all the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dws-podcast0-feed/id1752527298">other</a> systems will do the same thing because the guid is a function of the creation date of the item, and they changed. Oh well. At least the <a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">RSS version</a> only has three items. I think I should change how the guid works.

## The next patriotic kitten

date: 2024-06-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I loved being my own DJ with Napster, and none of the execs or journalists figured out that this was the appeal of getting all the music out from behind the incredibly obsolete and brutal paywall that the music industry had concocted. They didn't give a shit about the users except they wanted our money, there was no love in the connection between the creativity of the artists and the creativity of the users. We supposedly didn't have any. </p>
<p>I'm like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Chapman">Emmett Chapman</a>, an accomplished musician who created a new kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Stick">musicial instrument</a> for himself and others to use. That's what I do with software. I play the tools I make. But what I really get off on is the music the users make. I was thinking about my father yesterday, it would have been his 95th birthday. He died at 80, so there's been plenty of time to process his life as I knew it. The best connection he and I had was silent. I inherited my love for outliners from him, yet that love was latent probably for hundreds of generations in our family. I had the skill and creativity to create such a tool, and finally the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">technology</a> existed, and he let his son turn his mind upside down and inside out. For that he would say Every day is Father's Day. That may be my greatest accomplishment.</p>
<p>I was chatting with my brother yesterday, ChatGPT came up, and I thought (and said) I bet dad would have loved ChatGPT. Then I thought of our uncle Ken, on my mother's side, and said he would have shit his pants over ChatGPT. Ken spent literally hours every day with the meager reference tools he owned in his off the grid cottage near St Augustine. The way I love ChatGPT is the way he would have loved it. I'm absolutely sure of it. My paternal grandfather would have loved it, and I expect my great uncle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_Schmidt">Arno</a> who was a pioneer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">zettlekasten</a> would have also lost his shit over ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the art of a user of ChatGPT (which really needs a shorter name). People's first reaction is that by creating art with ChatGPT I'm stealing. Bollocks. I'm creating.

## The FeedLand stack

date: 2024-06-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>One of the cool things about the way I designed FeedLand internally is that there are various levels of feed stuff. If you want to start over at any level, you can, and today I'm doing exactly that. But first here's the stack:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the lowest level is the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/reallysimple">reallysimple package</a>, which reads any feed and returns a consistent JavaScript object, so the database code only ever sees one kind of feed. All the differences between RSS and Atom are flattened, and features from the source <a href="https://source.scripting.com/">namespace</a> are included, where they are present.  </li>
<li>Above that level is the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedlanddatabase">feedlanddatabase package</a>, which has a Node API that does all the stuff with the SQL database that FeedLand runs off. So if all you want to do is add feeds, subscribe to them, add a user, subscribe to a reading list, build a river, all that stuff is at this level. This is the level at which I'm going to start building today.</li>
<li>Next level up is the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/feedland">feedland package</a>, which implements the REST interface, and handles all the runtime stuff that the FeedLand client needs.</li>
<li>And the final level is the one the user interacts with, it runs in the browser, and makes the REST calls to the feedland server. All the rendering of the objects coming out of the database via the REST interface happens here.  </li>
</ol>
<p>In an <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/06/16.html#a112207">application</a> I'm working on, I found myself reimplementing features of FeedLand, and I stopped myself and said, nooooo use the API that's already there. The advantages are many, including I will be able to use FeedLand to manage the data structures. So that's what I'm doing. Wish me luck.</p>

## The Hacking of Culture and the Creation of Socio-Technical Debt

date: 2024-06-19, updated: 2024-06-18, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Culture is increasingly mediated through algorithms. These algorithms have splintered the organization of culture, a result of states and tech companies vying for influence over mass audiences. One byproduct of this splintering is a shift from imperfect but broad cultural narratives to a proliferation of niche groups, who are defined by ideology or aesthetics instead of nationality or geography. This change reflects a material shift in the relationship between collective identity and power, and illustrates how states no longer have exclusive domain over either. Today, both power and culture are increasingly corporate...</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-06-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I'm highly motivated to support the newly released Threads API, but a quick look indicates that it's a fairly large project. All I want to do is cross-post, along with Masto and Bluesky. I did both those a loooong time ago. But I really want my links to go to threads, and also create a thread-writer for it like the one I did for Twitter and Bluesky. There's no shortage of really interesting projects now, so I think I'm going to have to wait to do this for a while. If anyone makes a really simple Hello World for Threads for Node.js that would make my day. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

You can find it by choosing <i>Open Data Folder</i> from the File menu. You'll see prefs.json. Open it in a text editor, and make the changes you want -- carefully. Probably a good idea to make a copy of the file before editing. But I just did it and laughed out loud, why didn't I think of this before? Heh.

## Rethinking Democracy for the Age of AI

date: 2024-06-18, updated: 2024-06-18, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>There is a lot written about technology&#8217;s threats to democracy. Polarization. Artificial intelligence. The concentration of wealth and power. I have a more general story: The political and economic systems of governance that were created in the mid-18th century are poorly suited for the 21st century. They don&#8217;t align incentives well. And they are being hacked too effectively.</p>
<p>At the same time, the cost of these hacked systems has never been greater, across all human history. We have become too powerful as a species. And our systems cannot keep up with fast-changing disruptive technologies...</p>

## Twenty years ago today

date: 2024-06-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I was talking with a friend over the weekend about the origins of podcasting, and how, in June of 2004, I finally decided to do an audio post, to get my feet wet, and to prove all you needed was a laptop and a little software and you could be doing radio almost as easily as writing a blog post. </p>
<p>That was <a href="http://scripting.com/2004/06/11.html#When:9:13:45AM">June 11, 2004</a>. </p>
<p>Then it hit me, it's June <i>2024</i> now, it's been <i>twenty freaking years</i>. </p>
<p>In hindsight, that podcast was the start of the bootstrap that saw a dozen shows by September and then hundreds and thousands, and now here we are, podcasting has been through quite a few bursts of growth and it's still as open as it was back in June 2004. </p>
<p><b>Anyone with a laptop can do a podcast</b>. That was the goal. You don't need anyone's permission. That was a breakthrough in radio. Prior to that, you had to get a lot of approval, and every step made it less real and less interesting, imho. </p>
<p>My partner in this at the time was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Adam+Curry">Adam Curry</a>. Sometime in that period he started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Source_Code">The Daily Source Code</a>, and then we did a podcast together for a few months called <a href="http://secrets.scripting.com/">Trade Secrets</a>. My own podcast was called <a href="http://morningcoffeenotes.com/">Morning Coffee Notes</a>. </p>
<p>So I thought, why not do a Serial-like podcast over the next few months, with the actual programs from 2004, along with the Trade Secrets shows. I think I have them all archived. And it would be great if Adam did the same with his shows, starting when they started. And Dawn & Drew, Dave Slusher. This can go on forever if you like. (I promise mine won't.)</p>
<p>So here's the URL for the podcast.</p>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml">http://scripting.com/podcast0/rss.xml</a></p>
<p>I'm sure there will be a lot of cringeworthy moments, but what the heck. I'll hopefully have the feed up before the end of the day, and I'll register it with Apple so will hopefully be transcripts. </p>
<p>I hope I can count on you to spread the word, this is how the podcasting bootstrap happened. If you want to learn how two weird geek hippie types like Adam and myself, can have an idea, and then by constantly trying out new approaches, eventually it sticks and becomes a new medium that's still thriving twenty years later. </p>
<p>It should be quite a story! :-)</p>
<p>Here's a picture of myself and Adam at Gnomedex in the summer of 2004. And that's the laptop I used to make all these podcasts. I was living in Seattle at the time. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/17/gnomedexDaveAdam.png"></center>Dave and Adam at Gnomedex in 2004.</div></p>

The benefit is that once you have that, you can also have <em>remote command execution over UUCP</em> using <code>uux</code> and it is as terrifying as it sounds.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see whether I can reconstruct my setup.</p>

<p>I use Debian.</p>

<p>lkh has a &ldquo;travelling laptop&rdquo; that is mostly offline, but sometimes it&rsquo;s online. That&rsquo;s when he wants to exchange stuff with us.
The laptop is called Dwalin.</p>

<p>My server is Campaign Wiki.</p>

<p>The documentation for peering between news servers via UUCP is available via <code>man 8 send-uucp</code>.</p>

<h3 id="var-spool-uucp-ssh-authorized-keys">/var/spool/uucp/.ssh/authorized_keys</h3>

<p>This allows Dwalin to connect via ssh.</p>

<p>lkh sent me this.</p>

<pre><code># dwalins public key, ssh executes the remote
# uucico and hands over my login:
restrict,command=&quot;/usr/sbin/uucico -u Udwalin -l&quot; ssh-rsa another-long-string-of-stuff uucp@dwalin
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-uucp-passwd">/etc/uucp/passwd</h3>

<p>This is where Dwalin&rsquo;s password is stored. This is important because there&rsquo;s no actual Dwalin user on my system.</p>

<p>lkh sent me this.</p>

<pre><code># dwalins login on campaignwiki
Udwalin	some-long-string-of-stuff
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-sys">/etc/sys</h3>

<p>I kept the defaults and added Dwalin.</p>

<pre><code># dwalins system entry, no Port or
# credentials are given, since dwalin
# is expected to always call in.
system dwalin
called-login Udwalin
local-send /
local-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
remote-send /
remote-receive /var/spool/uucppublic
time any
forward ANY
protocol i
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-uucp-config">/etc/uucp/config</h3>

<p>This is where I set my own node name.</p>

<p>lkh sent me some spool related entries. I&rsquo;m not sure whether I needed them.</p>

<pre><code>nodename campaignwiki

spool     /var/spool/uucp
pubdir    /var/spool/uucppublic
lockdir   /var/spool/uucp/Lock
logfile   /var/spool/uucp/Log     # The UUCP log file
statfile  /var/spool/uucp/Stats   # The UUCP statistics file
debugfile /var/spool/uucp/Debug   # The UUCP debugging file
</code></pre>

<h3 id="testing-it">Testing it</h3>

<p>In our case, lkh&rsquo;s Dwalin is connected to kyonshi&rsquo;s Erebor system and here&rsquo;s me sending a file to Erebor via Dwalin (since I&rsquo;m not connected to Erebor directly):</p>

<pre><code>uucp some-local-file 'dwalin!ereborbbs.duckdns.org!~/'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="news">News</h2>

<p>Yes, we want to exchange news. That means we need to install INN.</p>

<p>Look at the requisites:</p>

<pre><code>perldoc /usr/lib/news/bin/send-uucp.pl
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-news-send-uucp-cf">/etc/news/send-uucp.cf</h3>

<p>This define the sites to send news to, how to compress them and how big the batches should be.</p>

<p>Add the following:</p>

<pre><code>dwalin      gzip        1048576
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-news-newsfeeds">/etc/news/newsfeeds</h3>

<p>Determine the newsgroups to send to Dwalin:</p>

<pre><code># newsfeed entry for dwalin
dwalin\
    :casa.*,campaignwiki.*,erebor.*\
    :Tf,Wnb,B4096/1024:
</code></pre>

<h3 id="var-lib-news-active">/var/lib/news/active</h3>

<p>Add the new newsgroups. We don&rsquo;t do control messages.</p>

<p>Use <code>ctlinnd</code> to control the INN daemon.</p>

<pre><code>ctlinnd newgroup erebor.talk y
ctlinnd newgroup erebor.test y
</code></pre>

<h3 id="var-lib-news-newsgroups">/var/lib/news/newsgroups</h3>

<p>Give the new newsgroups a tag line.</p>

<p>Add the following:</p>

<pre><code>erebor.talk             General talk for EreborBBS
erebor.test             Testing connectivity with EreborBBS
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-news-readers-conf">/etc/news/readers.conf</h3>

<p>Make sure the users connecting via NNTP can read the new groups, too.
This is not necessary if you read news via the local spool, I think.</p>

<p>Add <code>erebor.*</code> to the &ldquo;readonly&rdquo; section.</p>

<pre><code>auth &quot;foreignokay&quot; {
    auth: &quot;ckpasswd -f /var/lib/news/newsusers&quot;
    default: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
}

access &quot;authenticatedpeople&quot; {
    users: &quot;*&quot;
    newsgroups: &quot;*,!junk,!control,!control.*&quot;
}

access &quot;readonly&quot; {
    users: &quot;&lt;unauthenticated&gt;&quot;
    read: &quot;local.*,campaignwiki.*,casa.*,cosmic.*,erebor.*,rec.*,de.*,alt.*&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="testing-it-1">Testing it</h3>

<p>Check <code>uulog</code>. Here&rsquo;s where a news article is put into the queue and a few minutes later, Dwalin calls and the enqueued article is sent:</p>

<pre><code>uux dwalin news (2024-06-15 10:22:01.34 3832004) Queuing rnews (D.000R)

</code></pre>

<h2 id="e-mail">E-Mail</h2>

<p>Oh yes, we do.</p>

<p>Debian comes with Exim. Exim uses Perl&rsquo;s &ldquo;taint&rdquo; mechanism wherein user-supplied values cannot be used for commands. They must be untainted by a lookup. For example, a user supplied sender name like &ldquo;alex&rdquo; is tainted, but if you look it up in <code>/etc/passwd</code> it becomes untainted. Perl keeps track of this for you, if you want to. Once you run into the error, however, you need to figure out where you could be looking up the values you have. Is the local part a user on the system, is the domain a local domain? I spent way too much time on this.</p>

<h3 id="etc-exim4-update-exim4-conf-conf">/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf</h3>

<p>This is the file generated by <code>update-exim4.conf</code>.</p>

<p>The result of me answering the questions:</p>

<pre><code>dc_eximconfig_configtype='internet'
dc_other_hostnames='alexschroeder.ch;campaignwiki.org;communitywiki.org;transjovian.org'
dc_local_interfaces='127.0.0.1 ; ::1'

dc_mailname_in_oh='true'
dc_localdelivery='mail_spool'
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the MX records for my domains point to Migadu because that&rsquo;s where SMTP mail should go.</p>

<p>UUCP is what lkh, kyonshi and I use.</p>

<h3 id="etc-exim4-conf-d-router-110-exim4-config-uucp">/etc/exim4/conf.d/router/110_exim4-config_uucp</h3>

<p>A new router for UUCP mail that has to come before <code>200_exim4-config_primary</code>.
If it comes after the primary, then it won&rsquo;t work because the primary router ends with <code>no_more</code>
and as the comment at the end of the file says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <code>no_more</code> above means that all later routers are for domains in the local_domains list</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This router only accepts mail destined for domains listed in the new file <code>/etc/exim4/uucp</code>.</p>

<pre><code>### uucp      
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

uucp_router:
    debug_print = &quot;R: uucp_router for $local_part@$domain&quot;
    driver=accept
    require_files = +/usr/bin/uux
    domains = wildlsearch;/etc/exim4/uucp
    transport = rsmtp
</code></pre>

<h3 id="etc-exim4-uucp">/etc/exim4/uucp</h3>

<p>This is a file that translates the domain names I use for recipients to UUCP names.</p>

<p>It only works for Dwalin:</p>

<pre><code>dwalin	dwalin
</code></pre>

<p>This means that a mail for <code>lkh@dwalin</code> gets recognised as such (because of the first column) and it will be sent to the UUCP system <code>dwalin</code> (because of the second column).</p>

<p>The UUCP system <code>dwalin</code> is correct because <code>/etc/uucp/sys</code> has a section for <code>system dwalin</code> (see above).</p>

<h3 id="etc-exim-conf-d-transport-40-exim4-config-uucp">/etc/exim/conf.d/transport/40_exim4-config_uucp</h3>

<p>The route above says that the transport to use is <code>rsmtp</code>.</p>

<p>Define this using a new transport config file:</p>

<pre><code>### uucp
### based on /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz

rsmtp:
    debug_print = &quot;T: rsmtp for $pipe_addresses&quot;
    driver=pipe
    command = /usr/bin/uux - -r -a${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}} -gC $domain_data!rsmtp
    use_bsmtp
    return_fail_output
    user=uucp
    batch_max = 100
</code></pre>

<p>This was the biggest problem for me. The examples I saw for the <code>-a</code> argument to <code>uux</code> used <code>$sender_address</code>, resulting in an error about the third argument to <code>uux</code> being tainted. You can see these error messages in the exim main log (followed by a log entry showing that exim sends me a en error message):</p>

<pre><code>2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBd-26 &lt;= alex@alexschroeder.ch U=alex P=local S=461
2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBd-26 ** lkh@dwalin R=uucp_router T=rsmtp: Tainted arg 3 for rsmtp transport command: '-aalex@alexschroeder.ch'
2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBh-2Q &lt;= &lt;&gt; R=1sIFXj-00CzBd-26 U=Debian-exim P=local S=1695

2024-06-15 00:37:11 1sIFXj-00CzBh-2Q Completed
</code></pre>

<p>I guess the examples I had seen would only work for older Exim versions that didn&rsquo;t do taint checking.</p>

<p>The code I&rsquo;m using means that I&rsquo;m looking up the sender local part (&ldquo;alex&rdquo; or &ldquo;root&rdquo;) in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and if a match is found, the untainted key is returned (instead of the value from the password list).</p>

<p>You can test these expressions on the command-line:</p>

<pre><code>exim -d+all -be '${lookup{$sender_address_local_part}lsearch,ret=key{/etc/passwd}}'
</code></pre>

<h3 id="testing-it-2">Testing it</h3>

<p>As an ordinary user, use <code>mail</code> on the command line to send mail to <code>lkh@dwalin</code>.</p>

<p>Poor <code>lkh</code>. So many test mails.</p>

<p>As <code>root</code>, check the exim log:</p>

<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus:~# tail /var/log/exim4/mainlog
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a mail being enqueued successfully:</p>

<pre><code>2024-06-15 14:08:42 1sISD4-00GIbQ-1a &lt;= alex@alexschroeder.ch U=alex P=local S=513
2024-06-15 14:08:42 1sISD4-00GIbQ-1a =&gt; lkh &lt;lkh@dwalin&gt; R=uucp_router T=rsmtp
2024-06-15 14:08:42 1sISD4-00GIbQ-1a Completed
</code></pre>

<p>Note the <code>uucp_router</code> and the <code>rsmtp</code> transport being used.</p>

<p>Check <code>uulog</code>. Here&rsquo;s where four mails are put into the queue and a few minutes later, Dwalin calls the enqueued messages are sent:</p>

## Using LLMs to Exploit Vulnerabilities

date: 2024-06-17, updated: 2024-06-11, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01637">Teams of LLM Agents can Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> LLM agents have become increasingly sophisticated, especially in the realm of cybersecurity. Researchers have shown that LLM agents can exploit real-world vulnerabilities when given a description of the vulnerability and toy capture-the-flag problems. However, these agents still perform poorly on real-world vulnerabilities that are unknown to the agent ahead of time (zero-day vulnerabilities).</p>
<p>In this work, we show that teams of LLM agents can exploit real-world, zero-day vulnerabilities. Prior agents struggle with exploring many different vulnerabilities and long-range planning when used alone. To resolve this, we introduce HPTSA, a system of agents with a planning agent that can launch subagents. The planning agent explores the system and determines which subagents to call, resolving long-term planning issues when trying different vulnerabilities. We construct a benchmark of 15 real-world vulnerabilities and show that our team of agents improve over prior work by up to 4.5×...</p></blockquote>

Early in the morning on June 17, 1972, Frank Wills, a 24-year-old security guard at the Watergate Office Building in Washington, D.C., noticed that a door lock had been taped open. He ripped off the tape and closed the door, but when he went on the next round, he found the door taped open again. He called the police, who found five burglars in the Democratic National Committee headquarters located in the building.

## Miscellany № 101: back to our scheduled programming

<p>And you’re back in the room!</p>
<p>I recently submitted the manuscript for my next book, <a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/books/face-with-tears-of-joy"><cite>Face with Tears of Joy: a Natural History of Emoji</cite></a> to my editor, Brendan Curry, at W. W. Norton. This one was a bit of a whirlwind: <a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/books/empire-of-the-sum/"><cite>Empire of the Sum</cite></a> was published less than a year ago, so writing time has been short. Add in a recent relocation from Birmingham, England to Linlithgow, Scotland (<a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/linlithgow-palace/">the birthplace of Mary Queen of Scots</a>, no less), along with all of the attendant upheaval with jobs and schools and houses, and it has not been a restful few months 😅</p><a class="more-link" href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2024/06/miscellany-101/">Read more →</a>

## Defining public goods

date: 2024-06-16, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

“Where the public good is neglected in order to create profits for individuals or companies, there we have corruption. Now, in the United States, we dealt with this very efficiently by denying that there is any such thing as a public good.” &#8211;Amitav Ghosh (via) See also: The Dark Heart of Individualism by Anne Helen [&#8230;]

<p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> has never been on the cover of a magazine, so you can't say ChatGPT is stealing this from anyone. In fact I'm offended on behalf of ChatGPT that the press has chosen to focus on the idea that it's plagiarizing journalists. The ideas journalists write about do not belong to them. If they're doing their jobs, they're reporting facts that exist whether or not they wrote a story about it. A simple example. I may have read in a local paper that the Mets swept the Dodgers in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series">NLCS</a>. I don't owe a news org anything if I wrote that the Mets won, because I read the news on their site. The news doesn't belong to them. </p>
<p>The idea that RSS could be on the cover of a magazine isn't so far-fetched, but no one ran a press release and there were no billionaires involved, so they didn't consider it newsworthy I guess. Some day we're going to have to accept that we have to make our own news, in the sense of Scoop Nisker's famous line -- "If you don't like the news go out and make some of your own." So here we go. I asked ChatGPT to imagine a magazine with RSS as the cover story. </p>

<p>PS: Does the concept of a cover story even exist now that we rarely read printed magazines?</p>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/06/16/rssCover.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've written a crawler for the network of blogrolls via <a href="https://opml.org/blogroll.opml">connective links</a> in HTML and/or RSS feeds. When I started the project, I had no idea what I'd find. How many blogrolls of what quality. I still don't know the extent of it, but there's a non-trivial number of blogrolls out there. I'm thinking about ways to get a handle on all the feeds in all the blogrolls, and see what we get from that. And I'm beginning to see the utility of <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> as a feed operating system, which is what I wanted it to be. It's not just a feed reader. It's able to do things most feed readers don't do, maybe none do. We don't have a good grasp of the depth of the feed products either. I will of course share the results when they are shareable.

Three movies I've watched in the last few days: 1. Fight Club. 2. The Matrix. 3. The Devil's Advocate. I had seen all of them before. But they go together. And they're all about the same thing, about choosing to live in a dream, or to live the life you're actually living. All three are excellent movies that I watched straight through from beginning to end, which is really unusual for me these days.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zicGxU5MfwE">This would make a great campaign ad</a>. Remember how lost we were. Understand what you're voting for when you go MAGA and what you could get if you sit this one out or cast a protest vote of some kind.

I spent so much time in my friend Mike&#8217;s house growing up that I knew his parents as Mama and Papa. His father, Kenneth Edward Nyboe, was born in 1924 in New York City but spent his summers in Maine, where he knew my mother and my aunt and where he met, and secretly married, my aunt&#8217;s friend Helen Bryant just before he shipped overseas to be in the tank corps with Patton&#8217;s Third Army in World War II.
