date: 2024-10-11, from: Market Place

<p>As Election Day grows closer, economic-minded voters wanna know: How much do Harris and Trump plan on adding to the national debt? The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reviewed the campaign promises of both candidates and predicted a spending range for each. In this episode, will Trump or Harris dig a deeper debt hole — and why should voters care? Plus, thousands in North Carolina are still without power, and why a mining company is paying billions for a lithium firm when the metal&#8217;s prices are down.</p>

## The data dogs

date: 2024-10-10, from: Market Place

<p>Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, counts himself as a data dog. It&#8217;s a name for economic policymakers who take the long view and are usually game to wait for more numbers. Goolsbee spoke with &#8220;Marketplace&#8221; host Kai Ryssdal about his voracious appetite for information and what he calls &#8220;the hardest thing that a central bank has to do.” Plus: Sports ticket prices are up 10% in the last year, and California requires retailers to help fund textile recycling.</p>

## Who will pay for Helene’s damage?

## Evaluating the damage

date: 2024-10-09, from: Market Place

<p>As the Southeast assesses Hurricane Helene&#8217;s damage, Milton barrels toward Florida&#8217;s west coast. The proximity of the storms will make it harder for homeowners and insurers to estimate each one&#8217;s impact — and likely drive up recovery costs. Also in this episode: Corporate bonds shine after the Fed&#8217;s rate cut, the mortgage rate honeymoon is over and Nebraska&#8217;s elections attract major campaign spending — along with some odd yard signs.</p>

## The cost of being prepared

date: 2024-10-08, from: Market Place

<p>Natural disaster recovery is often expensive, but this season is shaping up to be particularly costly and painful. The Southeast is reeling from Hurricane Helene, and Hurricane Milton is expected to inflict more damage starting tomorrow night. Disaster preparedness can reduce the economic burden of recovery, but not all localities can afford to be prepared. Also in this episode: The Fed&#8217;s interest rate cut raised business owners&#8217; optimism and China invites more young Americans to visit.</p>

## The cost of the Israel-Hamas war

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

## We added a ton of jobs last month. Surprise!

date: 2024-10-07, from: Market Place

<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, firms have taken some unprecedented measures to balance out the effects of lockdown, inflation and supply chain backups, leaving some economic predictors sorta &#8230; off. How can forecasters do their jobs when so many economic patterns have changed? Also in this episode: The Author&#8217;s Guild announces an anti-AI marketing strategy, consumer credit climbs, and for some agents, the National Association of Realtors settlement was the last straw.</p>
