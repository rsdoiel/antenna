## Meta removes fake accounts in Moldova ahead of presidential election

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

STOCKHOLM — Meta Platforms said on Friday that it had removed a network of group accounts targeting Russian speakers in Moldova ahead of the country's October 20 election, for violation of the company's policy on fake accounts.


Authorities in Moldova, an ex-Soviet state lying between Romania and Ukraine, said they had blocked dozens of Telegram channels and chat bots linked to a drive to pay voters to cast "no" ballots in a referendum on European Union membership held alongside the presidential election.


Pro-European President Maia Sandu is seeking a second term in the election and called the referendum on joining the 27-member bloc as the cornerstone of her policies.


The fake Meta accounts posted criticism of Sandu, pro-EU politicians and close ties between Moldova and Romania, and supported pro-Russia parties in Moldova, the company said.


The company said its operation centered on about a dozen fictitious, Russian-language news brands posing as independent entities with presence on multiple internet services, including Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, as well as Telegram, OK.ru and TikTok.


Meta said it removed seven Facebook accounts, 23 pages, one group and 20 accounts on Instagram for violating its "coordinated inauthentic behavior policy."


About 4,200 accounts followed one or more of the 23 pages and about 335,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts, Meta said.


In Chisinau, the National Investigation Inspectorate said it had blocked 15 channels of the popular Telegram messaging app and 95 chat bots offering voters money. Users were told the channels "violated local laws" on political party financing.


It had traced the accounts to supporters of fugitive businessman Ilan Shor — members of the banned party bearing his name or the "Victory" electoral bloc he had set up in its place from his base of exile in Moscow.


Moldovan police said on Thursday that they searched homes of leaders linked to Shor as part of a criminal investigation into election-meddling. Police have said tens of thousands of voters were paid off via accounts in a Russian bank to derail the vote.


Shor was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia last year in connection with the 2014 disappearance of $1 billion from Moldovan banks. He denies allegations of trying to bribe voters.


Sandu accuses Moscow of trying to topple her government while Moscow has accused her of fomenting "Russophobia."

## US sues Virginia over alleged violation of federal election law

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday that it had sued the state of Virginia for violating the federal prohibition on systematic efforts to remove voters within 90 days of an election.


On August 7, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order requiring the commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify that the department was conducting "daily updates to the voter list" to remove, among other groups, people who are unable to verify that they are citizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles.


U.S. citizens who were identified and notified and did not affirm their citizenship within 14 days would be removed from the list of registered voters, the Justice Department said. It said this practice has led to citizens having their voter registrations canceled ahead of the November 5 election.


"By canceling voter registrations within 90 days of Election Day, Virginia places qualified voters in jeopardy of being removed from the rolls and creates the risk of confusion for the electorate," said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke.


"Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters," Clarke added.


The department said it was seeking injunctive relief that would restore the ability of affected eligible voters to cast their votes unimpeded on Election Day and would prohibit future violations.


Youngkin called the move politically motivated and an attempt to interfere in the election.


"With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these common sense steps that we are legally required to take with every resource available to us," he said in a statement on Friday.


Republicans across the U.S. have pushed against noncitizen voting, which is already illegal, ahead of the November election. Some election officials have warned that the move could penalize eligible voters.

## Experts: Future of US-South Korea defense cost-sharing deal remains uncertain

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington  — U.S. national security experts say it is unclear whether a new cost-sharing agreement with South Korea, hailed by the State Department as “a significant accomplishment,” will survive if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.


Concluded last week and effective from 2026, the five-year Special Measures Agreement, or SMA, requires South Korea to raise its contribution to the cost of stationing of U.S. troops in the country by 8.3% to $1.47 billion in the first year.


The two allies reached the agreement earlier than expected, a move widely seen as key for Seoul and Washington to clinch before the U.S. presidential election in November, in which Trump is the Republican Party candidate.


The U.S. State Department hailed the agreement as a “a significant accomplishment for both sides” in a statement released on October 4.


But Trump, both in office and as a candidate, has consistently demanded that South Korea contribute significantly more to the cost of supporting U.S. forces in Korea. Most recently in April, Trump told Time magazine that “I want South Korea to treat us properly,” adding that Seoul is “paying virtually nothing for” the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.


‘Trump factor’


John Bolton, a former White House national security adviser during the Trump administration, told VOA Korean by phone on Friday that “it’s very likely that Trump would ask to renegotiate it.”


“I know that the administration [of President Joe Biden] here tried to rush the coming-to-an-agreement on it, so that Trump couldn’t meddle with it, but that won’t slow him down at all,” said Bolton, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005-06.


“He never thinks his predecessors make good enough deals, and in part, it’s not just the question of economics, but he doesn’t understand collective defense alliances,” Bolton said.


“He thinks that not just with respect to the Republic of Korea, but also with NATO or Japan or whatever that we’re defending, these countries don’t pay us enough money.” The Republic of Korea is South Korea’s formal name.


Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, pointed out the pact is “an executive agreement,” which makes it easier for Trump to undo since it does not require approval from Congress.


“We really don’t know whether he would just see it as a done deal, or if he will seek to renegotiate it upward, where South Korea would pay much more,” Klingner said.


“If you take a step back, it’s in our strategic interest to have allies, it’s in our strategic interest to have our forces stationed overseas, because actually, they’re less costly to the United States when they’re stationed overseas than when they’re stationed domestically.”


Robert Rapson, who served as charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean last week that he was concerned that the agreement wouldn't pass muster with a Trump administration should the former president win a second term in November.


“Given his demands and expectations of U.S. allies with respect to security burden sharing, my strong fear is that he will seek to renegotiate today’s agreement with a much higher number in mind,” said Rapson, who was directly involved in the two sets of SMA negotiations in 2013-14 and in 2019-21.


Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told VOA Korean on Thursday via email that he suspected there was “considerable dissatisfaction with the recently concluded SMA agreement in the Trump camp,” knowing how strongly the former president feels about the burden-sharing issue.


Revere said he could not rule out the possibility that Trump will come up with “a demand to reopen talks on the SMA issue, and toward that end, he might make major new demands of Seoul” if he takes office again.


'It's in our interest'


Other former government officials, like Klingner, believe it is too early to predict whether Trump will try to revise the cost-sharing agreement between the U.S. and South Korea.


Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on Wednesday on the phone, “He might try, but let’s not get fearful about this too soon.”


“If he comes to the White House, he will have a secretary of state, defense, national security adviser, et cetera, who may have slightly different views and can help moderate Mr. Trump.”


“Seoul and Washington understand that Trump is very transactional,” Armitage said. “But American soldiers are not Hessians. We’re not for rent. We’re in Korea because it’s in our interest.”


VOA Korean contacted the Trump campaign this week and asked what Trump’s stance was on the newly reached agreement, but did not receive a reply by the time this article was published.

## US soldier sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to assist Islamic State

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — A U.S. Army soldier was sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempting to help the Islamic State conduct a deadly ambush of U.S. troops, the Department of Justice said on Friday.


Cole Bridges, also known as Cole Gonzales, 24, will undergo supervised release for 10 years following his release from prison, the department said.


Bridges, who was a private first class at the time of his arrest, was charged in 2021 with giving "military advice and guidance on how to kill fellow soldiers to individuals he thought were part of ISIS," the department said.


Bridges pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in June 2023. He joined the Army in 2019.


Before joining, according to the department, he began researching and consuming online propaganda "promoting jihadists and their violent ideology, and began to express his support for ISIS and jihad on social media."

## Boeing lawyers argue for settlement opposed by relatives of those killed in 737 Max crashes

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

fort worth, Texas — Relatives of passengers who died in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max planes came to a federal court in Texas on Friday to listen as their lawyers asked a judge to throw out a plea agreement that the aircraft manufacturer struck with prosecutors and put the company on trial.


Their lawyers argued that Boeing's punishment — mainly a fine amounting to about $244 million — would be too light for misleading regulators about a flight-control system that malfunctioned before the crashes. They accused Boeing and the Justice Department of airbrushing facts and ignoring that 346 people died in the crashes.


U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor asked a Boeing lawyer why he should accept the prepackaged plea deal and a sentence negotiated by a defendant.


The Boeing lawyer, Ben Hatch, said Boeing "is a pillar of the national economy and the national defense” and needs to know the punishment before it agrees to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, a felony. Otherwise, he said, the company could be disbarred from federal contracting.


“All the employees of the company, the shareholders of the company and a global and national supply chain ... all of those are put into doubt if the sentencing" isn't known, possibly for months, Hatch said.


The answer stunned and angered relatives of the victims.


“Boeing is too important for the economy — they're too big to jail. That's what he's saying,” Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in the second crash, said after the hearing. “It allows them to kill people with no consequences because they're too big and because their shareholders won't like it.”


The government joined Boeing in asking the judge to accept the deal that they struck in July.


Sean Tonolli, senior deputy chief of the Justice Department's fraud section, said the conspiracy count is the most serious crime prosecutors can bring — they can't prove that Boeing's deception of regulators caused the crashes. And, he said, going to trial is risky.


“We are confident in our case, but we don’t take for granted that we might not win," he said.


The judge, who had received written arguments from all sides before the hearing in Fort Worth, asked questions but gave no indication if he is leaning one way or the other. He has expressed sympathy for the passengers' families before, writing in a 2023 ruling about "Boeing’s egregious criminal conduct.”


“You have given me a lot to think about,” O'Connor said to all the lawyers as Friday's hearing ended. “I'll get a ruling out just as soon as I can.”


In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly deceiving Federal Aviation Administration regulators who were writing pilot-training requirements for the Max.


The FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737 pilots before they could fly the Max, the latest version of the 737. That helped Boeing by avoiding the need for training in flight simulators, which would have raised the cost for airlines to operate the Max.


Airlines began flying the Max in 2017. The first crash occurred in Indonesia in October 2018, followed in March 2019 by the second, in Ethiopia.


The plea agreement calls for Boeing to pay a fine of up to $487.2 million, but the fine would be cut in half by giving the company credit for $243.6 million it paid as part of a $2.5 billion settlement in 2021 to avoid prosecution. The Justice Department decided in May that Boeing violated terms of that settlement, leading to the new plea deal.


Boeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, would also invest $455 million in compliance and safety programs, and be placed on probation for three years.


The case is among a host of issues with which the manufacturer most contend.


Talks broke down this week with striking factory workers who assemble some of the company’s best-selling planes. The company withdrew its offer and S&P Global Ratings put it on its credit watch list, citing increased financial risk because of the labor unrest.


On Thursday, the company filed a complaint over what it calls unfair labor practices against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Boeing in its complaint with the National Labor Relations Board said that the union’s public narrative is misleading and has made it difficult to reach a resolution.

## US expands sanctions against Iran's oil industry after attack on Israel

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — The United States hit Iran's oil and petrochemicals sectors with fresh sanctions Friday in response to Tehran's October 1 attack against Israel, designating dozens of new companies and firms.  


In a statement Friday, the Treasury Department said it was going after Iran's so-called "shadow fleet" of ships involved in selling Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions, designating 10 companies and 17 vessels as "blocked property" over their involvement in "shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products." 


The State Department announced it was sanctioning an additional six firms and six ships for "knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran." 


The sanctions form part of the U.S. response to Iran's attack, in which it launched some 200 ballistic missiles against Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders and a general from Iran's Revolutionary Guards. 


Israel has said its response to Iran's second direct attack against its territory this year would be "deadly, precise, and surprising." 


U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that Israel should consider "other alternatives than striking oil fields," amid reports it was planning to do so.  


"In response to Iran's attack on Israel, the United States is taking decisive action to further disrupt the Iranian regime's ability to fund and carry out its destabilizing activity," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. 


"Today's sanctions target Iranian efforts to channel revenues from its energy industry to finance deadly and disruptive activity — including development of its nuclear program, the proliferation of ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles," she added.  


Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had made clear after the October 1 attack that Tehran would face consequences. 


"To that end, we are taking steps today to disrupt the flow of revenue the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program and missile development, support terrorist proxies and partners, and perpetuate conflict throughout the Middle East," he said in a statement.

## As Disasters Strike, Investors Turn to Adaptation Tech

date: 2024-10-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwNTYzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4OTk4Mjk2M30.kuVlX3L_fl1HJr5V87YQw1GAt-KaSOW4MQ_WIl7l2rQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">As the southeastern U.S. recovers from hurricanes Helene and Milton, the destruction the storms have left behind serves to underline the obvious: The need for technologies that support climate change adaptation and resilience is both real and urgent. And while nearly all the money in climate finance still flows into mitigation tech, which seeks to lower emissions to alleviate tomorrow’s harm, at long last, there are signs that interest and funding for the adaptation space is picking up. </p>
<p>The emergence and success of climate resilience advisory and investment firms such as Tailwind Climate and The Lightsmith Group are two signs of this shift. Founded just last year, Tailwind recently published <a href="https://www.tailwindclimate.com/taxonomy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a taxonomy</u></a> of activities and financing across the various sectors of adaptation and resilience solutions to help clients understand opportunity areas in the space. Next year, the firm’s co-founder Katie MacDonald told me, Tailwind will likely begin raising its first fund. It’s already invested in one company, UK-based <a href="https://www.cryogenx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cryogenx</u></a>, which makes a portable cooling vest to rapidly reduce the temperature of patients experiencing heatstroke.</p>
<p>As for Lightsmith, the firm held the final close of its <a href="https://lightsmithgp.com/news-posts/lightsmith-group-closes-inaugural-186-million-growth-equity-climate-fund-the-first-to-focus-on-climate-resilience-and-adaptation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$186 million growth equity fund</u></a> for climate adaptation solutions in 2022, which co-founder and managing director Jay Koh told me is one of the first, if not <em><em>the</em></em> first fund with a climate resilience focus. As Koh sees it, the evolution of climate adaptation and resilience technologies can be broken up into three stages, the first being “reactive and incremental.” That’s largely where we’re at right now, he said — think rebuilding a dam higher after it’s been breached in a flood, or making a firebreak broader after a destructive wildfire. Where he’s seeing interesting companies emerge, though, is in the more proactive second stage, which often involves anticipating and preparing for extreme weather events. “Let’s do a lot more data and analytics ahead of time. Let’s deploy more weather satellites. Let’s look at <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-fire-prevention" target="_self"><u>deploying artificial intelligence</u></a> and other technologies <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/brightband-ai-weather-forecasts" target="_self"><u>to do better forecasting</u></a>,” Koh explained to me. </p>
<p>The third and final stage, he said, could be categorized as “systemic or transcendent adaptation,” which involves systems-level changes as opposed to incremental improvements. Source Global, one of Lightsmith’s portfolio companies which makes solar-powered hydropanels that produce affordable drinking water, is an example of this. As Koh told me, “It’s not simply improving the efficiency of desalination filters by 5% or 10%. It’s saying, listen, we’re going to pull water out of the air in a way that we have never done before.”</p>
<p>But while the activity and interest around adaptation tech may be growing, the money just isn’t there yet. “We’re easily $50 [billion] to $60 billion below where we need to be today,” MacDonald told me. “And you know, we’re on the order of around $150 [billion] to $160 billion below where we need to be by 2030.” Everyone else I spoke with echoed the sentiment. “The latest statistics are that less than 5% of total climate finance tracked on planet Earth is attributable to adaptation and climate resilience,” Koh said. “Of that, less than 2% is private investment.”</p>
<p>There’s a few reasons why early-stage investors especially may be hesitant to throw their weight behind adaptation tech despite the clear need in the market. Amy Francetic, co-founder and managing general partner at Buoyant Ventures, which focuses on early-stage digital solutions for climate risk, told me that the main customer for adaptation solutions is often a government entity. “Municipalities and other government contracts, they’re hard to win, they’re slow to win, and they don’t pay that much, either, which is the problem.” Francetic told me. “So it’s not a great customer to have.”</p>
<p>One of Buoyant’s portfolio companies, the now defunct StormSensor, reinforced this lesson for Francetic. The company used sensors to track water flow within storm and sewage systems to prevent flooding and was able to arrange pilot projects with plenty of water agencies — but few of them converted into paying contracts. “The municipalities were willing to spend money on an experiment, but not so many of them had a larger budget.” Francetic told me. The same dynamic, she said, is also at play in the utility industry, where you often hear about new tech succumbing to “death by pilot.”</p>
<p>It’s not all doom and gloom, though, when it comes to working with larger, risk-averse agencies. AiDash, another of Lightsmith’s portfolio companies that uses artificial intelligence to help utilities assess and address wildfire risk, has five utility partnerships, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.aidash.com/news/aidash-closes-its-oversubscribed-series-c-funding-round-at-58-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>raised $58.5 million</u></a> in an oversubscribed Series C round. Francetic and MacDonald both told me they’re seeing the conversation around climate adaptation evolve to include more industry stakeholders. In the past, Francetic said, discussing resilience and adaptation was almost seen as a form of climate doomerism. “They said, oh, why are you doing that? It shows that you’re giving up.” But now, MacDonald told me that her experience at this year’s climate week in New York was defined by productive conversations with representatives from the insurance industry, banking sector, and venture capital arena about injecting more capital into the space. </p>
<p>Bill Clerico, the founder and managing partner of the venture firm Convective Capital, is also deeply familiar with the tricky dynamics of climate adaptation funding. Convective, founded in 2022, is solely dedicated to <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-fire-prevention" target="_self"><u>wildfire tech</u></a> solutions. The firm’s portfolio companies span a range of technologies that address suppression, early identification, prevention, and insurance against damages, and are mainly looking to work with utilities, governments, and insurance companies. When I talked to Clerico back in August, he (understatedly) categorized these establishments as “not necessarily the most fast-moving or innovative.” But the bleak silver lining, he told me, is that extreme weather is forcing them to up their tempo. “There is so much destruction happening so frequently that it’s forcing a lot of these institutions to think about it totally differently and to embrace newer, more novel solutions — and to do it quickly.” </p>
<p>People, it seems, are starting to get real. But investors and startups alike are also just beginning to define exactly what adaptation tech encompasses and what metrics for success look like when they’re less measurable than, say, the tons of carbon sucked out of the atmosphere via direct air capture, or the amount of energy produced by a fusion reactor. </p>
<p>“Nobody wakes up in the morning and buys a loaf of adaptation. You don’t drive around in an adaptation or live in an adaptation,” Koh noted. “What you want is food, transport, shelter, water that is resilient and adapted to the effects of climate change.” What Koh and the team at Lightsmith have found is that many of the companies working on these solutions are hiding in plain sight. “They call themselves business continuity or water efficiency or agricultural precision technologies or supply chain management in the face of weather volatility,” Koh explained. </p>
<p>In this way, the scope of adaptation technology balloons far beyond what is traditionally climate-coded. <a href="https://lightsmithgp.com/news-posts/lightsmith-leads-16-6-million-investment-round-in-digital-health-leader-beep-saude-supporting-climate-resilience-in-healthcare/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lightsmith recently invested</u></a> in a Brazil-based digital health company called Beep Saude, which enables patients to get rapid, in-home diagnostics, vaccination services, and infusion therapies. It falls under the umbrella of climate adaptation tech, Koh told me, because rising temperatures, increased rainfall, and deforestation in the country have led to a rapid increase in mosquitoes spreading diseases such as dengue fever and the Zika virus. </p>
<p>Naturally, measuring the efficacy of solutions that span such a vast problem space means a lot of customization. “Your metric might be, how many people have asked for water in a drought-prone area?” MacDonald told me. “And with health, it might be, how many children are safe from wildfire smoke during fire season? And for ecosystems, it might be, how many hectares of ecosystem have been saved as a means to reduce storm surge?” Insurance also brings up a host of additional metrics. As Francetic told me, “we measure things like lives and livelihoods covered or addressed. We measure things like losses covered or underwriting dollars spent on this.”</p>
<p>No matter how you categorize it or measure it, the need for these technologies is not going away. “The drivers of adaptation and climate resilience demand are physics and time,” Koh told me. “Whoever develops climate resilience and adaptation technology will have a competitive advantage over any other company, any other society, and the faster that we can scale it up, and the smarter and more equitable we are about deploying it, the better off we will all be.”</p>

## The Middle Road: Why the United States Needs a Dynamic Approach to Its Foreign Policy

date: 2024-10-11, updated: 2024-10-11, from: RAND blog

The two tickets in the upcoming U.S. election offer largely contrasting stances for America's position on the international stage. However, must America's approach to its role on the international stage be one of two extremes, or can it be more nuanced?

## Biden again blasts disinformation after second hurricane batters South

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

WHITE HOUSE — During a briefing Friday on recovery efforts after Hurricane Milton at the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden again warned about the spread of "disgusting" and "dangerous" misinformation and disinformation about the federal government's response to recent storms.


Responding to a reporter's question, Biden said that misleading information hurts people who need the most help. "Widowers, people in hospitals, people who are by themselves and they don't know, and they lose contact, and they get scared to death," he said.


"We're breaking through with it. We're breaking through with the truth," he said, noting that Republican governors and mayors have supported his call to stop the spread of disinformation.


Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has been spreading disinformation about the government's response, including that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is limiting payouts to disaster survivors to $750, and that funding for Americans who are affected by the disaster was used up to provide housing for undocumented immigrants.


"I think those who have been spreading these lies to try to undermine the opposition are going to pay a price for it," Biden said, adding that Trump is not solely to blame but has the "biggest mouth."




Biden provided an update on the federal government's response to hurricanes Milton and Helene flanked by his top aides, including Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. He was joined virtually by Vice President Kamala Harris from her campaign stop in Arizona.


Harris again warned companies against taking advantage of the storms to increase profit.


"Any company or individual that is using this crisis to jack up prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring, and there will be a consequence," she said.


Milton deaths


Authorities in Florida said Friday that Hurricane Milton was responsible for at least 16 deaths, and that more than 2 million people remained without power as evacuees returned to their homes to assess the damage and begin cleaning up from the storm.


As of midday Friday, the website poweroutage.us reported 2.3 million people remained without power. Late Thursday, Biden said more than 50,000 line workers and 1,000 federal personnel were on the ground to respond.


The storm made landfall late Wednesday near Siesta Key in Sarasota County as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour. It carved a path of destruction across central Florida, affecting many communities still cleaning up from Hurricane Helene two weeks earlier.


While the state's western coast felt the direct hit from the storm, Milton also spawned tornados that affected the southeastern part of the state. Local media reported more than 19 tornadoes touched down even before the hurricane made landfall. Tornadoes are believed responsible for several deaths.




State government officials and the Florida National Guard reported more than 1,000 people were rescued since the storm made landfall.


The U.S. Coast Guard reported one of its aircrews rescued a man Wednesday clinging to a cooler floating in the Gulf of Mexico 48 kilometers off the Florida coast. It said the man was later taken to Tampa General Hospital for medical treatment.


State officials said while total damage assessments are still being made, the storm could have been much worse. The population center of Tampa was spared a direct hit, and the predicted record-setting storm surge did not materialize.


Meanwhile, scientists said climate change made Hurricane Milton stronger and more dangerous.


In a report issued Friday, the nonprofit group Weather Attribution said Milton went through an "explosive intensification" from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in 24 hours.


The group said the rapid intensification was driven and sustained by very high sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico.


Some information for this report came from Reuters, The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.

## Why racial disparities in stock market investments persist

date: 2024-10-11, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Stocks are increasingly an important source of household wealth. Thanks to the booming stock market, U.S. household wealth surged to a record high last year, per Federal Reserve data. But there are continued racial differences in stock ownership, which has big implications for the racial wealth gap. We&#8217;ll learn more. Also on the show: producer prices remain tame, and business travel spending rebounds.</p>

## Maybe let’s just not talk about politics at work?

Hurricane Milton may have avoided the worst case scenario of a direct hit on the Tampa Bay area, but communities south of Tampa experienced heavy flooding just a couple weeks after being hit by Hurricane Helene. </p><p>While the damage is still being assessed in Sarasota County’s barrier islands, homes that require extensive renovations will almost certainly run up against what is known as the 50% rule — or, in Southwest Florida, the “<a href="https://www.swflappraisals.com/fema-fifty-percent-rule/#:~:text=And%20the%2050%25%20rule%20states,most%20recent%20flood%20prevention%20regulations." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dreaded</u></a> 50% rule.” </p><p>In flood zone-situated communities eligible to receive insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program, any renovations to repair “substantial damage” — defined as repairs whose cost exceeds 50% of the value of the structure (not the land, which can often be quite valuable due to its proximity to the water) — must bring the entire structure “into compliance with current local floodplain management standards.” In practice, this typically means elevating the home above what FEMA defines as the area’s “<a href="https://www.fema.gov/about/glossary/base-flood-elevation-bfe#:~:text=The%20elevation%20of%20surface%20water,%2C%20V1%E2%80%93V30%20and%20VE." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>base flood elevation</u></a>,” which is the level that a “100-year-flood” would reach, plus some amount determined by the building code. </p><p>The rule almost invites conflict. Because just as much as local communities and homeowners want to restore things to the way they were, the federal government doesn’t want to insure structures that are simply going to get destroyed. On Siesta Key, where Milton made landfall, the base flood elevation ranges from 7 feet to 9 feet, meaning that elevating a home to comply with flood codes could be beyond the means — or at least the insurance payouts — of some homeowners.</p><p>“You got a 1952 house that’s 1,400 square feet, and you get 4 feet of water,” Jeff Brandes, a former state legislator and president of the Florida Policy Project, told me on Wednesday, explaining how the rule could have played out in Tampa. “That means new kitchens and new bathrooms, all new flooring and baseboards and drywall to 4 or 5 feet.” That kind of claim could easily run to $150,000, which might well surpass the FEMA threshold. “Now all of the sudden you get into the 50% rule that you have the entire house up to current code levels. But then you have to do another half-a-million above what [insurance] paid you.”</p><p>Simple probability calculations show that a 100-year flood (which is really a flood elevation that has a 1-in-100 chance of occurring every year) has a more than 25% chance of occurring during the lifetime of a mortgage. If you browse Siesta Key real estate on Zillow, much of it is given a 100% chance of flooding sometime over the course of a 30-year mortgage, according to data analysis by First Street.</p><p>Sarasota County as a whole has around 62,000 NFIP policies with some $16.6 billion in total coverage (although more than 80% percent of households have <a href="https://www.harrisinsurance.com/sarasota-fl-flood-insurance-coverage/#:~:text=Not%20acquiring%20flood%20insurance%20in,do%20not%20have%20flood%20insurance." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no flood insurance at all)</u></a>. Considering that flood insurance is <a href="https://www.floodsmart.gov/am-i-required-have-flood-insurance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>required</u></a> in high-risk areas for federally-backed mortgages and for new homeowners insurance policies <a href="https://www.pnj.com/story/money/2024/03/15/citizens-mandatory-flood-insurance/72978182007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>written by Florida’s state backed property insurer of last resort</u></a>, Citizens, FEMA is likely to take a close interest in whether communities affected by Milton and Helene are complying with its rules.<br/></p><p>If 2022’s Hurricane Ian is any indication, squabbles over the 50% rule are almost certain to emerge — and soon. </p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/04/lee-county-fema-flood-zone-construction-50-percent-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FEMA told Lee County</u></a>, which includes Fort Myers and Cape Coral, that it was rescinding the discount its residents and a handful of towns within it receive on flood insurance because, the agency claimed, more than 600 homeowners had violated the 50% rule after Hurricane Ian. Following an outcry from local officials and congressional representatives, <a href="https://winknews.com/2024/07/19/cape-coral-keeps-fema-flood-discount/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FEMA restored the discount</u></a>.</p><p>In their efforts to avoid triggering the rule, homeowners are hardly rogue actors. Local governments often actively assist them. </p><p>FEMA had initiated a similar procedure in Lee County the year before, threatening to drop homeowners from the flood insurance program for using possibly inaccurate appraisals to avoid the 50% rule before <a href="https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2023/02/22/fema-50-percent-rule-lee-county-florida-appraiser-property-values-allowed-hurricane-ian/69933389007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>eventually relenting</u></a>. The <em><em>Fort Myers News Press</em></em> reported that the appraisals were provided by the county, which was deliberately “lowering the amount that residents could use to calculate their repairs or rebuilds” to avoid triggering the rule.</p><p>Less than a month after Ian swept through Southwest Florida, Cape Coral advised residents to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CityofCapeCoral/posts/pfbid0213LAr9too6BDBe24yDiDhdMiKPU3z9Eehk99eLPGQLpcco58oXeN8DinvYFzRG3Sl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delay and slow down repairs</u></a> for the same reason, as the rule there applied to money spent on repairs over the course of a year. Some <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=treasury+island+lookback+period&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS940US940&oq=treasury+island+lookback+period&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgcIBRAhGKsCMgcIBhAhGKsCMgcIBxAhGKsC0gEINTE2OGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=Belleair%20Beach%20homeowners,news%20%E2%80%BA%20local%20%E2%80%BA%20pinellascounty" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>highly exposed coastal communities</u></a> in Pinellas County have been adjusting their “lookback rules” — the period over which repairs are totaled to see if they hit the 50% rule — to make them shorter so homeowners are less likely to have to make the substantive repairs <a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/local/pinellascounty/homes-lookback-period-repair/67-15fadaa0-bf77-4399-9a1c-f65f285b3b49" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>required</u></a>. </p><p>This followed similar actions by local governments in Charlotte County. As the <em><em>Punta Gordon Sun</em></em> put it, “City Council members learned the federal regulation impacts its homeowners — and they decided to do something about it.” In the Sarasota County community of North Port, local officials <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/venice/2022/11/23/hurricane-ian-recovery-north-port-eases-rules-rebuild-floods/10761279002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scrapped a rule</u></a> that added up repair costs over a five-year period to make it possible for homeowners to rebuild without triggering elevation requirements.</p><p>When the 50% rule “works,” it can lead to the communities most affected by big storms being fundamentally changed, both in terms of the structures that are built and who occupies them. The end result of the rebuilding following Helene and Milton — or the next big storm to hit Florida’s Gulf Coast — or the one after that, and so on — may be wealthier homeowners in more resilient homes essentially serving as a flood barrier for everyone else, and picking up more of the bill if the waters rise too high again. </p><p>Florida’s Gulf Coast has long been seen as a place where the middle class can afford beachfront property. Elected officials’ resistance to the FEMA rule only goes to show just how important keeping a lid on the cost of living — quite literally, the cost of legally inhabiting a structure — is to the voters and residents they represent.</p><p>Still, said Brandes, “There’s the right way to come out of this thing. The wrong way is to build exactly back what you built before.”</p>

## What Happens to a Landfill in a Hurricane?

date: 2024-10-10, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDIxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjQ2OTkyN30.2B4I1U8C-uMyLHuj5ZYyPuRmBDBztHHT_wPNFkCoTPc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">In the coming days and weeks, as Floridians and others in storm-ravaged communities clean up from Hurricane Milton, trucks will carry all manner of storm-related detritus — chunks of buildings, fences, furniture, even cars — to the same place all their other waste goes: the local landfill. But what about the landfill itself? Does this gigantic trash pile take to the air and scatter Dorito bags and car parts alike around the surrounding region? </p><p>No, thankfully. As Richard Meyers, the director of land management services at the Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County, assured me, all landfill waste is covered with soil on “at least a weekly basis,” and certainly right before a hurricane, preventing the waste from being kicked up. “Aerodynamically, [the storm is] rolling over that covered waste. It’s not able to blow six inches of cover soil from the top of the waste.”</p><p>But just because a landfill won’t turn into a mass of airborne dirt and half-decomposed projectiles doesn’t mean there’s nothing to worry about. Because landfills — especially large ones — often contain more advanced infrastructure such as gas collection systems, which prevent methane from being vented into the atmosphere, and drainage systems, which collect contaminated liquid that’s pooled at the bottom of the waste pile and send it off for treatment. Meyers told me that getting these systems back online after a storm if they’ve been damaged is “the most critical part, from our standpoint.”</p><p>A flood-inundated gas collection system can mean more methane escaping into the air, and storm-damaged drainage pipes can lead to waste liquids leaking into the ground and potentially polluting water sources. The latter was a <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/news-release/usda-rural-development-awards-municipality-juncos-grant-23693000-repair-landfill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major concern in Puerto Rico</u></a> after Hurricane Maria destroyed a landfill’s waste liquid collection system in the Municipality of Juncos in 2017. </p><p>As for methane, calculating exactly how much could be released as a result of a dysfunctional landfill gas collection system requires accounting for myriad factors such as the composition of the waste and the climate that it’s in, but the back of the envelope calculations don’t look promising. The <a href="https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/service/facilityDetail/2022?id=1003560&ds=E&et=&popup=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Southeast County Landfill near Tampa</u></a>, for instance, emitted about 100,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2022, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (although a Harvard engineering study from earlier this year suggests that this may be a <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2024/05/epa-underestimates-methane-emissions-landfills-urban-areas#:~:text=Research%20highlights%20importance%20of%20high%2Dresolution%20methane%20accounting&text=The%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency%20(EPA,27%25%20higher%20than%20EPA%20estimates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>significant underestimate</u></a>). The EPA estimates that gas collection systems are about 75% effective, which means that the landfill generates a total of about 400,000 metric tons of CO2-worth of methane. If Southeast County Landfill’s gas collection system were to go down completely for even a day, that would mean extra methane emissions of roughly 822 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. That difference amounts to the daily emissions of more than 65,000 cars. </p><p>That’s a lot of math. But the takeaway is: Big landfills in the pathway of a destructive storm could end up spewing a lot of methane into the atmosphere. And keep in mind that these numbers are just for <em><em>one</em></em> hypothetical landfill with a gas collection system that goes down for <em><em>one</em></em> day. The emissions numbers, you can imagine, start to look much worse if you consider the possibility that floodwaters could impede access to infrastructure for even longer. </p><p>So stay strong out there, landfills of Florida. You may not be the star of this show, but you’ve got our attention. </p>

## There’s gold in them there central banks!

date: 2024-10-10, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The value of gold is up 28% since the beginning of the year. And while some see the precious metal as shiny and pretty, central banks around the globe view it differently — as a safe asset during a time of geopolitical tensions. Also on the program: We&#8217;ll discuss how markets are responding to this morning&#8217;s inflation data, and we&#8217;ll hear about a lawsuit against some top universities for alleged financial aid price-fixing.</p>

## What Hurricane Milton Left Behind

date: 2024-10-10, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMTg4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NDAwNDgxMn0.q4uYwCwDl4nmF4GODRzp4F33kQkRdKuLYCCxzSh2UtY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Large parts of Pennsylvania are under a frost advisory today and tomorrow • The remnants of Hurricane Kirk killed at least one person in France • A severe solar storm is <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-10-severe-solar-storm-thursday.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected</a> to hit Earth today.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Hurricane Milton moves toward Atlantic after slamming into Florida</h3><p>
	Hurricane Milton is headed out to the Atlantic after raking across Florida overnight, and as the sun comes up, residents are assessing the damage left in its wake. Milton made landfall near Sarasota as a Category 3 storm, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-milton-path-florida-10-10-24/index.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bringing heavy rainfall, dangerous winds, and flooding</a>. St. Petersburg reported 16 inches of rain, which meteorologists say is a 1-in-1,000-year event. The storm also triggered more than 130 tornado warnings, possibly a new record. The Tropicana Field Stadium in Tampa sustained significant damage. While deaths have been reported, it’s not yet clear how many. More than 3 million people are without power.
</p><p>
	Before the storm hit, the Florida Department of Financial Services issued a rule that requires insurance claims adjusters to provide an explanation for any changes they make to a claimant’s loss estimate, <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/10/10/florida-milton-emergency-insurance-rule-fraud/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" target="_blank">reported</a>, calling the move “a groundbreaking win for policyholders.”
</p><h3>2. WWF report charts steep wildlife population decline</h3><p>
	The World Wide Fund for Nature published its <a href="https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-GB/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" target="_blank">2024 Living Planet Report</a> yesterday, which tracks nearly 5,500 species of amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles all over the world. It found that wildlife populations plummeted by about 73% between 1970 and 2020, as illustrated in this rather bleak but very effective chart:
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="a38570a0b762b98cae3ed76e0b7274dc" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="ae23b" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMTg4Ni9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNDgxMTk2Mn0.wrppLyBaeOZUVkStOOpnAxxLZObqEAQW2PjDaHiAioM/image.png?width=980"/>
<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">WWF</small>
</p><p>
	Latin America, which is home to some of the most biodiverse regions in the world, saw the worst losses, at 95%. Freshwater species experienced the greatest decline at 85%. There are some success stories, such as a 3% increase in the mountain gorilla population, and the incredible comeback of the European Bison, but generally the report is pretty heartbreaking. It underscores the interconnected nature of the climate crisis and nature destruction. “It really does indicate to us that the fabric of nature is unraveling,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/10/09/wildlife-populations-decline-wwf-report/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Rebecca Shaw, WWF’s chief scientist. The report comes days ahead of the start of the UN COP16 biodiversity summit in Colombia, where delegates will discuss concrete ways to stop biodiversity loss.
</p><h3>3. CEOs publish letter urging more government action on climate</h3><p>
<strong></strong>More than 100 CEOs from some of the world’s biggest corporations have published a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/10/alliance-of-ceo-climate-leaders-cop29/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" target="_blank">letter</a> urging governments and the private sector to boost efforts to keep Paris Agreement goals alive. The letter, signed by the heads of companies including Ikea, AstraZeneca, A.P. Moller-Maersk, Bain & Company, Iberdrola, Orsted, and Volvo Cars, calls for governments to:
</p><ul>
<li>put forward aggressive and transparent new emission reduction plans</li>
<li>scale up climate finance including expanding the use of carbon pricing and phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies</li>
<li>eliminate permitting barriers for renewable projects </li>
<li>enact policies to help create a market for and scale breakthrough technologies</li>
</ul><h3>4. IMO boss says shipping industry must target ‘low hanging fruit’ to get reduce emissions</h3><p>
	The head of the International Maritime Organization this week called on the shipping industry to do more to cut emissions from the sector. Shipping accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The IMO recently set a new industry-wide target of a 20% emissions reduction by 2030, and net-zero by 2050. But the IMO’s Arsenio Dominguez said there is more to be done to hit these goals. That includes “low hanging fruit” like reducing ship speed, charting routes according to the weather, and cleaning the hulls of ships to reduce friction, <em><em>The Associated Press</em></em> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-shipping-greenhouse-gas-emissionsinternational-maritime-organization-933147f1bba7f4851134f128b07e6917?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" target="_blank">reported</a>. But in the long-term, he said, the industry will need to switch to cleaner fuels, which have yet to scale.
</p><h3>5. Form Energy raises $405 million for iron-air battery tech</h3><p>
	Long-duration energy storage startup <a href="https://formenergy.com/technology/battery-technology/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" target="_blank">Form Energy</a>, <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/form-energy-raises-405m-for-its-100-hour-iron-air-batteries?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed</a> a $405 million Series F funding round this week, bringing its total funding to more than $1.2 billion. Form uses a novel method for storing energy, combining iron and oxygen to make rust, a process that the company claims can be used to store and discharge up to 100 hours of battery power. As renewable energy production ramps up, new ways of storing variable energy from wind and solar is essential, and Form’s latest fundraising underscores this need. <em><em>Canary Media</em></em> <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/form-energy-raises-405m-for-its-100-hour-iron-air-batteries?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that Form’s technology isn’t proven at utility scale yet but the company is working on commercial deployments and broke ground on a project in August to provide energy to a utility in Minnesota.
</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>
	Some dragonfly species have evolved to have darker wing spots as a breeding advantage. A new <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ethology/articles/10.3389/fetho.2024.1447637/full?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwnVRLJz5dFpSKHp9QefgQza_9OoSijZR-DvneOrlphn1RiVFqNNu3Ek_UpAg3wB3HsWQ" target="_blank">study</a> finds these dragonflies have also evolved to be able to withstand higher temperatures.

## What shoppers really want is some disinflation

date: 2024-10-10, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Later this morning, we&#8217;ll get the consumer price index for September. While inflation is way down from its peak in June 2022, consumers are frustrated with persistently high prices. We&#8217;ll hear more. Plus, how does a Nobel win in literature influence book sales? We&#8217;ll hear from the publishers of last year&#8217;s Nobel laureate, Norwegian playwright and author Jon Fosse, about how they dealt with a surge in demand.</p>

## Evaluating the damage

date: 2024-10-09, from: Market Place

<p>As the Southeast assesses Hurricane Helene&#8217;s damage, Milton barrels toward Florida&#8217;s west coast. The proximity of the storms will make it harder for homeowners and insurers to estimate each one&#8217;s impact — and likely drive up recovery costs. Also in this episode: Corporate bonds shine after the Fed&#8217;s rate cut, the mortgage rate honeymoon is over and Nebraska&#8217;s elections attract major campaign spending — along with some odd yard signs.</p>

## How a Fight over Cables Could Kill Offshore Wind in New Jersey

date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDA2Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDY0NzEwNn0.Efdy9fizQg1lk5y2dKa_fBs4bfZQASn9LqsyUIisWiA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">One of the biggest threats to American offshore wind is a handful of homeowners on the south Jersey shoreline spouting unproven theories about magnetic fields. </p><p>Within a year of forming, the activist group “Stop The High-Risk Cables” has galvanized local politicians against the transmission infrastructure being planned for wind turbines off the coast of New Jersey known as the <a href="https://bpuoffshorewind.nj.gov/prebuild-solicitation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Larrabee Pre-built Infrastructure</u></a>. The transmission route, which will run a few miles from the beaches of Sea Girt, New Jersey, to a substation nearby, is expected to be a crucial landing zone for power from major offshore wind projects in south Jersey waters, including Atlantic Shores, a joint venture between EDF Renewables and Shell that received final permits from federal regulators last week. </p><p>The only problem: while state regulators have been busy planning the route for the transmission and selecting who will build it, opponents have managed to win the war of public opinion. Activists have clearly turned their neighbors against the plan, pushing the mayors of the four boroughs targeted for Pre-Built Infrastructure to come out against the project. And this weekend Jack Ciattarelli – who narrowly lost the race for the governor’s mansion last year and is running again in 2025 – joined activists rallying against the project and is <a href="https://x.com/Jack4NJ/status/1842963189891563676" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now campaigning</u></a> on ending the project and cable landings like it. </p><p>Since federal regulators control the waters, what this means is, unless Democrats hit the electoral jackpot over the next year, offshore wind in New Jersey could be screwed – even if Kamala Harris wins the White House. </p><p>What makes this more dire is, this isn’t any ol’ transmission. For other offshore wind projects like Empire Wind, states have forced developers to design and construct their own transmission landings, creating a somewhat disorganized situation resembling electrical spaghetti. New Jersey’s offshore wind transmission meanwhile has been studied for years and is supposed to minimize development on the shoreline. This means the combat over this cabling could decide the fates of multiple offshore wind projects – and the first major proactive plan to reduce beach-level environmental impacts that stymie offshore wind in the first place. </p><p>So I decided to dive deep into the campaign against the so-called “high-risk” cables. After a series of interviews with organizers and a mayor critical of the state’s processes, I’ve been left feeling this relatively small transmission project represents a true test for democracy’s role in climate action. Could a small band of organized individuals be <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/wind-farm-protests-leah-stokes-pnas" target="_self"><u>all it takes</u></a> to hold back decarbonization at the pace scientists say is necessary, no matter how many climate laws are passed? </p><h3>The Magnetic Fields</h3><p>Sea Girt resident Kimberly Paterson remembers when she first heard about the cables. Someone had left a postcard on her door about the project. Before that, the professional executive leadership trainer had devoted her activism to preserving maritime forests on the beach. Once made aware of the transmission cables though, she and her small coterie of environmentally-conscious neighbors got active. </p><p>Paterson said they also started getting looped in with an existing network of activists concerned about offshore wind infrastructure. Those activists included familiar characters to the fight over New Jersey offshore wind development. </p><p>People like Mike Dean of Save the East Coast and Cindy Zipf of Clean Ocean Action, who’ve spread theories without evidence about a spate of whale deaths being tied to pile drivers for offshore wind. She says her group’s work is focused on the cables, not offshore wind, despite the close allyship with these other actors. As she simply put it, “There’s a circle of people that you meet.” </p><p>“We do like to work with others, and communicate with others, but we’re not officially tied to any of those other groups.” </p><p>The group also started canvassing, making signage for homeowners, and holding public events. As calls for action grew, so too did the political focus on the area, as state legislators and members of Congress took up the issue. </p><p>“We have created an absolute firestorm here,” Paterson told me. ‘It is unbelievable what we’ve accomplished.” </p><p>The group is focused on what they believe to be the health risks of simply being near high-voltage power lines.</p><p>To understand their fears, think of an electric current going through a wire. The more current goes through a wire, the higher likelihood of electrical waves emanating from the current’s pathway. That’s where “electro-magnetic fields” come into play. These fields are all around us and even Earth emits them. It’s the result of an excess of energy. <br/><br/>The World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/electromagnetic-fields" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>classifies even</u></a> low amounts of electromagnetic fields as a possible carcinogen, citing studies around exposure and childhood leukemia rates. But as many environmental and health <a href="https://www.epa.gov/radtown/electric-and-magnetic-fields-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>experts note</u></a>, studies to date have not really linked cancer occurrences to prolonged exposure to these fields. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management <a href="https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/BOEM-Electromagnetic-Fields-Offshore-Wind-Facilities_1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>says the</u></a> electro-magnetic fields created by cables for offshore wind “are well below the recommended threshold values for human exposure.” So like whales and wind, it’s something to watch out for, but there’s no evidence to date of a danger here.</p><p>Nonetheless, seeking to calm any resident’s fears of magnetic fields, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities last week convened their first public hearing within the planned development area.<br/></p><p>At the event, numerous officials came and spoke to the project’s safety, including the executive director of the Board. They even played a long explanatory video from a consultant they hired to review the electro-magnetic fields that would come from the cables. The full presentation laid out numerous examples of what they said were similar underground and underwater transmission lines with magnetic emissions that had no discernable impact on public health, including lines in the New Jersey-New York region. </p><p>One person moved by the presentation’s efforts on magnetic fields was Mike Mangan, mayor of Manasquan, one of the boroughs that may be selected to host some of the transmission infrastructure. Mangan told me he joined with other mayors to press the state for more transparency on the cables at the behest of concerned constituents. But he didn’t know what the state knew about the magnetic fields. </p><p>“I’ll just be candid — I was ignorant on a lot of that,” he acknowledged. Mangan said he still has “a few very serious concerns” but “I think they addressed some of the bigger concerns,” including the magnetic fields. </p><p>I’ll admit, I felt the same. So far in The Fight, we’ve chronicled examples where there are at least somewhat reasonable concerns about renewable energy development – stuff like batteries <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/hecate-energy-acton-mike-garcia" target="_self"><u>sited in wildfire risk areas</u></a> and solar farms <a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/center-biological-diversity-tortoise-solar" target="_self"><u>in imperiled tortoise habitat</u></a>. But in this case, I watched the entire presentation online and left thinking this was essentially a non-issue. </p><p>Yet Paterson says she was unconvinced by the presentation. The projects they’re citing aren’t comparable, she claims. And then she has a laundry list of other complaints about the potential cables. </p><p>Hearing her talk about the transmission, you’d think she just doesn’t want this built under any circumstances. So I asked her if, given her allies, the goal is to stop offshore wind. An avid wildlife painter, she says no, and that she’s “very strongly in support of alternative energy.” </p><p>Well, okay. Maybe it’s political or partisan then? I asked her who she’s voting for in this year’s presidential election. “I don’t like anyone in the election to be quite honest,” she confessed, self-identifying simply as a “libertarian.” She then added: “I love the idea of Robert F. Kennedy [Jr.] revolutionizing our health-care system. That makes me very excited.” </p><h2>Tug of war over power lines</h2><p>Last week, Heatmap published a risk index of the top 10 renewable energy projects worth watching for potential cancellation or major blowback to the energy transition. </p><p>We listed Atlantic Shores in the top five, primarily citing the project’s current role as a focal point for opponents to offshore wind up and down the Atlantic coastline. Hours after the risk index was published, Atlantic Shores received its final approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. </p><p>Despite that win, we’re leaving the project on the index because the cables have to be built too – and that stands to be a more stressful fight. </p><p>It wasn’t supposed to be hard. In 2021, New Jersey passed a law granting the Board of Public Utilities the authority to supersede local governments opposing easements and other permits for offshore wind transmission cables. But that law’s permissibility under the state constitution hasn’t been tested yet, thanks to the cancellation of Orsted’s Ocean Wind project, which was set to be the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-state-government-phil-murphy-climate-and-environment-utilities-b23542107c4369a1b842dae985e0e7a0" target="_blank"><u>likeliest battleground over cables</u></a> before Atlantic Shores.</p><p>State officials are expected in the coming weeks to lay out who will actually build the transmission infrastructure and the route it’ll take from Sea Girt to the Larrabee substation. Between the day of that announcement and the completion of construction, a lot can go awry. Donald Trump could win the presidency and, as opponents of offshore wind expect, revisit permitting decisions for projects like Atlantic Shores. Or a Republican like Jack Ciattarelli could win the governor’s mansion, and that person could take any number of steps to undermine the cables like leaving the local control law undefended in state court if it’s challenged. </p><p>All this risk to the energy transition, started by a handful of actors with unfounded claims about magnetic fields. </p><p>I asked Atlantic Shores for comment on the opposition movement. They did not get back to me. </p><p>However, I did hear from the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, a consortium of developers trying to build offshore wind off the state coast. “While we are advocates of civil discourse and engagement from communities, we urge residents to be mindful of prevalent misinformation,” said Paulina O’Connor, executive director of the alliance, in a statement sent to me Tuesday evening. </p><p>“By following best practices in environmental science and engineering, such as proper siting, minimizing disruption during construction, and adherence to all state and federal regulations, this infrastructure can be safely and responsibly integrated into our communities and local and regional power grids to provide resilient and reliable power to New Jersey homes,” O’Connor continued. </p><p>I also heard from Anjuli Ramos-Busot, executive director of Sierra Club’s New Jersey chapter, who contacted me last night after Atlantic Shores and the offshore wind alliance brought my reporting to their attention. </p><p>“Let us be clear, the microwave in your kitchen emits more electromagnetic currents than cables buried deep underground covered by insulation and concrete,” Ramos-Busot said in a statement. “This technology is vetted, goes through rigorous permitting standards, and is safe and responsible for both the environment and local communities.” </p><p>Candidly, I’m holding my breath on whether Sierra Club’s words will win over these concerned shore residents. </p>

## These Hurricanes Have Birthed a New Kind of Climate Denial

date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDE0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MTI3MDY1NX0.bHYFF2prszzAlekS9mswZwcYc4MpdIuSNJTpgrkSDWk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Maybe Sharpiegate wasn’t so funny after all.</p><p>You’ll recall the micro-controversy from 2019, when then-President Donald Trump said that Hurricane Dorian was headed toward Alabama (which it wasn’t), and officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were <a href="https://time.com/5775953/trump-dorian-alabama-sharpiegate-noaa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pressured</u></a> to back up Trump’s mistake. It culminated in Trump presenting a map in the Oval Office on which someone drew a bubble atop the projected path of the storm so it would stretch into Alabama, apparently with a Sharpie. </p><p>At the time it was troubling but comical, a representation of how the cult-like adoration Trump demanded would distort the work of government in idiotic ways. Five years later, with a storm surge of misinformation pouring over the country in response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, it looks more like a harbinger of things to come.</p><p>In any crisis, some measure of confusion is inevitable. Rumors spread and misunderstandings proliferate, fed by fear and desperation. The most extravagant varieties of misinformation are often either short-lived or confined to a minority of the population. That has not been true, however, when it comes to Helene, and it <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-milton-misinformation" target="_self"><u>looks like</u></a> Milton will repeat the same pattern. This time, the misinformation is more explicitly partisan than ever before, and it portends a disturbing future in which every natural disaster could become not just a challenging task of rescue and cleanup but a simultaneous fight against falsehoods and conspiracy theories.</p><p>It’s not that disasters have never been political; presidents are often judged by how they react (anyone over 40 knows what the phrase “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-katrina-anniversary/heck-job-brownie-where-disgraced-fema-head-now-n400436" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Brownie, you’re doing a heckuva job</u></a>” refers to), with politicians discredited or elevated by how they performed and the opposition taking the opportunity to criticize the administration’s competence. But Trump has given that familiar criticism a particularly venomous cast, claiming not just that the disaster response is falling short but that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are <em><em>intentionally</em></em> ignoring the victims because of who they are. </p><p>Trump has focused in particular on <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/376982/trump-hurricane-helene-fema-lies-debunked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three falsehoods</u></a>: First, that the federal government is abandoning hurricane victims in areas where there are lots of Republican voters; <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/10/trumps-false-claim-of-stolen-disaster-relief-funds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>second</u></a>, that funds for recovery are unavailable because the Biden administration gave them to undocumented immigrants (“they stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season”); and third, that the $750 distributed immediately to survivors to enable them to obtain food and other basics, known as Serious Needs Assistance, is all the aid anyone will get. </p><p>It was like a bat-signal: As soon as Trump set the terms, conservative media and influencers <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/right-wing-media-are-falsely-claiming-fema-spent-their-resources-migrants-instead-helping" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>swung into action</u></a>, repeating Trump’s bogus <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/charlie-kirk-elon-musk-hurricane-helene-fema-misinformation-x-twitter.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claims</u></a> to their audiences. And then things took a strange turn. </p><p>To bring a conspiracy theory into the mainstream, you need individuals and outlets who serve as disinformation linkages, connecting the crazier people and ideas to those with legitimacy. In this case, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, played a key role, and she had a message: The weather is being manipulated by a shadowy conspiracy with powerful technologies at its disposal. “Yes they can control the weather,” she <a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1842755981312196688" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted on X</u></a> to her 3.7 million followers. “Anyone who says they don’t, or makes fun of this, is lying to you.” </p><p>As evidence, Greene and her allies offer the fact that many people have <em><em>proposed</em></em> geoengineering as a solution to a warming planet, which in their eyes means it must already be taking place, and that’s why these hurricanes came to the Southeast. And who is “They”? It might be the government, but to many, it’s obviously the Jews. </p><p>Antisemitic conspiracy theories around the hurricanes are swirling on the fetid sewer of right-wing hate and misinformation controlled by the world’s richest individual. As the <em><em>Washington Post</em></em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/08/hurricane-helene-antisemitic-misinformation-x/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>, “The attacks, which include wild claims that Jewish officials are conspiring to orchestrate the disasters, sabotage the recovery or even seize victims’ property, are being fomented largely on Elon Musk’s X.” </p><p>The tide of misinformation can be partly explained by the calendar. “What’s different about this natural disaster is the timing,” says Danielle Lee Tomson of the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington. “We’ve never had such an incredible, devastating natural disaster within weeks of a presidential election that has impacted two swing states,” North Carolina and Georgia. That gives purchase to the claims that there are conspiracies afoot to change the outcome of the election. </p><p>In 2024, it may have been inevitable that a disaster would be tied, however implausibly, to the “one narrative to rule them all this election cycle, which is that of non-citizen voting,” Tomson notes. </p><p>Disaster makes people search for answers that give order to chaos and suffering. Even answers that describe a world of sinister forces can be weirdly comforting, by assuring their adherents that they are among a select group who understand the reality most people miss. Amidst the chaos, you can grasp onto whatever bizarre belief you choose. </p><p>In the future, we might expect that any climate-linked disaster — hurricanes, floods, heat waves, droughts — will become fodder for this kind of misinformation, not just passed around from person to person but driven from the top of the political food chain. </p><p>In effect, this is the inverse of the kind of climate misinformation we’re more used to, which goes under the heading of “denial”: denying that temperatures are increasing, or that carbon pollution is a problem, or that human activity drives climate change. Since the occurrence of a hurricane or fire or other observably extreme event can’t be denied, this new kind of misinformation actually posits not just that the effects of climate change are real, but that they’re <em><em>worse</em></em> than you realize. It isn’t just that people have lost their lives or their homes due to a disaster, but that the disaster was engineered by sinister forces (including but not limited to the government) to accomplish a nefarious political goal. </p><p>So yesterday’s climate denier could become tomorrow’s climate obsessive, seeing in every disaster the hidden hand of the same global conspiracy that is creating all the world’s problems. “Climate change is the new covid,” <a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1843432743163834722" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> Congresswoman Greene; “Ask your government if the weather is manipulated or controlled.” It’s not fake, it’s a plot, one getting worse with each upward tick in global temperatures. </p><p>Of course, misinformation comes in a variety of forms — some <a href="https://x.com/florida_grand/status/1843641980523557185?s=46" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>downplayed</u></a> Milton as a way of arguing that the elites are trying to frighten you — and even debunkings can be a path to elevated social media clout when so much focus is on these events.</p><p>It may be, as Tomson argues, that it takes something like an impending election to turn conspiracy theorizing around disasters up to 11. “We’ve never seen such an opportune moment to repackage disaster for political gain,” she told me. But the effects of climate change will only grow more intense and dramatic, and there will be political actors looking to turn them against their opponents — and frightened people ready to believe the worst. </p>

Nantucket County, Massachusetts</strong> – A new group – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/keepnantucketwild/" target="_blank"><u>Keep Nantucket Wild</u></a> – is mobilizing opposition to the Vineyard Wind offshore wind project, seeking to capitalize on the recent blade breakage to sever the town of Nantucket’s good neighbor agreement with project developer Avangrid. </p><ul><li>Keep Nantucket Wild was started weeks ago by raw bar restaurateur Jesse Sandole and yoga studio owner Evie O’Connor.

East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana</strong> – One lowkey local election this fall may decide the future of Louisiana’s renewables: the swing seat on the state’s Public Service Commission, which is being vacated this year by a retiring moderate Republican. </p><ul><li>Only 3% of Louisiana’s power generation came <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=LA#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20coal%20fueled%20about,of%20Louisiana's%20total%20electricity%20generation." target="_blank"><u>from renewables</u></a> last year but that’s poised for significant growth thanks to offshore wind development <a href="https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/gulf-mexico-activities" target="_blank"><u>in the Gulf</u></a> and the PSC’s decision over the summer to let Entergy expand its solar capacity in the state <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/entergy-louisiana-psc-solar-procurement/716944/" target="_blank"><u>by 3 GW</u></a>.<br/></li><li>State Sen.

## Power Line Planning

<strong>Transmissions on transmission </strong>– The Energy Department last week <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-transmission-planning-study" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released a must-read</a> national planning study for transmission to connect renewables to the grid through 2040.
</p><ul>
<li>The takeaway? We could reduce billions of tonnes of CO2 emissions with interregional transmission and constraining development would require new nuclear and hydrogen energy to meet emission reduction targets, instead of solar, wind, and batteries.<br/>
</li>
<li>The lengthy report didn’t go into the permitting challenges at all though and the mapping does read aspirational if you know the context.</li>
<li>Regardless, we hope to see you on DOE’s webinar on the study <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/events/october-16-national-transmission-planning-study-informational-webinar" target="_blank"><u>next Wednesday</u></a>.</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>SCOTUS shrugs for once</strong> – The Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/10/supreme-court-declines-to-block-epa-methane-mercury-rules/" target="_blank">declined to stay</a> challenges to the EPA’s methane and mercury air pollution regulations, meaning at least two Biden regulatory tailwinds for renewables developers remains in play.
</p><ul>
<li>This means those challenges will have to weave their way through the appeals process while remaining in effect for companies.<br/>
</li>
<li>There’s still an outstanding request for the high court to stay EPA’s CO2 regulations for power plants though, so stay tuned.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the court has asked the U.S. solicitor general to weigh in on <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/supreme-court-asks-solicitor-general-to-weigh-in-on-climate-case" target="_blank">fossil fuel climate liability cases</a>.</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Big Oil wants IRA credits </strong>– Executives for oil majors have asked former President Donald Trump to keep at least some of the Inflation Reduction Act in place, reports <a href="https://qz.com/oil-lobby-donald-trump-joe-biden-ira-spending-evs-1851666483" target="_blank"><em><em>the Wall Street Journal</em></em></a><em><em style="">. </em></em>
</p><ul>
<li>However, don’t be fooled: the <em><em>WSJ</em></em> reporting indicates a priority for oil executives is carbon capture – not renewables. I first suggested this might be a possibility over the summer in my <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-ira-climate-law" target="_self"><u>first story for Heatmap</u></a>.<br/>

## Are Fossil Fuel Projects More or Less Insurable Than Renewables?

date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDE2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0Nzc3ODQ3NX0.AcHTRIbnBH-MZ2vqTw-DSFUJSYmMptq6VpbX9cda0Qs/image.jpg?width=900&height=410&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>This week we chatted with Jason Kaminsky, CEO of renewables insurance data firm kWh Analytics. Kaminsky has been laser focused on the real risks of physical damage solar and battery projects face – and the fears host communities feel about them. We talked about how those risks compare to fossil fuels and whether innovation could cure this industry ailment.<br/></p>
<p>The following is an edited version of our conversation. </p>
<p><strong>Are fossil fuel projects more or less insurable than the renewable projects you cover? </strong></p>
<p>On the whole, renewables are more exposed to natural catastrophe risk. You’re putting glass out onto a field that has hail or fire or what have you, and you see more exposure to natural events than you would [even] a spinning turbine that's surrounded by steel. When we were getting to insuring property, the first risk that came onto our radar screen was hail risk. The industry had shifted development into Texas for a variety of reasons and the insurance companies at that point in time were not recalibrating their models for the fact there’s actually quite significant hail in Texas. And we were seeing significant losses. </p>
<p>It’s not uncommon to have multiple $50 million loss events in any given year for solar projects due to hail, typically in Texas, Oklahoma. That’s the zone of hail. And we don’t see that with a gas facility particularly because, well, it’s in a building.</p>
<p>But it’s way more distributed than a single fossil fuel facility, so even if you have a $50 million loss, that does not have an impact on the ability of the grid to generate. </p>
<p>The part of the facility that is not damaged will continue to produce power and put power onto the grid. You get many more partial loss events versus a gas facility where the turbine goes and you basically have a total loss. Your ability to distribute your risk is much greater with renewables, which is a very strong pro from an insurance underwriting perspective. </p>
<p><strong>Are new technologies helping with renewables’ insurability? </strong></p>
<p>In the last few years, there’s been a lot of innovation. At RE+ you walk among the floor of battery providers and they all have very impressive fire management capabilities, and it’s at the forefront of how they market their technology. You also see that with solar modules some have said, <em><em>we’re hail resistant</em></em>. The way they’re putting sensors onto cells, the way they’re running controls on cooling devices, the way thermal management systems and battery management systems have abilities to vent for heat… they’ve made a lot of improvements. </p>
<p>But it’s interesting – I was at an asset management conference in March and I’d been going to that conference for 10 years, and it was the first time I’d heard at that conference about the social license to operate. They’re seeing these quasi-local thought leader groups that all seem to be using the same talking points that oppose large scale solar in their communities, and they push local regulatory rules to reduce the ability to develop solar in their backyards. It was encouraging to see a discussion around it and an acknowledgement that as an industry we need to go into these communities and spend time talking to the local communities. </p>
<p><strong>Fascinating. Do you think discussions like these are enough to mean progress in dealing with project opposition? </strong></p>
<p>It’s not historically been in the DNA of our industry to do that. I’d say today the opposition is much more organized than many renewable energy developers today so it’s been this interesting phenomenon. The local opposition says <em><em>we don’t want this industrial solar</em></em>. It’s proven to be effective at killing some of these utility scale deals. </p>
<p>We still have a long way to go in educating communities and getting them comfortable with the land stewardship that happens at these facilities. The solar industry manages a ton of land. It’s not my core focus but I’ve been exposed to those challenges around the community engagement piece and I think most developers are still building the muscle in how to do that effectively. </p>

## Hurricane Milton Crashes Into Tampa’s Development Boom

date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News

Once a sleepy retirement community, the area has seen a major development boom in recent years fueled by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tampa-why-gen-z-and-millennial-tourists-are-flocking-to-this-retirement-mecca-1e2be027" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Millennials and Gen Zers</u></a> seeking the perks of coastal living; it was <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/tampa-bay/2024/05/28/fastest-growing-cities-florida-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the 11th fastest-growing city</u></a> of its size in the U.S. as of this spring and has been expected to continue to grow at nearly twice the rate of the rest of the country over the next five years. A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/tampa-florida-hurricane-milton-vulnerabilities-2febd205" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third</u></a> of those residents, including many of the newcomers, live in low-lying neighborhoods now under urgent evacuation notices due to the threat of “unsurvivable” storm surge, which could rise up to 15 feet.</p><p>The development boom that has made Tampa Bay so desirable is also why it’s particularly vulnerable. In an analysis of Hurricane Ian — the most expensive storm in Florida’s history, which struck just south of Milton’s projected track in 2022 — the re-insurance company Swiss Re <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/hurricane/2023/09/29/florida-home-storm-damage-building-codes-population-boom/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a> that if the storm had struck in the 1970s, it would have caused a third to a half as much damage. Simply put: You can’t adapt your way out of a hurricane problem.</p><p>If there is anyone to talk to about the vulnerabilities unique to Tampa Bay, it’s Stephen M. Strader, an associate professor and hazard geographer at Villanova University. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p><strong>You shared </strong><a href="https://x.com/StephenMStrader/status/1843282278996398432" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>an image on Twitter</strong></u></a><strong> of the explosive growth in the Tampa Bay area between 1940 and 2024. Why does this make the region vulnerable to a storm like Milton? Is it just about there being more people there?</strong></p><p>When we think about disasters, we think of the intersection of three components: a violent event, like what we have with Milton; vulnerability, or what types of people could be in the path, which could be related to racial divides, age, and gender norms; and what a lot of my work focuses on, exposure.</p><p>Exposure is just the number of people or things that we care about — businesses, schools, and things like that — that are subject to losses if an event occurs. Florida is a great example of rapid urbanization since the 1900s, and it’s rapid development in a very hazard-prone region.</p><p><strong>It can be easy for outsiders to sit back and wonder why anyone would buy a house on the water or on a barrier island near Tampa.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of factors that come into play when you think about where we develop and why we develop certain locations. One of the biggest pressures that we see is that it’s desirable land: In the short term, people want to live near the water. It’s beautiful! People don’t think necessarily about the risk that comes with it because they’re too focused on their dream, which is to live near the ocean. </p><p>The other side of that is, from an economic standpoint, people see it as an opportunity to have businesses and to build condos. Developers see the land and think, “How much could I buy this for and sell it for with homes on it?” This really started back with Carl Fisher, who was famous for building the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He was a thrill-seeker, but also a businessman and developer, and he loved to go to South Florida — which is now Miami Beach, and then was swamps and mangroves and not developed at all. And he thought, <em><em>Hmm, this would be a great place for people to visit for vacations and experiences. </em></em>He slowly started filling in the wetlands with sand. And that’s the history of Florida's development: It continued because this was very valuable land.</p><p>There is a lot of socioeconomic pressure to develop in these areas, but we’re also starting to see it change. Those pressures are lessening because you have insurance industries now and events like this year after year.</p><p><strong>There is another issue in Southwest Florida, which is that many of the homes were constructed before building codes were </strong><a href="https://x.com/MarkCBove/status/1843396247039950940" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>updated</strong></u></a><strong>, right?</strong></p><p>I tend to do a lot more work on the manufactured housing side. Before 1974, all manufactured homes were called mobile homes, and there wasn’t really a standard. Then, in 1974, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development came in and said, “We need to increase the standards,” and they did.</p><p>Fast-forward to 1992 and Hurricane Andrew, and they realized these codes were not strong enough. Many people lived in manufactured homes that were destroyed by Andrew, which was a very windy hurricane. We think hurricanes are wind threats because of Andrew, but hurricanes are water threats, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024#:~:text=90%25%20of%20hurricane%20fatalities%20result%20from%20water" target="_self"><u>most deaths occur because of that water</u></a>. Andrew was the opposite.</p><p>Between 1992 and 1994, they updated building codes for manufactured housing, and actually, along the coastline, Florida has some of the strongest codes for manufactured homes in the country. A lot of the areas that will be affected by Milton will have those strong standards. But many homes were also grandfathered in if they were built before that time.</p><p>That’s just one type of housing. My guess is that when you have a lot of rapid development since the 1990s — well, I have some questions about structural integrity since building codes can be strong but they might not be followed. And we sometimes don’t know until afterwards. A lot of what is being built are condos or McMansions — it’s basically, <em><em>How fast can you build them, how cheap can you build them, and how high can you sell them? </em></em>And they look great until their performance is put into question. </p><p>Insurance companies are starting to see this and ask, “How do we retrofit structures?” Structure-wise, though, I think Tampa is in a decent spot. The problem is, the water is so powerful that it’s not going to matter.</p><p><strong>What kinds of conversations do you think Floridians should be having about development or potential redevelopment after Milton?</strong></p><p>I’m a huge proponent of resisting the urge to build right back — the reason being that’s how you get repetitive losses. The hard part is, with a lot of insurance, if you have it, you only get provisions to build back the way you were. You don’t have the ability to improve. So what I end up telling people is, sometimes these disasters provide an opportunity to assess what we need to do from a planning standpoint. This is unsustainable development, and not just because of hurricanes, but because of rising sea levels and the stress on the environment. And unfortunately, a lot of these developments were built on top of wetlands and marshes and mangroves that used to protect the island areas as natural barriers. </p><p>The hard part is that people’s emotions are very strong after disasters, and they immediately want to return to how things were. That’s why you see people picking up the pieces the day after a storm, sometimes even when they’re injured. So we have to resist the urge as a group, and say, maybe this isn’t the time to think about rebuilding here. </p><p>Many wetland restoration projects in Florida are doing that very thing: reclaiming the environments that protected people inland. But on the other side you have developers and builders and local economies that rely on people coming to these areas, and that pressures people to come right back. Then you end up with a situation of repetitive losses and that’s why FEMA has been losing money over the years — it’s not so much that we’re putting money toward disasters but that we’re not getting value out of it, because it’s so much more likely for there to be impacts because<em> </em>of that exposure growth. Look at what happened after Helene and what’s going to happen with Milton: We’re splitting resources between the two. But we’re doing the best with the tools we have when there’s pressure on both sides, and considerations both economic and safety.</p><p><strong>Is there anything else people should know about the geography of Tampa or the development risk there?</strong></p><p>This storm is going to be different than other storms, and that’s because of the direction and intensity of it. The one thing we have to remember is that all that development — and everybody, for the most part, who isn’t 100 years old — has not experienced a hurricane of this magnitude in their life. That means everyone has the cognitive bias to say, “I’ve been through hurricanes before and was fine.” That is probably not going to be the case with this event; no one has been through this before.</p><p>What’s worrisome to me is that the trajectory of the hurricane is changing. A subtle shift north or south by 20 miles could mean a big difference for the Tampa region — if you have the right side of the hurricane push water into the Bay, it’s no different than 10 people jumping into a hot tub. The water level goes up and forces all that water into a smaller region, which is going to lead to more storm surge in Tampa Bay, Clearwater, and the St. Pete area. I don’t want to call it a “perfect storm,” but if you push all that water in there, you’re going to flood people in a way that hurricanes they’ve been through before never got close to. And I worry, if it goes south, about Fort Myers and the areas that were hit hard by Hurricane Ian. So it’s multilayered.</p><p>The good news that I’ll bring up is that we’re reeling from Helene, which means people have it in their brains about how bad this can be, which is probably causing more people to evacuate than normal. We have a problem with disaster amnesia in places where a hurricane hasn’t happened in a long time so “it’s not going to happen again.” And we forget. I remember Hurricane Katrina and what it did to New Orleans. It still has effects, but the students I’m teaching now weren’t even alive when it hit. These memories are short, and many people in Florida today weren’t there 30 years ago or 20 years ago. The only good thing to come out of Helene is that people are now aware of what can happen.</p>

## UAW Is Threatening to Strike Again — This Time Over Shelved EV Plans

date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc4ODY4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDIwMzg0N30.fvCBqOQxa0MZph8enStUc6Rx40I1jHHb_IA7PE3RrfE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">One of the biggest wins the United Auto Workers’ secured in its historic <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/the-electric-vehicle-revolution-is-still-non-union" target="_blank">negotiations with the Big Three automakers</a> last year was a commitment from Stellantis to reopen and expand its shuttered factory in Belvidere, Illinois. Now the company is shelving those plans, which included retooling the factory to produce electric vehicles and EV batteries, and suing the union for threatening to strike in response.</p><p>The dispute illustrates a new turn in the EV transition. Whereas last year auto workers were wary of the transition and fighting to keep their jobs intact, now their jobs are dependent on that transition actually happening, and happening soon. The UAW is <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2024/08/20/stellantis-uaw-belvidere-assembly-plant-strike-reopening/74869725007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concerned that the company will delay the plant’s reopening</u></a> until 2028 — after the union’s contract expires. </p><p>Stellantis idled the Belvidere plant, which previously produced Jeep Cherokees, in February 2023, laying off more than 1,300 workers. But under its agreement with the UAW, the company said it would spend nearly $5 billion to restart the factory. The contract includes commitments to opening a parts distribution hub there this year, producing a new mid-size truck there by 2027, and building an electric vehicle battery plant at the site by 2028. Not only would jobs at Belvidere be restored, but the battery plant was expected to employ an additional 1,300 people. Former Belvidere employees would also be reclassified as temporary layoffs and receive partial pay and full healthcare benefits until operations started up again.</p><p>President Joe Biden celebrated Belvidere as a “great comeback story” in his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>State of the Union speech</u></a> in March. “Instead of an auto factory shutting down, an auto factory is reopening and a new state-of-the-art battery factory is being built to power those cars,” he said. “Instead of a town being left behind it’s a community moving forward again!”</p><p>In July, plans to turn Belvidere into an EV hub seemed to be taking shape when the Department of Energy selected Stellantis for a $335 million grant to transition the plant’s assembly lines to be able to produce electric vehicles. The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/mesc/domestic-manufacturing-conversion-grant-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>grant website</u></a> says the project was anticipated to incorporate “significant upgrades” to the plant’s infrastructure and re-employ about “1,450 unionized and highly skilled employees.” Stellantis, however, did not issue any press releases about the grant. In a <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/07/11/stellantis-grant/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>statement to the </u><u><em><em>Chicago Tribune</em></em></u></a>, the company said it was “an important step in continuing to work toward finalizing a sustainable solution” for Belvidere.</p><p>About a month later, the narrative around Belvidere started to shift. UAW president Shawn Fain <a href="https://x.com/UAW/status/1824547479074775502" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted a video</u></a> on social media claiming something was “rotten” at Stellantis and accused the company of “putting the brakes” on its plans to reopen the plant. On August 20, <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26081&mid=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Stellantis confirmed</u></a> that “plans for Belvidere will be delayed,” though it “firmly stands by its commitment” to reopen the plant. The company’s explanation for the decision was vague and did not include a new timeline. “To ensure the Company’s future competitiveness and sustainability,” it said, “it is critical that the business case for all investments is aligned with market conditions and our ability to accommodate a wide range of consumer demands.”</p><p>As it stands, the business is not exactly in a sustainable place. In July, Stellantis reported that its U.S. revenues were down 16% compared to the first half of last year. Declining sales have left dealerships with a glut of inventory. Fain blames the company’s poor performance on its CEO Carlos Tavares, questioning how “market conditions” could be holding back investments in Belvidere when Tavares took a 56% raise last year, “making him the highest paid auto executive outside of Tesla.” </p><p>In response, the company <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26271&mid=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published a fact check of the union’s claims,</u></a> which notes that “there is indisputable volatility in the market, especially as the industry transitions to an electrified future. Over the past year, numerous companies across the industry have announced investment and product delays as well as outright product cancellations.” Stellantis currently sells just one EV in the U.S., the Fiat 500e, which it <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=25708&mid=351" target="_blank">manufactures in Italy</a>; in September, the company announced it had suspended production due to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-pauses-production-electric-fiat-500-due-poor-demand-2024-09-12/" target="_blank"><u>poor sales</u></a>, though it still has several new EV models slated to launch later this year.</p><p>More than a dozen local UAW units all over the country filed grievances against Stellantis in August, arguing that the company’s “failure to plan for, fund and launch these programs constitute a violation” of its contract. The union has threatened to strike if the grievances are not addressed, citing its “right to strike over product and investment commitments” — another provision of the 2023 contract.</p><p>Stellantis denies that it has violated the contract and thrown the accusation back at UAW, noting that the agreement included a clause that says it is understood that the investments are “contingent upon plant performance, changes in market conditions, and consumer demand.” It has since <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-files-new-suits-against-united-auto-workers-union-2024-10-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed eight lawsuits</u></a> against the union and several of its locals for threatening to strike.</p><p>The company has also not completely abandoned its plans for the EV transition. A few weeks ago, it <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26153" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> it would invest more than $406 million to prepare three Michigan factories for EV production. During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urAJ4gmSqZE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>livestream</u></a> in September, Fain wrote off those investments as representing just a small portion of what the company committed to. </p><p>In response to questions about why investment in Belvidere was delayed, whether the company would still pursue the federal grant, or what the new timeline for the plant was, a representative from Stellantis sent me bullet points from the previously published fact check.</p><p>The Department of Energy did not answer questions about the status or timeline for the factory conversion grant.</p>

## A costly lesson, often learned the hard way

date: 2024-10-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Medicare does not pay for general, long-term care. Now, Kamala Harris, the Democrat&#8217;s candidate for president, wants to expand Medicare to pay for long-term care for older people in their home. That would need an amenable new Congress, but many families are presently left trying to piece together care for older relatives. Also on today&#8217;s show: potential structure changes to Google and the rising value of the U.S. dollar.</p>

## The IEA Has Good News and Bad News About Renewables

date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Rare rainstorms have flooded parts of the Sahara Desert • Storm Kirk is expected to bring flooding to parts of northern France • Wyoming’s 75,000-acre Elk Fire has been burning for nearly two weeks.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Category 5 Hurricane Milton approaches Florida</h3><p>
	Hurricane Milton, currently a Category 5 storm, is expected to make landfall this evening near Tampa, Florida, as a Category 4 hurricane with 130 mph winds, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/tbw/dssbriefs/dssbrief.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the National Weather Service</a>. It will bring between 10 and 15 feet of storm surge (possibly <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/hurricane-milton-to-have-extreme-impacts-in-florida/1700306?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more</a>, depending on which forecast you’re following), plus tornadoes. The conditions have already started to deteriorate and will continue to do so throughout the day. “There is no recent precedent for a major hurricane to take this path toward Florida,” <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/hurricane-milton-to-have-extreme-impacts-in-florida/1700306?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> AccuWeather Director of Forecasting Operations Dan DePodwin. “This is an increasing significant risk of devastating, catastrophic impacts to this region.”

</p><h3>2. Studies link Helene and Milton to climate change</h3><p>
	Climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels almost certainly made Hurricane Milton and Hurricane Helene a lot worse, according to two new rapid attribution studies by World Weather Attribution and <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/hurricane-rapid-intensification?utm_content=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024%20CID_5a4c73076a532c0cb91ebd2b7e99e07f&utm_term=extreme%20rapid%20intensification&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Climate Central</a>. A storm like Hurricane Helene is about two-and-a-half times more likely in the region today compared to what would be expected in a “cooler pre-industrial climate,” WWA found. That means Helene, the kind of storm one would expect to see once every 130 years on average, is now expected to develop at a rate of about once every 53 years. Separately, Climate Central looked at Hurricane Milton, which already has the distinction of being <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hurricane-milton-category-5-storm-fifth-strongest-ever-atlantic-1965604?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the fifth strongest</a> Atlantic storm on record. The nonprofit’s findings show that Milton’s rapid intensification — one of <a href="https://theconversation.com/hurricane-milton-explodes-into-a-powerful-category-5-storm-as-it-heads-for-florida-heres-how-rapid-intensification-works-240754?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the fastest and most powerful</a> instances of the phenomenon in history — is primarily due to high <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" target="_self">sea surface temperatures</a> in the weeks before Milton developed, which was made at least 400 times more likely by climate change and up to 800 times more likely.
</p><p>
	“While hurricane seasons eventually end, global temperatures haven’t stopped going up,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-change-hurricane-milton-helene?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote</a> Heatmap’s Jeva Lange. “That, perhaps, is the more terrifying subtext of the attribution studies: There will be more Miltons and Helenes.”
</p><h3>3. IEA: Renewable capacity growth not enough to triple by 2030</h3><p>
	There are several big energy reports out this week, and taken together, their findings tell a nuanced story of an energy transition that’s well underway, but still moving too slowly. Let’s start with the big one: The International Energy Agency’s <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/88a07dd9-42fe-4232-842e-9015b4b647f8/Renewables2024.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Renewables 2024</a> report, published this morning. It says that the world is on track to add 5,500 gigawatts of new clean energy capacity by 2030, 80% of which will come from solar PV alone. That means renewables will account for half of global electricity generation by the end of the decade.
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="a899f0c8a34c4517bc52eaf2af63790e" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="39e77" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc5ODM3MS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODQ4OTYwOX0.n4n4GMyA46qRpGp9UM2b8MYlWWAY-mGwymy2BrMKosU/image.png?width=980"/>
<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">IEA</small>
</p><p>
	While this is huge progress (the report notes that 5,500 GW is roughly equal the power capacity of China, the European Union, India, and the U.S. combined), it is not enough to meet the COP28 goal of tripling renewable capacity by 2030. But! The IEA stresses that it is “entirely possible” to meet this target if governments can get their acts together, set bold new emission reduction targets in the coming months, and work together to lower the energy transition costs for poorer countries. “The market can deliver on renewables, and now governments need to prioritize investing in storage, grids, and other forms of clean flexibility to enable this transformation,” said Dave Jones, director of global insights at energy think tank Ember. “The next half decade is going to be one heck of a ride.”
</p><p>
	So, that’s renewables. Let’s look at what all this means for emissions and, most importantly, warming.
</p><h3>4. Rhodium and DNV forecast 2100 warming levels</h3><p>
	An energy transition <a href="https://www.dnv.com/news/eto-energy-related-emissions-will-peak-in-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" target="_blank">report</a> published this morning from Norwegian risk management company DNV concludes, rather remarkably, that energy-related emissions are set to peak this year and begin a steady decline thanks to the plummeting costs of solar and batteries, especially in China. “Emissions peaking is a milestone for humanity,” said Remi Eriksen, group president and CEO of DNV. However, the projected rate of emission reduction is only enough to limit warming to <strong>2.2 degrees Celsius </strong>by 2100. “We must now focus on how quickly emissions decline and use the available tools to accelerate the energy transition,” Eriksen added.
</p><p>
	The Rhodium <a href="https://rhg.com/research/rhodium-climate-outlook-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" target="_blank">Climate Outlook 2024</a> report, out yesterday, concluded that there is a less than 7% chance of the world limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius “if current trends in policy and technology development continue.” In fact, it projected a “very likely” increase between<strong> 2 degrees Celsius</strong> and *gulp* <strong>3.7 degrees Celsius </strong>by century’s end. However, odds of limiting warming to 2 degrees jump to 96% if all countries can get to net-zero emissions by 2070. To date, 149 countries (representing 88% of global emissions) have made net-zero or carbon neutrality commitments, though it remains to be seen if and when they’ll meet those goals.

	The cost of “green” hydrogen – that which is produced with clean energy – is likely to remain “prohibitively expensive,” according to a new <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/abstract/S2542-4351(24)00421-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2542435124004215%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" target="_blank">study</a> published yesterday in the journal <em>Joule</em>. The fuel is seen as key to curbing emissions from hard-to-abate sectors (industry, for example), and many are banking on the price of production falling. But the researchers say the high storage and distribution costs are often overlooked. Taking those costs into consideration, carbon capture and storage is cheaper than green hydrogen when it comes to curbing emissions, the researchers found. “Even if production costs decrease in line with predictions, storage and distribution costs will prevent hydrogen being cost-competitive in many sectors,” <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/newsplus/green-hydrogen-far-pricier-than-projected/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> lead author Roxana Shafiee, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard University Center for the Environment. “Our results challenge a growing idea that hydrogen will be the ‘Swiss army knife of decarbonization’ and suggest that the opportunities for hydrogen may be narrower than previously thought.”

## Let’s get apolitical

date: 2024-10-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>In a time of fraught political polarization, it&#8217;s hard for companies to decide whether to take political stands or remain quietly on the sidelines. Today, as a continuation of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/collection/office-politics/">our Office Politics series</a>, we&#8217;ll hear why some places that once mixed business and politics may be keeping a lower profile now. Then, nearly a month into a strike, negotiations between aerospace giant Boeing and its union members have broken off. We hear why.</p>

## It’s not me, it’s you: Google faces a break-up

date: 2024-10-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The U.S. Department of Justice is taking aim at Google, saying the tech giant might need to be broken up because it&#8217;s too dominant in the market. This comes after a major ruling in August where a judge found Google has been running an illegal monopoly when it comes to online searches. Plus, an agency enabling the international mail system celebrates its 150th birthday.</p>

## Want to Decarbonize Your Life? Here’s How.

date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc3ODE5MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NzE1NzA2Mn0.1bH9sNELj9Se74-BoLYmdsqRV75lIXXNlvPestwfC5I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	How can you fight climate change in your daily life? Last month, Heatmap published our attempt at answering that question: Called Decarbonize Your Life, it’s a series of stories and guides to help you make better, smarter decisions to nudge the energy system away from fossil fuels. We consulted studies, ran our own analysis (with a little help from some friends), and used our expert judgment to arrive at six big, high-leverage actions you can take to fight climate change and cut carbon pollution.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Jesse and Rob speak with Heatmap’s deputy editor Jillian Goodman and founding staff writer Emily Pontecorvo about what those six big actions are, how the guide came together, and why big choices matter so much more than small ones. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>So it’s more than just the carbon impact which is the key here, right? This systemic leverage point that you’re trying to make is that you’re trying to think about — beyond just reducing emissions, which is important — how is that actually having some kind of systemic impact on reorienting the global capitalist system, right? That we all live in, towards where we want to go, towards what a net zero emissions lifestyle and society looks like.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>And instead of every dollar you spend going to the task of taking oil out of the ground, and the task of building more internal combustion cars, it’s going to the task of building more EVs and harvesting electricity. Anyway, Jillian, I interrupted you.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jillian Goodman: </strong>I was just going to add — and again, I’m just paraphrasing you — every time you drive, it’s a marginal impact. Every single time you use the device. Not only are you emitting less in the short term, you’re emitting less in the long term. And as the grid gets cleaner, every time you drive your EV, your EV will get cleaner, as well.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Emily Pontecorvo:</strong> One other thing that we were thinking about a little bit is thinking about these actions in terms of, which ones are you, as an individual, you’re literally the one who’s burning the fossil fuels. When you drive your car, you are burning the gas. When you’re lighting your stove, you’re burning natural gas. And not to put it all on the individual, but you’re the one who has the power to say, <em><em>Okay, I’m not gonna burn fossil fuels in my home anymore.</em></em> And whereas with a few other actions — like with rooftop solar, with efficiency improvements — those are extremely important, and those are very high on our list for other reasons. But they’re more indirect.

## How Climate Change Is Supercharging Hurricane Milton

date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc2ODk2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjkxMTQ0NH0.wZoQdZ5RRi34C-oAW-_F_mWtSvSqHSUx_sHGs7Ouc5U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>Contrary to <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-milton-misinformation" target="_self"><u>recent rumor</u></a>, the U.S. government cannot direct major hurricanes like Helene and Milton toward red states. According to two new rapid attribution studies by World Weather Attribution and <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/hurricane-rapid-intensification?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024&utm_content=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024+CID_5a4c73076a532c0cb91ebd2b7e99e07f&utm_source=Climate%20Central%20Email%20Campaign%20Monitor&utm_term=extreme%20rapid%20intensification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Climate Central</u></a>, however, human actors almost certainly made the storms a lot worse through the burning of fossil fuels. </p><p>A storm like Hurricane Helene, which has <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>killed at least 227 people so far</u></a> and caused close to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/business/property-damange-hurricane-helene-47-billion/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$50 billion in estimated property losses</u></a> across the southeast, is about two-and-a-half times more likely in the region today compared to what would be expected in a “cooler pre-industrial climate,” WWA found. That means Helene, the kind of storm one would expect to see once every 130 years on average, is now expected to develop at a rate of about once every 53 years. Additionally, WWA researchers determined that extreme rainfall from Helene was 70% more likely and 10% heavier in the Appalachians and about 40% more likely in the southern Appalachian region, where many of the deaths occurred, due to climate change. </p><p>“Americans shouldn’t have to fear hurricanes more violent than Helene — we have all the knowledge and technology needed to lower demand and replace oil, gas, and coal with renewable energy,” Friederike Otto, the lead of WWA and a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said in a statement. “But vitally, we need the political will.” Alarmingly, the attribution study found that storms could drop an additional 10% or more rain on average as soon as the 2050s if warming <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/year-warming-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>reaches</u></a> 2 degrees Celsius.</p><p>WWA’s study is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/helene-rainfall-boosted-human-driven-climate-change-studies-find-rcna173608" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not the first</a> to be released on Hurricane Helene, but it was still produced incredibly quickly and has not been peer reviewed. Just a few weeks ago, the group issued a correction on a report estimating the contribution of climate change to recent <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-and-high-exposure-increased-costs-and-disruption-to-lives-and-livelihoods-from-flooding-associated-with-exceptionally-heavy-rainfall-in-central-europe/" target="_blank">flooding in Europe</a>.</p><p>Separately, Climate Central looked at Hurricane Milton, which already has the distinction of being <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hurricane-milton-category-5-storm-fifth-strongest-ever-atlantic-1965604" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the fifth strongest</u></a> Atlantic storm on record. The nonprofit’s findings show that Milton’s rapid intensification — one of <a href="https://theconversation.com/hurricane-milton-explodes-into-a-powerful-category-5-storm-as-it-heads-for-florida-heres-how-rapid-intensification-works-240754" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the fastest and most powerful</u></a> instances of the phenomenon in history — is primarily due to high <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_self"><u>sea surface temperatures</u></a> in the weeks before Milton developed, which was made at least 400 times more likely by climate change and up to 800 times more likely. (WWA relied on Climate Central’s Climate Shift Index for oceans for its research, but found “climate change made the unusually hot sea surface temperature about 200-500 times more likely.”)</p><p>Attribution science is incredibly tricky, especially for a storm system like a hurricane that has variables ranging from wind shear to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation to ocean temperatures and jet stream variations. When <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>I spoke to a member of the WWA team earlier this year</u></a>, I was told the organization specifically avoids attributing the intensification of any <em><em>individual</em></em> hurricane — in theory, one of the more straightforward relationships — to climate change because of the relatively limited historical modeling available. Even something like rainfall “is not necessarily correlated to the magnitude of the floods that you see because there are other factors,” WWA’s Clair Barnes previously told me — for example, the steep-sided mountains and hollows of western North Carolina, which served as funnels for rainfall to an especially devastating effect.</p><p>But regarding the relationship between hurricanes and climate change more generally, “We’re relatively confident that storms will get more intense” in a warming world, Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton geoscientist, explained on <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-hurricane-helene" target="_self"><u>a recent episode of Heatmap’s Shift Key</u></a> podcast. “And we’re <em><em>really </em></em>confident that storms will get wetter.”</p><p>Helene and Milton hammer that point home: once-in-a-generation storms can now arrive on back-to-back weekends. You can almost understand the impulse to devise a zany explanation as to why. Only, the truth is far simpler than cloud seeding or <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-maui-fire-photos-misrepresented-conspiracy-555091357957" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>space lasers</u></a>: a warmer atmosphere makes for warmer oceans, which make for wetter, more intense storms. And while hurricane seasons <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/2024-hurricane-season-helene#:~:text=a%20couple%20of%20named%20storms%20in%20November%2C" target="_self"><u>eventually end</u></a>, global temperatures <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/climate-track-warm-by-nearly-3c-without-greater-ambition-un-report-2023-11-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t stopped going up</u></a>. That, perhaps, is the more terrifying subtext of the attribution studies: There will be more Miltons and Helenes.</p>

## The cost of being prepared

date: 2024-10-08, from: Market Place

<p>Natural disaster recovery is often expensive, but this season is shaping up to be particularly costly and painful. The Southeast is reeling from Hurricane Helene, and Hurricane Milton is expected to inflict more damage starting tomorrow night. Disaster preparedness can reduce the economic burden of recovery, but not all localities can afford to be prepared. Also in this episode: The Fed&#8217;s interest rate cut raised business owners&#8217; optimism and China invites more young Americans to visit.</p>

## Utilities Are Planning for the Wrong Kind of Hurricane

date: 2024-10-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc3ODEyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzE1NjExN30.XoDsEY-SZjB3LqkFXRAD68LsH_FBAw2_kCEwo8Muvwk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">There’s a familiar script when it comes to hurricanes: The high winds snap tree branches and even tree trunks and whip around anything else that’s light enough or not bolted down — including power lines and distribution poles. While this type of damage can lead to large-scale outages, it’s also relatively straightforward to fix. In many cases the power comes back on relatively quickly, more like days rather than weeks or months. </p>
<p>But when it comes to flooding, especially in areas that do not regularly deal with big storms, the damage can be more severe, long-lasting, and difficult to repair. This is largely because what’s at risk in these scenarios is not power lines but substations. These messes of transmission and distribution lines that channel high voltage power to homes and businesses are vulnerable to rising water, and repairs can’t begin until the floodwaters recede. Often they have to be replaced entirely, which is expensive and can lead to further delays as <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/DRAFT_NIAC_Addressing%20the%20Critical%20Shortage%20of%20Power%20Transformers%20to%20Ensure%20Reliability%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Grid_Report_06052024_508c.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>there’s a nationwide shortage</u></a> of transformers. Just one substation can support thousands of homes — a single point of failure that, when it floods, takes all its customers down with it.</p>
<p>Duke Energy, whose grid in the Carolinas was pummeled by Hurricane Helene, <a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energys-hurricane-helene-recovery-restores-power-to-nearly-1-1-million-in-the-carolinas-downed-trees-blocked-roadways-damaged-power-equipment-impeding-efforts-in-the-n-c-mountains-and-s-c-upstate-region" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has said</u></a> the damage to its system encompasses “submerged substations, thousands of downed utility poles, and downed transmission towers,” and noted that much of the affected area is “inaccessible due to mudslides, flooding and blocked roads, limiting the ability to assess and begin repairing damages.” In an update published Saturday, it stated that while more than 2 million customers had seen their power <a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-restores-90-of-carolinas-customers-capable-of-receiving-power-following-helene" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>restored</u></a>, about 250,000 customers across North and South Carolina remained without electricity more than a week after the storm. </p>
<p>Workers are “encountering more severe damage on a larger scale than we’ve ever experienced,” Duke Energy storm director Jason Hollifield said in a statement. (Duke didn’t respond to my request for comment.) One Duke employee <a href="https://abc11.com/post/helene-power-outages-wnc-duke-energy-substation-extensive-damage-biltmore-swannanoa-river/15392801/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told the local television station</u></a> in Asheville, North Carolina, which saw more than three months’ worth of rain fall over three days, that a local substation would have to be completely rebuilt, a process that could take months. In Western North Carolina, the area’s Representative Chuck Edwards has <a href="https://edwards.house.gov/media/press-releases/hurricane-helene-update-10-congressman-edwards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimated</u></a> that 117,000 customers still lack electricity, and that while some of them will likely get it back by Sunday, others “whose properties are inaccessible or not able to receive power may be without electricity for an extended period of time as Duke Energy works to rebuild critical infrastructure.”</p>
<p>To prepare for the onrushing Hurricane Milton, Duke <a href="https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-florida-increases-resource-count-to-16-000-encourages-customers-to-take-appropriate-safety-measures-prior-to-hurricane-miltons-landfall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is staging thousands o</u></a>f “line technicians, vegetation workers, damage assessors and support personnel” in Florida, the company said. The same problem remains, however: Line technicians will not prevent substations from flooding. </p>
<p>While the exact effect of climate change on hurricanes and other storm categories is an area of intense debate among climate scientists and meteorologists, there’s a rough consensus that <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/10/29/why-are-big-storms-bringing-so-much-more-rain-warming-yes-also-winds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warming will cause the storms to be wetter</u></a>. That means utilities will have to update their old disaster response playbooks, or else prolonged outages when an especially wet storm arrives over a flood plain. </p>
<p>In most hurricanes, utilities are able to pre-position workers to restore power quickly, working on knocked down poles and wires, explained Jordan Kern, an assistant professor engineering at North Carolina State University. “When trees fall on distribution lines, those are, in normal situations, easy to repair,” he told me. But, Kern said, “If the substations are flooded, you can’t do anything until the flood waters go down. They can be without power for a long time.”</p>
<p>Wetter hurricanes will likely mean more severe and less predictable flooding happening far away from the coasts, bringing with it risks that utilities and local governments may be less prepared to face, with costs that will ultimately be born by anyone who pays for electricity, as expensive repairs and hardening of electrical infrastructure will likely be born by ratepayers.</p>
<p>“Rates will necessarily rise” to deal with the higher costs of adaptation and repairing infrastructure more complex than a wooden pole, Tyler Norris, a PhD student at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment, told me while driving towards Asheville to help out family impacted by the storm.</p>
<p>While Helene has been an especially damaging storm, the risks of wetter storms and inland flooding away from the coastal areas that are prepared for frequent hurricanes have become more apparent in recent years. While Hurricane Irene in 2011 made landfall on Long Island, its <a href="https://www.weather.gov/gyx/Irene_Anniversary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most devastating effects were felt inland</u></a> due to heavy rains, especially in Vermont.</p><p>North Carolina in particular has seen a rash of nasty hurricanes in the past 10 years or so, giving Duke ample recent experience with big storms — and some indication of what a warming world could bring.</p><p>During 2018’s Hurricane Florence, which knocked out power for around a million Duke customers, “at least 10 substations required de-energization due to flooding or flood risk where heavy rainfall and resulting inland flooding,” <a href="https://www.duke-energy.com/-/media/pdfs/our-company/carolinasresiliencetransmissiondistributionstudy.pdf?rev=035db100f60b4c6a8b81e5a3a4d1e74c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to a 2022 Duke climate resiliency report</u></a>. The report was meant to look at the effects of climate change to the Duke system by 2050 under two emissions scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, one assuming emissions start falling by 2040, the other assuming continued (some might say <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00177-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unrealistically</u></a>) high emissions.</p><p>Under the extreme scenario, the “overall vulnerability priority of Duke Energy substations to climate-driven changes in precipitation and inland flooding is high,” the report said, while under the “middle of the road” projection, “transmission infrastructure faces a medium priority vulnerability.” <a href="https://www.duke-energy.com/-/media/pdfs/our-company/carolinasresiliencetransmissiondistributionstudy.pdf?rev=035db100f60b4c6a8b81e5a3a4d1e74c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In both cases, however</u></a>, “without adaptation planning … substations are at the highest potential risk, with extreme heat and flooding being the greatest concerns for existing assets.”</p><p>Duke said at the time that it had “implemented permanent flood protection measures at new substations located in flood plains and substations with a prior history of flooding.” For its existing fleet, priority was being given to those substations considered particularly “at-risk,” however the flood protection plan had “not yet been universally implemented at all existing substations in the flood plain.”</p><p>“What they characterized there falls significantly short of what we just saw,” Norris said. While he noted that Duke had listed risk to substations from inland flooding as high (albeit only under the extreme scenario), it had listed the risk to the distribution of power, i.e. poles and wires, as “low” under both scenarios. “There’s been a dramatic misestimate of risk here,” Norris said.</p><p>For Duke customers, especially in the more isolated parts of Western North Carolina, they may simply have to wait for workers and parts to arrive. Repairs that could normally happen quickly will likely happen slowly as workers struggle to reach areas whose roads have been washed away. Duke said that it’s now focusing on restoring the “backbone” of the transmission and distribution system, and then is moving on to restoring fallen poles in less densely populated areas.</p><p><span></span>And it will likely happen again. Kern noted that inland flooding especially is notoriously hard to predict compared to coastal flooding from hurricanes. “Flooding is so idiosyncratic,” he said. “It’s hard for anyone to predict how flooding will affect a region. Let alone electric utilities.”</p>

## Forecasters Are Horrified By Hurricane Milton

date: 2024-10-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc4MDMyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjQ2ODM3OH0.anNFoS3Ut3jKkjG8b98GMbvwBfQk5PGJ4yvKPsrUFlg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> What remains of former Hurricane Kirk could bring heavy rain and dangerous winds to Europe • Wildfires in Bolivia have scorched nearly 19 million football fields worth of land this year • It is 55 degrees Fahrenheit and rainy today at the Alpe du Grand Serre, an 85-year-old Alpine ski resort in France that announced it will close for good due to a lack of snow. </em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Hurricane Milton’s rapid intensification shocks forecasters</h3><p>Hurricane Milton has horrified meteorologists with its swift transformation into a monster system, exploding from a Category 1 storm into a Category 5 storm in about 18 hours. As of this morning it has maximum sustained winds of 155 mph, <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/080832.shtml?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ODKjBkkURT_IL9L4TAi37svZ60Jxi_rCANmiPzMBoWYs0gLEliOr_HeAIZCZRTa7qLQv-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the National Hurricane Center, and is expected to make landfall near Tampa, Florida, overnight on Wednesday. Milton will likely weaken slightly as it approaches the Sunshine State but will nonetheless bring life-threatening wind, rain, and storm surge to an area still in tatters from last month’s Hurricane Helene. “If Milton stays on its course this will be the most powerful hurricane to hit Tampa Bay in over 100 years,” the Tampa Bay National Weather Service <a href="https://x.com/NWSTampaBay/status/1843407393100836883?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ODKjBkkURT_IL9L4TAi37svZ60Jxi_rCANmiPzMBoWYs0gLEliOr_HeAIZCZRTa7qLQv-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. “No one in the area has ever experienced a hurricane this strong before.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

	Veteran Florida meteorologist John Morales <a href="https://x.com/brianstelter/status/1843362454321115138?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ODKjBkkURT_IL9L4TAi37svZ60Jxi_rCANmiPzMBoWYs0gLEliOr_HeAIZCZRTa7qLQv-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broke down</a> in tears reporting on Milton’s remarkable drop in air pressure – generally the lower a storm’s pressure, the greater its strength. “This is just horrific,” Morales said. “The seas are just so incredibly, incredibly hot. You know what’s driving that. I don’t need to tell you: Global warming.”
</p><h3>2. Onslaught of weather disasters tests FEMA</h3><p>
	The Federal Emergency Management Agency is under strain from back-to-back extreme weather events, including Hurricane Helene and looming Hurricane Milton. Last week Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned that FEMA “does not have the funds” to get through the rest of hurricane season. The agency’s former administrator, Craig Fugate, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-07/back-to-back-hurricanes-set-to-strain-fema-as-its-funds-run-low?srnd=green&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ODKjBkkURT_IL9L4TAi37svZ60Jxi_rCANmiPzMBoWYs0gLEliOr_HeAIZCZRTa7qLQv-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Bloomberg</em> the damage from Milton could be more costly than Helene’s. Staff shortages are compounding funding shortfalls, with just 9% of FEMA workers available to respond to disasters as of Monday, as personnel struggle to address a number of recent disasters in other parts of the country. “The agency is simultaneously supporting over 100 major disaster declarations,” Brock Long, who led FEMA during the Trump administration, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/climate/hurricane-milton-fema-staff-shortage.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ODKjBkkURT_IL9L4TAi37svZ60Jxi_rCANmiPzMBoWYs0gLEliOr_HeAIZCZRTa7qLQv-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>. “The scale of staffing required for these operations is immense.”
</p><h3>3. Kerry joins Steyer’s green investing firm</h3><p>
	John Kerry has joined billionaire Tom Steyer’s sustainable investing firm, Galvanize Climate Solutions, as co-executive chair alongside Steyer and Katie Hall. The former secretary of state and top U.S. climate diplomat “will focus on expanding the resources and reach of Galvanize’s investment strategies, originating differentiated opportunities, and leveraging firsthand knowledge as to how technology, policy, and geopolitics are shaping the energy transition,” the firm <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241006956833/en/Secretary-John-Kerry-Joins-Galvanize-Climate-Solutions-As-Co-Executive-Chair?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ODKjBkkURT_IL9L4TAi37svZ60Jxi_rCANmiPzMBoWYs0gLEliOr_HeAIZCZRTa7qLQv-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement. Steyer and Hall launched Galvanize in 2021. It manages around $1 billion and focuses on “generating long-term value from the energy transition.” Kerry said Galvanize would play a key role in the energy transition by “bringing competitive, commercially viable solutions to market.”
</p><h3>4. Lithios raises $12 million to unlock new sources of lithium</h3><p>
	Lithios, a Massachusetts-based startup with a novel method of lithium extraction, just <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/lithios-12-million-seed-round?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ODKjBkkURT_IL9L4TAi37svZ60Jxi_rCANmiPzMBoWYs0gLEliOr_HeAIZCZRTa7qLQv-" rel="noopener" target="_self">raised</a> a $12 million seed round. Energy market analysts predict that the world is hurtling towards a global lithium shortage by the 2030s, but Lithios is aiming to help unlock previously untapped lithium sources around the world, specifically salty groundwater deposits, a.k.a. brines. The company’s CEO, Mo Alkhadra, <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/lithios-12-million-seed-round?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ODKjBkkURT_IL9L4TAi37svZ60Jxi_rCANmiPzMBoWYs0gLEliOr_HeAIZCZRTa7qLQv-" rel="noopener" target="_self">told Heatmap’s Katie Brigham</a> that while about two-thirds of the world’s lithium is contained in brine rather than hard rock, only about 15% to 20% of these brines are currently worth mining. Lithios, he said, will get that number up to around 80% to 85%, in theory. The funding is led by Clean Energy Ventures with support from Lowercarbon Capital, among others. The round included $10 million in venture funding and $2 million in venture debt loans from Silicon Valley Bank.
</p><h3>5. White House eyes more decomissioned nuclear plants for revival</h3><p>
	The Biden administration wants to restart more nuclear power plants that have been decommissioned in an effort to provide zero-emission electricity to meet soaring demand, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-looks-resurrect-more-nuclear-reactors-white-house-adviser-says-2024-10-07/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ODKjBkkURT_IL9L4TAi37svZ60Jxi_rCANmiPzMBoWYs0gLEliOr_HeAIZCZRTa7qLQv-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> White House climate adviser Ali Zaidi. Two revivals are already in progress: The Department of Energy finalized over $2.8 billion in loans and grants to help restart the Palisades plant in Michigan, and tech giant Microsoft made a deal with energy company Constellation to revive Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island nuclear plant. Zaidi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-looks-resurrect-more-nuclear-reactors-white-house-adviser-says-2024-10-07/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ODKjBkkURT_IL9L4TAi37svZ60Jxi_rCANmiPzMBoWYs0gLEliOr_HeAIZCZRTa7qLQv-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> he could think of at least two other plants that could be brought back online, but didn’t get specific.
</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>

## Florida, flood insurance and yet another hurricane

date: 2024-10-08, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>As Hurricane Milton barrels toward the Tampa Bay region, home to some 3 million people, residents there are still recovering from Hurricane Helene. Helene caused billions of dollars in damage. Yet nearly every homeowner who may be affected lacks adequate flood insurance. Plus, our TVs may also be watching us. And we&#8217;re coming up on one year since Microsoft finalized the largest video game deal ever: $68 billion for Activision Blizzard.</p>

## Lithios Raises $12 Million to Unlock New Sources of Lithium

date: 2024-10-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc3NjgxNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MjMyOTk5OH0.exGku9nm_j6mce4_sNIyc8Cn-Otl-VU_sff6sqpwwuE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">With the markets for electric vehicles and battery energy storage systems on the come-up, energy market analysts predict that the world is hurtling towards a global lithium shortage by the 2030’s. Lithios, a Massachusetts-based startup with a novel method of lithium extraction, is aiming to help by unlocking previously untapped lithium resources around the world.</p><p>The company just raised a $12 million seed round to help fund this mission, led by Clean Energy Ventures with support from Lowercarbon Capital, among others. The round included $10 million in venture funding and $2 million in venture debt loans from Silicon Valley Bank. </p><p>It’s not as if the world actually lacks for lithium, the energy dense mineral that is the primary component in lithium-ion batteries. It’s just that many current reserves are too low-grade to be economically exploited, and traditional extraction methods are land-intensive, inefficient, and often controversial with local communities. Chile, Australia, and China dominate the market, while the U.S. contributes less than 2% of the world’s annual supply. </p><p>Lithios aims to make it more economical and environmentally friendly to extract lithium from salty groundwater deposits, a.k.a. brines. The company’s CEO, Mo Alkhadra, told me that while about two-thirds of the world’s lithium is contained in brine rather than hard rock, only about 15% to 20% of these brines are currently worth mining. Lithios, he said, will get that number up to around 80% to 85%, in theory. “The vision with Lithios’ tech is to enable access to these lower-grade resources at a similar or maybe slightly higher cost structure relative to the highest grade deposits that are mined today,” Alkhadra explained. </p><p>The normal lithium brine extraction process involves pumping saline water from underground reservoirs to the surface, where it’s then moved through a series of <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/144393/where-batteries-begin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>large, wildly colored evaporation ponds</u></a>, often located in the middle of vast salt deserts. Over a period of about 18 months, the sun slowly evaporates the brine, leaving behind increasingly high concentrations of lithium. But Lithios’ tech avoids these ponds altogether. Instead, the brine is pumped to the surface and delivered directly to the company’s refrigerator-sized electrochemical reactors, which contain stacks of electrodes that capture the lithium. </p><p>While the company wouldn't disclose the electrodes’ exact chemistry, Alkhadra told me they are made from “inorganic compounds which have geometries that fit basically only lithium and none of the other larger ions that you would find in these brine mixtures.” After lithium is extracted, the company produces a purified lithium concentrate and sends that off for refining into battery chemicals. The final batteries could end up in EVs, energy storage systems, or even just plain old portable consumer electronics.</p><p>Lithios’ tech comes at a good time, as the Inflation Reduction Act’s domestic content requirements for EVs incentivizes manufacturers to source critical minerals from the U.S. and countries that the U.S. has free trade agreements with. Alkhadra told me that Lithios could open up opportunities for brine mining in the Smackover formation, which spans a number of southern states including Texas and Arkansas, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/04/the-salton-sea-could-produce-the-worlds-greenest-lithium.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Salton Sea area</u></a>, which has been dubbed “Lithium Valley,” as well as deposits in Utah and Nevada. More areas in Canada and Europe could also be in play. (The company said it couldn’t talk yet about any specific partnership agreements.)</p><p>While there are a number of other companies such as <a href="https://lilacsolutions.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lilac Solutions</u></a> and <a href="https://energyx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EnergyX</u></a> that are also pursuing more efficient and less land-intensive brine-based extraction methods, they rely on a different, purely chemical process known as direct lithium extraction, which uses technology adapted from the water treatment industry. “The core thesis around what we're building at Lithios stems from that work,” Alkhadra told me, explaining that electrifying these chemical processes makes them “much more selective, energy efficient, and water efficient” — resulting in “modest to significant cost reduction.”</p><p>Lithios’ new funding will help the company scale its research and development efforts as well as build out a pilot facility in Medford, Massachusetts, with initial production to begin in the first quarter of next year. At first, output will be limited to just “several battery packs” per year, Alkhadra told me, scaling up to commercial production “in the coming years.”</p><p>Alkhadra is excited to see investors and the federal government alike beginning to express interest in the upstream, “dirtier” portions of the battery supply chain, which he told me have generally been overlooked in favor of downstream sectors such as battery manufacturing and cell production. “I think the U.S. departments of both energy and defense, and investors too, are coming to realize that the real bottlenecks in battery manufacturing and EV production are on the resource side.”</p>

## We added a ton of jobs last month. Surprise!

date: 2024-10-07, from: Market Place

<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, firms have taken some unprecedented measures to balance out the effects of lockdown, inflation and supply chain backups, leaving some economic predictors sorta &#8230; off. How can forecasters do their jobs when so many economic patterns have changed?

## Misinformation Is Already Swirling Around Hurricane Milton

date: 2024-10-07, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc3NzkxNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MDA5ODI3Mn0.WKQhacarUkpzReksvBvaT3O9P8o2pb8lxcuIqNkNLy8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The “Meteorologists” Facebook page has 51,000 followers, an iffy grasp of grammar rules, and outsized confidence in the United States’ weather engineering capabilities. “They are Aiming this KILLER Monster Hurricane Right at FLORIDA!” one user said of Hurricane Milton on Sunday morning, shortly before sharing purported photos of dinosaurs living on Mars.</p><p>By Monday afternoon, Milton had strengthened into a <a href="https://x.com/philklotzbach/status/1843398813027053696" target="_blank">Category 5 storm</a>, and the internet conspiracies were intensifying, too. People shared videos of themselves <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gammieluvs4/video/7422816848955051307" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asking their Alexas</u></a>, “What kind of hurricane was Hurricane Milton?” and getting answers in the past tense — proof, surely, that the government orchestrated the whole storm. “Never ever seen a hurricane form in the western Gulf and head directly EAST… It is not right,” other users mused in the comment sections of their local weather channels. A search for “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=cloud%20seeding%20hurricane%20milton" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cloud seeding</u></a>” on Facebook further turned up dozens of posts tracking flight paths for planes belonging to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and sharing photos of ominous-looking clouds as evidence that the “government is involved.”</p><p>Hoaxes and misinformation reliably follow extreme weather events. Pictures of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hurricane-shark" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hurricane Shark</u></a> have circulated on social media after pretty much every major flood since 2011, and a <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2012/10/29/awesome-hurricane-sandy-photo-statue-liberty-fake/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>photoshopped image</u></a> of a storm cell over the Statue of Liberty resurfaces anytime there is bad weather in New York. In the aftermath of a major disaster, it’s especially tempting for bad actors to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/02/1126480393/after-the-storm-the-scams-lies-and-misinformation-flood-in" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exploit</u></a> the desperation for news and images.</p><p>But Hurricane Helene — which devastated <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>swaths of Florida</u></a> up into the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hurricane-helene-appalachia-tennessee" target="_self"><u>Appalachians</u></a> just over a week ago — revealed how far this has spun out of control. For one thing, hoaxes are simpler than ever for the average person to disseminate, <a href="https://x.com/O_Rob1nson/status/1841433705186804145" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>thanks to the availability of AI image-making tools</u></a> and the degradation of content moderation on <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/elon-musk-twitter-blue-natural-disaster-crisis-emergency-response/673209/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disaster-response platforms like Twitter</u></a>. These conspiracies may also then be reinforced and amplified by people with an interest in making the government’s response look bad — such as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/politics/fact-check-trump-helene-response-north-carolina/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Republican candidate for president of the United States</u></a>, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/07/marjorie-taylor-greene-hurricane-helene" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Georgia congressperson</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-misinformation.html#:~:text=high%2Dprofile%20figures%2C-,including%20Elon%20Musk,-%2C%20who%20has%20pulled" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Elon Musk</u></a>. </p><p>While some lies — like Deep State cloud seeding — are relatively easy to see through, many rumors are much more difficult to fact-check when power, cell service, and internet are limited. Nicole McNeill, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-death-toll-asheville-north-carolina-34d1226bb31f79dfb2ff6827e40587fc#:~:text=The%20city%20of%20Asheville%2C%20in%20the%20western%20mountains%20of%20North%20Carolina%2C%20was%20particularly%20battered." target="_blank">Asheville, North Carolina</a>-based director of storytelling of Climate Power, told me she and many of her neighbors fell for <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/10/01/is-another-hurricane-coming-to-wnc-tropical-storm-kirk-impact/75466027007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a widespread rumor</u></a> that a second storm was going to hit the western part of the state immediately after Helene. The panic the rumor sparked risked lives: She saw a fight break out in a gas line between two men who were frantically trying to get out of town, and a young couple who were renting a home nearby tried to flee and ended up on a road that was closed. “We heard later that people had to sleep in their cars,” McNeill told me. “Local police had to be diverted from emergency response to direct traffic to clear the roads so emergency vehicles could pass. Misinformation made a desperate situation worse.” McNeill herself suffered a panic attack while trying to fix the holes in her roof from trees that had fallen during Helene, all in preparation for the second storm that would never come.</p><p>While there was no merit to those manufactured claims, the truth is in some ways even more alarming: Milton is looking like a worst-case scenario storm as it bears down on Tampa Bay, and at this point, the only thing anyone <em><em>can</em></em> control is getting good information to the people whose lives will depend on hearing it. Forecasters are doing a great job of that already, like South Florida hurricane specialist John Morales, who <a href="https://x.com/brianstelter/status/1843362454321115138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>let his emotions show on air</u></a> and connected the storm’s intensification to climate science.</p><p>Milton isn’t due to make landfall until Wednesday, but the misinformation already circulating online will make it more challenging for early warnings from the government and local experts to be heard and trusted. That job doesn’t get any easier after a storm. To fellow hurricane survivors, McNeill warned, “If you have patchy internet and you’re at 30% battery and worried about your phone running out, you’re often making split-second decisions. That’s where misinformation gets people.”</p>

## Can Bilingual Window-Breaking Drones Save New Yorkers From the Next Hurricane Sandy?

date: 2024-10-07, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzcyMzc5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjk3NTEyN30.PQbL-mY3konBnFkjPS9e8EL_gcCMiVXT7EfN7ySlf-k/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Last week, I took a train and two buses to an abandoned tuberculosis sanatorium on Staten Island, where I watched first responders pretend another Hurricane Sandy had just struck New York City.
</p><p>
	For the sake of the drill, organizers kept many of the details of the fictional scenario the same as they’d been then: Emergency Management officials were told to respond as if a supercharged storm was causing devastating floods and stranding people in life-threatening situations. But the dry run also featured a major difference from the disaster that hit 12 years ago this month and left <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>more than</u></a> 43 New Yorkers dead.
</p><p>
	This time, the city has drones.
</p><p>
	It has drones with cameras that can read the logo on your jacket from 400 feet in the air and drones with sophisticated mapping software that can estimate how deep a flooded intersection is. It has drones that come on little leashes tethered to NYPD cruisers for continuous power and drones that are so small they can fly under beds and into closets and sound like dentist drills when they’re operating. It has drones that can transmit messages in 80 languages, drones with thermal sensors, and drones that can drop flotation devices into the ocean. It even has a drone that can break a window — the highlight of the morning for the members of the local press and the top brass of the New York Police Department, Fire Department, and NYCEM (New York City Emergency Management, pronounced “Nee-chim,” newly rebranded from the more generic Office of Emergency Management) who’d gathered to observe the exercise, which was touted as the largest-known municipal unmanned aerial system drill in history.
</p><p>
	“Breach drones,” as I’ve since learned, look a little like crudely drawn mosquitos. Held aloft by four rotary wings, the <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/the-nypd-is-using-drones-3-times-more-than-it-did-last-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$87,750</u></a> contraptions are affixed with rods on their fronts that resemble an insect’s proboscis but function essentially like a battering ram. Given the drone’s unsteady, bobbing flight and the way it repeatedly banged itself against the window to chip a hole in the pane big enough to fly through, I found the whole demonstration to be surprisingly <em><em>entomological</em></em> for what New York City’s first responders claim is the bleeding edge of its extreme weather response.
</p><p>
	“We’re really just scraping the first layer” of what is possible, Louis Font, a citywide interagency coordinator, told me during the drill. As he put it, drones are “the Swiss army knife of the public safety world.”
</p><p>
	There is a small problem, though: New Yorkers really, really hate drones. Actually, they hate <em><em>all</em></em> autonomous gadgets that give off a whiff of Big Brother. A security robot deployed in the Times Square subway station over the winter had to be <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/696-23/transcript-mayor-adams-makes-public-safety-related-announcement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>guarded by two human officers</u></a> around the clock to prevent it from being vandalized, and the cheeky New York City news blog <em><em>Hell Gate </em></em><a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/eric-adams-robocop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed</u></a> that bots like the NYPD’s crime-fighting “Digidog” are “the city’s most expensive punching bags” and teased, “we’re excited to watch as the situation unfolds.” Even the local <em><em>wildlife</em></em> seems willing to take matters into its own talons, with birds <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/nyregion/nyc-beaches-drones-angry-birds.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attacking</u></a> drones deployed to Rockaway Beach over the summer.
</p><p>
	The city acquired its first set of drones in 2018 and is now one of about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/nyregion/nypd-drones.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>900 U.S. municipalities</u></a> that have begun using unmanned aerial systems in its crime- and emergency-related responses. But with a police budget <a href="https://reason.com/2011/11/30/michael-bloomberg-i-have-my-own-army-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bigger</u></a> than many nations’ entire military outlay and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-new-technology-hasnt-worked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a techno-optimist mayor</u></a>, New York quickly became one of the premier drone-wielding cities in the world.
</p><p>
	It hasn’t been an entirely smooth journey, though. Plans to use drones to monitor <a href="https://apnews.com/article/drones-labor-day-eric-adams-nypd-jouvert-c2787e87bcad8fa87aa8d34b454ee6cf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>private backyard Labor Day parties</u></a> last year spurred privacy concerns rooted in <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nypd-drone-czar-surveillence-post-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a history</u></a> of the NYPD abusing surveillance technologies and prompted pushback from local civil liberties groups. “We’ve got so many discredited examples of this mayor searching for high-tech gimmicks to solve real-world problems and leaving New Yorkers out to dry,” Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a.k.a. STOP, told me. “We end up spending a huge amount of money on largely unvetted vendors to buy products that simply just don’t fit the needs of our city.”
</p><p>
	The question I wanted to answer on Staten Island was whether drones might be able to<em> </em>meet the needs of a city after a storm like <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-helene-florida-size" target="_self"><u>Hurricane Helene</u></a> or Hurricane Sandy. The overwhelming impression I left with, though, was of agencies that are in the awkward stage of a growth spurt — eager to use technology that will one day be indispensable but, for the time being, presents the risk of overcomplicating situations that would otherwise benefit from a more old-fashioned, boots-on-the-ground approach, with potentially both comic and tragic results.
</p><p>
	Much of this is simply because of the physical limitations of drones. For one thing, they can’t fly in winds of more than about 20 to 30 miles per hour, making them pretty much useless during an actual storm (or <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nypd-drone-czar-surveillence-post-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in a Manhattan wind tunnel</u></a>, for that matter). That narrows their use to two main categories: before a storm, as early warning systems, and after, in search-and-rescue operations.
</p><p>
	It’s easy to understand the appeal of the former use. Scientists expect New York will get about 25% more annual rainfall by 2100 <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>due to climate change</u></a>, and the city has over 500 miles of coastline vulnerable to storm surge, with <a href="https://wordinblack.com/2024/04/nyc-floods-are-worst-for-those-who-can-least-afford-them/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over half</u></a> of <a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/emily-raboteau-lessons-for-survival" target="_self"><u>its environmental justice communities</u></a> living within its 100-year floodplains. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, 11 people <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/ida-s-forgotten-victims-nearly-all-storm-s-basement-deaths-n1281670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drowned</u></a> in flooded basement apartments, which are illegal under the city housing code and often used as housing by low-income immigrant families. Making matters worse, New York’s emergency alert system requires <a href="https://a858-nycnotify.nyc.gov/notifynyc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a voluntary opt-in</u></a> and currently has just 1,281,938 subscribers — roughly 15% of a city of 8.3 million. Last year, the city comptroller further <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/nyregion/storm-response-nyc-adams.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claimed</u></a> that the notification list for people living in basement apartments reached less than 1% of its target population. (A spokesperson for NYCEM told me there has been a 35% increase in their basement subscriber numbers since the comptroller’s comments.)
</p><p>
	The drones come in handy, then, because “not every New Yorker is on Twitter, not every New Yorker is on Instagram or Facebook, not every New Yorker reads <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>, the <em><em>Post</em></em>, or the <em><em>Daily News</em></em>, not all of them are tuned into our press conferences,” NYCEM Commissioner Zachary Iscol told me. “And so especially for vulnerable populations and immigrant communities, you’ve got to reach them where they are.”
</p><p>
	This summer, NYCEM <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/nyregion/drones-eric-adams-flooding.html" target="_blank">piloted a program</a> using drones to broadcast bilingual flood warnings in low-lying neighborhoods ahead of storms — an idea Mayor Eric Adams had after seeing hurricane sirens on telephone poles during a visit to Puerto Rico, Iscol told me. The drones’ machine-generated Spanish translations, however, were slammed as “<a href="https://x.com/J__Velasquez/status/1820914162387558778" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>incomprehensible</u></a>” by native speakers. (Font, the interagency coordinator, admitted the translations are still crude since “they’re robots” and told me the agencies are working to improve the messages.)

	Carolina Salguero, the founder and executive director of PortSide NewYork, which works with the waterfront community in Red Hook, told me she fears drone-delivered storm warnings could potentially alienate their intended audiences. “Why would you believe the government if it’s dissed the community for this long?” she said, recalling how some Red Hook residents unwisely ignored warnings ahead of Sandy. (One can only imagine the added element of distrust that would come from a <em><em>drone</em></em> shouting those same warnings at you.). Cahn, of STOP, was also skeptical of the message’s delivery system: “The idea that you’re going to warn people with a fleet of drones is ludicrous. It’d take hundreds of thousands of drones operating throughout the day to reach the number of people that [NYCEM] can reach through a single text message,” he told me.
</p><p>
	That problem of scale is also true <em><em>after</em></em> a storm. While I was impressed by the drones’ heat-seeking capabilities — operators could quickly find human actors and mannequins heated to lifelike temperatures during the Staten Island drill — the NYPD <a href="https://www.police1.com/tech-pulse/nypd-to-start-drone-as-first-responder-program-allowing-uavs-to-respond-to-scenes-of-shootings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only had 85 drones</u></a> in its arsenal as of this spring. Because connectivity issues are common after major weather disasters, drones cannot travel terribly far from human-toted hotspots, meaning the actual ground drones can cover to look for stranded, trapped, hurt, or drowning New Yorkers is relatively small. Drones also have a limited battery life of about half an hour and must repeatedly return to handlers to have their batteries swapped out as they conduct searches.
</p><p>
	Sometimes it seems almost as if the city government is creating problems for drones to solve. A scenario where a window-breaching drone would be more beneficial than having a firefighter simply walk into a building feels like an edge case, and while a drone can inform someone in Mandarin that help is on the way, that “help” still ultimately takes the form of human paramedics, police, or firefighters. Font told me that drones helped supplement the rescue of “multiple drowning victims” in the Rockaways this summer by providing an extra vantage, but the systems were only deployed in the first place because of <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-treading-water-as-lifeguard-shortage-lingers-for-another-summer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an unresolved lifeguard shortage</u></a>. (Though there was excited chatter at the Staten Island drill about drones one day being able to tow distressed swimmers to shore, currently they can only bonk you with a hotdog-sized floatation device that inflates to three feet long to buy first responders some extra time — and that’s <em><em>if</em></em> you manage to grab ahold of it while flailing about in rough waters.)
</p><p>
	Perhaps the biggest problem the drone exercise appeared poised to address was concerns about whether the city government could continue to function adequately under Adams’ leadership. Though the drill had reportedly been in the works for six months, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mounting scandals</u></a> and <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2024/10/who-has-left-adams-administration/399800/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>resignations</u></a> in the administration made the large-scale demonstration of interagency cooperation conveniently timed. On Monday, less than a week after the drill, Phil Banks — the deputy mayor for public safety whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/nyregion/phil-banks-resigns-eric-adams.html" target="_blank"><u>phone was seized last month</u></a> as part of a federal bribery investigation — resigned. His departure leaves a gaping hole in the office that is <a href="https://a856-gbol.nyc.gov/GBOLWebsite/GreenBook/Details?orgId=7560" target="_blank"><u>tasked with</u></a> coordinating the agencies involved in an extreme weather response, including directly overseeing NYCEM and the FDNY. (Banks <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/10/07/philip-banks-resigned-eric-adams/" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a> was also at the forefront of promoting the city’s use of “high-tech devices, including drones.)</p><p><span></span>When I asked Iscol — who has <a href="https://x.com/zachiscol/status/1838336960512881149" target="_blank"><u>publicly admitted</u></a> to having had his own conversations about leaving the administration due to the ongoing turmoil — during the drill (i.e. before Banks resigned) whether he was confident that there could still be smooth operations between City Hall and its agencies in the event of a near-term disaster, he told me firmly that he was. “There are 300,000 people that work for the city of New York, and they’re showing up every day,” he told me. “It’s our job to show up and make sure they have the resources and support and the guidance and direction they need to be successful to deliver for New Yorkers.” He emphasized that “it’s business as usual for the agencies,” despite how things look in the headlines.</p><p>As for the drones, the commissioner seemed clear-eyed in assessing their usefulness. “As you do things that are new and for the first time, it’s an evolution — you’re always improving,” he told me. Drone advancements are “iterative, kind of like an iPhone,” and he’s aware they’re not all the way there yet. But “it’s not like we’re <em><em>only</em></em> using drones,” he stressed. “We’re still taking a multi-channel approach.”</p><p>
	Concerned onlookers will often approach Font, the interagency coordinator, to ask if he’s spying on them when they notice him flying a drone. He told me that he is always eager to show regular New Yorkers how the city is using the technology: “We’re a bunch of tech guys, so we really love getting into the nuts and bolts of it,” he said.
</p><p>
	He expects, though, that eventually the questions and suspicious looks will start to taper off. The NYPD and FDNY already use drones in their everyday operations throughout the city; companies like Amazon have also started exploring the use of drones to deliver packages. Drones will become increasingly commonplace as the years wear on. Boring, even! So <em><em>of course</em></em> they’ll be used during extreme weather events, too.
</p><p>
	“This is the world we live in now,” he said.

## Investors are recalibrating their interest rate expectations

date: 2024-10-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Third quarter earnings season kicks off this week, when we&#8217;ll get a view of the economy through the lens of the companies on the front lines. We had a banner jobs report last week. Are banner earnings next? And what would all that mean for future rate cuts? Also on the show, we&#8217;ll examine why labor force participation has hovered at around 63% for a few years now.</p>

## Doing the numbers on campaign promises

date: 2024-10-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget released a new study this morning, looking at how the Harris and Trump campaigns’ spending plans would affect the national debt. Both estimates are pretty dire. We&#8217;ll hear the latest. Plus, the global private equity market was worth $579 billion in 2000; today, it’s worth over $8 trillion. But is there trouble ahead for private equity?</p>

## Hurricane Milton Takes Aim at Florida

Hurricane-battered Florida braces for another dangerous storm</h3><p>Hurricane Milton is intensifying rapidly in the Atlantic and is expected to become a major hurricane later today. Forecasters believe it will make landfall near Tampa Bay in Florida by Wednesday, less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene tore through the area. It could bring a foot of rain, possible more, and 10-15 feet of storm surge. “We expect the storm surge to be worse than what many people experienced during Helene,” <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/extreme-impacts-milton-to-become-major-hurricane-barrel-ashore-near-tampa-bay-midweek/1700306?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> AccuWeather’s lead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva. “This storm has the potential to create a catastrophic storm surge that no one in Tampa has seen in their lifetime.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">AccuWeather</small></p><p>More than 15 million people across southern and central Florida are under flood watches, and a state of emergency has been declared in 51 of the state’s counties. Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-milton-helene-florida-557c5c512135e0a8661b298e45e17c92?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the state was preparing for “the largest evacuation that we have seen, most likely since 2017, Hurricane Irma.” In a bleak <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/06/weather/tropical-storm-milton-florida-sunday/index.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warning</a>, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody said those who choose not to evacuate should “write your name in permanent marker on your arm, so that people know who you are when they get to you afterwards.”</p><h3>2. Oil giants reportedly want Trump to keep the IRA</h3><p>Some large fossil fuel companies have urged Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump not to gut the Inflation Reduction Act if he comes into power again in November, <em><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/big-oil-urges-trump-not-to-gut-bidens-climate-law-795dc597?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. The IRA, President Biden’s landmark climate law, provides tax credits for renewable energy and carbon capture projects, including many that these oil giants have heavily invested in. According to the <em><em>Journal</em></em>, executives from Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66, and Occidental Petroleum have been in discussions with the Trump campaign and congressional allies to make the case for the law, which Trump has called the “Green New Scam” and vowed to roll back. Political strategists told the <em><em>Journal</em></em> that Trump may try to “rebrand” the IRA given its popularity among Republican states. A recent <a href="https://e2.org/reports/clean-economy-works-two-year-review-2024/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> found that nearly 60% of the projects supported by the IRA are based in Republican congressional districts.</p><h3>3. Meanwhile, at BP...</h3><p>BP has dropped its ambitious 2030 plan to reduce its oil and gas production by 40% and shift to renewables, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bp-drops-oil-output-target-strategy-reset-sources-say-2024-10-07/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" target="_blank">three sources told</a> <em>Reuters</em>. The company made the commitment in 2020, and had already watered it down last year. Now it has reportedly abandoned the plan entirely and will focus on new investments to increase oil and gas output. Other oil giants including Shell have also walked back their energy transition goals.</p><p>Tangentially related: Fossil fuel company Equinor announced this morning it had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-07/eu-s-yes-votes-on-china-ev-tariffs-seen-as-targets-for-revenge?srnd=homepage-uk&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" target="_blank">acquired</a> a 9.8% stake in wind energy giant Orsted. That makes Equinor the firm’s second largest shareholder, behind the Danish government.</p><h3>4. Mexico’s Sheinbaum reiterates focus on ramping up renewables in 1st speech</h3><p>In case you missed it: Mexico’s new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, pledged last week to “boost renewable energies” to a 45% share of the country’s total energy mix by 2030. Sheinbaum, who was inaugurated on Tuesday, is a climate scientist, and her ascension has raised hopes among environmentalists that Mexico could ramp up climate action. Sheinbaum made many promises during her campaign but analysts have been skeptical of their staying power because she also promised to carry on the legacy of her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who doubled down on fossil fuels. But the strong words during Sheinbaum’s first speech as president “marks a sharp departure” from López Obrador, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-sheinbaum-energy-transition-climate-change-renewables-93a78b5f2c22d1eab0494a3d6dfaa5e9?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a><em><em> The Associated Press</em></em>. “The terms ‘sustainability’ or ‘renewable energy’ really never appeared” in his policies, one expert commented. “He didn’t use the term in any speech, in any document. And she has been using it all the time.” Sheinbaum promised to soon unveil her energy transition program focused on “the reduction of greenhouse gases that cause climate change.” Mexico is the only G20 nation that does not have a net zero target.</p><h3>5. WMO water report shows a hydrological cycle in chaos</h3><p>The World Meteorological Organization published its 2023 <a href="https://library.wmo.int/viewer/69033/download?file=1362_en.pdf&type=pdf&navigator=1&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" target="_blank">State of Global Water Resources</a> report today. It found that more than half of the world’s “river catchments” – watersheds or drainage basins – saw unusual levels of water flow last year. Mostly, there was less water than normal, with “large territories” of North, Central, and South America especially dry and many river flows falling to all-time lows. But in some places, like the Horn of Africa, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom, there was much more water than normal. These extremes – drought in some places and extreme flooding in others – were reflected in the regional soil moisture and terrestrial water levels. Glaciers lost more than 600 gigatons of water last year, the largest loss registered in the last 50 years. “Water is the canary in the coalmine of climate change,” WMO secretary general, Celeste Saulo, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/07/climate-warning-as-worlds-rivers-dry-up-at-fastest-rate-for-30-years?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The Guardian</em>. “As a result of rising temperatures, the hydrological cycle has accelerated. It has also become more erratic and unpredictable, and we are facing growing problems of either too much or too little water. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture which is conducive to heavy rainfall. More rapid evaporation and drying of soils worsen drought conditions.”</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p><em>“In the U.S., there is a decision being made now – and I’m not a part of it – as to whether to stop making pure ICE for the U.S. market. Just the fact that we’re thinking of that means that, OK, it must be close.”</em> –<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-03/toyota-hybrid-brings-about-the-end-of-the-ice-age-in-america?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-939j5OUb_XubYssk_hONLOhqie6GerVNl-YqzopeDP9z1yHsCULEPqYiehBcGcItY-nhZs" target="_blank">Gill Pratt, Toyota’s chief scientist</a>, speaking to <em>Bloomberg </em>about the future of the internal combustion engine.</p>

## Oil prices rise over Middle East tensions

date: 2024-10-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The biggest rise in oil prices for nearly two years was recorded on Friday, as the world watches mounting tensions in the Middle East and how Israel will respond to attacks by Iran. Then, an aging population is straining future growth prospects for Malaysia&#8217;s economy. And a British woman who spent nearly half a century wondering why a dream job application went unanswered has finally found out why.</p>
