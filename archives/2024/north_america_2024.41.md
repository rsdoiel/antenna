## Meta removes fake accounts in Moldova ahead of presidential election

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

STOCKHOLM — Meta Platforms said on Friday that it had removed a network of group accounts targeting Russian speakers in Moldova ahead of the country's October 20 election, for violation of the company's policy on fake accounts.


Authorities in Moldova, an ex-Soviet state lying between Romania and Ukraine, said they had blocked dozens of Telegram channels and chat bots linked to a drive to pay voters to cast "no" ballots in a referendum on European Union membership held alongside the presidential election.


Pro-European President Maia Sandu is seeking a second term in the election and called the referendum on joining the 27-member bloc as the cornerstone of her policies.


The fake Meta accounts posted criticism of Sandu, pro-EU politicians and close ties between Moldova and Romania, and supported pro-Russia parties in Moldova, the company said.


The company said its operation centered on about a dozen fictitious, Russian-language news brands posing as independent entities with presence on multiple internet services, including Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, as well as Telegram, OK.ru and TikTok.


Meta said it removed seven Facebook accounts, 23 pages, one group and 20 accounts on Instagram for violating its "coordinated inauthentic behavior policy."


About 4,200 accounts followed one or more of the 23 pages and about 335,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts, Meta said.


In Chisinau, the National Investigation Inspectorate said it had blocked 15 channels of the popular Telegram messaging app and 95 chat bots offering voters money. Users were told the channels "violated local laws" on political party financing.


It had traced the accounts to supporters of fugitive businessman Ilan Shor — members of the banned party bearing his name or the "Victory" electoral bloc he had set up in its place from his base of exile in Moscow.


Moldovan police said on Thursday that they searched homes of leaders linked to Shor as part of a criminal investigation into election-meddling. Police have said tens of thousands of voters were paid off via accounts in a Russian bank to derail the vote.


Shor was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia last year in connection with the 2014 disappearance of $1 billion from Moldovan banks. He denies allegations of trying to bribe voters.


Sandu accuses Moscow of trying to topple her government while Moscow has accused her of fomenting "Russophobia."

## US sues Virginia over alleged violation of federal election law

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday that it had sued the state of Virginia for violating the federal prohibition on systematic efforts to remove voters within 90 days of an election.


On August 7, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order requiring the commissioner of the Department of Elections to certify that the department was conducting "daily updates to the voter list" to remove, among other groups, people who are unable to verify that they are citizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles.


U.S. citizens who were identified and notified and did not affirm their citizenship within 14 days would be removed from the list of registered voters, the Justice Department said. It said this practice has led to citizens having their voter registrations canceled ahead of the November 5 election.


"By canceling voter registrations within 90 days of Election Day, Virginia places qualified voters in jeopardy of being removed from the rolls and creates the risk of confusion for the electorate," said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke.


"Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too often disenfranchise qualified voters," Clarke added.


The department said it was seeking injunctive relief that would restore the ability of affected eligible voters to cast their votes unimpeded on Election Day and would prohibit future violations.


Youngkin called the move politically motivated and an attempt to interfere in the election.


"With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these common sense steps that we are legally required to take with every resource available to us," he said in a statement on Friday.


Republicans across the U.S. have pushed against noncitizen voting, which is already illegal, ahead of the November election. Some election officials have warned that the move could penalize eligible voters.

## Experts: Future of US-South Korea defense cost-sharing deal remains uncertain

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington  — U.S. national security experts say it is unclear whether a new cost-sharing agreement with South Korea, hailed by the State Department as “a significant accomplishment,” will survive if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.


Concluded last week and effective from 2026, the five-year Special Measures Agreement, or SMA, requires South Korea to raise its contribution to the cost of stationing of U.S. troops in the country by 8.3% to $1.47 billion in the first year.


The two allies reached the agreement earlier than expected, a move widely seen as key for Seoul and Washington to clinch before the U.S. presidential election in November, in which Trump is the Republican Party candidate.


The U.S. State Department hailed the agreement as a “a significant accomplishment for both sides” in a statement released on October 4.


But Trump, both in office and as a candidate, has consistently demanded that South Korea contribute significantly more to the cost of supporting U.S. forces in Korea. Most recently in April, Trump told Time magazine that “I want South Korea to treat us properly,” adding that Seoul is “paying virtually nothing for” the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.


‘Trump factor’


John Bolton, a former White House national security adviser during the Trump administration, told VOA Korean by phone on Friday that “it’s very likely that Trump would ask to renegotiate it.”


“I know that the administration [of President Joe Biden] here tried to rush the coming-to-an-agreement on it, so that Trump couldn’t meddle with it, but that won’t slow him down at all,” said Bolton, who also served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005-06.


“He never thinks his predecessors make good enough deals, and in part, it’s not just the question of economics, but he doesn’t understand collective defense alliances,” Bolton said.


“He thinks that not just with respect to the Republic of Korea, but also with NATO or Japan or whatever that we’re defending, these countries don’t pay us enough money.” The Republic of Korea is South Korea’s formal name.


Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, pointed out the pact is “an executive agreement,” which makes it easier for Trump to undo since it does not require approval from Congress.


“We really don’t know whether he would just see it as a done deal, or if he will seek to renegotiate it upward, where South Korea would pay much more,” Klingner said.


“If you take a step back, it’s in our strategic interest to have allies, it’s in our strategic interest to have our forces stationed overseas, because actually, they’re less costly to the United States when they’re stationed overseas than when they’re stationed domestically.”


Robert Rapson, who served as charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean last week that he was concerned that the agreement wouldn't pass muster with a Trump administration should the former president win a second term in November.


“Given his demands and expectations of U.S. allies with respect to security burden sharing, my strong fear is that he will seek to renegotiate today’s agreement with a much higher number in mind,” said Rapson, who was directly involved in the two sets of SMA negotiations in 2013-14 and in 2019-21.


Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told VOA Korean on Thursday via email that he suspected there was “considerable dissatisfaction with the recently concluded SMA agreement in the Trump camp,” knowing how strongly the former president feels about the burden-sharing issue.


Revere said he could not rule out the possibility that Trump will come up with “a demand to reopen talks on the SMA issue, and toward that end, he might make major new demands of Seoul” if he takes office again.


'It's in our interest'


Other former government officials, like Klingner, believe it is too early to predict whether Trump will try to revise the cost-sharing agreement between the U.S. and South Korea.


Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on Wednesday on the phone, “He might try, but let’s not get fearful about this too soon.”


“If he comes to the White House, he will have a secretary of state, defense, national security adviser, et cetera, who may have slightly different views and can help moderate Mr. Trump.”


“Seoul and Washington understand that Trump is very transactional,” Armitage said. “But American soldiers are not Hessians. We’re not for rent. We’re in Korea because it’s in our interest.”


VOA Korean contacted the Trump campaign this week and asked what Trump’s stance was on the newly reached agreement, but did not receive a reply by the time this article was published.

## US soldier sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to assist Islamic State

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — A U.S. Army soldier was sentenced to 14 years in prison for attempting to help the Islamic State conduct a deadly ambush of U.S. troops, the Department of Justice said on Friday.


Cole Bridges, also known as Cole Gonzales, 24, will undergo supervised release for 10 years following his release from prison, the department said.


Bridges, who was a private first class at the time of his arrest, was charged in 2021 with giving "military advice and guidance on how to kill fellow soldiers to individuals he thought were part of ISIS," the department said.


Bridges pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in June 2023. He joined the Army in 2019.


Before joining, according to the department, he began researching and consuming online propaganda "promoting jihadists and their violent ideology, and began to express his support for ISIS and jihad on social media."

## Boeing lawyers argue for settlement opposed by relatives of those killed in 737 Max crashes

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

fort worth, Texas — Relatives of passengers who died in two crashes of Boeing 737 Max planes came to a federal court in Texas on Friday to listen as their lawyers asked a judge to throw out a plea agreement that the aircraft manufacturer struck with prosecutors and put the company on trial.


Their lawyers argued that Boeing's punishment — mainly a fine amounting to about $244 million — would be too light for misleading regulators about a flight-control system that malfunctioned before the crashes. They accused Boeing and the Justice Department of airbrushing facts and ignoring that 346 people died in the crashes.


U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor asked a Boeing lawyer why he should accept the prepackaged plea deal and a sentence negotiated by a defendant.


The Boeing lawyer, Ben Hatch, said Boeing "is a pillar of the national economy and the national defense” and needs to know the punishment before it agrees to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud, a felony. Otherwise, he said, the company could be disbarred from federal contracting.


“All the employees of the company, the shareholders of the company and a global and national supply chain ... all of those are put into doubt if the sentencing" isn't known, possibly for months, Hatch said.


The answer stunned and angered relatives of the victims.


“Boeing is too important for the economy — they're too big to jail. That's what he's saying,” Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in the second crash, said after the hearing. “It allows them to kill people with no consequences because they're too big and because their shareholders won't like it.”


The government joined Boeing in asking the judge to accept the deal that they struck in July.


Sean Tonolli, senior deputy chief of the Justice Department's fraud section, said the conspiracy count is the most serious crime prosecutors can bring — they can't prove that Boeing's deception of regulators caused the crashes. And, he said, going to trial is risky.


“We are confident in our case, but we don’t take for granted that we might not win," he said.


The judge, who had received written arguments from all sides before the hearing in Fort Worth, asked questions but gave no indication if he is leaning one way or the other. He has expressed sympathy for the passengers' families before, writing in a 2023 ruling about "Boeing’s egregious criminal conduct.”


“You have given me a lot to think about,” O'Connor said to all the lawyers as Friday's hearing ended. “I'll get a ruling out just as soon as I can.”


In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly deceiving Federal Aviation Administration regulators who were writing pilot-training requirements for the Max.


The FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737 pilots before they could fly the Max, the latest version of the 737. That helped Boeing by avoiding the need for training in flight simulators, which would have raised the cost for airlines to operate the Max.


Airlines began flying the Max in 2017. The first crash occurred in Indonesia in October 2018, followed in March 2019 by the second, in Ethiopia.


The plea agreement calls for Boeing to pay a fine of up to $487.2 million, but the fine would be cut in half by giving the company credit for $243.6 million it paid as part of a $2.5 billion settlement in 2021 to avoid prosecution. The Justice Department decided in May that Boeing violated terms of that settlement, leading to the new plea deal.


Boeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, would also invest $455 million in compliance and safety programs, and be placed on probation for three years.


The case is among a host of issues with which the manufacturer most contend.


Talks broke down this week with striking factory workers who assemble some of the company’s best-selling planes. The company withdrew its offer and S&P Global Ratings put it on its credit watch list, citing increased financial risk because of the labor unrest.


On Thursday, the company filed a complaint over what it calls unfair labor practices against the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Boeing in its complaint with the National Labor Relations Board said that the union’s public narrative is misleading and has made it difficult to reach a resolution.

## US expands sanctions against Iran's oil industry after attack on Israel

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

washington — The United States hit Iran's oil and petrochemicals sectors with fresh sanctions Friday in response to Tehran's October 1 attack against Israel, designating dozens of new companies and firms.  


In a statement Friday, the Treasury Department said it was going after Iran's so-called "shadow fleet" of ships involved in selling Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions, designating 10 companies and 17 vessels as "blocked property" over their involvement in "shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products." 


The State Department announced it was sanctioning an additional six firms and six ships for "knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of petroleum or petroleum products from Iran." 


The sanctions form part of the U.S. response to Iran's attack, in which it launched some 200 ballistic missiles against Israel in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders and a general from Iran's Revolutionary Guards. 


Israel has said its response to Iran's second direct attack against its territory this year would be "deadly, precise, and surprising." 


U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that Israel should consider "other alternatives than striking oil fields," amid reports it was planning to do so.  


"In response to Iran's attack on Israel, the United States is taking decisive action to further disrupt the Iranian regime's ability to fund and carry out its destabilizing activity," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. 


"Today's sanctions target Iranian efforts to channel revenues from its energy industry to finance deadly and disruptive activity — including development of its nuclear program, the proliferation of ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles," she added.  


Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had made clear after the October 1 attack that Tehran would face consequences. 


"To that end, we are taking steps today to disrupt the flow of revenue the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program and missile development, support terrorist proxies and partners, and perpetuate conflict throughout the Middle East," he said in a statement.

## Biden again blasts disinformation after second hurricane batters South

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

WHITE HOUSE — During a briefing Friday on recovery efforts after Hurricane Milton at the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden again warned about the spread of "disgusting" and "dangerous" misinformation and disinformation about the federal government's response to recent storms.


Responding to a reporter's question, Biden said that misleading information hurts people who need the most help. "Widowers, people in hospitals, people who are by themselves and they don't know, and they lose contact, and they get scared to death," he said.


"We're breaking through with it. We're breaking through with the truth," he said, noting that Republican governors and mayors have supported his call to stop the spread of disinformation.


Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has been spreading disinformation about the government's response, including that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is limiting payouts to disaster survivors to $750, and that funding for Americans who are affected by the disaster was used up to provide housing for undocumented immigrants.


"I think those who have been spreading these lies to try to undermine the opposition are going to pay a price for it," Biden said, adding that Trump is not solely to blame but has the "biggest mouth."




Biden provided an update on the federal government's response to hurricanes Milton and Helene flanked by his top aides, including Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. He was joined virtually by Vice President Kamala Harris from her campaign stop in Arizona.


Harris again warned companies against taking advantage of the storms to increase profit.


"Any company or individual that is using this crisis to jack up prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring, and there will be a consequence," she said.


Milton deaths


Authorities in Florida said Friday that Hurricane Milton was responsible for at least 16 deaths, and that more than 2 million people remained without power as evacuees returned to their homes to assess the damage and begin cleaning up from the storm.


As of midday Friday, the website poweroutage.us reported 2.3 million people remained without power. Late Thursday, Biden said more than 50,000 line workers and 1,000 federal personnel were on the ground to respond.


The storm made landfall late Wednesday near Siesta Key in Sarasota County as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour. It carved a path of destruction across central Florida, affecting many communities still cleaning up from Hurricane Helene two weeks earlier.


While the state's western coast felt the direct hit from the storm, Milton also spawned tornados that affected the southeastern part of the state. Local media reported more than 19 tornadoes touched down even before the hurricane made landfall. Tornadoes are believed responsible for several deaths.




State government officials and the Florida National Guard reported more than 1,000 people were rescued since the storm made landfall.


The U.S. Coast Guard reported one of its aircrews rescued a man Wednesday clinging to a cooler floating in the Gulf of Mexico 48 kilometers off the Florida coast. It said the man was later taken to Tampa General Hospital for medical treatment.


State officials said while total damage assessments are still being made, the storm could have been much worse. The population center of Tampa was spared a direct hit, and the predicted record-setting storm surge did not materialize.


Meanwhile, scientists said climate change made Hurricane Milton stronger and more dangerous.


In a report issued Friday, the nonprofit group Weather Attribution said Milton went through an "explosive intensification" from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in 24 hours.


The group said the rapid intensification was driven and sustained by very high sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico.


Some information for this report came from Reuters, The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.

## Back-to-back hurricanes reshape 2024 campaign’s final stretch

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A pair of unwelcome and destructive guests named Helene and Milton have stormed their way into this year's U.S. presidential election.


The back-to-back hurricanes have jumbled the schedules of Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, both of whom devoted part of their recent days to tackling questions about the storm recovery effort.


The two hurricanes are forcing basic questions about who as president would best respond to deadly natural disasters, a once-overlooked issue that has become an increasingly routine part of the job. And just weeks before the November 5 election, the storms have disrupted the mechanics of voting in several key counties.


Vice President Harris is trying to use this as an opportunity to project leadership, appearing alongside President Joe Biden at briefings and calling for bipartisan cooperation. Former President Trump is trying to use the moment to attack the administration's competence and question whether it is withholding help from Republican areas, despite no evidence of such behavior.


Adding to the pressure is the need to provide more money for the Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would require House Republicans to work with the Democratic administration. Biden said Thursday that lawmakers should address the situation immediately.


Timothy Kneeland, a professor at Nazareth University in Rochester, New York, who has studied the issue, said, “Dealing with back-to-back crises will put FEMA under more scrutiny and, therefore, the Biden administration will be under a microscope in the days leading up to the election.


“Vice President Harris must empathize with the victims without altering the campaign schedule and provide consistent messaging on the widespread devastation that makes FEMA’s work even more challenging than normal,” Kneeland said.




Already, Trump and Harris have separately gone to Georgia to assess hurricane damage and pledge support, and Harris has visited North Carolina, requiring the candidates to cancel campaign events elsewhere and use up time that is a precious resource in the final weeks before any election. Georgia and North Carolina are political battlegrounds, raising the stakes.


Campaign language altered


The hurricane fallout is evident in the candidates' campaign events as well.


On Thursday, the first question Harris got at a Univision town hall in Las Vegas came from a construction worker and undecided voter from Tampa, Florida. Ramiro Gonzalez asked about talk that the administration has not done enough to support people after Helene, and whether the people in Milton's path would have access to aid — a sign that Trump’s messaging is breaking through with some potential voters.


Harris has called out the level of misinformation being circulated by Republicans, but her fuller answer revealed the dynamics at play just a few weeks before an election.


“I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play politics,” she said.




On the same day, Trump opened his speech at the Detroit Economic Club by praising Republican governors in the affected states and blasting the Biden-Harris administration.


“They’ve let those people suffer unjustly,” he said about those affected by Helene in North Carolina.


Voting systems affected


The storms have also scrambled the voting process in places. North Carolina’s State Board of Elections has passed a resolution to help people in the state's affected counties vote. Florida will allow some counties greater flexibility in distributing mail-in ballots and changing polling sites for in-person voting. But a federal judge in Georgia said Thursday the state doesn't need to reopen voter registration despite the disruptions by Helene.


Tension and controversy have begun to override the disaster response, with Biden on Wednesday and Thursday saying that Trump has spread falsehoods that are “un-American.”


Candace Bright Hall-Wurst, a sociology professor at East Tennessee State University, said that natural disasters have become increasingly politicized, often putting more of the focus on the politicians instead of the people in need.


“Disasters are politicized when they have political value to the candidate," she said. "This does not mean that the politicization is beneficial to victims.”


As the Democratic nominee, Harris has suddenly been a major part of the response to hurricanes, a role that traditionally has not involved vice presidents in prior administrations.


On Thursday, she participated virtually at a Situation Room briefing on Milton while she was in Nevada for campaign activities. She has huddled in meetings about response plans and on Wednesday phoned into CNN live to discuss the administration's efforts.


At a Wednesday appearance with Biden to discuss Milton ahead of it making landfall, Harris subtly tied back the issues into her campaign policies to stop price gouging on food and other products.


“To any company that — or individual that — might use this crisis to exploit people who are desperate for help through illegal fraud or price gouging — whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel counter — know that we are monitoring these behaviors and the situation on the ground very closely and anyone taking advantage of consumers will be held accountable,” she said.


Harris warned that Milton “poses extreme danger.” It made landfall in Florida late Wednesday and left more than 3 million without power. But the storm surge never reached the same levels as Helene, which led to roughly 230 fatalities and for a prolonged period left mountainous parts of North Carolina without access to electricity, cell service and roads.


Misinformation about Helene


Trump and his allies have seized on the aftermath of Helene to spread misinformation about the administration's response. Their debunked claims include statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid, as well as false charges that emergency response funds were diverted to immigrants.


The former president said the administration's response to Helene was worse than the George W. Bush administration's widely panned handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to nearly 1,400 deaths.


“This hurricane has been a bad one; Kamala Harris has left them stranded," Trump said at a recent rally in Juneau, Wisconsin. “This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we’ve ever seen ever. Probably worse than Katrina, and that’s hard to beat, right?"


Asked about the Trump campaign's strategic thinking on emphasizing the hurricane response, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it reflects a pattern of “failed leadership” by the Biden administration that also includes the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and security at the U.S. southern border.


John Gasper, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who has researched government responses to natural disasters, said storm victims generally want to ensure foremost that they get the aid they need.


“These disasters essentially end up being good tests of leadership for local, state and federal officials in how they respond," he said.


But Gasper noted that U.S. politics have gotten so polarized and other issues such as the economy are shaping the election, such that the debate currently generating so much heat between Trump and the Biden administration might not matter that much on Election Day.

## US lawmakers seek answers from telecoms on Chinese hacking report

date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers asked AT&T, Verizon Communications, and Lumen Technologies on Friday to answer questions after a report that Chinese hackers accessed the networks of U.S. broadband providers. 


The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday hackers obtained information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized wiretapping, and said the three companies were among the telecoms whose networks were breached. 


House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican, and the top Democrat on the committee Representative Frank Pallone along with Representatives Bob Latta and Doris Matsui asked the three companies to answer questions. They are seeking a briefing and detailed answers by next Friday. 


"There is a growing concern regarding the cybersecurity vulnerabilities embedded in U.S. telecommunications networks," the lawmakers said. They are asking for details on what information was seized and when the companies learned about the intrusion. 


AT&T and Lumen declined to comment, while Verizon did not immediately comment. 


It was unclear when the hack occurred. 


Hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized U.S. requests for communications data, the Journal said. It said the hackers had also accessed other tranches of internet traffic. 


China's foreign ministry said on Sunday that it was not aware of the attack described in the report but said the United States had "concocted a false narrative" to "frame" China in the past.

## Why racial disparities in stock market investments persist

date: 2024-10-11, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Stocks are increasingly an important source of household wealth. Thanks to the booming stock market, U.S. household wealth surged to a record high last year, per Federal Reserve data. But there are continued racial differences in stock ownership, which has big implications for the racial wealth gap. We&#8217;ll learn more. Also on the show: producer prices remain tame, and business travel spending rebounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just softened the boundaries a little bit and allowed politics to creep into the workplace,&#8221; says Sean Westwood, director of the Polarization Research Lab at Dartmouth.

Today: the argument for just not talking about politics or other divisive matters at work. But first, Trump and Harris turn their attention to automakers.</p>

## Who will pay for Helene’s damage?

## Evaluating the damage

date: 2024-10-09, from: Market Place

<p>As the Southeast assesses Hurricane Helene&#8217;s damage, Milton barrels toward Florida&#8217;s west coast. The proximity of the storms will make it harder for homeowners and insurers to estimate each one&#8217;s impact — and likely drive up recovery costs. Also in this episode: Corporate bonds shine after the Fed&#8217;s rate cut, the mortgage rate honeymoon is over and Nebraska&#8217;s elections attract major campaign spending — along with some odd yard signs.</p>

## A costly lesson, often learned the hard way

date: 2024-10-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Medicare does not pay for general, long-term care. Now, Kamala Harris, the Democrat&#8217;s candidate for president, wants to expand Medicare to pay for long-term care for older people in their home. That would need an amenable new Congress, but many families are presently left trying to piece together care for older relatives. Also on today&#8217;s show: potential structure changes to Google and the rising value of the U.S. dollar.</p>

## Let’s get apolitical

date: 2024-10-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>In a time of fraught political polarization, it&#8217;s hard for companies to decide whether to take political stands or remain quietly on the sidelines. Today, as a continuation of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/collection/office-politics/">our Office Politics series</a>, we&#8217;ll hear why some places that once mixed business and politics may be keeping a lower profile now.

date: 2024-10-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The U.S. Department of Justice is taking aim at Google, saying the tech giant might need to be broken up because it&#8217;s too dominant in the market.

## The cost of being prepared

date: 2024-10-08, from: Market Place

<p>Natural disaster recovery is often expensive, but this season is shaping up to be particularly costly and painful. The Southeast is reeling from Hurricane Helene, and Hurricane Milton is expected to inflict more damage starting tomorrow night. Disaster preparedness can reduce the economic burden of recovery, but not all localities can afford to be prepared. Also in this episode: The Fed&#8217;s interest rate cut raised business owners&#8217; optimism and China invites more young Americans to visit.</p>
