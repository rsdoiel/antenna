<h2 id="qml-haskell-library">QML Haskell Library</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: James Hobson blog</p>
<p>Making UIs in haskell is a pain. Not because the libraries are bad,
but because they are either hard to use or short lived. My reason for
thinking this is because making UI bindings is just not a normal
haskeller’s idea of fun. They may make a library, and then abandon it.
There is basically one UI library that has stood the test of time, and
that is gi-gtk, whi is here because it’s auto-generated using
gobject-introspection.</p>
