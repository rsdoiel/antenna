<p>JIMMY Buffett taught us that sometimes, well-told fiction is better
than reality.  Tristan Jones would have agreed.  His own life packed
enough interesting material to keep inquisitive grandchildren gathered
wide-eyed at his feet for years, yet halfway through his life’s journey
he upped the ante and reinvented himself.  Separating fact from fiction
in Tristan Jones’ life is one thing, but whatever you think of him,
there is no denying his power with the pen.</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;BEIRUT (Reuters) &amp;#8212; Massive consecutive strikes hit Beirut&amp;#8217;s southern suburbs from late Saturday into Sunday, Reuters eyewitnesses said, sending booms across the city and sparking flashes of red and white for nearly 30 minutes visible from several kilometers away. The strikes came after days of bombing by Israel of Beirut suburbs considered strongholds for Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, killing its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and possibly his potential successor. A Lebanese security source said on Saturday that Hashem Safieddine, the potential successor, had been out of contact since Friday, after an Israeli airstrike near the city&amp;#8217;s international airport that was reported to have targeted him. The Israeli military said it eliminated Nasrallah in a strike on the group&amp;#8217;s central command headquarters in Beirut on Sept. 27. Hezbollah confirmed he had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;

Watch: First light (and flight) for HVO’s new airborne lidar system</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Topographic mapping has been a key component of volcano monitoring for decades, helping scientists to study morphologic changes and predict the paths of lava flows during eruptions. Lidar systems are a preferred mapping tool and the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory now has a lidar system of its own to generate mapping products more frequently than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;In contrast to the scattered, angry, erratic, openly demagogic man at the top of the ticket, Sen. JD Vance was calm and clear and presentable in Tuesday night&amp;#8217;s debate against Gov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris&amp;#8217; choice to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Vance probably even won on points, if you judge these things like a high school debate meet; Walz served up a few word salads. &lt;/p&gt;

In fact, many school districts have adopted policies deliberately designed to keep you in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

ǀ Building lifelong connections: The strength of compassion and
community in the digital and physical classroom</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, updated: 2024-10-02, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>AS a teacher, I often caught up in lesson planning and evaluating
student work, and I didn’t take the time to appreciate the special
moments I shared with them. However, in 2019, I decided to make a change
and saw an opportunity to create something extraordinary with my
students — a virtual diary of our experiences and memories that we could
all cherish for years. So, I started a Google Site where I could
document every moment, big and small, and make it a part of our shared
history.</p>
