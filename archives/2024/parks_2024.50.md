date: 2024-12-09, from: Press Releases

Fire managers at Grand Canyon National Park are preparing to conduct a prescribed burn operation on the North Rim this week, which will begin on Tuesday, December 10. These operations will help reduce hazardous fuel loads, improve forest health, and restore natural fire regimes. The burns are expected to occur over several days and will coincide with prescribed burns planned on the North Kaibab Ranger District. https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/news/prescribed-fire-beginning-dec10-north-rim.htm
