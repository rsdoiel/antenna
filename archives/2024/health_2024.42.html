tuberculosis combine with EBV infection in severe adult
meningoencephalitis: a rare case reports and literature review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundTuberculous meningitis (TBM) with adults Epstein-Barr (EB)
virus encephalitis is a very rare infectious disease, with a high
mortality and disability. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS)
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is highly diagnostic. We report on a case
of severe meningoencephalitis caused by co-infection with mycobacterium
tuberculosis and EB virus. Brain MRI indicated a parenchyma lesion in
the brain. mNGS of CSF indicated Mycobacterium tuberculosis and EB virus
amplification, positive serum EB virus IgG antibodies, and improved
symptoms after anti-tuberculosis and antiviral treatment. A
re-examination of the brain MRI revealed that the significantly
absorption of the lesions.Case reportA 49-year-old male patient
presented with a chief complaint of headache and fever with
consciousness disturbance. The brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a
lesions in the right parenchymal brain with uneven enhancement,
accompanied by significantly increased intracranial pressure, elevated
CSF cell count and protein levels, as well as notably decreased glucose
and chloride levels. mNGS of CSF showed the coexistence of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and EBV. The patient was diagnosed as TBM with EBV
encephalitis. The patient’s symptoms gradually improved with the active
administration of anti-tuberculosis combined with antiviral agents, the
use of hormones to reduce inflammatory reaction, dehydration to lower
intracranial pressure, and intrathecal injection. Subsequent follow-up
brain magnetic resonance imaging indicated significant absorption of the
lesions, along with a marked decrease in CSF count and protein levels,
as well as obvious increase in glucose and chloride levels.ConclusionTBM
associated with adult EBV encephalitis is extremely rare. The disease’s
early stages are severe and have a high fatality rate. A prompt and
accurate diagnosis is particularly important. NGS of CSF is of great
value for early diagnosis.</p>

influence of perilipin 5 deficiency on gut microbiome profiles in murine
metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and
MAFLD-hepatocellular carcinoma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMetabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease
(MAFLD) has emerged as the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) worldwide. Over the years, Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) has been recognized
as a key regulator of both MAFLD and HCC development. In our previous
studies we demonstrated that deficiency in Plin5 reduces the severity of
MAFLD and HCC in mice. Interestingly, it has been established that
patients with MAFLD and HCC exhibit various changes in their gut
microbiome profiles. The gut microbiome itself has been shown to play a
role in modulating carcinogenesis and the immune response against
cancer.MethodsTherefore, we conducted a study to investigate the
alterations in fecal microbiome composition in wild type (WT) and
Plin5-deficient (Plin5-/-) mice models of MAFLD and MAFLD-induced HCC
(MAFLD-HCC). We utilized 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to profile
the composition of gut bacteria in fecal samples.ResultsNotably, we
discovered that the absence of Plin5 alone is already associated with
changes in gut microbiota composition. Moreover, feeding the mice a
Western diet (WD) resulted in additional microbial alterations.
Interestingly, Plin5-/- animals exhibited an enrichment of the
beneficial taxa Lactobacillus in both animal models.DiscussionOur
findings identify Plin5 as a major regulator of gut microbiota during
the development of MAFLD and MAFLD-HCC.</p>

compound-induced downregulation of antimicrobial resistance and
biofilm-linked genes in wastewater Aeromonas species</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Addressing the global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis requires
a multifaceted innovative approach to mitigate impacts on public health,
healthcare and economic systems. In the complex evolution of AMR,
biofilms and the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs)
play a pivotal role. Aeromonas is a major AMR player that often forms
biofilm, harbors ARGs and is frequently detected in wastewater. Existing
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) do not have the capacity to totally
eliminate antimicrobial-resistant bacteria favoring the evolution of
ARGs in wastewater. Besides facilitating the emergence of AMR, biofilms
contribute significantly to biofouling process within the activated
sludge of WWTP bioreactors. This paper presents the inhibition of
biofilm formation, the expression of biofilm-linked genes and ARGs by
phytochemicals andrographolide, docosanol, lanosterol, quercetin, rutin
and thymohydroquinone. Aeromonas species were isolated and purified from
activated sludge samples. The ARGs were detected in the isolated
Aeromonas species through PCR. Aeromonas biofilms were quantified
following the application of biocompounds through the microtiter plate
assay. qPCR analyses of related genes were done for confirmation.
Findings showed that the natural compounds inhibited the formation of
biofilms and reduced the expression of genes linked to biofilm
production as well as ARGs in wastewater Aeromonas. This indicates the
efficacy of these compounds in targeting and controlling both ARGs and
biofilm formation, highlighting their potential as innovative solutions
for combating antimicrobial resistance and biofouling.</p>

gingivalis triggers microglia activation and neurodegenerative processes
through NOX4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Periodontitis and infections with periodontal bacteria have been
highlighted as risk factors for dementia. In recent years, attention has
been drawn to the role of microglia cells in neurodegenerative diseases.
However, there is limited knowledge of the influence of periodontal
bacteria on microglia cells. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the interactions between the periodontal bacteria
Porphyromonas gingivalis and microglia cells and to unravel whether
these interactions could contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer’s
disease. We found, through microarray analysis, that stimulation of
microglia cells with P. gingivalis resulted in the upregulation of
several Alzheimer’s disease-associated genes, including NOX4. We also
showed that P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharides (LPS) mediated reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin
8 (IL-8) induction via NOX4 in microglia. The viability of neurons was
shown to be reduced by conditioned media from microglia cells stimulated
with P. gingivalis LPS and the reduction was NOX4 dependent. The levels
of total and phosphorylated tau in neurons were increased by conditioned
media from microglia cells stimulated with P. gingivalis or LPS. This
increase was NOX4-dependent. In summary, our findings provide us with a
potential mechanistic explanation of how the periodontal pathogen P.
gingivalis could trigger or exacerbate AD pathogenesis.</p>

characterization of Neisseria meningitidis isolates recovered from
patients with invasive meningococcal disease in Lithuania</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNeisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative bacterium
responsible for life-threatening invasive infections known as invasive
meningococcal disease and is associated with high fatality rates and
serious lifelong disabilities among survivors.MethodsThis study aimed to
characterize N. meningitidis isolates cultured from blood and
cerebrospinal fluid collected between 2009 and 2021 in Lithuania, assess
their genomic relationships with European strains, and evaluate the
possibility of using a cost-effective method for strain
characterization, thus improving the national molecular surveillance of
invasive meningococcal disease. In total, 321 N. meningitidis isolates
were collected and analyzed using multilocus restriction typing (MLRT).
Amplification of the penA gene and restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis were performed to identify the modified penA
genes. Based on the MLRT genotyping results, we selected 10 strains for
additional analysis using whole-genome sequencing. The sequenced genomes
were incorporated into a dataset of publicly available N. meningitidis
genomes to evaluate genomic diversity and establish phylogenetic
relationships within the Lithuanian and European circulating
strains.ResultsWe identified 83 different strains using MLRT genotyping.
Genomic diversity of N. meningitidis genomes analysed revealed 21
different sequence types (STs) circulating in Lithuania. Among these,
ST34 was the most prevalent. Notably, three isolates displayed unique
combinations of seven housekeeping genes and were identified as novel
STs: ST16969, ST16901, and ST16959. The analyzed strains were found to
possess virulence factors not commonly found in N. meningitidis. Six
distinct penA profiles were identified, each with different frequencies.
In the present study, we also identified N. meningitidis strains with
new penA, NEIS0123, NEIS1320, NEIS1525, NEIS1600, and NEIS1753 loci
variants. In our study, using the cgMLST scheme, Minimum Spanning Tree
(MST) analysis did not identify significant geographic relationships
between Lithuanian N. meningitidis isolates and strains from
Europe.DiscussionDiscussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study
to employ whole genome sequencing (WGS) method for a comprehensive
genetic characterization of invasive N. meningitidis isolates from
Lithuania. This approach provides a more detailed and precise analysis
of genomic relationships and diversity compared to prior studies relying
on traditional molecular typing methods and antigen analysis.</p>

cruzi-derived exovesicles contribute to parasite infection, tissue
damage, and apoptotic cell death during ex vivo infection of human
placental explants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, can be
congenitally transmitted by crossing the placental barrier. This study
investigates the role of T. cruzi-derived exovesicles (TcEVs) in
facilitating parasite infection and the consequent tissue damage and
apoptotic cell death in human placental explants (HPEs). Our findings
demonstrate that TcEVs significantly enhance the parasite load and
induce tissue damage in HPEs, both in the presence and absence of the
parasite. Through histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses, we
show that TcEVs alone can disrupt the placental barrier, affecting the
basal membrane and villous stroma. The induction of apoptotic cell death
is evidenced by DNA fragmentation, caspase 8 and 3, and p18 fragment
immunodetection. This damage is exacerbated when TcEVs are combined with
T. cruzi infection. These findings suggest that TcEVs play a critical
role in the pathogenesis of congenital Chagas disease by disrupting the
placental barrier and facilitating parasite transmission to the fetus.
This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of transplacental
transmission of T. cruzi and highlights the potential of targeting TcEVs
as a therapeutic strategy against congenital Chagas disease.</p>
