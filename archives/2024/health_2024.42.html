activates NF-κB and ERK1/2 through TLR2 and contributes to the virulence
of Pasteurella multocida</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPasteurella multocida is a pathogenic bacterium known to
cause hemorrhagic septicemia and pneumonia in poultry. Reports have
indicated that certain proteins, either directly involved in or
regulating iron metabolism, are important virulence factors of P.
multocida. Therefore, understanding virulent factors and analyzing the
role of pro-inflammatory cytokines can help us elucidate the underlying
pathogenesis.MethodsIn this study, the PMCNA_RS00975 protein, a putative
encapsuling protein encoded by a gene from a specific prophage island of
the pathogenic strain C48-1 of P. multocida, was investigated. To
further explore the impact of the PMCNA_RS00975 protein on
pathogenicity, a PMCNA_RS00975 gene mutant of P. multocida strain C48-1
was constructed using positive selection technology. Subcellular
localization was performed to determine the location of the
PMCNA_RS00975 protein within P. multocida. The recombinant protein
PMCNA_RS00975 of P. multocida was soluble expressed, purified, and its
role in pro-inflammatory cytokines was investigated.ResultsThe mutant
exhibited significantly reduced pathogenicity in the mice model.
Furthermore, subcellular localization indicated that the PMCNA_RS00975
protein was located at the outer membrane and expressed during infection
of P. multocida. Additionally, our experiments revealed that recombinant
PMCNA_RS00975 protein promotes the secretion of the IL-6
pro-inflammatory cytokines triggered by the TLR2 receptor via NF-κB and
ERK1/2 signaling pathways in the macrophages.DiscussionThis study
identified a novel virulence factor in the C48-1 strain, providing a
basis for understanding the pathogenesis and directions for the
development of attenuated vaccines against P. multocida.</p>

and procaine hydrochloride inhibit the growth of Aspergillus species and
exert antimicrobial properties during coinfection with influenza A
viruses and A. fumigatus in vitro</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionInfluenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis is
associated with high mortality rates and limited treatment options. The
current standard practice involves treating each pathogen separately.
However, the use of antifungal drugs can lead to serious side effects,
and the presence of triazole-resistant Aspergillus strains can
complicate antifungal therapy. In addition, drug-resistant influenza
viruses are becoming an increasing concern in clinics. A drug that
affects fungal and viral propagation could overcome these disadvantages.
Thus, we conducted a study to examine the antifungal and antiviral
properties of ProcCluster® and procaine hydrochloride (HCl), which are
prodrugs derived from the local anesthetic procaine.MethodsConidia of
different A. fumigatus strains, A. flavus and A. terreus were treated
with the test substances in a human cell-free system and antifungal
properties were analyzed either by fluorescence microscopy or absorption
measurements. Changes in metabolic activity and intracellular Ca2+
distribution during treatment of A. fumigatus with ProcCluster® were
observed using fluorescence microscopy. In addition, antifungal and
antiviral properties of ProcCluster® and procaine HCl were investigated
during in vitro coinfection of lung epithelial cells with A. fumigatus
and influenza A viruses (IAV). Analysis was performed by fluorescence
microscopy, standard plaque assay and Western blot assay.ResultsBoth
substances inhibited the growth of the fungus, even when applied after
germination or in the presence of purified IAV particles. ProcCluster®
remained effective against triazole-resistant A. fumigatus strains.
However, the addition of CaCl2 reversed the antifungal effect,
indicating that ProcCluster® inhibited fungal growth by disrupting
fungal Ca2+ homeostasis. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that
ProcCluster® and procaine HCl reduced the pathogen load of IAV and A.
fumigatus during coinfection. Finally, the combination of ProcCluster®
with the antiviral drug favipiravir exhibited increased antipathogenic
activity, particularly against IAV replication.DiscussionThis research
highlights ProcCluster® and procaine HCl as substances with
anti-infective properties against various pathogens.</p>

metabolomics and pseudo-targeted lipidomics combined with gut microbes
reveal the protective effects of Causonis japonica (Thunb.) Raf. in
ulcerative colitis mice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease
characterized by recurrent inflammatory tissue damage to the intestinal
mucosa and forming intestinal epithelial ulcers. It is one of the most
intractable diseases in the world. To date, the mechanism is unclear.
Causonis japonica (Thunb.) Raf. (Wu Lianmei in Chinese; WLM), a
traditional Chinese medicine, which has a long history as an
anti-inflammatory, but its effect on UC was unconfirmed yet. Therefore,
we established a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC mice model and
evaluated the therapeutic effect of WLM extract. The results indicated
that WLM inhibits DSS-induced inflammatory response in colitis in vivo,
decrease DSS-induced clinical manifestations, reverses colon length
shortening, and reduces tissue damage. The results of ELISA kits
suggested that WLM could reverse the levels of DSS-induced inflammatory
factors. To explore the mechanism of WLM in treating DSS-induced UC, 1H
NMR and UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap MS were used to perform non-targeted
metabolomics analysis; 21 differential metabolites in colon tissues were
closely related to UC. Meanwhile, the pseudo-targeted lipidomics based
on UHPLC-Q/Trap MS was used to analyze lipid metabolism disorders, and
60 differential lipid compounds were screened. These differential
compounds were mainly involved in glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid,
glycerolipid, citric acid, tyrosine, and ether lipid metabolisms. The
analysis of gut microbial showed that WLM may improve the symptoms of UC
mice by reducing the abundance of Helicobacter and Streptococcus and
increasing the abundance of Limosilactobacillus and Akkermansia.
Moreover, the real-time qPCR results showed that WLM extract could
decrease the mRNA levels of inflammatory factors and may be associated
with protecting the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier by
destroying in vivo metabolic pathways, especially by regulating energy
and lipid metabolisms and reducing inflammatory reactions. It provides a
beneficial reference for studying WLM to elucidate the therapeutic
mechanism of UC.</p>

the killing mechanisms of potassium iodide in combination with
antimicrobial photodynamic therapy against cross-kingdom biofilm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe co-existence of S. mutans and C. albicans is
frequently detected in root caries and early child caries and is
reported to be associated with recurrent caries. The aim of this study
was to investigate the effects of potassium iodide (KI) in combination
with toluidine blue O-mediated antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT)
on S. mutans and C. albicans mixed-species biofilm, as well as the
antibiofilm mechanisms involved.MethodsMixed-species biofilm was
constructed of S. mutans and C. albicans on dentin blocks. The
antibiofilm efficacy, cytotoxicity and antibiofilm mechanism of KI in
combination with aPDT were determined and evaluated.ResultsKI+TBO-aPDT
treatment caused reduction in microorganism counts, metabolic activity,
and biofilm biomass of mixed-species biofilm without inducing
cytotoxicity to hDPCs (human dental pulp cells). Observations such
increased ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels, impaired cell membrane
function, cell apoptosis and reduced expression in several genes seem to
be artifacts of reduced growth and general killing by KI+TBO-aPDT
treatment.DiscussionThese data suggested that KI in combination with
aPDT as an innovative approach to combat S. mutans and C. albicans
biofilm, and thus as an optional treatment for caries.</p>

compound-induced downregulation of antimicrobial resistance and
biofilm-linked genes in wastewater Aeromonas species</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Addressing the global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis requires
a multifaceted innovative approach to mitigate impacts on public health,
healthcare and economic systems. In the complex evolution of AMR,
biofilms and the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs)
play a pivotal role. Aeromonas is a major AMR player that often forms
biofilm, harbors ARGs and is frequently detected in wastewater. Existing
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) do not have the capacity to totally
eliminate antimicrobial-resistant bacteria favoring the evolution of
ARGs in wastewater. Besides facilitating the emergence of AMR, biofilms
contribute significantly to biofouling process within the activated
sludge of WWTP bioreactors. This paper presents the inhibition of
biofilm formation, the expression of biofilm-linked genes and ARGs by
phytochemicals andrographolide, docosanol, lanosterol, quercetin, rutin
and thymohydroquinone. Aeromonas species were isolated and purified from
activated sludge samples. The ARGs were detected in the isolated
Aeromonas species through PCR. Aeromonas biofilms were quantified
following the application of biocompounds through the microtiter plate
assay. qPCR analyses of related genes were done for confirmation.
Findings showed that the natural compounds inhibited the formation of
biofilms and reduced the expression of genes linked to biofilm
production as well as ARGs in wastewater Aeromonas. This indicates the
efficacy of these compounds in targeting and controlling both ARGs and
biofilm formation, highlighting their potential as innovative solutions
for combating antimicrobial resistance and biofouling.</p>

influence of perilipin 5 deficiency on gut microbiome profiles in murine
metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and
MAFLD-hepatocellular carcinoma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMetabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease
(MAFLD) has emerged as the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) worldwide. Over the years, Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) has been recognized
as a key regulator of both MAFLD and HCC development. In our previous
studies we demonstrated that deficiency in Plin5 reduces the severity of
MAFLD and HCC in mice. Interestingly, it has been established that
patients with MAFLD and HCC exhibit various changes in their gut
microbiome profiles. The gut microbiome itself has been shown to play a
role in modulating carcinogenesis and the immune response against
cancer.MethodsTherefore, we conducted a study to investigate the
alterations in fecal microbiome composition in wild type (WT) and
Plin5-deficient (Plin5-/-) mice models of MAFLD and MAFLD-induced HCC
(MAFLD-HCC). We utilized 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to profile
the composition of gut bacteria in fecal samples.ResultsNotably, we
discovered that the absence of Plin5 alone is already associated with
changes in gut microbiota composition. Moreover, feeding the mice a
Western diet (WD) resulted in additional microbial alterations.
Interestingly, Plin5-/- animals exhibited an enrichment of the
beneficial taxa Lactobacillus in both animal models.DiscussionOur
findings identify Plin5 as a major regulator of gut microbiota during
the development of MAFLD and MAFLD-HCC.</p>

cruzi-derived exovesicles contribute to parasite infection, tissue
damage, and apoptotic cell death during ex vivo infection of human
placental explants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, can be
congenitally transmitted by crossing the placental barrier. This study
investigates the role of T. cruzi-derived exovesicles (TcEVs) in
facilitating parasite infection and the consequent tissue damage and
apoptotic cell death in human placental explants (HPEs). Our findings
demonstrate that TcEVs significantly enhance the parasite load and
induce tissue damage in HPEs, both in the presence and absence of the
parasite. Through histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses, we
show that TcEVs alone can disrupt the placental barrier, affecting the
basal membrane and villous stroma. The induction of apoptotic cell death
is evidenced by DNA fragmentation, caspase 8 and 3, and p18 fragment
immunodetection. This damage is exacerbated when TcEVs are combined with
T. cruzi infection. These findings suggest that TcEVs play a critical
role in the pathogenesis of congenital Chagas disease by disrupting the
placental barrier and facilitating parasite transmission to the fetus.
This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of transplacental
transmission of T. cruzi and highlights the potential of targeting TcEVs
as a therapeutic strategy against congenital Chagas disease.</p>

characterization of Neisseria meningitidis isolates recovered from
patients with invasive meningococcal disease in Lithuania</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNeisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative bacterium
responsible for life-threatening invasive infections known as invasive
meningococcal disease and is associated with high fatality rates and
serious lifelong disabilities among survivors.MethodsThis study aimed to
characterize N. meningitidis isolates cultured from blood and
cerebrospinal fluid collected between 2009 and 2021 in Lithuania, assess
their genomic relationships with European strains, and evaluate the
possibility of using a cost-effective method for strain
characterization, thus improving the national molecular surveillance of
invasive meningococcal disease. In total, 321 N. meningitidis isolates
were collected and analyzed using multilocus restriction typing (MLRT).
Amplification of the penA gene and restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis were performed to identify the modified penA
genes. Based on the MLRT genotyping results, we selected 10 strains for
additional analysis using whole-genome sequencing. The sequenced genomes
were incorporated into a dataset of publicly available N. meningitidis
genomes to evaluate genomic diversity and establish phylogenetic
relationships within the Lithuanian and European circulating
strains.ResultsWe identified 83 different strains using MLRT genotyping.
Genomic diversity of N. meningitidis genomes analysed revealed 21
different sequence types (STs) circulating in Lithuania. Among these,
ST34 was the most prevalent. Notably, three isolates displayed unique
combinations of seven housekeeping genes and were identified as novel
STs: ST16969, ST16901, and ST16959. The analyzed strains were found to
possess virulence factors not commonly found in N. meningitidis. Six
distinct penA profiles were identified, each with different frequencies.
In the present study, we also identified N. meningitidis strains with
new penA, NEIS0123, NEIS1320, NEIS1525, NEIS1600, and NEIS1753 loci
variants. In our study, using the cgMLST scheme, Minimum Spanning Tree
(MST) analysis did not identify significant geographic relationships
between Lithuanian N. meningitidis isolates and strains from
Europe.DiscussionDiscussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study
to employ whole genome sequencing (WGS) method for a comprehensive
genetic characterization of invasive N. meningitidis isolates from
Lithuania. This approach provides a more detailed and precise analysis
of genomic relationships and diversity compared to prior studies relying
on traditional molecular typing methods and antigen analysis.</p>

gingivalis triggers microglia activation and neurodegenerative processes
through NOX4</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Periodontitis and infections with periodontal bacteria have been
highlighted as risk factors for dementia. In recent years, attention has
been drawn to the role of microglia cells in neurodegenerative diseases.
However, there is limited knowledge of the influence of periodontal
bacteria on microglia cells. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the interactions between the periodontal bacteria
Porphyromonas gingivalis and microglia cells and to unravel whether
these interactions could contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer’s
disease. We found, through microarray analysis, that stimulation of
microglia cells with P. gingivalis resulted in the upregulation of
several Alzheimer’s disease-associated genes, including NOX4. We also
showed that P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharides (LPS) mediated reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin
8 (IL-8) induction via NOX4 in microglia. The viability of neurons was
shown to be reduced by conditioned media from microglia cells stimulated
with P. gingivalis LPS and the reduction was NOX4 dependent. The levels
of total and phosphorylated tau in neurons were increased by conditioned
media from microglia cells stimulated with P. gingivalis or LPS. This
increase was NOX4-dependent. In summary, our findings provide us with a
potential mechanistic explanation of how the periodontal pathogen P.
gingivalis could trigger or exacerbate AD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundTuberculous meningitis (TBM) with adults Epstein-Barr (EB)
virus encephalitis is a very rare infectious disease, with a high
mortality and disability. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS)
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is highly diagnostic. We report on a case
of severe meningoencephalitis caused by co-infection with mycobacterium
tuberculosis and EB virus. Brain MRI indicated a parenchyma lesion in
the brain. mNGS of CSF indicated Mycobacterium tuberculosis and EB virus
amplification, positive serum EB virus IgG antibodies, and improved
symptoms after anti-tuberculosis and antiviral treatment. A
re-examination of the brain MRI revealed that the significantly
absorption of the lesions.Case reportA 49-year-old male patient
presented with a chief complaint of headache and fever with
consciousness disturbance. The brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a
lesions in the right parenchymal brain with uneven enhancement,
accompanied by significantly increased intracranial pressure, elevated
CSF cell count and protein levels, as well as notably decreased glucose
and chloride levels. mNGS of CSF showed the coexistence of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis and EBV. The patient was diagnosed as TBM with EBV
encephalitis. The patient’s symptoms gradually improved with the active
administration of anti-tuberculosis combined with antiviral agents, the
use of hormones to reduce inflammatory reaction, dehydration to lower
intracranial pressure, and intrathecal injection. Subsequent follow-up
brain magnetic resonance imaging indicated significant absorption of the
lesions, along with a marked decrease in CSF count and protein levels,
as well as obvious increase in glucose and chloride levels.ConclusionTBM
associated with adult EBV encephalitis is extremely rare. The disease’s
early stages are severe and have a high fatality rate. A prompt and
accurate diagnosis is particularly important. NGS of CSF is of great
value for early diagnosis.</p>
