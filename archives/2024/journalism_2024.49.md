## There’s now a way for journalists to verify their Bluesky accounts through their employers (while still keeping control of them)

There would not have been a beginning without them and none of the greatest philosophers, even of the contemporary age, would have managed to develop a single concrete idea, think of Immanuel Kant who still criticized Plato during the period of the Enlightenment (1750).

## This Moment in Time: A Celebration of Ephemerality

At the beginning of the fall term, the Caltech Pond Bridge was transformed by artist Lita Albuquerque into a gold foil installation — the largest she has made to date — dubbed <em>This Moment in Time</em>. It’s part of a larger art exhibit at Caltech called <strong>Crossing Over: Art and Science at Caltech</strong>. Apparently, some people couldn’t wait until December 15th to walk over the bridge, which has been gradually sullied with footprints over the course of the term. This came as somewhat of a disappointment to Albuquerque.

## Judge declares mistrial after hung jury in trial of former UCLA child care teacher

date: 2024-12-03, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)

A judge declared a mistrial Monday after jurors were hung on 11 misdemeanor counts against a former UCLA Early Care and Education Center teacher.
Christopher Rodriguez, the defendant, faced prosecution for sexual battery, false imprisonment, battery, willful cruelty to a child, sexual penetration with foreign object and intimate touch against a person’s will for sexual arousal.&#160;
Following an almost month-long trial, the jury’s foreperson told judge Liliana Gonzalez that further deliberation would be pointless, as the jury would still be hung on all 11 counts against Rodriguez, who worked at various UCLA ECE centers, including the Krieger Center and University Village, for nearly 25 years.&#160;
Rodriguez was arrested in February on five misdemeanor charges and was charged further in May after another child victim reported inappropriate sexual touching at a UCLA ECE classroom.&#160;
[Related: Former UCLA child care teacher charged with sexual battery, cruelty to a child]
The UCLA ECE centers provide care for children ages two months to six years for UCLA-affiliated families.
