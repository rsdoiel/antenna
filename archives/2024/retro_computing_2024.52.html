merry Southern Hemisphere Commodore Christmas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-25, from: Old Ventage Computing Research</p>
<p>A merry Christmas and happy holidays from the Southern Hemisphere,
where it’s my year to be with my wife’s family in regional New South
Wales, Australia. One of my wife’s relatives had an “old Commodore” in
their house and asked if I wanted it. Stupid question, yeah?</p>

So they brought over, in their original boxes, a Commodore 128D (PAL)
with Commodore 1802 monitor, Commodore MPS-1250 dot matrix printer and a
separate box of magazines, circulars and boxed software. Let’s fire it
up!

<p>The magazine and software box was what attracted my eye first,
because a fair bit of it wasn’t anything I’d ordinarily encounter in the
United States. This computer seemed to have been bought relatively late
in the C128 lifecycle based on chip dates (we’ll get to that) and the
magazines correspond to that era, all copies of <i>The Australian
Commodore and Amiga Review</i> published from 1983 to 1996. The issues
here date from</p>
4/89, 5/89, 6/89, 10/89, 11/89, 12/89, 2/90, 3/90, 4/90, 5/90, 6/90,
8/90, 9/90, and the 1990 Annual with an extensive list of Australian
BBSes, software packages and user groups. By this time the Commodore
8-bits were past their prime compared to their 16-bit Amiga brethren,
but there was still some decent coverage of the 64 and 128 in this set.
Unlike most American Commodore magazines, there was little type-in
content, at least in these particular issues; the ones here concentrate
more on reviews and product announcements with sidecar tips and tricks.
<p>
<p>The other bit of literature in the box was a 1987-88 Dick Smith
Electronics catalogue. If you’re on one of the other continents, DSE was
approximately Australia’s equivalent of Radio Shack and at its peak sold
a similar range of rebadged products and electronics. It is likewise no
more (shut down in 2016), though its name lives on as a zombie Kogan
brand; today its closest domestic equivalent would probably be
Jaycar.</p>

<p>Like Tandy Radio Shack, Dick Smith’s typical MO was to rebadge
existing products rather than engineer new ones if the company could
possibly avoid it. Dick Smith’s computer and computer-adjacent selection
around this time included a smattering of relabeled VTech computers and
toys such as the
<a href="/2021/03/those-mysterious-toshiba-t-chips-plus.html">Type-right</a>
and Whiz Kid.</p>

<p>However, DSE also sold a number of Sharp pocket computers directly as
Sharp systems (unlike Tandy, which
<a href="https://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/tpm/">rebadged them
also</a>). The PC-1360 and PC-1401 were more advanced than Tandy’s Sharp
rebadges, but they did include the lowend PC-1246 (Tandy PC-8, which
avoided being the worst Tandy Pocket Computer ever because of the
execrable PC-7) and even lower-end PC-1100, a flip-face unit that had a
narrower but 2-row display and basic organizer functions, and sold for
more likely because of it. DSE also sold the excellent Sharp CE-126P, a
lovely device that combines a thermal printer and cassette interface yet
does not rely on the sure-to-fail NiCad batteries other such peripherals
did to their detriment. Tandy never sold this unit, rebadged or
otherwise.</p>

Like Tandy, DSE also had several distinct house lines of computers,
though also like Radio Shack by now the PCs were taking over.
<em>Unlike</em> Tandy, though, DSE simply chose to rebadge other PC
systems instead of creating its own like the Tandy 1000 series. At least
initially their PCs came from a Taiwanese company called Multitech,
which started in 1979 selling their Z80-based “MicroProfessor” MPF-I SBC
and later two Apple II clones, the MPF-II and MPF-III. These clones were
especially notable for their onboard Chinese language support, drawing
characters in high-resolution graphics and as such completely omitting
the Apple II’s text mode. Subsequently Multitech started producing PC
clones in 1984 with the MPF-PC-XT, and over several years served as a PC
OEM for many diverse companies such as Texas Instruments. The clones
shown here (the 8088-based PC500 and PC700, and the AT-class 80286
PC900) may have been some of the last to bear the Multitech name because
after failing to land a large contract with a German firm, company head
Stan Shih decided he’d had enough and retooled the company to start
selling their own PCs under their own brand in 1987. He chose a new name
for the company, too: Acer.
<p>
<p>But just like the Tandy Color Computers, Dick Smith was still selling
their range of 8-bit home computers as well in those days. The last of
this line was the Z80-based VZ300, yet another VTech rebadge, and had a
whole assortment of peripherals including memory expansion, floppy disk
drive (three times the cost of the computer), and interfaces for the
joysticks, cassette, printer and disk drive — which was sold separately
from the disk drive! I have a VZ300 and some upgrades I need to finish
building which will be <a href="/search/label/dick%20smith">in a future
article</a>.</p>

<p>The boxed software assortment was more typical and almost all of
these would be known to a Stateside audience. The previous owner really
liked his MicroProse games, so there was Gunship, Red Storm Rising and
Airborne Ranger; from Activision was Fighter Bomber, Big Trouble in
Little China, The Last Ninja, Galactic Games, X-15 Alpha Mission,
Labyrinth and Firetrap; and also Berkeley Softworks’ GEOS 128,
Broderbund’s The Print Shop and Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego?
(complete with its 1989 World Almanac), Commodore’s own Word
Machine/Name Machine and rebranded copy of Arktronics’ Jane 128, and
finally Maths Mania and Let’s Make Greeting Cards.</p>

<p>Several of these boxed items, however, show Australia-specific labels
and packaging. Questor was a major NSW games distributor for Activision,
Broderbund, Telecomsoft (Rainbird/Firebird), MicroProse and
Mastertronic, and the six game pack shown here was a Questor-specific
budget special. However, Dataflow Computer Services Pty Ltd (also NSW)
had distribution rights for Broderbund’s educational and productivity
software, so The Print Shop and Carmen Sandiego came through them. Maths
Mania was apparently an Irish package redistributed by Pactronics Pty
Ltd in NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia.</p>

<p>Also in the documentation was a small Commodore product circular and
a software-of-the-month membership card, which I’ve covered over the
address on since the prior owner is still living there. On the back we
see advertisements for the MPS-1250 printer, sold for AUD$525, or in
2024 Australian dollars about A$1400 (roughly US$875 at today’s spot
rate); the 1802 monitor, a rebadge of the cursed and poor quality CM-141
which we had the displeasure to have owned until it crapped out, offered
at A$499 [A$1325, US$825]; and the deluxe 1084 monitor suitable for the
Amiga, 64, 128 and CGA PCs at A$699 [A$1850, US$1150]. Notice the 1802
and MPS-1250 are exactly the peripherals we have here!</p>

<p>Australia’s Commodore pitchman at the time was John Laws, who by then
was probably close to 50 years into his 71 years of national
broadcasting. Best known for his extensive presence in talkback radio
(talk radio to American audiences), he also endorsed products as diverse
as Valvoline motor oil (“Valvoline, you know what I mean”) and Oral-B
toothbrushes. In his hand here he holds a Commodore credit card. He
retired from his final posting at 2SM in Sydney about a month ago

<p>Three special combo packs were advertised inside the circular. The
premier one was of course the Amiga 500 Pack, provided with 512K RAM,
Textcraft Plus and an A520 RF modulator. This sold for A$999 [A$2650,
US$1650]. Despite Commodore’s best efforts, though, its financial anchor
continued to be the computer it was trying its hardest to kill off: the
C64. The Commodore Pro Pack had a Commodore 64, 1541 disk drive, GEOS,
joystick, and 15 educational, games and utility programs for A$699
[A$1850, US$1150]. A second “Pro Pack Plus” added an MCS-810 printer,
1351 mouse (for which GEOS had a driver) and ten more software packages
for an additional A$499 [A$1325, US$825].</p>

<p>The membership card was for the Island By Mail Software Club, out of
Werribee, Victoria, which in addition to member hardware sales provided
public domain software on floppy disk and a catalogue, also on floppy
disk. I’ll likely end up imaging some of these. A number of Ocean
Software games like Total Recall, Golden Axe and Super Off Road were on
separate floppies in the disk box plus an Atarisoft Battlezone
cartridge.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this machine, printer, monitor, main system and
keyboard alike, apparently spent a lot of time in the NSW sun because it
ended up jaundice yellow — the disk drive lever was up long enough that
the only beige portion of the front case was what it was covering. I
sense some Retr0brighting in this system’s future.</p>

<p>The monitor powered on (I’ll get to the printer in a moment) and I
decided to bring it up in 128 mode first. Unfortunately there are
several obvious defects: the text colour is wrong — it should be light
green, like the border — and the characters are flickering with other
darker colours, and there is no <tt>READY.</tt> prompt because the
computer can’t boot from its internal disk drive. The drive activity
light never turns on and the drive motor never turns off.</p>

<p>It has the same problem as 128 mode although the character colour at
least matches the correct colour part of the time. We’re dealing with
either a VIC-IIe fault or colour RAM problem, but by this point I was
leaning towards the latter since most of the system is working and a
failure in the VIC would likely prevent starting up at all.</p>

<p>Overview of the mainboard. This “128D” is in fact a 128DCR too. Aside
from a couple completely unsurprising cobwebs the board appears intact
without obvious physical damage or deficiency. The colour RAM here is
the M2128-15 at U19. This is unfortunately soldered to the board and not
socketed, as most of the parts are. The disk drive issue could be either
CIA 6526 #2 or some failure in the internal 1571.</p>

<p>For the disk drive problem, we need to see whether it can talk over
the IEC serial bus at all, so let’s get out the printer. The printer has
suffered the same leptospirotic fate as the other components of the
system but it does power on and it does pass its internal self-test
(hold down LF when turning it on). It doesn’t actually print anything on
the paper but you won’t be surprised to hear the ribbon’s as long gone
as Menzies and I think its electronics are just fine.</p>

Hooking it up to the 128DCR, the printer receives no data, and the
machine freezes accessing it as well. This doesn’t exonerate the disk
drive as a factor, but I think we’d need to start with replacing CIA #2
at U4 and then see where we’re at. If it still freezes then I’d wonder
about the internal 1571’s processor (the 6502AD at U101) or one of its
6522A VIAs at U106 or U104. One possible way to temporarily deal with
the problem is disabling power to the internal drive and hooking up an
external one.
<p>
<p>I don’t have any of these chips here and I don’t even have a proper
soldering iron available on this side of the Pacific, so this will be a
restoration for another day while I get everything together. But it was
fun looking at the software and magazines, and I think this machine is
eminently repairable. <a href="/search/label/refurb%20weekend">To be

I haven’t blogged about World of Commodore since 2019. Now, to be fair,
we did have a worldwide pandemic between then and now. In 2020 there was
no in-person event. Maybe it happened online, but I didn’t participate.
In 2021 World of Commodore happened again in the flesh, but we were all
masked up. I don’t remember much about that event. I did take lots of
photos, but I can only assume that attendance was low. I think they did
the show via Zoom in parallel with the in-person event. At this time,
C64 OS had not yet made its v1.0 debut. I was very busy preparing for
the release though. Instead of blogging I was writing the User’s Guide
both printed and digital, and trying to finish everything up in the
following 6 months. By the time 2022 rolled around, I had released C64
OS just a couple of months earlier, and my life and time availability
had been completely deranged. That was one of the busiest times I’ve
ever experienced. I was making sales every few minutes. I had a huge

</h2>
<p>
For centuries, many cultures have used heated tables for thermal comfort
in cold weather. Examples are the “kotatsu” in Japan, the “korsi” in the
Middle East, and the “brasero de picon” in Spain. A heat source goes
under a table, a blanket goes over it, and people slide their legs
underneath. The micro-climate under the blanket keeps you comfortable,
even though the space in which you find yourself is cold.
</p>
<p>
The heated table is an excellent example of our ancestors’
energy-efficient way of warming:
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/12/thematic-book-series-heating-people-not-spaces/">heating
people, not spaces</a>. Historically, glowing charcoal from the
fireplace heated the space under the table. While that provided
sufficient warmth, it also carried a significant risk of fire and carbon
monoxide poisoning. Nowadays, we can use electric heating technology
instead. For example, the Japanese kotatsu is still in use, but it’s now
working with a small electric heater fixed under the table surface.
</p>
<p>
In this manual, I will walk you through the making of an electrically
heated work desk for one person. I have built the table for myself in
the co-working space in Barcelona where I have my office now. The
building, an old industrial warehouse, has very high ceilings, no
insulation, and little sun in winter. It can get very cold here and
conventional heating systems don’t work. My heated table turns out to be
a perfect solution. I can power it with a solar panel, a wind turbine, a
bike generator, or a battery. I can also plug it into the power grid.

<p>
A heated table offers exceptional comfort. The lower part of your body
gets immersed in heat as if you are baking in the sun or sitting in a
hot bath. The warmth quickly spreads to the rest of your body through
the bloodstream.
</p>
<p>
During a week of experiments in December 2024, with indoor air
temperatures of 12-14°C (53-57°F), I recorded very low energy use for my
freshly built heated table: between 50 and 75 watt-hours per hour.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Compare that to a conventional electric portable heater, which easily
consumes 1,500 watt-hours per hour (and does not guarantee thermal
comfort). My heated table uses as little electricity as charging a
laptop or heating two liters of water for a
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/01/the-revenge-of-the-hot-water-bottle/">hot
water bottle</a> (58 watt-hours per hour, assuming you reheat the water
every two hours).
</p>
<p>
It takes about 15 minutes before the heat effect of the table becomes
noticeable, one hour before it heats at full power, and two hours before
it reaches its maximum energy efficiency. Energy use drops from 75
watt-hours in the first hour to between 50 and 60 watt-hours in the
third hour, as the thermostat turns off the heating more often. The
system accumulates heat in the carpet, the blankets, the table, and the
human body. If you turn it off after three hours, walk away, come back
30 minutes later, and turn it on again, the table is heating at maximum
capacity within 10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
Building an electrically heated table is quite a simple project, which
requires few technical skills and little time. Once you get all the
parts together, you can assemble a heated table in a few hours. The
costs are limited, too.
<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The construction process consists of three parts: wiring the electrical
system, programming the thermostat, and getting the textile layers and
insulation right.

</h2>
<p>
This manual concerns a table for only one person - my writing desk.
Unlike the Japanese and Middle Eastern examples, my table is adapted to
a Western-style sitting position: not on the floor but on a chair. You
can turn any table into a personal heat source, but some are better
suited than others. Most importantly, you should be able to screw a flat
heating foil (step 2) under the table. However, structural elements may
complicate that, as is the case for my table (see the image below).
</p>

<p>
I solved this by installing the heating foil on a thin wooden board
which I then screwed against the supporting elements. However, for some
other tables, this may not work. Choose a wooden table. Wood insulates
relatively well, so a wooden table top already provides some of the
insulation you need to maximize heat production. It’s easy to screw
things onto a wooden table as well.
</p>
<p>
You can build a larger heated table that can seat more people, but in
that case, you will have to connect several heating foils (step 2) and
stitch several blankets (step 8) together. Low-tech Magazine will build
a large heated table for several people
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about/events/">during a
workshop in Barcelona on January 25, 2025</a>.

<span id="step2">Step 2: Choose your heating element</span>

<p>
In principle, any electric heating device can power a heated table.
However, because a heated and insulated table is so energy efficient,
you need an electric heater with a very low power use. The average
portable electric heater is way too powerful for our purpose. Due to its
high surface temperature, it could also cause burns or provoke a fire
when you put it under a table.
</p>
<h3 id="carbon-heating-film">
Carbon heating film
</h3>
<p>
The best heating element for an electrically heated table - and the one
I am using in this manual - is carbon or infrared heating film. These
very thin heating foils are primarily meant for electric floor and wall
heating in buildings and vehicles, for protecting batteries or water
tanks against the cold, or for warming beehives and terrariums. Infrared
heating films are low-temperature, large-surface heaters, so there’s no
risk of burns or fire through direct contact with skin or clothes. They
are meant to operate at a maximum temperature of 40-45°C (104-113°F).

</div>
</div>
<h3 id="voltage">
Voltage
</h3>
<p>
Carbon heating foils come in different voltages: 12V, 24V, and 110/220V.
I chose a 12V heating foil to make my table compatible with my
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/12/how-to-build-a-small-solar-power-system/">12V
solar installations</a> and
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/03/how-to-build-a-practical-household-bike-generator/">bike
generator</a>. If you have a 24V renewable power system, opt for a 24V
heating foil.
</p>
<p>
If you want to plug the table into a wall socket, using mains power,
there are two options. First, you could buy a 110V/220V heating foil,
add a compatible plug, and connect it directly to the power socket.
However, you really need to know what you are doing, because such high
voltages carry the risk of electrocution. A safer DIY option is to use a
12V or 24V heat foil connected to a
<a href="https://meishile.co">universal power adapter</a> that steps
down the voltage from 220V to 12 or 24V (comparable to the charger of a
laptop). That is how I tested the table because I don’t have solar
panels in my new office yet.
</p>
<h3 id="size">
Size
</h3>
<p>
Carbon heating film is available in different widths, for example, 20,
30, or 50 cm. You can buy it per running meter, and it’s flexible enough
to be rolled up tightly for transport and storage. You can cut the foils
to size in length at certain intervals. They have electric cables
soldered to the positive and negative terminals, ready to plug into the
power source. However, if you cut the foil into pieces, you will need to
solder cables to all the new pieces. You can connect carbon heating
foils in parallel, operated by only one thermostat (step 3). My table
only has one heating foil, cut to size.
</p>
<h3 id="power-use">
Power use
</h3>
<p>
The power use of carbon heating foils - expressed in watts per square
meter (W/m2) - varies because of two factors. First, heating foils are
sold with different power outputs, mostly between 100 and 250 W/m2.
Second, there’s size. If your 1m2 carbon foil reads 130 W/m2 and you cut
it in half, then 0.5 square meters of heat foil will demand 65 watts. My
table’s infrared heating film has a power use of 220W/m2. I first used
0.375 m2 of heating foil (50x70cm), resulting in a power use of about
82.5 watts. Then I cut off a centimeter to make it fit better under the
table, and as a result power use dropped to roughly 75 watts.
</p>
<h2 id="span-idstep3step-3-choose-your-thermostatspan">
<span id="step3">Step 3: Choose your thermostat</span>
</h2>
<p>
You should only operate a carbon heating film with a thermostat. Without
a thermostat, a heating foil could overheat and get damaged or cause
fire. A thermostat also provides a stable comfort zone under the table.
The thermostat turns the heater off when it reaches a set maximum
temperature, and turns it back on when the temperature drops a few
degrees lower.
</p>
<p>
The thermostat voltage must match the heating film voltage: if you have
a 12V heating foil, you need a 12V thermostat. If you have a 24V heating
film, get a 24V thermostat. The thermostat I use for my table is the
W3230 DC 12V. It’s a widely sold device for all kinds of purposes. You
need to wire the thermostat and set the temperature.
</p>
<h2 id="span-idstep4step-4-wire-everything-togetherspan">
<span id="step4">Step 4: Wire everything together</span>
</h2>
<p>
The thermostat is connected between the heating foil and the power
source, as shown in the illustration below. The wiring may be different
for other thermostat models.

them. Infrared heating foils are sold with thick electric cables
included, and they are often much longer than you need them to be. You
can cut them shorter and use the rest to wire the whole system. If you
want to use other cables, then use a multimeter to measure the current
that the heating film draws. For example, my 12V heat foil requires 6.6
Amps, so my cables - in the complete circuit - should have a conductor
cross-section of at least 2.63 mm2 (that’s 13 AWG gauge,
<a href="https://www.powerstream.com/Wire_Size.htm">check this
chart</a>).
</p>
<h3 id="fuse">
Fuse
</h3>
<p>
Any electrical system needs fuses for safety. Once you have cut your
heating film to size, measure how much current runs through it. Next,
install a fuse that is slightly above that value. My table uses 6.6 amps
and I added an 8A fuse.

Switch
</h3>
<p>
You can
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/03/how-to-build-a-practical-household-bike-generator/#wires">add
an off-on switch in your circuit</a> to turn your heated table on and
off. Use one that has a light indicator, so that you don’t forget to
stop the heating system when you leave. You could also install a motion
sensor under the table. That said, if you have wired your system
correctly, used the right cable thickness, and added a fuse, leaving it
on accidentally will not cause any safety problems.
</p>
<h3 id="temperature-sensor">
Temperature sensor
</h3>
<p>
The thermostat comes with a temperature sensor that you should install
between the heating foil and the table (touching the heating foil). Make
sure to fix this sensor securely, as it is essential to the proper and
safe functioning of the heating system.
</p>
<h3 id="where-does-the-thermostat-go">
Where does the thermostat go?
</h3>
<p>
Before you start wiring the system, decide where your thermostat goes,
because it will determine the length of the cables you need. I have my
thermostat installed under the table, hidden under the blankets. Once
programmed, there’s no need to access it regularly (see further). Having
the thermostat on top of the table means that you need a hole in your
blanket for all the cables to go through. It also complicates the adding
and removing of blankets.

<span id="step5">Step 5: Program the thermostat</span>
</h2>
<p>
To program the thermostat, connect it to the power source. First, select
the “heating” function. My thermostat’s default setting was “cooling”
and I struggled to make it work at first. Here’s the steps to follow:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Press and hold “set” to enter the code setting menu.
</li>
<li>
Press up or down to select “P0”.
</li>
<li>
Press “set” again to enter the code setting
</li>
<li>
Press up or down to select “H”
</li>
<li>
Wait 3 seconds and the setting is saved.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Next, you set the temperature at which you want the thermostat to turn
the heat foil off. Heat foil manufacturers advise 40-45°C (104-113°F)
during sustained use. Here’s what to do:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Short press “set” and the blue number will start blinking.
</li>
<li>
Press up or down to select the maximum temperature you want
</li>
<li>
Wait 3 seconds, and the setting is saved.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can leave all other functions of the thermostat untouched.

<h2 id="span-idinsulatinginsulating-the-tablespan">
<span id="insulating">Insulating the table</span>
</h2>
<p>
To build a comfortable and energy-efficient heated table, you need to
understand that a carbon heating film emits heat on both sides. If you
simply attach it under a table it does not get warmer than 30°C, which
will not improve thermal comfort in a significant way. It’s only when
the heating surpasses skin temperature (around 35°C/95°F) and core body
temperature (37°C/99°F) that you start feeling the warmth radiating
towards you.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To reach sufficiently high temperatures, you need to cover one side of
the heating foil with heat-insulating material.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To reach sufficiently high temperatures, you need to cover one side of
the heating foil with heat-insulating material. That will force most of
the heat output to the other side - the side that radiates energy
towards your body. The carbon heat film for a heated table is placed
below the tabletop, radiating heat downwards, and so the insulation goes
on top.
<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
It consists of the wood table top, one or more blankets, and any
additional insulation material that you add to the table surface.
</p>
<p>
When carbon heating films are used as floor heating, the insulation is
below. The upper side needs to be protected by a material that is strong
and easily radiates heat, such as ceramic tile. However, when you build
an electrically heated table with the foil radiating heat downwards,
there’s no need to protect the exposed side. It can be touched safely
and nobody is walking on it.
</p>
<h2 id="span-idstep6step-6-insulate-the-heat-foilspan">
<span id="step6">Step 6: Insulate the heat foil</span>
</h2>
<p>
To improve the heat output of the infrared heating film, I have added 3
cm of cork insulation in the space between the foil and the table
surface. I have not done any tests without the cork layer, but I am
confident that the energy efficiency and thermal comfort of my table
would not have been so excellent if it would not have been there. Other
suitable natural insulation materials are wool, cellulose, wood fibers,
hemp, and flax. You could also try radiator heat reflector foil.
</p>
<h2 id="span-idstep7step-7-get-a-carpetspan">
<span id="step7">Step 7: Get a carpet</span>
</h2>
<p>
If you put an electrically heated table on a cold floor, you will not be
comfortable. The cold floor will suck up all the heat from the carbon
heat foil, and your feet will conduct warmth to the floor. You need to
insulate the floor, and you can do that with a wool carpet (or several
wool carpets on top of each other). New wool carpets are expensive, but
they don’t need to be much larger than the table and they can be found
cheap second-hand. I got the very large Persian-style wool rug in my
office for 50 euros, and I will add a second one on top to further
improve the floor insulation.
</p>
<h2 id="span-idstep8step-8-find-your-blanketsspan">
<span id="step8">Step 8: Find your blankets</span>
</h2>
<p>
The energy efficiency and thermal comfort of an electrically heated
table are in large part determined by the type and size of the blankets
you put over it. The blankets form part of the heat film insulation
layer, but if they are long enough to reach the ground they also trap
warm air under the table.
</p>
<p>
Radiant heating systems transfer energy to surfaces - including your
body - and
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/02/restoring-the-old-way-of-warming-heating-people-not-places/">do
not warm up the air directly</a>. However, the air temperature under the
table will slowly increase indirectly due to the higher surface
temperatures of the blankets, the table, the carpet, and the person who
sits at the table. During the experiments, the air temperature below my
table at 25 cm above the floor increased by about 10°C (18°F).

<h3 id="wool">
Wool
</h3>
<p>
Choose a wool blanket. Wool traps heat very efficienctly, is much more
flame-resistant than other textile materials, doesn’t get dirty or
smelly easily, regulates humidity, and purifies the air.
<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
New wool blankets can be pricey at hundreds of euros for the size we
need. However, I purchased four second-hand wool blankets for 90 euros,
two of them large enough to reach the ground. If you find a wool blanket
that is ugly or stained, simply layer it with a nicer and cheaper cotton
blanket.
</p>
<h3 id="blanket-size">
Blanket size
</h3>
<p>
The size of the blanket you need depends on the size of your table
(length, width, height). My table measures 80 cm long, 56 cm wide, and
75 cm high. That means that my blanket should measure at least 230 cm
(75+80+75cm) x 206 cm (75+56+75cm) to reach the ground. Can’t find a
blanket that is large enough? You could build a lower heated table and
sit on the ground, or you could sew several smaller blankets together.
Smaller blankets can also be useful in combination with larger blankets,
or they can serve as the only blanket when it’s not so cold (see
further).
</p>
<h3 id="work-surface">
Work surface
</h3>
<p>
Although it feels nice to work on a wool or cotton surface in winter,
you can also put a wooden board on top of the blanket, cut to size, in
order to protect the blanket from wear and dirt. Or, you drape a cotton
tablecloth over the blanket, which is easier to wash than wool.

<p>
Any heating system must be able to be adjusted to achieve the desired
comfort. For a central heating system, that happens by manipulating the
thermostat. However, that doesn’t work so well for a heated table,
because the temperature range of the carbon heating film is limited.
Going below 38°C (100°F) will not provide a pleasant sensation of
warmth, while prolonged heating above 45°C (113°F) may damage the
heating film and make it too hot to touch. However, you can adjust
thermal comfort in a wide range of air temperatures by “dressing” and
“undressing” the table: by adding and removing textile layers, and by
using them in different ways.
</p>

It’s not an exaggeration to say that the blanket becomes part of your
clothing. Sitting at the table feels like wearing a very large dress
that is heated from the inside. Just like we dress differently depending
on the weather, adding and removing layers, the number of blankets, and
how they are positioned can reflect the environmental conditions. I have
tested the table with one to four blankets, and with every extra blanket
energy efficiency and thermal comfort increase. On a very cold day, you
could add two or three blankets hanging down the table. If you are still
cold, you could drape extra blankets over your chair and shoulders. You
could end up in a complete tent, heated from the inside, with just your
head and arms sticking out.

However, as you add more blankets, the textile layer becomes
increasingly heavy, and it takes more time to get in and out - to
“dress” and “undress”. Consequently, a lighter cover is preferable if it
provides sufficient comfort. On a chilly spring evening, one or two
shorter blankets may be sufficient to keep you comfortable. I have
tested the table like that and it did almost as good as with a large
blanket. Energy use was somewhat higher and thermal comfort somewhat
lower - I especially noted cold feet. However, should it be a bit
warmer, I would prefer this setup because it’s more practical to get up
from the desk.
</p>
<p>
Overheating can be solved without reaching for the thermostat as well:
lift a corner of the carpet with your foot and let some heat escape, or
remove one of the blankets. It would be more energy-efficient to turn
down the thermostat, but the energy use of a heated table is already so
low that there is room for some convenience. The comfort of a heated
table can be further improved by a heated chair or bench, or by putting
a screen behind your chair, covered with heat foil on one side and with
insulation on the other side. That’s something for a future manual.

While an electrically heated table is much safer than a table heated by
fire, it does entail some risks, including a fire. However, this can
only happen when you ignore some crucial rules, which I repeat below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do not put a powerful electric space heater under a table with blanket.
</li>
<li>
Never operate a radiant heating foil without a thermostat.
</li>
<li>
Make sure your electric cables are thick enough.
</li>
<li>
Add a fuse to your electrical system.
</li>
<li>
Fix the temperature sensor securely: it should always stay in place.
</li>
<li>
Avoid blankets and carpets made of synthetic fibers, which are highly
flammable. Your heated table won’t catch fire if you follow the advice
above, but a fire can start elsewhere in the space. The best material
for blankets and carpets is wool, which does not catch fire. Cotton is
flammable, but it’s not as bad as synthetic material.
</li>
<li>
Long blankets are more energy efficient than shorter blankets. However,
watch out with too long blankets because they can make you trip when you
get in or out of the table.

I did all tests at a maximum thermostat temperature of 44.5 degrees
Celsius (112°F). Energy will be lower if you use a lower temperature
setting. Apart from measuring energy use and temperatures, I noted my
thermal comfort. I was sitting at the table wearing leather shoes, a
thick layer of merino wool thermal underclothing, and thin work clothes
above that. I did computer work. I did tests with an insulation of one
to four blankets. The energy use and performance of your heated table
may differ from mine. The energy use depends on the size and power of
the heat source (step 2), the thermostat settings (step 4), the
heat-insulating value of the blankets (step 8) and the carpet (step 7),
the heat source insulation (step 6), and the table surface (step 1). As
you add more heat insulation, the thermostat will turn off the heating
source more often and for longer, resulting in lower energy use. The
same happens when you set a lower maximum thermostat
setting. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>
Not accounting for the cost of a table or a carpet - things that are
likely already around - you can build a one-person electrically heated
table for less than 100 euros. Here are the costs for my table: 35 euros
for the heating foil (I bought 2 meters for 75 euros and cut the roll to
about half the size), 10 euros for the thermostat, 30 euros of cork
insulation, and 40 euros for the second-hand “double” green wool blanket
that is very large and thick. Total = 115 euros. I bought four other
cheap second-hand blankets, all in an excellent state. You can spend
hundreds or even thousands of euros on exquisite wool blankets if you
have deep pockets. The costs (and the building time) increase as the
table gets larger because there is more heating foil and insulation to
add. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>
</p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>
Don’t make the mistake of putting the heat foil on the floor, radiating
heat upwards to the table. Radiant heat sources don’t work by heating
the air but by directly transmitting energy to your body. If energy
radiates downwards, it will reach your thighs, knees, lower legs, and
feet. In contrast, if the radiant energy comes from below, the bottom of
the chair blocks most of it. Only your feet are directly exposed, but
they will only be warmed when taking off your shoes. You also need to
insulate the space below the heating foil and protect the top of the
carbon heating film against damage, complicating the building
process. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>
