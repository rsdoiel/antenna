<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Intriguing Dresden, Germany, winds up on far fewer American itineraries than it deserves to. Don&amp;#8217;t make that mistake. Since its horrific firebombing in World War II, the city has transitioned to a thriving cultural center that&amp;#8217;s well worth a visit. Even with only a day to spare, Dresden is a doable side trip from bigger attractions like Berlin or Prague.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Lawyers can own law firms. Bankers can own banks. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, doctors are effectively banned from owning hospitals. At a time when the rapidly consolidating hospital market needs more competition, not less, keeping this poorly conceived provision on the books makes little sense. Congress should repeal it. &lt;/p&gt;
