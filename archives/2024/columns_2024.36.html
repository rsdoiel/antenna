</div>
The basic aspiration of the <a href="https://lockss.org/">LOCKSS
Program</a> when we
<a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2013/10/it-was-fifteen-years-ago-today.html">started
a quarter century ago</a> was to enable libraries to continue their
historical mission of collecting, preserving, and providing readers with
access to academic journals. In the paper world libraries which
subscribed to a journal <i>owned</i> a copy; in the digital world they
could only <i>rent</i> access to the publisher’s copy. This allowed the
oligoply academic publishers to increase their rent extraction from
research and education budgets.<br /> <br /> LOCKSS provided a cheap way
for libraries to collect, preserve and provide access to their own copy
of journals. The competing e-journal preservation systems accepted the
idea of rental; they provided an alternate place from which access could
be rented if it were denied by the publisher.<br /> <br /> Similarly,
libraries that purchased a paper book <i>owned</i> a copy that they
could loan to readers. The transition to e-books meant that they were
only able to <i>rent</i> access to the publisher’s copy, and over time
the terms of this rental grew more and more onerous.<br /> <br /> Below
the fold I look into a recent effort to mitigate this problem.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Gennie Gebhart’s 2019
<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/publishers-should-be-making-e-book-licensing-better-not-worse"><i>Publishers
Should be Making E-Book Licensing Better, Not Worse</i></a> reports on
another turn of the e-book rental screw:<br />
<blockquote>
When Macmillan releases a new book, library systems will be able to
purchase only one digital copy for the first eight weeks after it’s
published. Macmillan is offering this initial copy for half-price ($30),
but that has not taken away the sting for librarians who will need to
answer to frustrated users. In large library systems in particular,
readers are likely to experience even longer hold queues for new
Macmillan e-book releases. For example, under the new Macmillan embargo,
the 27 branches of the San Francisco Public Library system, serving a
city of nearly 900,000 people, will have to share one single copy right
when the demand for the new title is the greatest.<br /> …<br /> After
the two-month embargo period ends, libraries will be welcome to purchase
additional copies of the e-book under normal terms, which aren’t great
to begin with: typically, a $60 price tag for an e-book that can only be
lent out to one user at a time for two years or 52 lends, whichever
comes first. After that, the library has to license another e-book.
</blockquote>
Gebhart’s use of “purchase” here is misleading, they are signing a
two-year lease. Macmillian can make life miserable for libraries and
their readers because they are
“<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/">too
big to care</a>”. Gebhart
<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/publishers-should-be-making-e-book-licensing-better-not-worse">explains</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In a July

CEO John Sargent says the publisher’s move is motivated by “growing

need to “protect the value of your books during their first format
publication,” but fails to present any evidence to back up his claims.

</blockquote>
On 13<sup>the</sup> August, the Independent Publishers Group and the
Digital Public Library of America
<a href="https://dp.la/news/groundbreaking-ebook-agreement?mc_cid=b690d51703">announced
a deal</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Through this landmark collaboration between IPG and DPLA, libraries
around the country will now have the power to purchase and own in
perpetuity, rather than merely license, tens of thousands of ebook and
audiobook titles from dozens of independent publishers. The agreement
will empower libraries to fulfill their mission to provide access to
books for readers nationwide. Publishers such as Austin Macauley,
Arcadia Publishing, Dynamite Entertainment, Dover Publications and JMS
Books, alongside dozens of other renowned indie publishers, are
participating in the deal.
</blockquote>
Of course, none of the major publishers would agree to this. The
<a href="https://dp.la/news/groundbreaking-ebook-agreement?mc_cid=b690d51703">press
release</a> explains:<br />
<blockquote>
Now, libraries will be able to purchase books through the Palace
Marketplace, a non-profit ebook and audiobook platform developed by The
Palace Project in consultation with libraries, for libraries. The Palace
Project provides libraries with tools and resources that allows patrons
to access the broadest possible range of ebooks and audiobooks sourced
from the widest variety of sources. Among the tens of thousands of books
that are now available for libraries to own and lend out digitally are
contemporary award-winning titles, like Leticia Aguilar’s spellbinding
memoir <i>Leaving Patriarchy Behind</i>, Michael Nicholson’s <i>The
Mosaic Escalator</i>, a mind-bending adventure story nominated for the
Best Fiction Book Award by the Golden Book Awards 2024, as well as
classics like Elizabeth Bowen’s debut novel <i>The Hotel</i>.<br />
…<br /> “After more than 12 years explaining to policy makers and
publishers why existing license models for ebooks prevent libraries from
fulfilling their mandates, this agreement is a win that libraries,
publishers and authors should celebrate together,” said <b>Christina de
Castell, Chief Librarian &amp; CEO of the Vancouver Public Library</b>.
“Now, libraries will be able to take steps to share and preserve
authors’ ebooks as we have always shared and preserved their print
books. I hope this agreement is a model that leads other publishers
towards more flexible licensing terms, so libraries can continue to be
the home for our collective knowledge in our increasingly digital
world.”
</blockquote>
Details of how the technology works are scarce, although the Palace code
is on <a href="https://github.com/ThePalaceProject">github</a>. The
DPLA’s <a href="https://ebooks.dp.la/"><i>Everyone should have access to
knowledge</i></a> claims:<br />
<blockquote>
<a href="http://exchange.dp.la/">Palace Marketplace</a>, formerly DPLA
Exchange, is an e-content acquisitions platform that works seamlessly
with the <a href="http://thepalaceproject.org/">Palace app</a>. With
Palace Marketplace, libraries can customize diverse collections beyond
the bestsellers, including non-English titles. Member libraries benefit
from DPLA’s ongoing publisher negotiations for new, more favorable
licensing terms, and have access to our collection of more than 11,000
open access ebooks.
</blockquote>
So it appears that “members” have access to books they “purchased”
hosted at DPLA. Once again, as with e-journal preservation systems such
as Portico, this is a welcome development but it isn’t a solution to the
underlying problem. It is in fact another instance of the same problem,
because the member libraries are renting access to DPLA’s copy. As I
understand it, these libraries would be able to download a copy, and
preserve it themselves outside the Palace ecosystem, but it isn’t clear
whether the terms of use would allow them to provide their readers
access to the preserved copy.<br /> <br /> The key barrier to
implementing true “purchase” rather than “rental” is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine">First-sale
Doctrine</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The first-sale doctrine (also sometimes referred to as the “right of
first sale” or the “first sale rule”) is an American legal concept that
limits the rights of an intellectual property owner to control resale of
products embodying its intellectual property. The doctrine enables the
distribution chain of copyrighted products, library lending, giving,
video rentals and secondary markets for copyrighted works (for example,
enabling individuals to sell their legally purchased books or CDs to
others).
</blockquote>
But it doesn’t apply to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine#Application_to_digital_copies">digital
copies</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The first-sale doctrine does not neatly fit transfers of copies of
digital works because an actual transfer does not actually
happen—instead, the recipient receives a new copy of the work while, at
the same time, the sender has the original copy (unless that copy is
deleted, either automatically or manually). …<br /> <br /> E-books have
the same issue. Because the first sale doctrine does not apply to
electronic books, libraries cannot freely lend e-books indefinitely
after purchase. Instead, electronic book publishers came up with
business models to sell the subscriptions to the license of the text.
</blockquote>
Mary Minow’s 2017
<a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/2017/02/19/future-libraries-need-first-sale-ebooks/"><i>Future
of Libraries – Need First Sale for ebooks</i></a> explains the
importance of first sale for libraries:<br />
<blockquote>
It is essential to libraries, and the term existential would not be too
great a term to use, to be able to own digital files, and care for them
via preservation and library lends (e.g. to one person at a time) just
as they do with print. Can readers count on books being available a year
or two or five after publication? The existence of libraries has made
this possible from their inception until now.
</blockquote>
The
<a href="https://dp.la/news/groundbreaking-ebook-agreement?mc_cid=b690d51703">DPLA
echoes this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Copyright’s ‘first sale doctrine’ is important to readers and libraries
for a number of reasons, not least of which is the way that it
facilitates long-term preservation and access,” noted <b>Lyrasis CEO
John Wilkin</b>. “Licensing models have threatened this critical
underpinning, which is needed for preservation of the cultural record.
Lyrasis is excited to collaborate with DPLA and IPG in the creation of a
model that will make preservation and access of digital content
possible.”
</blockquote>
Alas, even if the first-sale barrier were removed, the experience of the
LOCKSS program shows that the problem would remain. In the paper world
building a local collection was essential for libraries to provide
service to their <i>current</i> readers. The costs and effort involved
in doing so were inescapable. The fact that doing so safeguarded access
for <i>future</i> readers was a no-cost, no-effort side-effect. But in
the digital world building a local collection is irrelevant to providing
service to <i>current</i> readers. They get access from the publisher.
The costs and effort devoted to building a local collection are only in
the interest of <i>future</i> readers. Thus, given strained budgets,
these costs must be minimized. The choice between maintaining a local
collection, and simply outsourcing the task of supporting future readers
to a service by signing a small check is a no-brainer.<br /> <br />
Worse, three other considerations weigh in the balance:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The publishers are highly motivated to ensure that current readers
access their copy, because this provides them data they can sell to
advertisers.
</li>
<li>
The publishers view many local collections as a bigger risk of their
content leaking than a small number of concentrated archives, which they
expect will be better secured.
</li>
<li>
Economies of scale mean a centralized archive is likely to have a lower
cost per unit content than a distributed one.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The LOCKSS Program devoted a great deal of engineering effort to
reducing the capital and operational cost, and increasing the security
of, two generations of an
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/bsdcon03/tech/full_papers/rosenthal/rosenthal_html/index.html">appliance</a>
that libraries could use to build a local collection of the e-journals
to which they subscribed. But in the end most libraries that cared about
protecting access for future readers to this content chose to sign
checks to centralized archives. Of course, it didn’t help that the
publishers of the most expensive content would not allow libraries to
use the appliance to collect it.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="the-dev-tools-performance-monitor-panel">The Dev Tools
Performance Monitor Panel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-03, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
Weeks ago I was looking in to a performance issue for our animated
spinner component and stumbled across a tool in DevTools I hadn’t used
before:
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/performance-monitor">The
Performance Monitor Panel</a>. In you open <code>Dev Tools &gt; More
Tools &gt; Performance Monitor</code> you’ll see some helpful high-level
charts and graphs of the realtime performance data of your UI.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/perfmonitorpanel.jpg" alt="The Figma.com homepage with the performance panel open to the side showing 120 style recalcs per second" />
</p>
<p>
The Performance Monitor collects performance data in realtime and puts
it on a graph. It’s handy for detecting performance problems at a
high-level. If your CPU, memory, DOM node count, or event listeners only
go up while
<a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/sanding-ui/">clicking
around</a>, you probably have a leak in your code. The part I was most
interested in were style recalculations per second and layouts per
second. Our spinner component was triggering style recalculations and
layout calls at a rate of 120 per second. Yikes! That’s a lot of extra
work on the CPU.
</p>
<p>
Next I turned on <code>Dev Tools &gt; More Tools &gt; Rendering &gt;
Show Paint Flashes</code> and I could immediately see the tactile
feedback of green boxes thrashing around as the browser repainted the
component hundreds of times per second. The green paint boxes confirmed
that this UI work was happening on the main thread instead of the
compositor thread. The Performance Monitor showed my CPU usage at 5-9%
of my Mackbook Pro. Double Yikes.
</p>
<p>
The Performance Monitor panel pairs nicely with the top-level
Performance panel. While the Performance Monitor panel is very
high-level, the Performance panel is an in-depth debugging tool where
you can inspect a snapshot of your app down to each function and render
call.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/perfpanel.jpg" alt="A flame graph inside the Performance Panel in dev tools" />
</p>
<p>
Capturing a snapshot in the Performance panel confirmed what I was now
seeing. I could see the “red line of death” of dropped frames where I
locked the main thread. The remediation steps were pretty simple but I
did need to strip down and recode how our animation worked.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://web.dev/articles/animations-guide">Avoid properties
that trigger paint or layout</a>
</li>
<li>
Tamp down layout recalcs with <code>contain</code>
</li>
<li>
Use <code>overflow: hidden</code> instead of CSS masks
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It took a couple of prototypes to shop around a workable solution. The
good news is our animation is off-loaded to the compositor instead of
the main thread now. CPU use is now at <code>0.2%</code> (down from
5-9%) and our recalcs and layouts are down to <code>0</code> but the
animation still chugs along. Truth be told, a loading spinner is a
pretty insignificant component and is only temporary, but reducing CPU
usage by 10% here makes room for other JavaScript activities… like…
y’know… fetching and parsing data.

the beginning of the Trade Secrets
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040923224915/http://secrets.scripting.com/2004/09/22#a26">podcast</a>
on Sept 22, 2004, is when I would say podcasting got its name. Adam and
I were the leaders of the community. It had been discussed briefly on
the mail list. We all recognized that what we were doing needed a name.
There was a consensus, it was a small community by then, very collegial.
Dave Slusher had already used the term in his podcast (according to
<a href="https://podnews.net/article/history-of-word-podcast">James
Cridland</a>), so I said in the Trade Secrets show, let’s just go ahead
and use it. I did mention Ben Hammersley. So he’s not out of the story,
but he’s not the person who gave podcasting its name. September 2004 was
the moment when podcasting became something. It’s rare in things like
this that you can point to a moment, but we can
<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=podcast">here</a>,
and the record should make that very clear. You could say Hammersley was
the first to publish the term in a piece he wrote, but he played no role
in the bootstrap. I’d say that by the end of 2004 it was on its way, I
basically stepped back and enjoyed the medium along with everyone else.
Adam started a company. I would have liked to have started a company
then, but it wasn’t meant to be. That all happened 20 years ago.</p>

<h2 id="bluesky-vs-mastodon-as-open-apis">Bluesky vs Mastodon as open
APIs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-02, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The problem with Mastodon is its protocol is underspecified, therefore
interop is really hard, and ultimately the standard, if any emerges,
will be decided by big tech companies and will be ridiculously complex.
</p>
<p>
I think Bluesky has a better chance of being a solid standard you can
build on, though I find it fairly incomprehensible, but other people
seem to understand it well enough, and I’ve been able to get it to do
what I need. Kind of like Amazon’s web service APIs. The designers seem
smart, and are accessible (a big plus). On the other hand, I’ve already
had apps built on their api break.
</p>
<p>
Neither one is in a particularly strong position.
</p>
<p>
Bluesky should factor their API, provide a profile, and a simple API you
can adapt to in a weekend, for most common things people want to hook
into. And they should commit to not breaking that profile. Their
protocol has a lot of generality that gets in the way of doing things
that 99% of devs need to do.
</p>
<p>
Of course Mastodon isn’t supposed to be an API, the underlying API was
supposed to be ActivityPub, but as I understand, that isn’t complete,
and they need the functionality now, so they’ve implemented a REST API
for the other stuff. Makes sense, it’s what I would do in this
situation. On the other hand, that pretty much guarantees that a big
part of this interface is going to be deprecated, meaning many
developers, myself included, will just wait till we get there.
</p>
<p>
As I said above I fully expect Meta (ie Facebook) will drive that
process, that people will choose to interop with their product over
Mastodon and over ActivityPub. Names like “fediverse” get walked over
and perverted by big tech companies. We will find ourselves soon talking
about the Meta-fediverse and the Masto-fediverse or (somesuch).
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen countless of good, clear, solid ideas get muddied by big tech
companies. This idea, the fediverse, got completely muddied before the
BigCos got involved. Still more hard work to do, and it must be working
<i>together. </i>It doesn’t work if people try to throw their
non-existent weight around. That’s basically with the big companies.

hindsight
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+medium">Medium</a>
chose the wrong business model. They could have done what Automattic has
done with WordPress. It’s a private company so I don’t know how much
it’s growing or how profitable it is, but from outside it’s obviously
growing and profitable. Basically, charge writers for the service, or
lots of services. Little extras you can add to your site. Use it as a
hook to sell domain names (huge recurring business). And open source the
Medium editor, when it came out it was a breakthrough in usability, and
offer it to Google to bundle with Chrome, upgrade the whole web while
you’re at it. With billions of windfall from the success of Twitter, why
argue over nickels and dimes. That’s what I always wondered about the
thinking behind Medium. Ev had the ability to change the course of the
industry, and make the same kind of money Google and Microsoft make. And
yes, I did urge him to do
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+medium">all
this</a> at the time, publicly (didn’t have access to him privately, if
you can believe that).</p>

<p>
Interesting <a href="https://ian.sh/tsa">vulnerability</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
…a special lane at airport security called Known Crewmember (KCM). KCM
is a TSA program that allows pilots and flight attendants to bypass
security screening, even when flying on domestic personal trips.
</p>
<p>
The KCM process is fairly simple: the employee uses the dedicated lane
and presents their KCM barcode or provides the TSA agent their employee
number and airline.
<a href="https://www.apfa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/KCM-Program-Changes_OCT19.pdf">Various
forms of ID</a> need to be presented while the TSA agent’s laptop
verifies the employment status with the airline. If successful, the
employee can access the sterile area without any screening at all…

review and feedback on, <a href="Contact">let me know</a>. I’m happy to
write a few words on this page.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://malachijs.itch.io/sundial-siphon">Sundial Siphon</a>: I
love the myconid picture and map; I had to read the part about the
rotating map multiple times and I’m still not sure it really contributes
to the game. Sometimes doors cannot be opened, sometimes some rooms
cannot be reached, but I’d have to see it at the table. I liked the
colour coding of monsters and connections. It says twice “Takes some
time to clear” but it’s unclear what the drawback is since there are no
random encounters? Is it a quarter rotation? Reading the Siphon makes me
think that after 4 phases all player characters are trapped in
constructs? That seems rather harsh. The dungeon says that that players
are racing against the clock but I think players wouldn’t know that, so
some sort of warning might be apt? There’s a warning in room 4 but I
feel a better warning is required, or the siphon should only affect room
5? In any case, the dungeon seems promising! 😄
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://peninsulancestral.itch.io/epona-temple">Epona’s
Temple</a>: I love the idea of achieving a permanent blessing of Epona.
The map is beautiful. I feel that the map doesn’t make clear which of
the obstacles are easy to sidestep. Can people go from 3 to 5 without
crossing 4 or 8? In 4 there’s a presence of insects but it wasn’t clear
to mean what that entails since there are no insect stats. From a logic
perspective the abandoned camp is puzzling. In any case, the rewards at
the end are my favourite thing. They match the premise at the entrance
and the theme of the temple itself. Love that. <em>E gostei muito de ver
um versão que não seja Inglesa. Muito bem feito!</em> 😄

2024-08-29 msmtp and app armor
</h1>
<p>
I tried to send an email from Emacs and it didn’t work. The error was:
</p>
<pre><code>msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>
<p>
I was able to reproduce the problem with the following
<code>hello.txt</code> file:
</p>
<pre><code>From: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
To: Alex &lt;alex@alexschroeder.ch&gt;
Subject: Test

This is the test.
</code></pre>
<p>
And then feeding that to <code>msmtp</code> with debugging enabled
(<code>-d</code>) and reading recipients from the mail
(<code>-t</code>):
</p>
<pre><code>msmtp -d -t &lt; hello.txt
</code></pre>
<p>
Now I had more info, however:
</p>
<pre><code>ignoring system configuration file /etc/msmtprc: No such file or directory
ignoring user configuration file /home/alex/.config/msmtp/config: Permission denied
falling back to default account
msmtp: account default not found: no configuration file available
</code></pre>
<p>
I checked permissions, and it was 0600 for the config file. Online, I
found a reference to AppArmor. Taking a peek at
<code>/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp</code> I didn’t see anything
surprising. But then I grew suspicious… I had in fact moved
<code>~/.config/msmtp</code> to <code>~/src/home/.config/msmtp</code>
(which is a Git repository) and replaced that with a symbolic link.
AppArmor didn’t like this and decided that <code>msmtp</code> was not
allowed to read that other file. Moving the directory back solved this
problem.
</p>
<p>
I guess I’ll be making occasional copies of this file into the Git
repository. 😒

delay</a> and when he says you can legally murder babies in some states,
that should be treated as if he said fuck or shit. Put up a screen that
explains why he was cut off, then go to commercial, esp during the
debate on Sep 10.</p>

<p>And for some companies, the founder of a company they acquire might
make the best CEO when the founder of the original company isn’t
available. Again Apple is a great example. Steve Jobs ultimately
replaced Gil Amelio, after Apple bought NeXT.</p>

Wordle Kitty is watching TV along with 80 other convicted house pets
serving life sentences at Attica high security prison. They’re watching
a mushy political psycho drama starring Wordle Kitty herself, the cutest
most adorable kitten known to mankind. The NYT headline reads “Cushy
kitty crushes mushy melodrama in prison laugh riot.”

<p>Graham uses Steve Jobs as an example. He knew what was and wasn’t an
Apple product. A hired CEO would have to have that explained to him.
Sculley, who Graham cites, is a perfectly nice person in my experience,
had no idea how to deal with Windows. Very different from a consumer
product like fizzy water. Who but Steve Jobs would have thought that an
iPod was a proper product for a company that made PCs. I think he
himself wanted it, and that’s what made something an Apple product. It’s
probably why post-Jobs Apple is pretty much stuck selling only the
products Jobs created for them. He told
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook">Cook</a> to innovate on
his own vision and timetable, probably knowing full-well that nobody
would be able to do it. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<p>Another rule for whoever runs a tech company, they must themselves be
a fanatical user of the company’s product. They must love it the way a
founder loves it. They must think the users are the smartest people in
the world because they love the best product in the world. As a founder,
I could not visualize the day I left the company for the last time. In
hindsight I felt that was the one factor most responsible for the
success of the company.</p>

Graham wrote a very
<a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/foundermode.html">useful piece</a>
about “Founder Mode.” As a founder myself, I think I can tell you why
founders have a central role to play as the company grows. They’re the
only ones who know how the company was built, and what works and what
doesn’t and how to keep it consistent for customers and partners, and
the founder, if the company grew, is tuned into to what makes the
company work, and will see opportunities that even well-intentioned
managers miss. I remember when a company I was a developer for, early in
my career, switched out the founder and replaced him with a professional
CEO. The founder had problems managing, and could have used help imho,
but – the founder understood what the company was about, and the
professional claimed to be a “market of one” and therefore didn’t have
an opinion about what products the company should make. That would be
delegated to people he hired. Almost as if the people running a company
were just modules and servers, and if you needed to grow you just bought
new modules. In this case. I can write this because I don’t have to get
approval from anyone else. I’m sure in a company of today someone would
take offense at something I wrote here. That my friends is another
reason why companies have a hard time scaling. <span

<p>Already September 1st, and a tang of autumn in the morning air. I had
a two-week holiday with no laptop or emails, and lots of reading. Then a
two-week scramble to catch up with the accumulated email and work. So …
