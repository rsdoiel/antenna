you want Americans to pay attention to climate change, just call it
climate change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>You probably have been hearing phrases like “climate crisis,”
“climate emergency” or “climate justice” more often lately as people try
to get across the urgent risks and consequences of climate change.
The danger is real, but is using this language actually persuasive? It
turns out that Americans are more familiar with — and more concerned
about — “climate…</p>

Taylor Swift really call Florida “racist”? (No she didn’t, no matter

<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>When is a news alert not a news alert? No, that’s not a question from
a blunted hippie who just read the I Ching and now speaks only in kōans.
It’s a question about TikTok and other social apps that have leaned into
