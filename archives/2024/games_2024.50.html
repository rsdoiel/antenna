<p>On Dec. 4, a masked person shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson

<p>“Father and Son” is a mystery you’ll uncover in Indiana Jones and the

<p>Our favorite books this year were so wonderfully human. A sexbot’s
quest for self-determination; a haunted house inhabited by angry
witches; more than one heartbreaking new take on time travel — genre
fiction is always about how we live now, but this year how we live now
seems so much closer to the surface.  With […]</p>

<p>The first trailer for Danny Boyle and Alex Garland’s 28 Years Later —
follow-up to their 2002 zombie banger 28 Days Later and its 2007 sequel

<p>Murkrow, the darkness Pokémon from Johto, can be found in the wild in
Pokémon Go. Yes, Murkrow can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Honestly, Honchkrow
is not a terrible option for both a dark- and flying-type attacker, if
you have no better choices. It’s even better with its shadow form, where
it’s strangely reliable. These […]</p>

<p>Nicole Kidman may be right about going to the movies — we do go to

<p>2024 was an oddball year for movies, heavily shaped by the disruption
of the 2023 Hollywood strikes and an industry hedging its bets against a
stronger 2025 by postponing many of its would-be blockbusters for a year
or more. That left a lot of open space at multiplexes, which responded
by booking smaller movies, from […]</p>
