<p>date: 2024-12-09, updated: 2024-12-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Nicole Kidman may be right about going to the movies — we do go to
that place to laugh, to cry, to care, to see dazzling images on a huge
silver screen. And then, all but inevitably, we go home. And it’s there
we also find a place where stories can feel like magic. In […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-09, updated: 2024-12-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>2024 was an oddball year for movies, heavily shaped by the disruption
of the 2023 Hollywood strikes and an industry hedging its bets against a
stronger 2025 by postponing many of its would-be blockbusters for a year
or more. That left a lot of open space at multiplexes, which responded
by booking smaller movies, from […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-09, updated: 2024-12-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>2024 has been… a year. But at the end of the day, there was plenty to
sink our teeth into. We were delighted by the platforming possibilities
in Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and Astro Bot, and the rich
storytelling of RPGs like Metaphor: ReFantazio and Like a Dragon:
Infinite Wealth. We loved the […]</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-09, updated: 2024-12-09, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>About 25 years ago, the production team on Peter Jackson’s Lord of
the Rings trilogy put out an open call for any able-bodied horse rider
willing to truck themselves and a horse out to a remote New Zealand
shoot to become an extra in the legendary cavalry of Rohan. Stop me if
you’ve heard this […]</p>

<p>Medallions return in Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 1, after being first
introduced in Chapter 5 Season 1. There are two medallions up for grabs

Medallion. In this Fortnite guide, we’ll explain what the medallions do

<p>itch.io spent hours completely offline on Sunday night — and the
indie game marketplace placed the blame on an automated takedown
generated on behalf of Funko, maker of the Funko Pop collectable
figurines. “I kid you not, <span class="citation"

<p>In the 2002 movie Chicago, Catherine Zeta-Jones steps into the
spotlight to belt out “All That Jazz” with a defiant kind of joy that
takes on new meaning once it becomes clear that her character, Velma
Kelly, has just murdered her husband. Zeta-Jones’ rendition of the song
was irresistible: On a wave of critical and […]</p>

<p>I’ve played so many survival and crafting games that I have the
opening routine down to a science. Here’s how it usually goes: I wake up
in a new environment and get straight to punching trees. Sometimes, I
don’t even get to punch trees — I have to pick up sticks and rocks and
