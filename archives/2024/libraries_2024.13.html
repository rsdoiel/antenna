line of defense in identifying research integrity issues. In today’s
post, Angela Cochran calls for research institutions to take a larger
role in validation and integrity checks.

the Retraction Minefield in China and Beyond: A Need for Systemic
Changes and Increased Focus on Researcher Well-Being</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-27, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>
<p>

interconnectedness of stakeholders within the research ecosystem and
emphasizes the importance of aligning incentives and priorities to
foster a culture of integrity and accountability. Can similar efforts be
applied globally to cultivate a culture of accountability and
transparency?
