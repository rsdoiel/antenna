<p>BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not
staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for
software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook
was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users
are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end
while a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef">coral
reef</a> has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from.
Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in
the 60s,. You would have missed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles">all
that followed</a>. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the
2020s. That story is far from over.</p>

we need, now, is a system to compete with Twitter. A system as capable
as Twitter. It has to be privately held by a group that can be trusted
not to interfere with democratic use of the system. This can’t be
guaranteed, it has to be based on trust. It needs to scale very quickly.
Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and
quickly understood as parallel to Twitter. Bluesky has a lot of what’s
needed, but its ownership is not clear. But it more like Twitter than
Twitter is today and I expect that to continue.</p>

Godot on iPhone, I forgot to disable it from the TestFlight and it sort

My opinion was that we should block it, but people love it. And in the
last 12 hours I can’t stop thinking of some easy wins to make it at
least passable.

But perhaps the right thing is still to prevent from running on iPhone

like to share posts from Threads on Bluesky and Mastodon to illustrate
the incompatibility, the ignorance of one to the other. These guys
should all be using the same protocol. It’s a travesty that each of them
considers their product to define the
<a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> – they don’t
understand the first thing about the web, what the miracle the web was.
Before the web, the tech world was as it is now, fragmented by huge
companies that didn’t care about anything but their own internal drama.
The last thing they would consider was reusing something that was
already running. While all that was going on Unix basically agreed on a
core set of functions that formed a basis for interop. They weren’t
perfect, there were differences in each of the Unixes, but you could
reuse most of what you knew on each of the platforms. But Apple,
Microsoft, Sun and IBM each ran their own ecosystems. And then one day
along came the web. Instead of bookshelves of docs, it wasn’t even a
booklet. You could be up and running with a “website” in ten minutes. I
speak from experience. My first website was authored with a freaking
email. Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon are the IBM, Microsoft and Apple of
2024. It’s ridiculous if they think this is a web. To paraphrase the
late great
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgtfEX2Pka0&t=65s">Lloyd
Bentsen</a>, I knew the web, the web was a friend of mine. You are not
the web.</p>

<h2 id="plan-9-is-a-bicycle">Plan 9 is a bicycle</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-21, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<p>Someone on Reddit asked
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/unix/comments/1hih6vs/screenshots_of_plan9_operatin_system/m30q8be/">how
easy it was to do "simple stuff" on 9front.</a><br /><br />This is not a
Linux distribution. It is an experimental research OS.<br /><br />Look,
all Linux distros are the same kernel with different tools slapped on
top. Mostly the GNU tools and a bunch of other stuff. Linux is one
operating system.<br /><br />Linux is a GPL implementation of a simple
monolithic 1970s Unix kernel. All the BSDs are BSD-licensed
implementations of a simple monolithic 1970s Unix
kernel.<br /><br />Taking a high-level view they are different
implementations of the same design.<br /><br />So it’s very easy to port
the same apps to all of them. All run Firefox and Thunderbird and
LibreOffice. They are slightly different flavours of a single
design.<br /><br />They are all just Unixes.<br /><br />Solaris and AIX
and HP/UX are the same design. All just Unixes.<br /><br />Now we get to
outliers. Some break up the kernel into different programs that work
together. This is called a microkernel design. Mac OS X/macOS, Minix 3,
QNX, CoyotOS, keyKOS. Still pretty much Unixes but weird
ones.<br /><br />The big names among them, like macOS, still run the
same apps. Firefox, LibreOffice,
etc.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/">Still
UNIX.<br /></a><br />9front is a distro of Plan 9. Plan 9 is NOT a
Unix.<br /><br />A small team – originally 2 guys, Dennis Ritchie and
Ken Thompson, designed Unix and C.<br /><br />It caught on. Lots of
people built versions of it. Some of them changed the design a bit.
Doesn’t really matter. It is all just Unix.<br /><br />It takes the core
design and adds a million layers of junk on top, implemented by
well-meaning people who just had jobs to do and get stuff working, so
now it’s huge and vastly complex… but it’s just Unix.<br /><br />It’s an
ancient tradition to compare computers to vehicles. Unix is a car. Lots
of people make cars. It’s surprisingly hard to define what a "car" is
but it’s a box on wheels, probably with a roof (but maybe not), probably
with windows (but maybe not), on wheels (probably 4, maybe 3, could be
6) with an engine.<br /><br />All Unixes are types of car. You can’t
take the gearbox of a Ford and just bolt it into a Honda. Won’t fit. But
you can take a Ford and take a Honda and put 4 people in it and drive it
on the same road to the same shop and buy stuff and carry it
home.<br /><br />Windows is… not a car, but it’s close. Let’s say it’s a
bus. Still a box on wheels, still carries people (but lots of them.) You
can buy a bus to yourself and drive to the shops, with 40 friends
instead of 4, but you wouldn’t want to. It’s big and slow and hard to
drive and expensive. But you could do.<br /><br />Plan 9 is not Unix.
Plan 9 is what the guys who invented Unix did next.<br /><br />Plan 9 is
not a car.<br /><br />You are only thinking of cars. We are not talking
about cars any more.<br /><br />Plan 9 is, say, a bicycle. (I know,
bicycles came before cars. Sue me, it’s a metaphor not a history
lecture.)<br /><br />It still has wheels. It still goes places. You can
sit on it, and ride it, and go hundreds of miles. You can go to the
shops and do your shopping and take it home, but no, 4 of you can’t. You
can’t put the shopping in the boot. It doesn’t have a boot. You need a
backpack or panniers.<br /><br />Stop thinking of cars. We have left
car-land behind. There are a hundred other types of "things that have
wheels and go" that aren’t cars. There are motorbikes and roller skates
and skateboards and go-karts and racing cars and unicycles and roller
blades and cross-country-skiing roller-trainers and wheely shoes and
loads more.<br /><br />You’re asking what kind of car a bicycle is. It
isn’t.<br /><br />&gt; I’m just wondering how easy it would be to load
this on a cheap laptop and get up and running.<br /><br />It’s doable. A
few hours work maybe.<br /><br />&gt; Does it require a lot of tweaking
to get simple things working?<br /><br />You do not define "simple
things". But downthread you do.<br /><br />You will never usefully
browse the web on 9front. It doesn’t really have a web browser. There
are some kinda sorta things that do 1% of what a mainstream web browser
does but you won’t like them.<br /><br />It doesn’t really have "apps".
Nobody ever wrote any. (With rounding errors. There is a tiny bit of 3rd
party software, but you won’t recognise anything.)<br /><br />Plan 9 is
a bicycle. It can take you places but you can’t drive it if you only
know how to drive cars. Never mind that it has a manual gear shift and
there are 27 gears in 2 different gearing systems and no clutch and you
need to memorise all the combinations you need to climb a hill and speed
along the flat.<br /><br />Also, you know, you need to
pedal.<br /><br />There’s no engine.<br /><br />"I want to write
Markdown text and print it to a laser printer."<br /><br />Right, well,
you’ll need to find a dozen separate tools, learn how to work them, and
learn how to link them together… Or, you’ll need to write your
own.<br /><br />Plan 9 is not the end point of the story,
either.<br /><br />Plan 9 was a step on the road to Inferno. Inferno is
not a car and it’s not a bicycle. It is, in extremely vague and general
terms, a cross between an operating system, and Java, and the JVM. All
in one.<br /><br />It’s… a pedal-powered aeroplane. You can’t ride it to
the shops but it is in its way even more amazing than a bicycle… it can
fly.<br /><br />What you call "simple stuff" is car stuff. You can’t do
it. It is not as "simple" as you think it
is.<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=93196" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a> that isn’t
cooperating, having to do with the clipboard and the
<a href="https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor">MediumEditor</a>
package, which does all these nice things for us with the clipboard, but
it isn’t willing to share custody, or perhaps more accurately we can’t
figure out how to. The feature I want is when you paste a URL and
there’s a selection, the selected text is turned into a link. A video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQQPTlpNZQ">explanation</a>.
I’ve burned two full sessions on this, seeking advice from ChatGPT,
Claude and Perplexity. They all pretend to know what to do, but in fact
they don’t. The clipboard is one of those areas of the browser that is
held together with rumors and confusion, as is MediumEditor, and the
intersection is rumors and confusion squared. Tomorrow I’m going to work
on other things, and the day after until I have an idea for another way
to approach this. I really want this feature because apparently it’s
supported in Slack, WordPress and other software that supports
links.</p>

<p>BTW, we could use a few
<a href="https://this.how/wordland/#1733146566000">more testers</a> with
good experience with bug reporting who use WordPress. I’m sure there are
more bugs we haven’t gotten reports on yet.</p>

<p>One more thing. I love taking the time to craft a delicious piece of
software. I have never really done that in the 50 years I’ve been doing
this. This time I decided there’s no rush. I’m going to wait until
people want what I’ve created. We’re not there yet. <span

<p>Amazing that the tech industry hasn’t tried to retrieve its
reputation from the ones who are repping us in DC nowadays. Software
doesn’t <i>have</i> to treat their users like nobodies. Quite the
opposite. I come from the school that says our users are the smartest
most powerful people in the world and it’s our privilege to create tools
for them.</p>

<p>I’ve figured out more precisely what
<a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a> is meant to
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/13/214755.html?title=itsBiggerThanATinyLittleTextbox">compete</a>
with –&gt; the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text
boxes</a> of the social web. Ours is slightly bigger, and grows as your
piece gets longer. Neatly arranged like the others, and all your writing
flows through WordPress and RSS, where each of the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">TLTBs</a> only
flows into their limited and incompatible views of the social web. RSS
and WordPress are a powerful distribution system. Lots of software works
with those two protocols, as do many programmers, and they’re both
marvelously open, stable over more than twenty years each, and
<i>can’t</i> be owned by billionaires. Pretty powerful place, kind of
amazing that there’s so much room here, and the people are friendly.

<p>I’m thinking maybe we’ll do a Kickstarter for
<a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>. It’ll cost money to
run the server and continue to develop the sofware. It fills a big
enough need to ask the users to support it financially, at least to get
it off the ground. The server is open source so theoretically anyone can
run one. But in practice most people will probably just want to use the
service. I just want to solve this problem so we can start building a
developer ecosystem around WordPress that it’s never had. Think of
WordLand as a pump primer. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<h2 id="valais">2024-12-19 Valais</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-19, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-12-19-valais">
2024-12-19 Valais
</h1>
<p>
We are spending a week in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valais">Valais</a>. It’s the
source of the Rhone river (comparable to the Rhine except it flows west
instead of north). We’re at around 1300m above sea level, here.
</p>
<p>
The entire valley goes from east to west. There are mountains to the
north, east and south. So in three out of four cardinal directions, the
clouds already rained over some mountains. This region has the most
sunny days in all of Switzerland.
</p>
<p>
The Valais has two parts: the upper part is German speaking, the lower
part is French speaking. The German speaking part used to lord it over
the French speaking part. The region joined Switzerland in 1815.
</p>
<p>
When I came here, I was about two weeks old. I don’t remember much. We
left the Valais when I was at the age of learning to ride a bicycle.
When is that? Maybe four years old? Not kindergarten age, in any case.
</p>
<p>
In the seventies, the Valais got a tunnel through the mountains to
connect it to the German speaking rest of Switzerland. I remember my das
thinking the locals were extremely backwards. They didn’t understand
that he rode the bicycle up the mountain just for fun. They threatened
to call the police when they saw him tend his tomatoes on a Sunday (no
working on a Sunday, it’s the law!).
</p>
<p>
A little badmouthing remains. Outside of the Valais, people like to
think that they are corrupt. The current and the last FIFA bosses –
Blatter and Infantino – are from Valais. Enough said.
</p>
<p>
People here, on the other hand, like to call everybody from outside the
canton “Üsseschwyzer” (people from “outer Switzerland”).
</p>
<p>
Historically, it was conquered by the Romans in 57 BCE, ended up as part
of Burgundy in 888, was handed over to the bishop of Sion in 999 (still
the capital), was part of the Holy Roman Empire in 1032, fell under the
influence of Savoy, pushed them back and finally managed to conquer the
lower parts during the Burgundian wars in 1475. This new, French
speaking and subservient region got further expanded in 1536.
</p>
<p>
With the French Revolution there was a revolt in 1798 against the upper
Valais; France conquered the Valais in 1799, founded an independent
republic in 1802 and absorbed it in 1810. At the Congress of Vienna in
1815 they joined the Swiss.

ChatGPT is encyclopedic but is not good at strategy. It will drive you
down blind alleys. It rewrites your code to conform to its standards. It
has a terrible memory. Forgets things you told it specifically not to
forget. It does not keep promises. People who say the bubble is fully
inflated on this stuff are not paying attention. We’re still dealing
with very basic features.</p>

<p>I watched
<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber">Ari Melber</a>
last night and noted he isn’t yet on Bluesky or hasn’t updated his show
graphics to include it? He usually tries to be leading edge in this, and
at this point he looks a bit behind the times, imho, ymmv etc. After
Melber, I stayed through the opening segment of Joy Reid and was charged
up by her intro. She’s clicking on all cylinders. They must be thinking
about gutting or reconfiguring MSNBC at this time. It’s up
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/01/msnbc-comcast-cable-news-for-sale-elon-musk-trump">for

piece of real estate as Musk saw the value in Twitter, far beyond what
the stock market valued it at. (BTW, I should add that I benefited from
his largesse, I was a very
<a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/11/15/0295.html">small

are all things the NYT wouldn’t let him run? Or if he submitted them,
would they edit them into mushy nonsense. I’ve been there, I quit Wired
when they edited my pieces, with my name on them, where I said things I
thought were inane, things that I most definitely did not say. There’s
never been a better illustration of the importance of blogging and the
value that’s removed by publishing in the NYT. If a

huge advantage in circulation they have (as Wired did over my humble

It turns out that all cluster mailboxes in the Denver area have the same

very fragile security.

<h2 id="every-token-is-a-feature">Every token is a feature</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-19, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’m in the middle of a design tokens project and I thought I’d share
something I’m learning that is probably obvious to everyone else; every
design token is a feature.
</p>
<p>
A token is a magical contract between design and engineering, if we
agree to use the same name to abstractly refer to the same value, it
will produce a desired outcome. That bridge alone is probably worth the
investment, but tokens solve even more organizational problems. The
mobile app and the website can look the same by sharing a single JSON
file. But wait, there’s more! If the blue a different team chose is not
blue enough for you, you can make your own blue and apply it at the
global scope or the individual element scope. Tokens as an
organizational feature are a powerful concept but there’s tons of nuance
packed behind it.
</p>
<p>
Like features, too many tokens can bloat your system. I recently learned
–because I’m lucky to work with people who work on browsers– there’s a
not-so-theoretical limit where the browser starts taking a performance
hit based purely on the number of CSS variables. There’s no hard upper
limit on the number of variables (we drew a line at ~500) because the
limit ultimately depends on the size and the depth of your DOM. Style
recalcs and tree walking are expensive problems for a browser. Alias
tokens like <code>–foo: var(–bar)</code> compound the problem and the
more static you can be, like <code>–foo: #bada55</code>, the better.
Infinite customizability and peak performance are often at odds.
</p>
<p>
Like features, too many tokens can create organizational problems! This
is the opposite of what I said above, how can that be? It’s possible to
generate enough tokens that they become their own
<a href="https://robinrendle.com/essays/systems-mistakes-and-the-sea/">hyperobject</a>,
impossible to comprehend from the outside, so well-meaning people eject
from the system. Detached instances. One-offs. Snowflakes.
</p>
<p>
Like features, tokens can create little piles of
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/">technical
debt</a>. “Is anyone still using
<code>–color-beefcake-primary-2</code>?” you shout into the void of the
team chat. No one responds because no one knows. The person who does
know left the company five months ago. Alas, we’ll bolt on more until we
find time to fix it. Always adding. Never subtracting.
</p>
<p>
Like features, some tokens are going to have a massive payoff if
implemented and some tokens the user benefit is less clear.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">You’re passing
organizational complexity on to the user</a>. Like features, you can
build over-complicated machinery around a simple concept like sharing
values. Like features, people will build every part without considering
whether they actually need each facet.
</p>
<p>
Generally speaking, if someone wants to implement hundreds or thousands
of little features in an application, that’s probably a red flag.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/09/if-statements-should-cost-10000/">If-statements
are expensive over their lifetime</a>. But from my experience, a good
system of tokens inside a cascade of meaningful componentry can make a
product resonate with consistency across many surfaces, while providing
just enough customizability to differentiate when necessary.

<a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a>
file in the GitHub project, ChatGPT understands where I want to take
this project. Most amazing, it wrote a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md">summary</a>
of what it saw in the project. I
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md">added
that</a> to the GitHub project, of course, and since it was in Markdown,
it fit right in with no mods. The power of standards. I love it when
things that should work, do. The next step is to implement a feature in
the new Bingeworthy that can only be done with an AI bot like ChatGPT.
It’s such a thrill to be working on this stuff as it’s happening. And
what a delight that it has an API. I don’t mind that I’m paying for it,
I love the idea of paying to break down walls to create new things that
couldn’t have been created before.</p>

<p>What could journalism do to help the country? Move your shows out
into the red territories. Make it a requirement that Chris and Joy,
Lawrence or Rachel, if they want to stay on the air, have to broadcast
from one of the red states. It could be a large city in a red state. The
reason is symbolic and practical. The red state voters wouldn’t be such
a mystery if you knew some of them from your everyday life. And you
might have a few of them on the show. You have some selling to do, the
idea you’re selling is that you care about the people you don’t
know.</p>

Democrats are, of course, failing to lead the 75 million who voted for
them in the last election, which was a bit over a month ago. Maybe they
should factor that into their thinking, what kind of relationship would
you have with an organization that only cared about what you thought if
they needed something very specific from you in that exact moment. Any
other time, who are you again? We are without leaders.</p>

get my greatest ideas walking, riding my bike, on a ski lift, or sitting
in a hot tub esp when it’s really cold out and there’s a full moon as
there was last night. Sometimes the ideas prove workable and other times
they’re like the great brainstorms one had with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_boom">cocaine</a> in the
80s, not that I would know, but have heard. Anyway, I was daydreaming
about what I’d do with
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bingeworthy">Bingeworthy</a>
if I was going to continue working on it. I thought about the mode I
want to use it in. I want to watch a series that I would like, not that
Netflix thinks I’d like, because their idea of what I’d like is
bullshit. I find that I’ll like almost anything that’s rated in the 80s
by Metacritic, but really only if the NYT reviewed it well. I’ll give
almost any NYT <i>critics choice</i> a go. So what I really want in the
middle of the Bingeworthy display of a program is 250 words about the
program aggregated from various critics as Metacritic does so well.
Unfortunately neither Metacritic or the NYT offer an API for this as far
as I know. Oh too bad, same old thing. No access to the data where you
need it (btw, ideally Bingeworthy would be baked into the TV set, or all
the streamers could be played in the context of Bingeworthy). Anyway,
then <i>boom</i> it hit me, holy shit the thing I was farting around
with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/17.html#a164345">in the
outliner</a> could actually do this. Now I’m going to need to be able to

<p>
Not everything needs to be digital and “smart.” License plates,
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/digital-license-plate-jailbreak-hack/">for
example</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Josep Rodriguez, a researcher at security firm IOActive, has revealed a
technique to “jailbreak” digital license plates sold by Reviver, the
leading vendor of those plates in the US with 65,000 plates already
sold. By removing a sticker on the back of the plate and attaching a
cable to its internal connectors, he’s able to rewrite a Reviver plate’s
firmware in a matter of minutes. Then, with that custom firmware
installed, the jailbroken license plate can receive commands via
Bluetooth from a smartphone app to instantly change its display to show
any characters or image…

<p>I’m farting around with the OpenAI API. I have a nice encapsulation
for calls to ChatGPT, one that hides all the tricky stuff, all you need
is an apiToken to make it work, something that is available for free.
The first place I put it is in an outliner. Basically I can write a
question in a headline, click an icon and the response from ChatGPT is
placed in a series of sub-heads. Interesting to see that they use
Markdown to convey the response. The logical choice. I’m not sure how or
if I will use this in my writing, but now I have an idea what it’s good
for. Here’s a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/17/fartingAroundWithOpenAiApi.png">screen
shot</a> of a question I asked and the answer. Also the API is very
slow. A question like that would be displayed instantly in their app, in
my app it takes a half minute. And I have to pay for it, whereas in
their app it’s all covered by my $20 a month subscription.</p>

Alas, this infographic is deeply misleading because they cherry-picked
their data. Nvidia’s stock price is extraordinarily volatile. The log
plot of NVDA shows that on average over its history every three years it
suffers a drop of between 45% and 80%. Fortunately, over the same time
it has had much larger rises. Thus when discussing the return for being
long NVDA for a period the start and end dates matter a lot.<br />

This table shows the performance of NVDA and the S&amp;P 500 over each
of the 5-year periods in the infographic. Over three of the 5-year
periods NVDA out-performed the S&amp;P 500, and over the remaining one
it under-performed. By choosing appropriate starting points it is easy
to find other 5-year periods when NVDA under-performed the S&amp;P 500.
For example, from 8/2007 to 8/2012 NVDA returned -63.7% but the S&amp;P
returned -5.6%. Or from 11/2001 to 11/2006 NVDA returned +10.7% but the
S&amp;P returned +23.5%.<br /> <br />

<p>Although the infographic suggests that the huge out-performance
started 20 years ago and has been decreasing, this is misleading for two
reasons. First, the infographic’s numbers are for the whole 20-year
period, not for each 5-year period. Second, they are dominated by the
rise in the most recent 5-year period. The linear plot of NVDA makes it
clear that, had the most recent 5-year period been like any of the
others, Nvidia would not have been in the infographic at all.<br />
<br /> None of this is financial advice. Nevertheless, Nvidia is a great
company, and it is possible to make money in its stock. There are two
ways to do it, trading on the stock’s volatility, or buying low and
being prepared to hold it for many years.<br /> <br /> Remember, past
performance is no guarantee of future performance. If NVDA were to
repeat the past 5-year return over the next 5 years, it would be around
$3,100. To maintain its current P/E of 52.85 it would need annual
revenue of around $2.6T.<br /> <br /></p>

Ubuntu has some of the most complete support for arm64, so I went to
download a Live CD ISO I could flash to a USB stick, to install on my

Starting
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/11/eoy-letter-2024/">next
year</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our longstanding offering won’t fundamentally change next year, but we
are going to introduce a new offering that’s a big shift from anything
we’ve done before—short-lived certificates. Specifically, certificates
with a lifetime of six days. This is a big upgrade for the security of
the TLS ecosystem because it minimizes exposure time during a key
compromise event.
</p>
<p>
Because we’ve done so much to encourage automation over the past decade,
most of our subscribers aren’t going to have to do much in order to
switch to shorter lived certificates. We, on the other hand, are going
to have to think about the possibility that we will need to issue 20x as
many certificates as we do now. It’s not inconceivable that at some
point in our next decade we may need to be prepared to issue 100,000,000
certificates per day…

or something much like it, and then ask it to give me an outline of what
I wrote, and allow me to massage the outline, churn out a synopsis. I’d
like to see what’s there, and there’s far too much writing for me to do
that.”</p>

journalism I pay attention is labeling itself as <i>truth-based</i> –
but it most definitely is not. When it comes to topics I am expert in,
they tell a mushed up version of extreme points of view, that
(surprise!) favor the continued existence of their jobs. The choice of
the <i>truth-based</i> label is kind of a clue. <span

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ldc6fz4sfz2v">thread</a>
on Bluesky: “The AI industry could give us easy tools to build our own
models, from our own archived writing, for private use. This may be a
blind spot. It’s as if when personal computers started, instead of
spreadsheet editors, we were offered great sets of tabulated recalc’ing
data. Fun to watch, maybe useful for researchers, but nothing compared
to the utility of playing ‘what if’ on our own models.”</p>
