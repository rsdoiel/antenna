Certificates Coming to Let‚Äôs Encrypt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Starting
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/11/eoy-letter-2024/">next
year</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our longstanding offering won‚Äôt fundamentally change next year, but we
are going to introduce a new offering that‚Äôs a big shift from anything
we‚Äôve done before‚Äîshort-lived certificates. Specifically, certificates
with a lifetime of six days. This is a big upgrade for the security of
the TLS ecosystem because it minimizes exposure time during a key
compromise event.
</p>
<p>
Because we‚Äôve done so much to encourage automation over the past decade,
most of our subscribers aren‚Äôt going to have to do much in order to
switch to shorter lived certificates. We, on the other hand, are going
to have to think about the possibility that we will need to issue 20x as
many certificates as we do now. It‚Äôs not inconceivable that at some
point in our next decade we may need to be prepared to issue 100,000,000
certificates per day‚Ä¶
