## Why more American teenagers are rejecting driver’s licenses in favor of e-bikes

date: 2024-06-10, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/super73-header-image.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1400" /></div><p>There’s a good chance that when you were a teenager, getting your driver’s license was seen as a rite of passage, and you probably couldn’t wait for the freedom promised by that shiny new card in your credit card-less wallet. At least, that’s unless you’re a teenager today, and then the picture might not be so cut and dry. Unlike when I got my learner’s permit 20 years ago, today’s teenagers have already been enjoying a new form of affordable and effective transportation freedom: electric bikes.</p>



<p>And it’s changing the way they view getting a driver’s license.</p>
