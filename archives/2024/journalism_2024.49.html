innovation in journalism education</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I submitted my first Nieman Lab prediction, in which I
made the provocation that product management would be the new model for
journalism. I am encouraged by the thriving news product community that
has emerged over the past decade. However, journalism education, with
few exceptions, has not comprehensively responded to support this…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Last year here, I predicted TV reporters would become influencers. I
asserted that in being encouraged by stations to use social media to
build brands and bring in viewership, reporters would experience
something we call influencer creep — how being on social mandates one
act like an influencer, even if they don’t necessarily think of…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>One of the things that’s lost when the last reporter is laid off and
a local newspaper stops publishing is a sort of community muscle memory.
In May 2023, I started as the editor of Brookline.News, a startup,
nonprofit news site in Brookline, Massachusetts. It had been about a
year since the long-time local newspaper…</p>

<h2 id="the-print-revival-comes-to-news">The print revival comes to

<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>We’ve seen a swathe of print magazine launches, relaunches and
frequency increases this year, leading to the general acceptance that
there is something of a print revival. This has generally been confined
to magazines as readers turn to trusted expertise and seek physical
reading experiences. There’s no question daily newspapers will continue
their decline, but…</p>

<p>In October, Dow Jones filed a lawsuit against the generative AI

massive amount of illegal copying of publishers’ copyrighted work.” The
claim echoed similar accusations by Forbes and the New York Post earlier
this year. Perplexity’s response was swift and dismissive. “[Dow Jones]

<p>The Onion has peeled off an odious layer of hatred on the internet,

<p>We’ve covered 2024 as the fragmentation election, and media analysts
mostly assume fragmentation will continue — more and more podcasts and
Substacks and hyper-personalized TikTok accounts, and a weaker and
weaker big media. But as one of the great early internet CEOs once said,
there are only two ways to go in media: bundling and…</p>

<p>date: 2024-12-04, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>For an industry rooted in communication, journalists working in
newsrooms must improve how they communicate with each other. Is news in
its current state reaching the right audiences? Some reports would lead
us to say no. That’s why, in 2025, news organizations need to put the
“why” back in journalism decision-making. We must have an…</p>

<p>Well yes, I am more than sure that all of you have already heard of
Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the masters of ancient classical philosophy.
There would not have been a beginning without them and none of the
greatest philosophers, even of the contemporary age, would have managed
to develop a single concrete idea, think of Immanuel Kant who still
criticized Plato during the period of the Enlightenment (1750).</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fall term, the Caltech Pond Bridge was

the largest she has made to date — dubbed <em>This Moment in Time</em>.
It’s part of a larger art exhibit at Caltech called <strong>Crossing
Over: Art and Science at Caltech</strong>. Apparently, some people
couldn’t wait until December 15th to walk over the bridge, which has
been gradually sullied with footprints over the course of the term. This
came as somewhat of a disappointment to Albuquerque.</p>

declares mistrial after hung jury in trial of former UCLA child care
teacher</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>A judge declared a mistrial Monday after jurors were hung on 11
misdemeanor counts against a former UCLA Early Care and Education Center
teacher. Christopher Rodriguez, the defendant, faced prosecution for
sexual battery, false imprisonment, battery, willful cruelty to a child,
sexual penetration with foreign object and intimate touch against a
person’s will for sexual arousal.  Following an almost month-long trial,
the jury’s foreperson told judge Liliana Gonzalez that further
deliberation would be pointless, as the jury would still be hung on all
11 counts against Rodriguez, who worked at various UCLA ECE centers,
including the Krieger Center and University Village, for nearly 25
years.  Rodriguez was arrested in February on five misdemeanor charges
and was charged further in May after another child victim reported
inappropriate sexual touching at a UCLA ECE classroom.  [Related: Former
UCLA child care teacher charged with sexual battery, cruelty to a child]
The UCLA ECE centers provide care for children ages two months to six
years for UCLA-affiliated families.</p>

costing American public schools more than just time. American school
districts have spent roughly $3.2 billion toward resolving tensions over
how political issues are taught in educational spaces in the 2023-2024
school year, according to the study.</p>
