declares mistrial after hung jury in trial of former UCLA child care
teacher</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-03, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>A judge declared a mistrial Monday after jurors were hung on 11
misdemeanor counts against a former UCLA Early Care and Education Center
teacher. Christopher Rodriguez, the defendant, faced prosecution for
sexual battery, false imprisonment, battery, willful cruelty to a child,
sexual penetration with foreign object and intimate touch against a
person’s will for sexual arousal.  Following an almost month-long trial,
the jury’s foreperson told judge Liliana Gonzalez that further
deliberation would be pointless, as the jury would still be hung on all
11 counts against Rodriguez, who worked at various UCLA ECE centers,
including the Krieger Center and University Village, for nearly 25
years.  Rodriguez was arrested in February on five misdemeanor charges
and was charged further in May after another child victim reported
inappropriate sexual touching at a UCLA ECE classroom.  [Related: Former
UCLA child care teacher charged with sexual battery, cruelty to a child]
The UCLA ECE centers provide care for children ages two months to six
years for UCLA-affiliated families.</p>
