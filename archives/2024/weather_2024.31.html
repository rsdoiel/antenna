Mesoscale Discussion 1743
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1139 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...Pennsylvania...Maryland...and Virginia...including
Washington D.C.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 301639Z - 301845Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Initially isolated thunderstorms should increase in
coverage through the afternoon hours with an accompanying increase
in damaging wind potential. Watch issuance is not anticipated given
a weak kinematic environment.

DISCUSSION...GOES imagery and lightning data over the past 30-60
minutes have shown steadily deepening/intensifying convection along
a residual outflow boundary and weak surface trough from central PA
southward into VA. While ongoing convection currently appears to be
sub-severe based on MRMS hail metrics and regional velocity data,
temperatures warming into the low 80s should promote SBCAPE values
up to 2000 J/kg that will likely result in additional thunderstorm
development as well as some degree of intensification through the
day with an attendant potential for damaging wind gusts. Given weak
deep-layer flow over the region, overall convective intensity will
likely be influenced primarily by low-level heating/destabilization.
This will be modulated by how quickly residual low-level stratus can
clear ahead of developing storms. If stronger diurnal heating can be
achieved (i.e. surface temperatures into the mid/upper 80s) then
higher SBCAPE (possibly up to 3000 J/kg) and steeper low-level lapse
rates will likely favor more intense convection with a relatively
higher damaging wind threat. Regardless, watch issuance is not
anticipated given the meager deep-layer wind shear and uncertainty
regarding the thermodynamic environment.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Valid 301630Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE MID MISSOURI VALLEY INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY/MIDWEST...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected today into tonight across a broad
area from eastern Nebraska and Iowa into parts of the Midwest,
Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians, with multiple swaths of
damaging winds likely within this corridor. Severe thunderstorms are
also possible across parts of the northern Plains.

...Mid Missouri Valley into the Midwest/Ohio Valley/Southeast...
A larger than usual amount of uncertainty remains regarding
convective evolution this afternoon though tonight. Ongoing cluster
in southern IA will move southeastward across the mid MS Valley into
a rapidly destabilizing airmass with enhanced northwesterly winds at
mid/upper-levels supporting sufficient deep-layer shear for
continued updraft organization. A swath of severe/damaging winds
appears likely with this cluster given the favorable parameter
space. Therefore, the Enhanced Risk for damaging winds has been
extended southeastward to account for the forecast evolution of this
MCS. Another ongoing cluster over the lower OH Valley should also
pose some threat for severe/damaging winds as it and associated
outflow on its southwest flank spreads east-southeastward across KY
and perhaps parts of TN the rest of this afternoon/evening.

Additional robust thunderstorm development appears possible through
the period in a broad corridor from central/eastern NE through the
lower OH Valley and Southeast, with swaths of damaging winds likely
the main threat. Details on where/when this activity will develop
remain rather uncertain. But, isolated supercells may develop across
central/eastern NE late this afternoon/evening in the vicinity of a
surface low/lee trough. Very large hail may occur with this
convection, with a greater threat for severe/damaging winds possible
if this activity can grow upscale into another cluster and spread
southeastward across the mid MO and mid MS Valleys this
evening/overnight.

...Northern Plains...
Weak mid-level height falls amid moderate to strong instability
should foster to widely scattered thunderstorm development along a
surface trough/dryline across parts of the Dakotas this afternoon.
Moderate mid-level westerlies should support deep-layer shear around
30-35 kt, sufficient for a few organized storms, including a few
supercells, capable of both large hail and damaging gusts this
afternoon and evening.

...Mid-Atlantic Vicinity...
A weak mid/upper-level trough and will move across the
Mid-Atlantic and vicinity through this evening. Scattered
thunderstorm development should continue this afternoon from VA into
parts of PA. While there is some uncertainty regarding the extent of
heating and destabilization due to lingering cloudiness, a couple of
stronger cells/clusters may become capable of producing isolated
damaging winds.

...Northeast...
Weak to locally moderate instability may develop this afternoon from
parts of northern New York into northern New England. While storm
coverage remains uncertain, deep-layer shear and relatively cool
temperatures aloft could support a couple of modestly organized
thunderstorms capable of locally damaging winds, and possibly some
hail.

1131 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

The current forecast remains on-track with no necessary updates or
changes. See previous discussion for further detail.

..Halbert/Squitieri.. 07/30/2024

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will move eastward across the northern Rockies and
adjacent Plains during the day. Along/south of the trough, moderate
west-southwesterly midlevel flow will overspread the Great Basin
into the northern/central Rockies.

...Dry Thunderstorms - Northern Rockies/Intermountain West...
Large-scale ascent accompanying the midlevel trough will promote
widely scattered thunderstorms across portions of ID and western MT
during the afternoon and evening. While 0.6-0.9 inch PW will favor a
mix of wet/dry thunderstorms, 25-35 mph storm motions may tend to
limit overall rainfall in any given area. Nevertheless,
lightning-induced ignitions will be possible on the peripheries of
rain cores, given dry fuels across the area.

...Dry/Windy - Great Basin into the Central Rockies...
Deep boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced flow aloft will yield
5-10 percent RH and 15-20 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds from southern UT into WY -- with the strongest winds expected
over WY. These dry/breezy conditions atop modestly receptive fuels
will favor elevated fire-weather conditions during the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1742
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0909 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of southern Illinois and southern Indiana
into north-central Kentucky

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 567...

Valid 301409Z - 301615Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 567
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms posing a damaging wind risk will
persist across southern Illinois within Severe Thunderstorm Watch
567. Areas across southern Indiana into adjacent north-central
Kentucky are being monitored for possible downstream watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A small, but well organized bowing cluster of storms
continues to track east/southeast across south-central Illinois this
morning. This activity has produced gusts near 50 kt within the past
hour. Around 30 kt effective shear magnitudes are likely sustaining
organized activity as convection shifts east/southeast along an
instability gradient oriented northwest to southeast across the
lower Ohio Valley vicinity. A very moist downstream airmass is
evident, with surface dewpoints in the 70s. With continued heating,
boundary-layer inhibition is expected to quickly erode by midday.
Damaging gusts may continue downstream of ongoing activity,
especially if additional convection can develop on the southern
flank of the ongoing cluster. Visible satellite imagery shows
deepening cumulus ahead of the southern flank, so this evolution
appears plausible. A downstream watch may be needed within the next
hour or so if current trends persist/increase.

Mesoscale Discussion 1741
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0847 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Areas affected...portions of southern Iowa...northern Missouri...and
extreme west-central Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 301347Z - 301515Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging gusts are possible this morning and afternoon as
a cluster of storms tracks southeast across southern Iowa into
northern Missouri and extreme west-central Illinois. A watch may be
needed this morning, though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...A well organized cluster of storms currently moving
into central Iowa has produced gusts near 50 kt within the past 30
minutes or so. This activity may be somewhat elevated in the wake of
overnight convection. Nevertheless, 35-45 kt effective shear
magnitudes and MLCAPE around 1000-1500 J/kg will likely maintain
organization. While outflow from overnight convection has surged
southward to near I-70 in Missouri, the airmass has shown signs of
quick recovery, with surface dewpoints in the mid/upper 60s F noted
in 13z surface obs. Clear skies ahead of the cluster will also allow
for quick heating through the morning hours. As a result, downstream
destabilization and erosion of capping is expected. 

The ongoing cluster of storms may continue to gradually intensify
and pose a risk for damaging gusts into late morning/early afternoon
as the downstream airmass continue to recover/destabilize. Given the
effect of overnight convection on the airmass, there is some
uncertainty in convective evolution and timing of possible watch
issuance. Nevertheless, it appears possible a severe thunderstorm
watch could be needed this morning across parts of the discussion
area.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0804 AM CDT Tue Jul 30 2024

Valid 301300Z - 311200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MIDDLE MISSOURI VALLEY/MIDWEST...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS TO THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are expected today into tonight across a broad area
from eastern Nebraska and Iowa into parts of the Midwest, Tennessee
Valley and southern Appalachians, with swaths of damaging winds
possible within this corridor. Severe storms are also possible
across parts of the northern Plains.

...Central Plains/Upper Midwest to OH/TN Valleys...
Very challenging meteorological scenario with highly variable
guidance as far as MCS development/disposition today. However, a
rather favorable set of ingredients will generally coincide,
spanning east/northeast Nebraska into Iowa, northern Missouri and
western Illinois, and to some extent even farther southeastward into
the Tennessee Valley. Very strong buoyancy will exist within this
MCS/outflow-reinforced corridor, with a strong elevated mixed layer
-- yet not overly warm aloft for the season -- atop a moist boundary
layer. Seasonally strong west-northwesterly winds aloft will also
reside in this general corridor, with potential for multiple
east/southeastward-moving MCSs today and tonight. Swath of damaging
wind gusts (potentially in excess of 75 mph) are plausible.

With a remnant thunderstorm cluster across Illinois, some
re-intensification of this convection may occur across the lower
Ohio Valley toward the Tennessee Valley, with a modestly strong
northwesterly flow regime and ample downstream instability. Isolated
to scattered damaging wind should be the primary threat. 

Meanwhile, multiple thunderstorm clusters across Siouxland this
morning from southeast South Dakota into northwest/western Iowa may
continue to pose a severe risk, with some potential that these
storms could merge/organize later today along the instability
gradient. There is also potential that additional storm development
may occur by late afternoon/early evening across northern
Nebraska/far southern South Dakota near a surface low/troughs, with
these storms potentially increasing and evolving into an MCS
tonight, aided by a nocturnally strengthening low-level jet.

...Northern Plains...
Weak height falls amid moderate to strong instability may lead to
widely scattered thunderstorm development along a surface
trough/dryline across the Dakotas this afternoon. Moderate
westerlies should support moderate deep-layer vertical shear around
30-35 kt, sufficient for a few organized storms capable of both
large hail and damaging gusts.

...Northern New York to northern New England...
Moderate buoyancy may develop this afternoon from northern New York
into northern New England. While storm coverage remains somewhat
uncertain, deep-layer shear and relatively cool temperatures aloft
could support a couple modestly organized storms capable of locally
damaging wind, and possibly some hail. 

...Mid-Atlantic vicinity...
A mid/upper-level trough and possibly an MCV will move across the
Mid Atlantic vicinity later today. Scattered thunderstorm
development is expected by afternoon from northern Virginia into
parts of Pennsylvania. While there is some uncertainty regarding the
extent of heating and destabilization, a couple stronger
cells/clusters may become capable of producing isolated damaging
winds.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Mon Jul 29 2024

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will advance eastward across the northern Rockies
and adjacent High Plains during the day, while broad/enhanced
west-southwesterly flow aloft persists across the Great Basin.

...Northern Rockies/Intermountain West... 
Large-scale ascent accompanying the eastward-moving midlevel trough
will promote widely scattered thunderstorms across portions of the
northern Rockies/Intermountain West into the northern Plains during
the afternoon and evening. While many of these storms will be
capable of producing measurable rainfall, quick eastward-moving
storms (around 25-35 mph) will still favor a mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms over dry fuels. As a result, some lightning-induced
ignitions will be possible -- especially along the peripheries of
any rain cores.

...Great Basin...
Boundary-layer mixing into the modestly enhanced west-southwesterly
flow aloft will lead to locally dry/breezy conditions across parts
of the Great Basin during the afternoon. While locally elevated
conditions are possible, winds should be slightly weaker than the
day prior, and the overall threat appears too localized for an
Elevated area at this time.
