<p>Anyone can build on an open format. That‚Äôs part of what it means for
it to be open. Developers and users are free to use anyone‚Äôs ideas, or
not use them, even if they claim to be the Holy Church of Some Open
Format. No one can form an organization that owns the future of the open
format because then it wouldn‚Äôt be open.</p>

<h1 id="2024-12-09-ed-is-the-standard">
2024-12-09 ed is the standard
</h1>
<p>
<code>ed</code> is <a href="true-path">the standard editor</a>, they
say. I have strange fascination with it.
</p>
<p>
<code>ed</code> is a window in the past. This is a line-based editor,
not a screen-based editor. It can be used with a line-printer instead of
a screen. This also means that working with it is very different. I‚Äôll
try to collect some interesting command sequences on this page.
</p>
<p>
I use <code>ed</code> to send mail from the command line. One way I do
this is by using <code>mail</code> on the server. It‚Äôs a line-oriented
mail client. You can use any editor with it, but the default feels very
close to <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<p>
When I started reading newsgroups again, I used <code>tin</code> and
made it use <code>ed</code> as the editor.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, it‚Äôs growing on me. üòÖ
</p>
<p>
And I‚Äôm not alone! On fedi, I‚Äôm following
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@aartaka" title="@aartaka@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="aartaka">@aartaka</span></a> who
occasionally posts things about <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<p>
And so, in order to get better with it, I decided to write this page. I
expect to be adding to it.
</p>
<h2 id="documentation">
Documentation
</h2>
<p>
Try <code>man ed</code> or <code>info ed</code> to learn more about the
commands available to you within <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://io.mwl.io/@mwl" title="@mwl@io.mwl.io"><span
class="citation" data-cites="mwl">@mwl</span></a>. wrote
<a href="https://mwl.io/nonfiction/tools#ed">Ed Mastery</a> which
motivated me to get into <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="create-a-new-file">
Create a new file
</h2>
<p>
Start <code>ed</code> without a file name. You‚Äôll be editing ‚Äúlines‚Äù in
a ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
The commands to use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>i</code> to insert a few lines
</li>
<li>
<code>.</code> on a line by itself ends the insertion of lines
</li>
<li>
<code>w filename</code> writes the buffer to a file (and prints the
number of bytes written)
</li>
<li>
<code>q</code> quits the editor
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed
i
Hello World!

This is a letter from me to you.
.
w hello.txt
47
q
</code></pre>
<h2 id="edit-an-existing-file">
Edit an existing file
</h2>
<p>
When we provide ed with a filename, it is read into the buffer (and the
number of bytes read are printed). The current line is the last line of
the buffer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>a</code> appends new lines after the current line
</li>
<li>
<code>.</code> on a line by itself ends the appending of lines
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed hello.txt 
47
.
This is a letter from me to you.
a

And that was it!
.
w
65
</code></pre>
<p>
Now, <code>ed</code> is line-oriented and so we can provide line numbers
and line ranges to our commands. If you omit a line number or the range,
these commands apply to the current line only. A range is two
comma-separated line numbers. If you omit numbers, defaults are ‚Äúfrom
the first line‚Äù and ‚Äúto the last line‚Äù. Thus, a single comma means ‚Äúall
the lines‚Äù. <code>$</code> is always the last line.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>p</code> prints the lines
</li>
<li>
<code>n</code> numbers the lines
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are all equivalent:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>1,5p</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>1,$p</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>,p</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So now let‚Äôs number the lines and then append to the first paragraph.
Use <code>n</code> to find the right line number to append to, and use
<code>p</code> at the end to proofread.
</p>
<pre><code>,n

Hello World!

This is a letter from me to you.
It's pretty short, I know. I didn't have enough time to make it longer.

And that was it!
</code></pre>
<p>
Notice how we could only append new lines after the third line. We
couldn‚Äôt append new words to the third line itself. What we can do is
join two lines, though. Unfortunately, that doesn‚Äôt add a space!
</p>
<p>
One option is to add a single line containing a space. The other option
is to use a substitution to add a space. That‚Äôs what we will use.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>s/from/to/</code> replaces regular expression <code>from</code>
with string <code>to</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>j</code> joins lines in the range
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Knowing that this concerns lines 3 and 4 there is no need to use
<code>n</code>.

<p>
There is no way to process the buffer with external tools, but there is
a way to do it with the current file.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>w</code> writes the file

<li>
<code>e</code> edits a filename, replacing the current buffer; or if the
argument starts with an exclamation mark, executes the command and
replaces the buffer with the output

<h2 id="trust-issues-in-ai">Trust Issues in AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, updated: 2024-12-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
For a technology that seems startling in its modernity, AI sure has a
long history. Google Translate, OpenAI chatbots, and Meta AI image
generators are built on decades of advancements in linguistics, signal
processing, statistics, and other fields going back to the early days of
computing‚Äîand, often, on seed funding from the U.S. Department of
Defense. But today‚Äôs tools are hardly the intentional product of the
diverse generations of innovators that came before. We agree with
Morozov that the ‚Äúrefuseniks,‚Äù as he
<a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/forum/the-ai-we-deserve/">calls</a>
them, are wrong to see AI as ‚Äúirreparably tainted‚Äù by its origins. AI is
better understood as a creative, global field of human endeavor that has
been largely captured by U.S. venture capitalists, private equity, and
Big Tech. But that was never the inevitable outcome, and it doesn‚Äôt need
to stay that way‚Ä¶

<h2 id="burned">2024-12-09 Burned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Alex Schroeder‚Äôs Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-12-09-burned">
2024-12-09 Burned
</h1>
<p>
This page is about me burning myself on a Raclette table-grill.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm no longer quite sure of the timeline. I think I got the burn on
2024-12-03 or 2024-12-04.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-05</strong>: Two days ago I got myself a second degree
burn about one inch in diameter from our Raclette oven. I hadn‚Äôt burned
myself in about forty years, I think and I feel like a kid again,
observing the body as it reacts. The healing powers are so weird.
</p>
<p>
Also I‚Äôm thankful for these self-healing capabilities we have! And
thankful for this accident to be a curiosity instead of an emergency. A
good reminder to be thankful for all the good days we have and I hope
you‚Äôre having a good day! Live long and prosper. Or, as I usually tell
me wife: healthy, happy, and in love. Be well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-07</strong>: I went to the pharmacy and got a
disinfectant cream and wound pads. This was Saturday afternoon and no
more doctors were available. Since this isn‚Äôt an emergency, there‚Äôs no
rush.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-09</strong>: The minor burn resulted in some sort of
low-key infection, so now it‚Äôs antibiotic to swallow and antibiotics to
apply.
</p>
<p>
Some things I‚Äôm learning from this experience: The burn might look like
a typical abrasion but you have to keep it super clean. Best cover it
with those special wound covers that don‚Äôt stick to the wound (nothing
we would have had at home so off to the pharmacy you go, immediately,
unlike me). It might look dry and clean like blisters you got from a
long hike but the bedsheets or long sleeves or whatever will pass on
germs and since there is a piece of your exterior protection missing,
you‚Äôll get an infection. The skin around the wound is a bit red, the
area a bit swollen, a bit warmer. And that already concerns the doctors.

like an idiot I thought that‚Äôs what they wanted, instead it was an
ambush, people mostly wanting to ridicule me because they thought
anything that a person does can‚Äôt be any good, it has to come from a big
company like Mozilla or Google. I thought then and still do now, how do
they justify wasting their time on such a ridiculous thing. I kept on
doing what I was doing, but switched off their browser first chance I
got.‚Äù If they really want to get behind projects that make the open web
stronger, I‚Äôd be happy to help guide them, but only if they‚Äôve sobered
up and take that mission statement seriously, instead of just as a
justification for holding on to their jobs a little bit longer.</p>
