<h2 id="burned">2024-12-09 Burned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-12-09-burned">
2024-12-09 Burned
</h1>
<p>
This page is about me burning myself on a Raclette table-grill.
</p>
<p>
I’m no longer quite sure of the timeline. I think I got the burn on
2024-12-03 or 2024-12-04.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-05</strong>: Two days ago I got myself a second degree
burn about one inch in diameter from our Raclette oven. I hadn’t burned
myself in about forty years, I think and I feel like a kid again,
observing the body as it reacts. The healing powers are so weird.
</p>
<p>
Also I’m thankful for these self-healing capabilities we have! And
thankful for this accident to be a curiosity instead of an emergency. A
good reminder to be thankful for all the good days we have and I hope
you’re having a good day! Live long and prosper. Or, as I usually tell
me wife: healthy, happy, and in love. Be well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-07</strong>: The skin around the burn had reddened and
had swollen a bit. I went to the pharmacy and got a disinfectant cream
and wound pads. This was Saturday afternoon and no more doctors were
available. Since this wasn’t an emergency, there’s was rush.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-12-09</strong>: The minor burn resulted in some sort of
low-key infection, so now it’s antibiotic to swallow and antibiotics to
apply.
</p>
<p>
Some things I’m learning from this experience:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I knew about cold, running water and left my arm under that cold tap for
many long minutes. Maybe not long enough? I don’t know. It felt ready to
fall off. 😆
</li>
<li>
The burn might look like a typical abrasion but you have to keep it
super clean. Best cover it with those special wound covers that don’t
stick to the wound (nothing we would have had at home so off to the
pharmacy you go, immediately, unlike me).
</li>
<li>
It might look dry and clean like blisters you got from a long hike but
the bedsheets or long sleeves or whatever will pass on germs and since
there is a piece of your exterior protection missing, you’ll get an
infection. The skin around the wound is a bit red, the area a bit
swollen, a bit warmer. And that already concerns the doctors.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Syria yesterday took
oxygen away from the airing of President-elect Trump’s interview with
Kristen Welker of NBC’S Meet the Press. The interview told us little
that we didn’t already know, but it did reinforce what we can expect in
the new administration.</p>

<h2 id="ed-is-the-standard">2024-12-09 ed is the standard</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-10, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-12-09-ed-is-the-standard">
2024-12-09 ed is the standard
</h1>
<p>
<code>ed</code> is <a href="true-path">the standard editor</a>, they
say. I have strange fascination with it.
</p>
<p>
<code>ed</code> is a window in the past. This is a line-based editor,
not a screen-based editor. It can be used with a line-printer instead of
a screen. This also means that working with it is very different. I’ll
try to collect some interesting command sequences on this page.
</p>
<p>
I use <code>ed</code> to send mail from the command line. One way I do
this is by using <code>mail</code> on the server. It’s a line-oriented
mail client. You can use any editor with it, but the default feels very
close to <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<p>
When I started reading newsgroups again, I used <code>tin</code> and
made it use <code>ed</code> as the editor.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, it’s growing on me. 😅
</p>
<p>
And I’m not alone! On fedi, I’m following
<a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@aartaka" title="@aartaka@merveilles.town"><span
class="citation" data-cites="aartaka">@aartaka</span></a> who
occasionally posts things about <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<p>
And so, in order to get better with it, I decided to write this page. I
expect to be adding to it.
</p>
<p>
Also check out
<a href="https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/actually-using-ed/">Actually using

Try <code>man ed</code> or <code>info ed</code> to learn more about the
commands available to you within <code>ed</code>.

class="citation" data-cites="mwl">@mwl</span></a>. wrote
<a href="https://mwl.io/nonfiction/tools#ed">Ed Mastery</a> which
motivated me to get into <code>ed</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="create-a-new-file">
Create a new file
</h2>
<p>
Start <code>ed</code> without a file name. You’ll be editing “lines” in
a “buffer”.
</p>
<p>
The commands to use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>i</code> to insert a few lines
</li>
<li>
<code>.</code> on a line by itself ends the insertion of lines
</li>
<li>
<code>w filename</code> writes the buffer to a file (and prints the
number of bytes written)
</li>
<li>
<code>q</code> quits the editor
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed
i
Hello World!

This is a letter from me to you.
.
w hello.txt
47
q
</code></pre>
<h2 id="edit-an-existing-file">
Edit an existing file
</h2>
<p>
When we provide ed with a filename, it is read into the buffer (and the
number of bytes read are printed). The current line is the last line of
the buffer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>a</code> appends new lines after the current line
</li>
<li>
<code>.</code> on a line by itself ends the appending of lines
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed hello.txt 
47
.
This is a letter from me to you.
a

And that was it!
.
w
65
</code></pre>
<p>
Now, <code>ed</code> is line-oriented and so we can provide line numbers
and line ranges to our commands. If you omit a line number or the range,
these commands apply to the current line only. A range is two
comma-separated line numbers. If you omit numbers, defaults are “from
the first line” and “to the last line”. Thus, a single comma means “all
the lines”. <code>$</code> is always the last line. Relative addressing
with negative offsets like <code>-1</code> and positive offsets like
<code>+1</code> works as well.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>p</code> prints the lines
</li>
<li>
<code>n</code> numbers the lines
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are all equivalent:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>1,5p</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>1,$p</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>,p</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So now let’s number the lines and then append to the first paragraph.
Use <code>n</code> to find the right line number to append to, and use
<code>p</code> at the end to proofread.
</p>
<pre><code>,n

It's pretty short, I know. I didn't have enough time to make it longer.

And that was it!
</code></pre>
<p>
Notice how we could only append new lines after the third line. We
couldn’t append new words to the third line itself. What we can do is
join two lines, though. Unfortunately, that doesn’t add a space!
</p>
<p>
One option is to add a single line containing a space. The other option
is to use a substitution to add a space. That’s what we will use.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>s/from/to/</code> replaces regular expression <code>from</code>
with string <code>to</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>j</code> joins lines in the range
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Knowing that this concerns lines 3 and 4 there is no need to use
<code>n</code>.

<h2 id="processing-with-other-tools">
Processing with other tools
</h2>
<p>
There is no way to process the buffer with external tools, but there is
a way to do it with the current file.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>w</code> writes the file
</li>
<li>
<code>e</code> edits a filename, replacing the current buffer; or if the
argument starts with an exclamation mark, executes the command and
replaces the buffer with the output
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>w

<h2 id="to-insert-some-command-output">
To insert some command output

<p>
I like to start my blog posts with a level one heading, a date, and some
text. Here’s how I would insert a date. Note the invisible space after
the <code>#</code>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>r</code> reads lines from a filename, inserting them into the
current buffer; or if the argument starts with an exclamation mark,
executes the command and inserts the lines from the output into the

</ul>

<h2 id="using-the-buffer-as-a-workspace">
Using the buffer as a workspace
</h2>
<p>
OK, I know this is weird. But in theory we can think of the buffer as a
huge one-dimensional workspace. We can insert lines from files and
process output here and there, and we can write line ranges to files.
</p>
<p>
Here we are writing a haiku, don’t like the last line, insert a new
third line and then write just the first three lines to the file. The
fourth line not saved but it is still available in the buffer.
</p>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ed

</code></pre>
<p>
In this sense it’s unclear what the default filename of the buffer is.
It’s the one-dimensional desktop!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>f</code> prints the default filename, or sets it if a filename is
provided
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>f
haiku.txt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="using-marks-and-line-arithmetic">
Using marks and line arithmetic
</h2>
<p>
Perhaps working with the buffer as a long, one-dimensional workspace
makes more sense if you drop markers as you work with files. Use
<code>k</code> followed by a lower case letter.
</p>
<p>
Here we insert a first haiku, mark the first line, insert a new haiku,
mark its beginning, and then we print the two, using the marks and some
line arithmetic.
</p>
<pre><code>r haiku.txt

<h2 id="hit-enter-too-soon">

<p>
Something I do often enough: I hit the Enter key when I didn’t mean to.
Fix it by beginning the new line with a space. Finish the line, and join
the previous line with the current line:
</p>
<pre><code>i

<p>I’ve got the
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/09/bingeworthyScreenShot.png">new
version of Bingeworthy</a> running here. When I saw how the database
code worked, I had to redo it from scratch. It was probably my first SQL
project, and I barely knew what I was doing. It’s too bad, because
looking at it from that point of view I could see how SQL could have
been much simpler by making some of the optional features automatic. A
higher layer on top of SQL is possible, it seems to me. Having ChatGPT
review my ideas has been invaluable in this project. I’m going to use it
myself for a while, and see how I want to reorganize the user interface.
There were opportunities for factoring I didn’t take back then because I
was in a rush to do something else.</p>

<h2 id="trust-issues-in-ai">Trust Issues in AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, updated: 2024-12-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
For a technology that seems startling in its modernity, AI sure has a
long history. Google Translate, OpenAI chatbots, and Meta AI image
generators are built on decades of advancements in linguistics, signal
processing, statistics, and other fields going back to the early days of
computing—and, often, on seed funding from the U.S. Department of
Defense. But today’s tools are hardly the intentional product of the
diverse generations of innovators that came before. We agree with
Morozov that the “refuseniks,” as he
<a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/forum/the-ai-we-deserve/">calls</a>
them, are wrong to see AI as “irreparably tainted” by its origins. AI is
better understood as a creative, global field of human endeavor that has
been largely captured by U.S. venture capitalists, private equity, and
Big Tech. But that was never the inevitable outcome, and it doesn’t need
to stay that way…

has repositioned itself as “a global crew of activists, technologists
and builders, all working to keep the internet free, open and
accessible.” These are all worthy goals, but in my experience Mozilla
has been an <i>obstacle</i> to these things. I wrote in a
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@dave@social.masto.land/113617569413777710">comment</a>
on Mastodon, “A long time ago they invited me to present my ideas, and
like an idiot I thought that’s what they wanted, instead it was an
ambush, people mostly wanting to ridicule me because they thought
anything that a person does can’t be any good, it has to come from a big
company like Mozilla or Google. I thought then and still do now, how do
they justify wasting their time on such a ridiculous thing. I kept on
doing what I was doing, but switched off their browser first chance I
got.” If they really want to get behind projects that make the open web
stronger, I’d be happy to help guide them, but only if they’ve sobered
up and take that mission statement seriously, instead of just as a
justification for holding on to their jobs a little bit longer.</p>
