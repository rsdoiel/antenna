<p>Here’s what the snag was. We were low on storage starting at the
beginning and eventually we ran out of space, and the error messages we
got indicated the problem was something else. All the searching we did,
none of the hits, or ChatGPT suggested looking at memory usage. Quite
independently after thrashing around trying various theories, we finally
got a message from the Digital Ocean service saying the server was out
of space. When I doubled the space, that gave it enough room to do the
tasks we had for it. Now running the last query. Looks like we may be
over the hump. Let’s just pray the software runs when we turn the server
back on. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span></p>

“Cats are on the march in NYC, on 8th Ave between 57th and 45th streets.
Thousands of cats carrying signs and handing out leaflets saying ‘Cats
are people too!’ and ‘Up with Cats!’ – they are angry but there’s a
sense of celebration in the march, that finally the time has come for
cats.”

The first version had one of the themes as “Down with Dogs!” but ChatGPT
rejected that as not being nice enough. So I changed it to “Up with
Cats!” Please keep that in mind.

<p>Maybe you read about them in the papers–amateur astronomers in Japan,
Russia, France, Finland, and the United States have been pulling
all-nighters to spot extraordinary exoplanets, planets orbiting stars
other than the Sun.  NASA’s UNITE project holds these planetary
stakeouts several times every month, and you can join in! This October,
the UNITE team undertook a […]</p>

<p>I have a server that handles all my old sites, and it needs to be
replaced, so I’m trying to figure out where to put all the sites. Most
are really small, 10 or fewer files. But
<a href="http://outline.land/treefun">outline.land/treefun</a> was large

many of my little experiments.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-02, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is the 23rd edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where
I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today
we have Winnie Lim and her blog,
<a href="https://winnielim.org">winnielim.org</a>
</p>
<p>
I first discovered Winnie’s website thanks to the recomendation of
<a href="https://longest.voyage">Jamie Crisman</a> who’s been featured
on the series a couple of months ago. I had her site listed on my
spreadheet and was planning to contact her so imagine my surprise when
she appeared as a supporter on my Ko-Fi page! It was such a delightful
moment. I love to be able to feature people who are supporters of the
series because it gives this fun project a sense of community.

</p>
<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
This is Winnie, and I’m from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Singapore</a> where
I’ve spent most of my life except a few years when I worked in San
Francisco. I was a self-taught designer in both print and digital from
2000-2016 before I had to quit due to chronic migraines and
photosensitivity.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have any hobbies per se in the sense of things I enjoy doing
because I seem to
<a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/my-mind-the-invisible-loudspeaker/">lack
the ability to feel pleasure</a>, but I do a variety of things that
enrich me: reading, exercise, photography, learning, and I am trying to
pick up drawing. Perhaps one day I would like to learn how to play the
keyboard.
</p>
<p>
I try to publish at least once a week, mostly documenting my life and
struggles with both my health and existence.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I got really into learning how to make websites when I had my first
computer at 15 all the way back in 1996. So my first website was on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">Geocities</a>. It felt
like a natural progression to start blogging when I saw other people
start doing it in the late 90s. My first blog was on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter_(software)">Greymatter</a>
on a now defunct domain. I would just post links to websites I liked and
perhaps some emo poetry. A while later my friend introduced me to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal">Livejournal</a>,
which is interesting to me till this day because the inherent culture
and dynamics of it encouraged people to pour out their feelings on it. I
don’t know if I am rewriting my own history but I feel like Livejournal
was instrumental in the process in setting the tone of my writing till
today. It gave me the idea that writing my feelings out to some
invisible audience could be somewhat therapeutic. One thing that is now
permanently gone from the Livejournal era is the ability to easily
follow and like your friend’s blog, and publish only to your network of
friends. I hope something like this can exist on federated systems one
day.
</p>
<p>
Sadly Livejournal got sold, and I moved to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(blogging_platform)">Vox</a>,
which also got sold, then to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous">Posterous</a> – well
you get the idea. I finally bought the domain winnielim.org sometime in
2012 and set up my blog there. I had loved the network effects and
community of early twitter, so when Medium came along I got a job there,
hence publishing exclusively there for a while, continued even after I
left the job but stopped when it started putting up paywalls. My
personal lived history of the internet has taught me it is really
important to have our own domain. It is not just about the ownership of
content but it is sad when urls go dead.
</p>
<p>
I felt very alienated and lonely as a young person in the 1990s. It was
incredible to discover the internet and know there is an entire world
out there, that there are actually many people living diverse lives that
were not visible or encouraged in Singapore. Reading people’s vulnerable
and honest writing on their blogs made me feel like I was not alone. So
I try to pay it forward by doing the same with my writing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Since 2013 I mostly just turn up every Sunday, and start writing. Half
the time I have no idea what I’m writing about till I finish writing it.
The other times I have an idea but it becomes something else entirely in
the writing process. They call it intuitive writing I guess. Once in a
long while I write <a href="https://winnielim.org/book-reviews/">book
reviews</a> or essays to share something in a more structured way. Those
take considerable focus and multiple-sittings, so I don’t do it very
often.
</p>
<p>
I do publish more frequently than weekly if I get inspired or if
circumstances encourage it, like my recent trip to Japan where I tried
to <a href="https://winnielim.org/tag/japan2023/">travel blog during the
trip</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried writing “proper” pieces before where there is a ton of
editing and proofreading by other people, but I didn’t enjoy the
process. It made me feel disconnected from the writing. Some of these
pieces did very well, which made me realise that being able to write
however I want is more important than views.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I do believe that physical space influences creativity. I constantly
feel inspired in a place like Japan, where the culture itself has
aesthetic and creative elements. But I also believe it is important to
cultivate a capacity to be creative anywhere, because sometimes in life
we get caught in circumstances and environments that are not ideal.
</p>
<p>
I try to keep my entire home a creative environment. It is not one of
those beautiful minimalistic environments like you see in youtube
videos. It is more like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakka">zakka style</a>, where it
contains things that feel creative to me: lots of
(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/launshae">my partner</a>’s) artwork
hung up on the walls, tons of books, art materials and tools, a warm and
cosy space that feels psychologically safe. A lot of it is thanks to my
partner who is an artist and an efficient organiser.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I use <a href="https://opalstack.com/">Opalstack</a> as my webhost, they
offer VPS-like hosting but managed. I chose them because I used to use
Webfaction, which got sold. For a few years in between I hosted my
website on a droplet at Digital Ocean, but I decided managing my own
server is too tedious.
</p>
<p>
Like many others I use
<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> for my domains. It
was highly recommended in the 2000s, so I used it and stuck with it
since I have no issues with it so far.
</p>
<p>
For the beginning few years my blog in its current incarnation was on
Jekyll, but it is now on Wordpress because I want to be able to
dynamically query it like
<a href="https://winnielim.org/experiments/website/this-website-as-a-learning-and-reflection-tool/">I
am querying my second brain</a>. I also use a plugin called
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pods/">Pods</a> that allows me to
create custom post types and surface relationships between them easily.
Everything is connected, and I want to demonstrate and understand these
connections. A blog post is not just a piece of writing to me. It is a
piece of my self, and these pieces track the process of my becoming.
Sometimes
<a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/remembering-forgotten-lessons-and-selves/">I
forget and I get lost</a>, so these pieces and connections help to
<a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/returning-to-ones-core/">bring me
back</a> to who I am and who I aspired to be. These are not things that
a static website can do, so I stay with Wordpress despite its obvious
issues.
</p>
<p>
It is also important to use something that has proven stability and
longevity.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I would host my own website using the same domain right from the start.
But given the highly-ephemeral and experimental nature of the web back
then, I think it would have been challenging not to hop on new
technologies and platforms, especially because I have an experimental
nature. But I am envious of blogs who ignored all of those things and
persistently stayed on their own domain or even on Blogger. It is such a
magnificent thing to see an archive that spans decades because on the
internet we create and destroy content like it doesn’t matter since it
is so easy to do so. Witnessing some permanence is beautiful when
everything is so transient.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
For now Opalstack is $115 a year, and it costs $15 to renew my domain.
These costs increase every now and then. So roughly it is about $11 a
month, which is about 2 cups of coffee.
</p>
<p>
When I first quit my job I tried to use Patreon to gather monetary
support, not so much for my writing but for my interactive experiments.
However along with my chronic illness, that experience made me realise I
don’t have the personality required for this. I am too afraid of
rejection, and it also makes me deeply uncomfortable to the point of
being perpetually anxious when people <em>do</em> support me. It felt
stressful to try to upkeep something to some invisible expectations, and
during times when I fell sick and was unable to work on my projects I
felt like I was letting people down.
</p>

I do understand when people monetise blogs, but I hope it can be a model
where some people are supporting the content financially in order for
everybody else to read it free. This is because there is already deep
inequality in this world, and putting content behind pay walls is
exacerbating that inequality.
</p>
<p>
Having freely accessible information on the internet during the 90s
impacted my life so deeply, a major contributor to my career. I know it
changed so many people’s lives, and lifted people out of their poor
living circumstances. However I understand that it is the only source of
income for some people and paywalls are the only way to go for them. I
am encouraged by examples of people who are successful with the
some-supporters-pay-for-the-rest model though, like
<a href="https://kottke.org/members/">kottke.org</a>.

<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I love a ton of blogs – I have hundreds of blogs on my rss reader – so
it is difficult to pick a few, but if I really have to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://brainbaking.com/">Brain Baking</a>: Wouter writes
widely and deeply, a quality I really appreciate on the internet.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://ruk.ca/">Peter Rukavina</a>: classic example of
blogging that is rare these days – frequent, slice of life updates.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://popagandhi.com/">Popagandhi</a>: Adrianna has been a
huge inspiration for me because she has been writing transparently and
vulnerably since the early 2000s. She was writing about lgbtq when it
was still considered taboo (at least in Singapore), and till today
continues to write on some potentially divisive topics.
<a href="https://popagandhi.com/2005/01/the-eight-ages-of-a-woman/">Some
of her early writing</a> has this heartbreaking poetic quality.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-eli-mellen">another</a> vote for
<a href="https://maya.land/">maya.land</a>: I’ve not seen a range of
topics like this anywhere else.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I also love <a href="https://blogroll.org/">blogroll.org</a> for always
recommending new interesting blogs to follow. I think Wouter of Brain
Baking would be a great interview subject.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The longevity of websites is something I still think about. I often
wonder
<a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/on-writing-to-exist-and-website-graveyards/">what
would happen to my website</a> after I pass on. I know of at least
<a href="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/">one great website</a> that is
being maintained by family and friends after the owner passed on, but
what would happen when they too are no longer around? There is this
attitude that websites are ephemeral and not important, but there is a
lot of richness, history and information within them that deserves to be
preserved. It would be sad that we didn’t try hard enough to keep them.
I know there is the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>
that is doing great work, but I wish there was an option to keep a
website in its entirety. Wordpress has recently launched
<a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/08/25/introducing-the-100-year-plan/">a
100-year plan</a>, but it is only for wordpress.com users and it costs
38k. I wish there are more viable solutions out there.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I hope people will not be afraid to pick up new skills, hobbies
or any learnings at any age. I recently started to
<a href="https://wynlimdraws.tumblr.com/">learn how to draw</a>, and I
think being unafraid of
<a href="https://winnielim.org/journal/daring-to-be-ugly/">“being
ugly”</a> or failure goes a long way. I see too many people not pursue
art/skills/hobbies because it is “too late”, “no talent”, or if they do
they give up because they cannot tolerate not living up to their
internal standards. But we can relish the process of doing things
without being great at it. For me, it is also an act of rebellion
towards an utilitarian world.

<p>
I’m a little bit
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/search?search_api_fulltext=timelapse">nutty
about timelapses</a>, and have made them with dashcams, GoPros, full
DSLRs, webcams, and
<a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-timelapse">even Raspberry
Pi</a>.
</p>
<p>
But one thing I <em>haven’t</em> done (until now) is make easy
timelapses from IP cameras like the
<a href="https://amzn.to/3HPGcdT">Annke 4K PoE cameras</a> I use for
security around my house.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I’m planning on automating things further, but for now,
here’s my process for building up a timelapse that’s relatively small in
file size, preserving only frames where there’s motion from frame to
frame.
</p>
<p>
For something like clouds/sky, or natural environments, it’s better to
do a straight timelapse export and maybe recompress it if you want, but
for indoor or outdoor security footage, it’s nice to condense it down.

id="redox-gets-more-linux-utilities-changes-resource-path-format-and-more">Redox
gets more Linux utilities, changes resource path format, and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Redox project has published an overview of the progress made in
January, and it’s a long list. Redox now supports the Raspberry Pi 3
Model B+, a few of System76’s Cosmic Desktop applications now run on
Redox, several more Linux applications haven been ported (most notably
for me, nano, my CLI text editor of choice), and much more. The most
important change is an overhaul of how Redox handles resource paths:
Redox has a microkernel core, with drivers and other resource providers
running as tasks and providing “schemes”. A scheme is the name of a
resource provider, and until now, resources have been accessed using
URI/URL format. For example, files would be accessed as
file:path/to/my_file, and a TCP connection would be accessed as
tcp:127.0.0.1. This format, while forward-looking, has not been very
backwards-compatible. In order to simplify our efforts to port Linux
software to Redox, we have decided to change our resource path format to
the Linux-compatible /scheme/scheme_name/path/to/resource. Paths that do
not begin with /scheme will be assumed to refer to the file scheme, so
/path/to/my_file is treated by the system as
/scheme/file/path/to/my_file, but the application will only see the
/path/to/my_file portion. Using this format, normal paths now look just
like Linux paths, while drivers and other resources can still be
addressed without breaking software. ↫ Ron Williams The change is an
ongoing process, so you might encounter some issues related to it in the
coming time.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>That was back in August and since then, there has not been anything
too noteworthy in terms of Windows bootability support on ReFS.
Meanwhile, Microsoft has also not updated the officially supported ReFS
version up from 3.10 yet, and as such, trying to run Windows on any
newer ReFS version leads to an immediate crash on the newest Canary
build 26040. Apparently, the crash is worse than it was on previous
builds as it now throws up no recovery messages either. ↫ Sayan Sen at

Google’s Bard now does pictures. I asked for thousands of cats marching
on 8th Ave in NYC between 57th St and 45th St. A very different style
from what ChatGPT would have drawn and I like it.

<h2 id="reactos-details-its-new-graphical-installer">ReactOS details its
new graphical installer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>The ReactOS project is working on a new graphical installer to
replace the older, text-mode one. In the first blog post about this
effort, from December 2023, developer hbelusca details their work on
setupapi, the module that enables “reading and processing INF files,
moving/copying files from an installation source media to a target,
supporting also extraction from compressed .CAB cabinet files”, as well
as device installation functions. The second post dives into
partitioning during installation, which involves a lot of very delicate
work, from partitioning to installing the bootloader, and from copying
files to modifying the registry. On top of that, this needs a GUI, and
preferably one that’s better and more versatile than the well-known blue
text-mode setup we all know from old versions of Windows. The new GUI
presents more options, allows for bootloader settings, and, of course,
partitioning in a non-destructive way before committing. In addition,
while the blue text-mode setup can only go forward, the new GUI is
bidirectional. The third and final post dives into testing all this work
and fixing bugs. The post goes into great detail describing a number of
bugs and their fixes, and is well worth a read, too.</p>

<h2 id="whats-up-at-harvard">What’s up at Harvard?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wrote this note to Chris Lydon re the
<a href="https://radioopensource.org/the-humbling-of-harvard/">latest
episode</a> of his podcast.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Chris,
</li>
<li>
I’m listening to your latest
<a href="https://radioopensource.org/the-humbling-of-harvard/">podcast
about Harvard</a>, and totally appreciate this.
</li>
<li>
In my two years at Harvard in the 00s, I never:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<ol type="1">
<li>Experienced antisemitism.
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Saw antisemitism.
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Even thought about the <i>possibility</i> of antisemitism.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
On the Harvard campus.
</li>
<li>
That said, antisemitism is everywhere, even inside me, a man whose
grandparents were Jews who fled for their lives with their children from
the Holocaust before and during WWII. I am a product of that, in ways I
didn’t even realize until my parents were gone. It’s everywhere, all
around, inside myself, inside everyone, and the best we can hope for
imho is that it will stay hidden.
</li>
<li>
Ask me about what happened in the NBA with
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+kyrie">Kyrie
Irving</a>, and how, by their silence, the players and coaches showed
how huge and deep the problem is.
</li>
<li>
To see the Repubs monetize this for political gain is par for the
course. To see Harvard buckle under that, is weak and the people who
made that decision imho should resign in disgrace.
</li>
<li>
Thanks for your continued and unique excellence.
</li>
<li>
Dave

<h2 id="making-a-pdf-thats-larger-than-germany">Making a PDF that’s
larger than Germany</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few times a year, a claim will make the rounds that the largest PDF
you can make is a square covering about the middle section of Germany –
381 km × 381 km. Turns out, this is only the maximum size Acrobat Reader
can display, and not the limit of the format itself at all. So, how big
can you go? Very big: If you’re curious, that width is approximately the
distance between the Earth and the Moon. I’d have to get my ruler to
check, but I’m pretty sure that’s larger than Germany. I could keep
going. And I did. Eventually I ended up with a PDF that Preview claimed
is larger than the entire universe – approximately 37 trillion light
years square. Admittedly it’s mostly empty space, but so is the
universe. If you’d like to play with that PDF, you can get it here.
Please don’t try to print it. ↫ Alex Chan Don’t worry, I’m out of
magenta anyway.</p>

Computer (セガＡＩコンピューター)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Around late 1986, Sega released the “Sega AI Computer”. This is one
of Sega’s least well known and rarest systems. Not much is known about
this system apart from a small amount of information in Japanese and
American flyers and press articles. The information we have is still
piecemeal and may be partly inaccurate. Today we are making public, for
the first time: all system roms extracted from the Sega AI Computer,
data dumps from 26 my-cards and 14 tapes, many scans and photographs,
and in collaboration with MAME developers, an early working MAME driver
allowing this computer to be emulated. ↫ SMS Power! Incredible. Usually
stuff like this is relegated to a YouTube video, with potential archival
efforts pushed to the background since it’s boring and won’t get any
views. This is an amazing effort.</p>

<p>
Often when I talk with folks who know me from
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">my podcast</a> they will say
something along the lines of, “I used to listen to your podcast!” Then
they blush because their statement implies they don’t listen anymore

A</a>). And I just wanted to say…
</p>
<p>
I get it.

<p>
It’s fine. I take no offense. In fact, that’s part of the magic of
podcasts! There’s an ebb and flow to them. Here’s ten reasons I give up
on
podcasts<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
You need certain podcasts at certain times in your life.
</li>
<li>
You and the podcast grow in different directions.
</li>
<li>
You finish a season or story arc and it feels like a good stopping
point.
</li>
<li>
You find yourself subscribed to <em>too many</em> of the <em>same
kind</em> of podcast (tech, murder mystery, actual play, two white dudes
talking, etc).
</li>

Nearly every podcast goes through an experimental phase and it’s okay
not to join them on that cringe journey, you can catch up afterwards.
</li>
<li>
Podcasts bring an immense amount of joy, but they can become another
item on the to do list.
</li>
<li>
There might be a global pandemic that cut your daily commute to zero and
now you don’t have time for podcasts.
</li>
<li>
You might get into audiobooks with a consistent narrative instead of
rambly diatribes.
</li>
<li>
People are only so original. When podcasts get a bit repetitive, it’s
okay to peel off.
</li>
<li>
A great reset where all podcasts must earn their position back in the
queue!
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Unsubscribe and if you miss it you can always go back. As long as they
paid their hosting bill, it should still be there.
</p>
<p>
With RSS you can unplug from the machine. Podcasts – built on RSS – are
the same. A never ending stream of content… but with latency. It’s
important we celebrate the Thrill of Missing Out.

<h2 id="on-digital-relationships">On digital relationships</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is my entry for February’s
<a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">IndieWeb carnival</a>.
This month is hosted by yours truly and I’d love to have you as part of
this initiative.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Digital relationships are a fascinating concept. The idea that a
relationship with someone else can be lived, consumed, and enjoyed
entirely inside the digital space is something we probably take for
granted but it’s such a unique and distinctive feature of this time we
live in.
</p>
<p>
If you’re like me, you probably met and interacted with more people in
the digital world than in real life. And I’m not saying this because I’m
an introvert, I don’t think I am. I’m saying this simply because it’s
the result of the life I live.
</p>
<p>
Daily I receive emails or messages from people I don’t know and will
never meet “in real life”. And daily I send back messages to these
people sharing thoughts, opinions, bits of my life. That’s just what my
life is these days and, to be honest with you, I find it incredibly
rewarding at a personal level.
</p>
<p>
But my life hasn’t always been like that. I’m technically a child of the
80s—juuuuust barely—but I grew up in the 90s. The internet wasn’t part
of my life and the same can be said for most of the technology we take
for granted nowadays. I had a cellphone—not a smartphone—and SMS was how
we communicated. But SMS was such a limited and costly way to interact
that using it to have digital relationships was not an option. And you
had to have someone’s number first.
</p>
<p>
My first experience with a digital relationship happened on a forum. Do
you remember those? I love forums. They’re such a neat way to organize
an online community. I’m even considering setting up one myself! Anyway,
I remember browsing and posting on
<a href="https://www.hwupgrade.it/forum/">hwupgrade.it/forum/</a> in the
early 2000s and becoming friends with an Italian girl. We talked PS1
games and it was awesome. I never met her, never seen a picture of her,
never even cared about asking for one. The only thing we exchanged were
names and that was it.
</p>
<p>
That was just the first in a long series of fun digital relationships. I
met people playing the original COD MW2, back in 2009, I connected with
strangers during the #followfriday days of early Twitter, and I
exchanged countless emails with designers and developers during my years
curating the—now defunct—thegallery.io.
</p>
<p>
With most of the people I consider friends I have digital relationships.
I met <a href="https://robhope.com">Rob</a> in person once in my life.
We’ve known each other since I think 2012 and I hear from him pretty
much daily. The same is true for
<a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com">Carl</a>. We met in person exactly
once and I hear from him daily.
<a href="https://mwarrenarts.com">Mike</a> connected with me via email
in 2015 and we’re still friends to this day. We never met in person and
that’s absolutely fine.
</p>
<p>
Digital relationships are powerful. Some people discard them because
they think they’re not at the same level as “real relationships” but I
disagree. Digital relationships are their own thing. They have their own
rules, and their own ways to be unique. And they can be as important as
any other relationship.
</p>
<p>
The current internet can be a miserable place, I know. Social media can
be a cesspool, people are mean, and there are weirdos everywhere. It
sucks. I’m not going to pretend everything is wonderful out there. But I
still have hope. I do because of the countless lovely exchanges I had
via email with people like you.
</p>
<p>
You, are a wonderful person. I don’t have any reason to think otherwise.
And I’m sure there are others like you out there. Curious people, kind
people, generous people. People who like to share, to engage honestly.
</p>
<p>
Digital relationships are powerful but don’t take my word for it. Try
for yourself. Next time you stumble on a personal site you find
interesting, try to connect with the person behind that site. Write an
email, say hi, send them some love. You won’t regret it.
</p>

what’s going to happen. A bunch of new networks are forming, and they
will melt into one, following a pattern established by the internet
itself, when they formed a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">net
of nets</a> based on a common protocol called TCP. On top of that HTTP
was built, with a number of years following with very productive
building and bootstrapping, and from there it was a lot of chaos, around
the advent of Twitter, Facebook and Google Reader. The last time we had
a common way of
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html">interop</a>
was 17 years ago. I think/hope we’re incentivized to make one edit box
suffice, in place of the 5-10
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14.html#a145854">tiny little
textboxes</a> we now all have to copy-paste between, and btw one way of
addressing nodes, and then we can start building again as we did last in
the 90s and 00s. I see something brilliant in the
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057231/iconfactory-kickstarter-internet-reader-project-tapestry-twitterrific">new
path</a> that Twitteriffic wants to go down (I gave
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iconfactory/project-tapestry">them</a>
$128). It’s same path I’ve been going down, mostly without partners, for
the 17 years since we crawled on land and started tweeting. I don’t see
the negative shit that’s happening on Twitter, it’s easy to avoid the
mess – I don’t think that’s the reason we’re breaking out of that silo –
it’s that all at once all the devs who had been quietly suffering with
Twitter were set free. Boom. All at once. And it turns out perhaps we
don’t give up so easily. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

Doorbell: Halt and Catch Fire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-01, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">SimpliSafe
Video Doorbell: Halt and Catch Fire</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/simplisafe-video-doorbell-burnt-wires.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; class=&quot;insert-image&quot; alt=&quot;SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro burnt wires&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
This SimpliSafe doorbell burned up less than a week after I installed
it. I never would’ve thought a doorbell would be the most dangerous
thing I set up at my studio!
</p>
<p>
I learned a LOT about powering ‘smart’ doorbells, and talked directly to
SimpliSafe about it. They did sent a replacement, but it has it’s own
problems.
</p>
<p>
I’m still happy with SimpliSafe overall, but I don’t like how I’ve spent
about 8 hours troubleshooting a ‘smart’ doorbell. The only thing that’s
been 100% reliable on this thing is the basic ding dong I could’ve
gotten with a <a href="https://amzn.to/4987S9w">five dollar dumb
doorbell</a>!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This blog post is based off my latest moving vlog, episode 12, where I
talk about my SimpliSafe doorbell problems, the new 10G and 25G
networking gear I’m testing, and a new ‘retro corner’ in my office.
Check it out below:

On January 10th the forge that we use to host our projects was taken
down by DDoS attacks and was struggling to come back online(it’s back
now, read the
<a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-01-19-outage-post-mortem/" target="_blank">post-mortem</a>),
the event reminded us that we ought to host mirrors and release versions
of these source files ourselves. We have begun to
<a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/etc/" target="_blank">host copies</a>
across our various websites. The builds are still accessible through
<a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.
These will be automatically updated as we work on them in their
individual repositories, but mirrored there for reliability. We are
thankful for Sourcehut’s tireless work on resolving the issue and for
taking the time to communicate important changes.
</p>
<p>
In keeping with the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we
use we’ve taken a moment to write a kind of pocket version of the
console emulator and
<a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/drifblim.html" target="_blank">self-hosted
assembler</a> as to see how many lines are needed to start from the seed
assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket emulator, the source
for the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have been
<a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html" target="_blank">documented</a>.
</p>
<p>
On January 17th
<a href="https://100r.co/site/victoria.html" target="_blank">Victoria</a>
got its first
<a href="https://100r.co/media/content/stream/2024_snow.jpg" target="_blank">snowfall</a>,
with it came temperatures below freezing. We got to test our recent
improvements, like a new
<a href="https://100r.co/media/content/boat_projects/vent.jpg" target="_blank">louvered
closet vent</a> to help ventilate the space(there are also two existing
vents at the top, one on each side). The closet has been dry for the
first time in 3 years. We’ve made an effort not to keep too many items
on the floor so the area can breathe. We got ice inside of the windows
for the first time ever though… not ideal.

to optionally ingest your Google Messages history into its “AI”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Researchers have just unveiled a pre-release, game-changing AI
upgrade for Google Messages. But it’s one with a serious privacy risk—it
seems that Bard may ask to read and analyze your private message
history. So how might this work, how do you maintain your privacy, and
when might this begin. ↫ Zak Doffman As long as this “AI” hoovering is
an optional ‘feature’, I don’t really have any issues with it – it’s a
free world, and if you want to spice up your autocomplete like this, go
ahead. The real danger, of course, is that this won’t be optional for
long, and eventually Google’s “AI” will just ingest your messages and
emails by default, consent or no.</p>

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">IndieWeb Carnival:
Digital Relationships</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
January is about to end. That means that January’s IndieWeb Carnival,
hosted by <a href="https://foreverliketh.is">foreverliketh.is</a>, is
also about to end. If you want to submit your entry on the topic of
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive
Internalization</a> you should hurry up.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned previously on this blog I’m going to host the next month
and the topic for the month of February is going to be “Digital
relationships”. The meaning of the topic is intentionally vague but I
can think of at least three ways to interpret it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The first is probably the most obvious: relationships between us human
beings that are lived primarily—or entirely—on the digital world.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The second is the relationship between us and the digital world itself.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The third is the growing trend of people having relationships with
digital creations such as AI fiends, boyfriends and girlfriends.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those are three ways you can interpret the topic but don’t feel limited
to just those three. Go nuts and be creative. This site doesn’t have
pingbacks or webmentions so if you plan to participate send me a link to
your entry via email. I’m going to accept everything that’s sent to me
before March 1st and I plan to write at least one roundup post with your
links. Look forward to read your entries and don’t forget to spread the
word about the IndieWeb Carnival and if you want to get involved you can
still become a host yourself. Just claim your spot here

<p>As I was writing the post about using ChatGPT to port Frontier, which
is a C program, runs on Mac and Windows, GPL licensed, to Linux. This
took me to an interesting place. Could a bot, having read all the source
code of MySQL, for example, then be tasked with writing a non-GPL MySQL
workalike that would <i>not</i> be open source? Here’s a

<h2 id="some-activities-are-harder-than-others">Some activities are
harder than others</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Some activities are harder than others
</h1>
<p>
Or, why <a href="2022-03-04_It_is_not_too_late_to_bake_bread">baking
bread</a> is easy compared to many other activities.
</p>
<p>
A recent conversation with
<a class="account" href="https://zirk.us/@Mayobrot" title="@Mayobrot@zirk.us"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Mayobrot">@Mayobrot</span></a> made me
think about the fear of doing things. I’m thinking that there are
activities that are inherently easier to perform than others because of
the natural environment. In speaking about them, however, we use
categories that do not differentiate between the two and so we transfer
our fears from one category to the other.
</p>
<p>
Here are some examples from my personal life: I think programming and
soldering and model planes are difficult activities because small
differences have big impacts. On the other hand, cooking or baking, or
taking care of plants are comparatively easy activities because small
differences often don’t have a large impact.
</p>
<p>
Take the question of how long you should bake bread. In my oven, with my
settings, it seems that anything between 30 min and 90 min results in
edible bread. The temperature can vary between 160°C and 220°C and if
I’m looking into the oven every now and then this results in edible
bread. Varying ingredients by ±10% and more results in edible bread.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for watering plants, potting plants and all that
connects to. Plants adapt. Errors don’t accumulate but instead they
average out. To much or too little water means it’s going to be OK on
average.
</p>
<p>
This is not how software works. Its bugs bugs bugs and they never
average out to a nice user experience.
</p>
<p>
When family asks me about bugs in programming, I tell them that the
problem is that we need to put everything into the program: gravity, air
resistance, the floor… In real life we don’t. Walking is easy because if
we push of harder we don’t yeet ourselves into the sun. We just bounce a
little higher and then we’re back on the ground. And we don’t fall
towards the centre of the Earth as in some 3d model glitch in a game.
No, the ground is always there. If we speed up, there’s friction to slow
us down again. So physics stabilizes many things.
</p>
<p>
Chemistry stabilizes many things, too. If we use up the oxygen in our
room, we don’t just go go go and then we die because the oxygen
concentration goes down slowly. We get less oxygen, we move slower, we
have more time to get out.
</p>
<p>
And biology stabilizes things, too. We call it homeostasis. You
exercise, burning up sugar. Sugar goes down, fat gets mobilized,
allowing your body to continue. And then there are a hundred feedback
loops for everything to keep your body from falling apart. Of course
eventually we all do, but still.
</p>
<p>
I guess what I really was trying to say is that there are some
activities like baking bread that seem hard because you think that
baking bread is probably related to model air-planes and if you struggle
with the tweezers and glue and all that, surely you will struggle with
the ingredients of that dish, too. But that is not so. Usually, you can
mess up ingredients pretty badly and results are still edible, or even
tasty! They might not be repeatable, but who cares if you’re not a chef
in a restaurant. It’s tasty and you eat it. It’s great.

<p>In the olden days with X11, you could just do x11-forwarding in SSH
and remote cut and paste would work. Now with Wayland, this is all
broken and supposedly “there are better ways of doing it”. One of those
is OSC52 support in terminals, but not in VTE based ones, like Tilix,
which is was my default terminal. (See
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/2495 for the 5(!) year old
bug). So I wanted this to work, which meant changing terminal and
configuring Neovim - where the latter was way more complex, hard to
debug and reason about.</p>

<h2 id="pgbouncer-1.22.0-released">PgBouncer 1.22.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-31, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
PgBouncer 1.22.0 has been released. The main feature this release adds
is support for the <code>DISCARD ALL</code> and <code>DEALLOCATE
ALL</code> commands when enabling prepared statement support in
transaction pooling mode (by setting
<code>max_prepared_statements</code> to a non-zero value). This is an
important improvement in the prepared statement support that clears the
road for us to be able to enable prepared statement support by default
in a future release.
</p>
<p>
Other than that this release contains some small improvements and
bugfixes, including improvements to our recommended SystemD
configuration files.
</p>
<p>

<h2 id="patriotism-in-popular-music">Patriotism in popular music</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Patriotism in popular music
</h1>
<p>
Patriotism is a terrible topic for a song. That’s what makes me cringe
when I listen to Preciosa Puerto Rico by Marc Anthony. But when that
tempo change in the middle around the 3min mark comes up, it just makes
me want to get up and shout with jubilation! It is only later that I
wonder: what if this had been a German singing about Germany (substitute
your own boogeyman). 😩
</p>
<p>
I am convinced: patriotism is an illusion used to achieve something. It
might be something good, a national infrastructure project, but
inevitably it will be used for evil. But that song … ah, it melts my
heart!
</p>
<p>
Beware small-patriotism. It starts with homesickness, longing for the
places and culture you grew up in, which is valid, no doubt, but when
you add pride or that feeling of belonging to the mix, it starts getting
tricky. Who decides who belongs?
</p>
<p>
As a perpetual foreigner, that feeling of belonging always comes with an
exclusionary element, in my experience. The Swiss celebrate Switzerland,
and their independence from the Austrians and the Germans. The Austrians
celebrate Austria and think that the Slovenian road names have to go.
There’s always somebody on the other side of the fence. But I know
relatives in Portugal, France, Germany, Austria, Croatia, and there are
more relatives that I haven’t met. So yes, there can be as moment of
pride for living in a place where this or that works well, or where the
landscape is beautiful, or where you feel the people are nice, or the
food is good, a moment where you’re not thinking too hard about it all –
but that moment is fleeting, and the abyss is huge. Patriotism and
nationalism are not only about that fleeting moment.

Pi is planning a London IPO, but its CEO expects “no change” in
focus</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>The business arm of Raspberry Pi is preparing to make an initial
public offering (IPO) in London. CEO Eben Upton tells Ars that should
the IPO happen, it will let Raspberry Pi’s not-for-profit side expand by
“at least a factor of 2X.” And while it’s “an understandable thing” that
Raspberry Pi enthusiasts could be concerned, “while I’m involved in
running the thing, I don’t expect people to see any change in how we do
things.” ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica Expect changes in how they do
things.</p>

review: magic, until it’s not</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>A number of reviews for Apple’s new VR headset have been published,
but the only one I think is worth reading is, surprisingly, the one
published by The Verge. Both the written and video review are excellent,
and go into every possible little detail of the new device. Nilay Patel
concludes: The basic gist is that the Vision Pro is simply cumbersome
and unpleasant to use, exactly what many people have been suspecting
since the day it was unveiled. I’ve been asking a very simple question
on Mastodon nobody has been able to answer yet: is there anything you do
on your phone, laptop, or desktop, that the Vision Pro can do better,
easier, quicker? Now that the reviews are here, not even the people
using it can provide an answer. And think about that last point in the
list above. It’s a private computer that’s always looking at your
hands.</p>

<h2 id="best-laptop-of-2024">Best laptop of 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
You might be confused by the title of this post. You might be wondering
why on earth am I writing about the best laptop of 2024. I never
reviewed products on this blog. There was no best laptop of 2023 post
nor a best laptop of 2022. And fear not, there won’t be a post about the
best laptop of 2024 either.
</p>
<p>
You see, this is not going to be a post about laptops. It’s going to be
a post about words, about generated content, and about SEO. It’s also
going to be an experiment because I’m a curious person and the inner
workings of search engines fascinate me.
</p>
<p>
I was listening to a tech podcast the other day and in it, they were
talking about the evolving landscape of the publishing industry with the
increasing trend of companies making AI-generated listicles in an
attempt to rank high on Google. And then you have things like the
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/28/24053882/arc-search-browser-web-app-ios">Arc
search browser</a> that will use Ai to generate summaries of the pages
they browsed on your behalf. The result is that you have Ai consuming
content written by Ai in an attempt to do… something? I’m not sure what
the end game is to be perfectly honest with you but I’m interested
because this all looks like a shit show.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back to the best laptops of 2024. In that podcast, they
mentioned that one of the prime targets in the search results tech space
is, you guessed it, the first page of results for the query “best
laptops of 2024”. And while I was listening I thought “I wonder how high
can a stupid blog post get on that SERP if I don’t actually write
content that’s relevant to the query”.
</p>
<p>
And this is that post. I have no interest in laptops. I know nothing
about laptops. I don’t care about laptops. I don’t even know which
laptops came out in 2024. I do know people are interested in knowing
which laptop is the best laptop in 2024 which is why I just wasted some
of your time (I’m sorry) making you read a silly post about the best
laptops in 2024 that has nothing to do with laptops.
</p>
<p>
Will google pick this one up? Will I even reach the first page? Who
knows! But if for some reason you landed on this blog post searching for
the best laptop of 2024 send me an email. I promise you I’ll do my best
to help you figure out what’s the best laptop for you.

<p>A growing body of research suggests a link between epigenetic
mechanisms and a wide variety of illnesses and behaviors, including
cancer, cardiovascular and autoimmune illnesses, and cognitive
dysfunction. Epigenetics also plays a role in the changes humans and
other living things experience in space. This phenomenon has become part
of studies in a wide variety […]</p>

Apple sold some 200,000 VisionPro. So at least 700 million dollars.
</p>
<p>
That assumes everyone went with the cheapest option without accessories.
</p>
<p>
If people go with the high end models, a battery and apple care the
total is 900million.
</p>
<p>
So say 800million so far?

<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Rachel Kwon blog</p>
<p>Last month Katherine called out the tension inherent in a “personal”
website which is that it is both public and personal, and one’s public
(or professional) persona is often different from that of their personal
life. Robin Rendle riffed on the concept and said that it’s totally fine
for personal websites to be messy or imperfect or weird (i.e., not
necessarily how you’d want to present a “professional” front) and
declared, in a pretty great and punchy/pithy statement, “You’re a poem
and not software”.</p>

<p>As a love-token to my readers here are the first few pages of my new
novel which is published on Feb 1 DAY ONE Kerpow! Funny - unless it’s
ominous - she had put that very word down on a Scrabble board only a day
or two or before. Jubilant, the k scoring triple. Her opponent - the man
she had known for over twenty years, slept with for five, no longer
slept with with for however many more that left, and now played Scrabble
with instead - contested the spelling. Kapow, yes. Kerpow, no. They
fought over it. Have it your way, she said in the end. Which meant she
had to remove a garment.</p>

asking which networks people check first, which they get the most out
of. As you might expect, the most common answer was the network I was
asking on (except Facebook, no one answered there, I guessed that might
happen, because Facebook is different from the others). I asked because
I’m trying to figure that out for myself, and I’m kind of disappointed
that I find myself going to Threads more often. It has the greater
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sweaty+Palms+Quotient">Sweaty
Palms Quotient</a>, the feeling I used to have every week in the 80s
when MacWeek or PC Week arrived. I always cleared the time to go through
each issue carefully to see what my friends and competitors were up to.
Then I would talk to my reporter friends, who wanted to know what I
thought, or what back-room perspectives I could share with them. This
was the time of the telephone, even before everyone had email, in the
tech industry, believe it or not. Anyway, this isn’t going the way I
hoped it would. For me an open network built on the idea of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> is what I want to
see, what I’m working towards. And seeing products like WordPress and
its competitors as full-class members of the social web, because they
already do textcasting, now all they need is to be hooked up to a social
web that understands that writing isn’t just
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+grunts+and+snorts">grunts
and snorts</a>. Anyway, it’ll give you some encouragement that people in
the fediverse are most optimistic about their preferred network being
the best of the new lot. I still like Bluesky, a lot, because of the
intelligence and creativity of the people who use it. And I like the UI,
for its simplicity and familiarity, but I’m concerned it’ll lose its
simplicity when they federate. And don’t count Twitter out yet, there’s
far more happening there than any of the other networks. And a lot of
what you read on the other nets is wishful thinking about the demise of
Twitter. Hasn’t happened yet, and my guess is it won’t. It’s really hard
to snuff out machines with the kind of momentum Twitter has, even though
Musk is doing his best. One more thing to think about, I don’t think
federation is what we need, I think we need
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/03/21/theWebIsMadeOfInterop.html">interop</a>.
It’s a more permissive kind of compatibility, and will happen a lot
sooner than federation, which honestly, I don’t think ever will happen.
With the usual disclaimers, most important that I’m often wrong, and am
open to other constructive points of view.</p>

This is a blog post about a video, which is about new color-conversion
LUTs for Apple Log footage from the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max (updated
from my <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">first set</a>). The
video is also a mini-travelogue of my recent trips to Taiwan and Peru.
This post dives a bit deeper into both the LUT workflows, and my state
of mind about shooting digital-cinema-grade footage with a device I
always have with me.

There’s a lot going on here.

I always have a moment when packing for a trip: Which camera to bring?
Which lenses? I know I’m always happier when I pack less, like just a
single prime lens. But sometimes FOMO gets me and I pack three zooms.
</p>
<p>
For my trip to Lima, I brought my
<a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1645238-REG/sony_ilce7rm4a_b_alpha_a7r_iv_mirrorless.html/BI/4778/KBID/5292">Sony

35mm F2.8 prime</a>. I lugged it around for a few days, but wasn’t
really feeling it.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, my iPhone 15 Pro Max was calling to me with its ProRes Log
video mode. “I’m 10-bit!” It would say. “Think of the fun you’ll have
color grading me!”
</p>
<p>
I told my phone to shut up, and proceeded to shoot very little with it —
or my Sony. Like a squirrel in the middle of the street, drawn in two
different directions at once, I creatively froze.
</p>
<p>
Photography, for me, is made up of a lot of habits, and shooting iPhone
video with aesthetic intent is just not yet baked into my travel muscle
memory.

A month later, I took a family trip to Taiwan, one of my favorite places
in the world. I’d had some time to process my Peru deadlock, and decided
to stop judging my own creative impulses, and let inspiration guide me
in which camera I pulled out.
</p>
<p>
I wound up shooting a lot of video.

I <em>loved</em> shooting ProRes Log in Taiwan with the iPhone 15 Pro
Max. I’d occasionally reach for
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241">Blackmagic
Camera</a>, but I often just used the default camera app. I stuck my
phone (with its
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@prolost/post/C0VGQ8gPPyU">crumbling
case</a>) out of taxi sunroofs and skyscraper windows, held it above
teeming crowds and shoved it between chain-link fences. Seeing the broad
dynamic range I was capturing in scenarios from noontime sun to neon-lit
nights got me excited about grading the footage later.
</p>
<p>
It’s exactly the way I feel about shooting raw stills with my Sony,
knowing that I’ll be able to go crazy on them in Lightroom. The
photographing act is just half of the process.

LUTs, Looks, and Magic Bullets
</h2>
<p>
There’s been a bit of a gold rush of people hawking creative LUTs that
apply a particular “look” to iPhone Log footage. My day job is, in part,
helping make color tools like
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant/magic-bullet/looks">Magic
Bullet Looks</a>, which can do so much more than any LUT. Creative LUTs
are great, and by all means support the folks making them — but that’s
not what my iPhone LUTs
<a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">were</a> or are.
</p>
<p>
The Prolost iPhone LUTs convert Apple Log to various other color spaces,
and support three kinds of workflow:
</p>
<h3 id="grade-under-a-display-transform-lut">
Grade Under a Display Transform LUT
</h3>
<p>
Apple Log is a totally decent color space to work in, so color
correcting Apple Log can be as simple as applying
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/red-giant/magic-bullet/colorista">Magic
Bullet Colorista</a> and choosing one of my <strong>Monitor &amp;
Grade</strong> LUTs. That’s what you see me doing in the video above.
Colorista (set to Log mode) does its work on the native Apple Log
pixels, and the LUT converts the result to look nice on video.
</p>
<p>
Many other systems work like this, including
<a href="https://luma-touch.com">LumaFusion</a>, which
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLtNJ8DbQrQ">ships with</a>
Prolost Apple Log LUTs.
</p>
<p>
The key is <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/applelog">color correcting
under the LUT</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="bring-apple-log-into-an-existing-workflow">
Bring Apple Log into an Existing Workflow
</h3>
<p>
Color work is often done in an intermediate color space. This is usually
some kind of wide-gamut, log format, such as Davinci Wide
Gamut/Intermediate, or one of the
<a href="https://prolost.com/blog/aces">ACES log spaces</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Prolost <strong>ACES</strong> LUTs convert Apple Log to either
ACEScc or ACEScct log, allowing you to grade your iPhone footage
alongside any other professional camera, and output them all through the
same pipeline.
</p>
<h3 id="shooting-through-a-lut">
Shooting Through a LUT
</h3>
<p>
The Blackmagic Camera app allows you to load any LUTs you want and
preview through them without baking them into your footage. With my
LUTs, you can shoot with the same LUTs you grade under later, for a
truly professional (no joke!) workflow.
</p>
<p>
The real stars of this update though are the <strong>FC</strong> LUTs.
They add an informative False Color overlay to the Shoot/Grade LUTs,
making sure you always nail your exposure. Watch the video to see them
in action. I already can’t imagine shooting without them.
</p>
<p>
These LUTs work well in Blackmagic Camera or even on an external HDMI
monitor.

<p>
As if this video wasn’t enough work already (I shot the A-roll in
mid-December), I decided to use it as a personal test-case for creative
editorial in DaVinci Resolve. It’s the ACES LUTs that allowed me to
incorporate Magic Bullet Looks into my Resolve color workflow.
</p>
<p>
Maxon just shipped a really nice
<a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/article/maxon-red-giant-update-delivers-fast-beautiful-bokeh-and-realistic-lens-flares">update</a>
to Magic Bullet Looks, with simplified color management made possible by
more and more apps we support doing darn fine color management at the
timeline level.
</p>
<p>
So in Resolve, I can use my LUT to convert Apple Log to ACEScc, and then
apply Magic Bullet Looks, which can now be set to work in ACEScc with a
single click.

I can sneak additional Resolve corrector nodes between those two for
local corrections. Resolve is great at this, and Looks is great at
creative look development, so this is a match made in heaven.

<h2 id="gear-inspires">
Gear Inspires
</h2>
<p>
Every photographer knows the feeling of lusting after new gear. We know
it so well that we remind ourselves constantly that “next camera
syndrome” is debilitating, and that “most cameras are better than most
photographers.” Gear is not the answer. Go shoot.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, a counterpoint to these truths: As shooters, we take
inspiration where we can get it. And sometimes a new technique, a new
locale, or even, yes, a new bit of kit is what provides it.
</p>
<p>
The key is to listen for that inspiration, and don’t judge it.
</p>
<p>
Even if it’s coming from your phone.

for earlier versions of the OS last year. ↫ Simon Sharwood at The
Register One of the biggest “what could have beens” of the past two
decades. Had Oracle not closed Solaris up after acquiring Sun, an open
source Solaris might’ve been something more tangible than what it is
today. Of course, Oracle gonna Oracle and they were always going to
screw things up, open source or not, but had Solaris stayed open we’d
have had a more concerted, centralised development effort instead of
what we have now, where the open source Solaris community is working off
the last OpenSolaris codebase from 14 years ago.</p>

<h2 id="new-renderers-for-gtk">New renderers for GTK</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, GTK gained not one, but two new renderers: one for GL and
one for Vulkan. Since naming is hard, we reused existing names and
called them “ngl” and “vulkan”. They are built from the same sources,
therefore we also call them “unified” renderers. As mentioned already,
the two renderers are built from the same source. It is modeled to
follow Vulkan apis, with some abstractions to cover the differences
between Vulkan and GL (more specifically, GL 3.3+ and GLES 3.0+). This
lets us share much of the infrastructure for walking the scene graph,
maintaining transforms and other state, caching textures and glyphs, and
will make it easier to keep both renderers up-to-date and on-par. ↫ GTK
Development Blog This is well above my paygrade, but I’m sure it’s still
of interest to y’all.</p>

<p>But despite all this chaos and temptation, operating system vendors
knew better. To this day, they follow THE convention: checkboxes are
square, radio buttons are round. Maybe it was part of their internal
training. Maybe they had experienced art directors. Maybe it was just
luck. I don’t know — it doesn’t really matter — but — somehow — they
managed to stick to the convention. Until this day. Apple is the first
major operating system vendor who had abandoned a four-decades-long

Apple — will have round checkboxes. ↫ Nikita Prokopov Unsightly. A lack

<p>Last week, I turned on my PC, installed a Windows update, and
rebooted to find Microsoft Edge automatically open with the Chrome tabs
I was working on before the update. I don’t use Microsoft Edge
regularly, and I have Google Chrome set as my default browser.
Bleary-eyed at 9AM, it took me a moment to realize that Microsoft Edge
had simply taken over where I’d left off in Chrome. I couldn’t believe
my eyes. I never imported my data into Microsoft Edge, nor did I confirm
whether I wanted to import my tabs. But here was Edge automatically
opening after a Windows update with all the Chrome tabs I’d been working
on. I didn’t even realize I was using Edge at first, and I was confused
why all my tabs were suddenly logged out. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge I

id="roring-ahead-using-ror-in-place-of-the-open-funder-registry">RORing
ahead: using ROR in place of the Open Funder Registry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
A few months ago we announced our plan to
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror/">deprecate
our support for the Open Funder Registry</a> in favour of using the ROR
Registry to support both affiliation and funder use cases. The feedback
we’ve had from the community has been positive and supports our members,
service providers and metadata users who are already starting to move in
this direction.
</p>
<p>
We wanted to provide an update on work that’s underway to make this
transition happen, and how you can get involved in working together with
us on this.
</p>
<p>
Overall, we are building more comprehensive support for ROR into
Crossref’s services. Some of this work is specifically to support using
ROR to identify funding organisations in place of funder registry IDs.
We have a number of parallel, complementary projects underway to support
different elements of this work:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We are evolving our metadata schema so that we can collect ROR IDs in
places where we currently support the collection of Funder IDs.
</li>
<li>
We are analysing the coverage of Funder ID to ROR ID mappings and
testing the way we expose them in our APIs.
</li>
<li>
We are developing new matching strategies to match text strings to ROR
IDs.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="1-schema-updates">
<ol type="1">
<li>Schema updates
</h2>
<p>
Everything flows from being able to get ROR IDs into the Crossref
metadata!
</p>
<p>
We are evolving our metadata schema so that we can collect ROR IDs in
places where we already support the collection of Funder IDs – for
instance, in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/funding-data-overview/">the
funding section of the metadata for works</a> and in the funder section
for grants.
</p>
<p>
We’re working with members and service providers so that they can try
sending us this data via a pipeline our Labs team has built to test
schema updates before they go live. We are actively recruiting members
to help us test our new pipeline by providing sample XML for
registration. Planned metadata inputs and outputs are detailed in
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/164h3UtBQ2mHf5lH5ZS6c_Oh8OuraoaQPvXhNNO3-Ko8/edit" target="_blank">Including
ROR as a funder identifier in your metadata (metadata prototyping
instructions)</a>, we’d encourage you to provide feedback on these in
the document, ideally in the next two weeks. We’re aiming to release an
updated schema that supports these changes in Q1 2024.
</p>
<h2 id="2-modelling-ror-idfunder-id-mappings-in-our-metadata-model">
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Modelling ROR ID/Funder ID mappings in our metadata model
</h2>
<p>
We have integrated the ROR registry into our evolving metadata model,
and we have started work to integrate the Funder Registry. The aim is to
create more flexibility in how Crossref’s metadata can be supplemented
and queried, and give more clarity as to which party asserted or created
a metadata element.
</p>
<p>
We’re working on an early iteration of how the model handles ROR IDs,
funder IDs and their equivalencies. Once we have something to share,
we’ll welcome community feedback on this approach and on the metadata
model in general.
</p>
<h2 id="3-developing-new-matching-strategies-to-match-text-strings-to-ror-ids">
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Developing new matching strategies to match text strings to ROR IDs
</h2>
<p>
Ideally, everyone would always use persistent identifiers to exchange
information about contributor and awardee affiliations, organisations
related to works, as well as funders supporting the research. In
practice, this information is often exchanged as data without
identifiers, such as affiliation strings (e.g. “University of Virginia,
Charlottesville, VA”), funder names, or even funding acknowledgements
(e.g. “Funding and support generously provided by the Ford Foundation”).
In such situations, a good metadata matching strategy can help map these
to persistent identifiers.
</p>
<p>
Currently, we are focused on developing reliable strategies for matching
affiliation strings to ROR IDs. In the future, we will adapt the
strategies to support funder names and funding acknowledgements as well.
All the strategies will be rigorously evaluated using real-life data. We
will make the strategies, as well as the evaluation datasets and
evaluation results, publicly available for anyone to use. If you are
interested in collaborating on the development or the evaluation of the
matching strategies, <a href="mailto:labs@crossref.org">please get in
touch</a>!
</p>
<p>
In the future, we might also apply some of the new matching strategies
at Crossref, to the metadata our members send us. This would allow us to
insert matched identifiers to the metadata to better connect
organisations with other items in the scholarly record. We already have
a process that matches the names of funders supporting research against
the Funder Registry and enriches the metadata with matched Funder
Registry IDs. Developing and evaluating reliable matching strategies
will allow us to modify this process to use ROR IDs instead, and extend
it to support other use cases, such as contributor affiliations.
</p>
<h2 id="what-will-the-transition-mean-for-you">
What will the transition mean for you?
</h2>
<p>
We do recommend that you begin looking at what it will take to integrate
ROR into your systems and workflows for identifying funders. Talk to
your service providers about this to ready them for this change. To
reiterate the point from the earlier post, in the short term, and even
in the medium term, Funder IDs aren’t going away and the Funder IDs will
continue to resolve – they are persistent, after all. Eventually,
however, the Funder Registry will cease to be updated, so any new
funders will only be registrable in Crossref metadata with ROR IDs.
Legacy Funder IDs and their mapping to ROR IDs will be maintained, so if
Crossref members submit a legacy Funder ID, it will get mapped to a ROR
ID automatically. Note, too, that Crossref is committed to maintaining
the current funder API endpoints until ROR IDs become the predominant
identifier for newly registered content. We also know that there are
questions that we’ll want to tackle with the community as we all make
progress, some we know and some we don’t know. With that in mind:
</p>
<h2 id="tell-us-what-you-need">
Tell us what you need!
</h2>
<p>
We want to hear from you! We have set up several channels of
communication meant to ensure that you can tell both ROR and Crossref
what will make this transition easier for you and that you can get
answers to your questions.
</p>
<p>
First, we are conducting a series of Open Funder Registry user
interviews designed to deepen our understanding of where Funder IDs are
being used in workflows and systems. Write
<a href="mailto:community@ror.org">community@ror.org</a> if you’d like
to participate in these interviews to show and tell us how you’re using
Funder IDs.
</p>
<p>
Second, in 2024, we will be running a follow-up to the funding data
workshop we ran in June 2023. Please get in touch if your organisation
would be interested in participating in the discussion.

<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: Marginallia log</p>
<p>I get significantly more work done when I unplug my computer from the
Internet. It’s not that my productive output drops to zero when I’m
plugged in, but more like 70%. Despite many of the tools that I use
requiring a connection, and certainly the Internet containing a wealth
of information that might expedite my work, these benefits are
drastically outweighed by the wealth of distractions also available.
It’s very appealing, when the code is compiling or the docker containers
restarting, to sneak open a browser tab with hacker news, or the Χ
formerly known as Twitter, youtube, mastodon, a news site, or something
similar to pass those minutes.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2>
PostgreSQL credcheck extension
</h2>
<p>
The credcheck PostgreSQL extension provides few general credential
checks, which will be evaluated during the user creation, during the
password change and user renaming. By using this extension, we can
define a set of rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
allow a specific set of credentials
</li>
<li>
reject a certain type of credentials
</li>
<li>
deny password that can be easily cracked
</li>
<li>
enforce use of an expiration date with a minimum of day for a password
</li>
<li>
define a password reuse policy
</li>
<li>
define the number of authentication failure allowed before a user is
banned
</li>
<li>
add a delay after all authentication failure
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This release is a maintenance release to fix a major issue with the
backup of the password history file with pgBackRest and adds an
authentication delay feature.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Add authentication delay feature to be able to add a pause on
authentication failure. Setting <code>credcheck.auth_delay_ms</code>
causes the server to pause for a given number of milliseconds before
reporting authentication failure. This makes brute-force attacks on
database passwords more difficult. This patch is purely a copy/paste
from the auth_delay extension just to limit the number of extensions to
preload. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-delay.html for
more information about the origin of this feature.
</li>
<li>
Force size of file <code>$PGDATA/global/pg_password_history</code> to be
a multiple of 8192 to fix pgBackRest error caused by the error message:
“page misalignment in file /…/global/pg_password_history: file size 2604
is not divisible by page size 8192”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Extension upgrade requires a PostgreSQL restart to reload the credcheck
library.

Paris 2024: Schedule published &amp; Call for lightning talks
launched</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-30, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
Hi,
</p>
<p>
The schedule for pgDay Paris 2024 on March 14 is now live and we are
really excited to share it with you. We have some great talks lined up
for you about everything Postgres - from Codd to community and from
logical decoding to LSM trees.
</p>
<p>
Check out the programme &amp; register now
<a href="https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2024/schedule">https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgdayparis2024/schedule</a>
</p>
<p>
But that’s not all!
</p>
<p>
The best news is that there’s still a chance for <strong>you</strong> to
be on stage! If you look at the schedule, you’ll notice we reserved a
slot for lightning talks because we know how much everyone loves them.
We also know how nerve-wracking it can be to sign up on the day and not
know until the last minute whether or not you’ll be speaking, so we’ve
decided to launch a separate lightning talk CFP. Whether you’re a
seasoned speaker or you’ve never been up on stage before, and whatever
your Postgres use-case, we want to hear from you!
</p>
<p>
Submissions (max 1 per speaker) should be sent by email to
lightning@pgday.paris.
</p>
<p>
The talk must be in English and no longer than 5 minutes.
</p>
<p>
The subject of your email should be your name followed by the title of
the talk (e.g. “Slonik: What Elephants do for Fun”). The body of the
email should contain a very short description of your talk (max 50
words)
</p>
<p>
We recommend you submit your lightning talk by 23 February as that’s
when we’ll do the first round of selections, with selected speakers
notified by 8 March. You can, however, submit your lightning talk right
up until the day of the conference in case slots are still available
</p>
<p>
We look forward to seeing you in Paris on March 14, The pgDay Paris Team

<p>
The
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">EU
Digital Markets Act is making waves in the Apple ecosystem</a>. For the
first time ever you’ll be able to install a browser other than
Safari/Webkit on iOS (as long as you live in the EU). While there are
other browsers on the iOS App Store, they’re all Safari/Webkit under the
hood due to non-competitive App Store submission guidelines.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/">Open Web Advocacy</a> group
have spent years documenting the issues at hand. I haven’t participated
much there, but I’ve built countless web apps and have felt most (if not
all) the pain points that come with supporting Safari users and, as a
Mobile Safari user, not having access to features I’ve built. That
feature gap has closed considerably in the last couple years and the
Safari/Webkit team’s movement is impressive, their relative openness on
issues is welcome, and
<a href="https://webkit.org/standards-positions/">declaring standards
positions</a> reduces risk and removes mystery. But this (potentially)
blows the doors open on competition.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see what happens from here. Will we break out
of the Chromium/Webkit duopoly? Or will we fall headlong into a Chromium
monopoly? Regardless, the EU ruling is a win for the Open Web because
now users have options beyond the OS-provided default browser. Before
there was nothing beyond a thin veneer of choice.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, there are
<a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/this-web-page-is-best-viewed-in-the-eu/">some
questions on how to test this</a> if you don’t live in the EU and it’s
not yet known if (or ever) the rest of the world might also get access
to other browsers. And there seems to be some malicious compliance
afoot… but hopefully over time the situation normalizes towards the
ideal outcome; an unfettered web.
</p>
<p>
Next, if the EU could fix the GDPR banners that are killing the web,
that would be wonderful.

Hi Dave Rupert LLC,
</p>
<p>
I liked your latest blog post
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/quick-thoughts-on-chips/">Quick
toughts on chips</a> and see you are a business leader in accessibility,
Doritos®, and Jekyll blogging software. I thought we should connect. I
would like to inform you of an exciting opportunity.
</p>
<p>
I scraped or stole your email address from some list that you never
signed up for, but would you like help growing your company’s sales? I
can do the same impersonal, unsolicited, scumbag sales shit I’m doing to
you right now but on behalf of your company.
</p>
<p>
I generated this with AI, so it took me literally no time or effort but
I sent it anyways. The federal crime I just committed is utterly
offensive and every time I send this to you under a different fake
business name you instantly delete it, but some might also call it
“innovative”. I can provide this service for your company. Reach new
customers today by deploying large scale AI-driven spam operations.
</p>
<p>
I clearly have no ethics, but you should enter a business relationship
with me, a guy who found your email on the internet.
</p>
<p>
You are now signed up for a no-opt-out email drip campaign to send you
automated replies every day for the next week to get you to reply. Reply
and start a conversation with your harasser if you’d like it to stop.
</p>
<p>
Also, would you like to have my boss on your podcast? He’s a B2B Growth
Saas Fortune Trope 500 Under 500 Startups Entreprenuer and has a red
Porsche. There’s almost no trace of this guy on the internet but you
should absolutely have him on your super niche web development podcast.
I think he’d be a great fit for your audience.
</p>
<p>
What do you say? Are you ready to increase the size of your revenue?
</p>
<p>
Thanks,<br /> Helen

<h1>
Berlin School
</h1>
<p>
I’m listening to
<a href="https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=BE8rMsM3zLs">Berlin Schoool: An
Uncomplicated Approach</a> by Synth Seeker because
<a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="phf">@phf</span></a> recommended it.
</p>
<p>
We were talking about music. All I do is create small jingles for my
podcast but every now and then I wonder about music theory. A while ago
I had saved <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0">Learn music
theory in half an hour</a> by Andrew Huang to get back to it. But all I
had done about it was think to myself: Pick a scale, like this one, B
Major looks nice, OK, so full full half full full full half, that’s
these keys, OK, let me doodle around on these … beep beep boop boop …
here we go. Or maybe do the other one, full full full half full full
half … biep biep boup boup … all right! 🥳
</p>
<p>
But then I wonder: what would my next step be? Some days I look at the
circle of fifth and wonder if that’s hogwash. Non-European music doesn’t
need it! But then again, they also use <em>something</em>. There are
rules because people figured out what generally “works”. Well, on the
other hand there are books about many things and they are neither a
replacement for spending ten thousand hours practising and the rules
they espouse are often just there to get you started and then they are
immediately broken.
</p>
<p>
All I know when I look at a typical drum machine or tracker setup with
<sup>8</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> or similar I immediately want to do a
<a href="https://babayagamusic.com/Music/nine-eight-rhythms.htm"><sup>9</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub>
Karsilama</a> or something like that. My wife’s oriental dancing and all
the Turkish, Arab, Iranian and Maghreb music we listened to must have
left an impression… Or confused the hell out of me, depending on your
perspective. Or mine.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, writing all of this and I’m still not making music. What next, I
wonder. Perhaps playing C Major and playing a bunch of notes it shares
with another scale and then continuing with that scale is cool. Or maybe
not. I don’t know. Or just stay in that scale and do some drum machine
and patterns below that!
</p>
<p>
That Synth Seeker video had a link to a
<a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/cheat-sheet">Key Cheat Sheet
Index</a>. The effect is similar to picking scales in Garage Band or
Animoog: limiting the keys I use in order to stay in that scale. Works
for me!
</p>
<p>
All this listening and writing makes me realize that it’s Sunday, late
at night, I should go to bed, and then I’ll be working and playing
role-playing games and war-games every evening until the next week-end
comes around. Whaaat!
</p>
<p>
I must find time between the things I do to do the other things.
</p>
<p>
This is my life.

We had already been friends for a few years then. By total coincidence
we were both offered writing gigs at the then-new

Dave as the Fetish columnist, where he wrote about all the latest tech
gadgetry, which was a perfect assignment for him, because Dave is one of
the most tech-literate people you’ll ever meet. Also an avid bike rider,
Deadhead, and later a receiver of donated kidneys, and a pioneer of the
technology for matching kidney donors with recipients. He has saved a
lot of lives with his software. And he’s still with us, against all
odds.

I was offered a column to basically write whatever I wanted to write

<p>
I’m trying to get <a href="https://vasl-templates.org/">VASL
Templates</a> to run on my laptop so that I can create nice setups for
Advanced Squad Leader. As it turns out, I have to use <code>pipx</code>
because that automatically creates virtual environments for me, as far
as I understand.
</p>
<pre><code>cd src
git clone https://code.pacman-ghost.com/public/vasl-templates.git
cd vasl-templates
pipx install .
</code></pre>

As it turns out, this is not enough:

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets

So now you need to install PyQt5 into the virtual environment used by

<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: Miek Giebin blog</p>
<p>this project needs a name and a domain. After many years of playing
with YAML in k8s, I’ve returned to using CFEngine (at work). The last
config management software before that was Puppet. An issue I see with
all modern config management tooling is the lack of monitoring and the
impossibility to cleanly roll back. In k8s it works better, but that’s
only for pods running in k8s (which are stateless), not the underlying
machines.</p>

Redefines Distributed PostgreSQL with the Launch of pgEdge Cloud
Developer Edition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-29, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
First serverless distributed Postgres managed cloud service delivers low
latency and high availability in three minutes or less
</p>
<p>
Alexandria, Virginia – January 24, 2024 — pgEdge, Inc., the leading
company dedicated to distributed Postgres, today announced the launch of
pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition, making it easy for developers to deploy
and access distributed Postgres databases for low latency and high
availability. pgEdge Cloud is the first fully distributed database as a
service (DBaaS) optimized for the network edge and based completely on
the widely adopted open-source PostgreSQL database. pgEdge Cloud
Developer is a generous free tier for developers to rapidly and easily
experience the advantages of distributed Postgres.
</p>
<p>
pgEdge Cloud addresses the growing demand for low-latency and “always
on” applications that need to be dispersed across multiple cloud
regions. As a fully managed distributed Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS),
pgEdge Cloud empowers developers and database architects with an
intuitive user interface for creation, management and monitoring of
distributed database clusters running across multiple cloud regions.
</p>
<p>
By putting database nodes closer to global users, pgEdge Cloud can
dramatically reduce latency and application response times, particularly
page loads for database intensive applications. Additionally, having
multiple replicated database nodes across the network ensures high
levels of availability, since when a node fails or is not reachable
traffic automatically routes to the nearest still available node.
</p>
<p>
pgEdge Cloud is especially well suited for use with edge development
platforms such as Cloudflare Workers, Vercel and Fastly. The ability to
place database nodes in multiple regions around the global network,
together with automated and seamless nearest-node routing, allow
developers to deploy very low latency applications that eliminate slow
round trips to a single centrally located database. pgEdge Cloud
Developer Edition includes built-in integration for Cloudflare Workers,
and support for Vercel and Fastly will be available in coming weeks. An
example demonstrating pgEdge Cloud’s ease of integration with Cloudflare
is https://github.com/pgEdge/cloudflare-worker-template. Additionally, a
demo application running against a distributed version of the well-known
“Northwind Traders” database, and implemented with Cloudflare Workers
and pgEdge Cloud, is at: https://northwind.pgedge.com/.
</p>
<p>
Key features of pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition include:
</p>
<p>
Instant Deployment: Developers can now deploy a globally distributed
PostgreSQL serverless database in just a minute, streamlining the
database setup process and accelerating development.
</p>
<p>
Predefined multi-region clusters: Creation and deployment of pgEdge
distributed databases is simplified via prebuilt global clusters.
Developers can select from a set of predefined multi-region clusters
that span the continental US, US and Europe, or US, Europe and Asia.
</p>
<p>
Multi-Master (Active-Active) Architecture: Each database node can handle
both read and write traffic for low latency and high availability,
utilizing an eventually consistent multi-master architecture with built
in conflict resolution and reporting.
</p>
<p>
Latency-based DNS Routing: Geo-proximity routing ensures that users are
connected to the nearest pgEdge node that is up and running.
</p>
<p>
Generous Free Tier: Available for prototyping, application development
and evaluation of pgEdge capabilities with up to 12GB of storage across
three nodes.
</p>
<p>
Management and Monitoring: Eliminates the need for manual infrastructure
configuration and management while providing automated backups, security
against misconfiguration, and continuous monitoring via a clean and easy
to use web dashboard.
</p>
<p>
“pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition marks a significant leap in our mission
to make it easy for developers to build and deploy highly distributed
database applications across the global network,” said Phillip Merrick,
Co-founder and CEO at pgEdge. “The innovative features of the pgEdge
Cloud fully managed service, from multi-region, multi-master support to
its intuitive user interface, empower developers to easily create and
manage distributed PostgreSQL databases.”
</p>
<p>
Availability
</p>
<p>
pgEdge Cloud Developer Edition is available today in preview. Users
requiring more resources or capabilities beyond what is offered in the
Developer Edition free tier can upgrade to either pgEdge Cloud Team
Edition (coming in H1 2024), or pgEdge Cloud Enterprise Edition.

<h2 id="resizing-macos-app-windows-for-169-screen-capture">Resizing
macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Jeff Geerling blog</p>
<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Resizing
macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I frequently need to capture a window of some Mac app for a recording (usually for my YouTube channel), and I&#39;ve used a little AppleScript I wrote years ago for the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Somehow, that script (which I saved as a ‘one shot’ App
(<code>.app</code> extension) that just runs then quits) got deleted off
my Script Editor folder in my iCloud Drive, so I had to re-create it.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, the syntax for this operation is dead simple:
</p>
<pre><code>tell application "Safari"
    set bounds of front window to {0, 50, 1280, 770}
end tell
</code></pre>
<p>
You can adjust the <code>{X, Y, width, height}</code> parameters
accordingly—note that the width and height seem to be additive to the
X/Y. So I use 770 instead of 720 for the height (720 + 50).
</p>
<p>
In <code>Script Editor</code>, save the file as a <code>.app</code>,
with the option to keep it running unchecked. Now, whenever you want a
window sized perfectly for capture, just press Command + Spacebar, then
type in the name of the Script/App you saved, and hit enter. The
top-most window in Safari will scale to exactly 720p resolution.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
spent a couple of days putting together a JSON text editor in a modal
dialog for a project I’m working on. I’m combining the
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/aceEditorDemo">Ace editor</a> with
the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap toolkit</a>. I’ve used
both components before, but never together. And they’re always a bit
tricky to get working because I’m impatient and the docs are spread out,
and there are different versions. It’s all kind of a mess, so you just
get it working and move on, never quite sure why it works, and I rarely
end up with reusable code. But it’s certainly a lot better than starting
from scratch, which basically is impossible, given the depth of the two
components. After spinning my wheels a bit, I did what I always do in
2024, I turned to ChatGPT, outlined the problem, and asked if it knew of
any sample code, which it proceeded to write for me, in about two
seconds (not kidding about that). I copied their code and pasted it into
my editor and ran it. It worked. Then I went through a number of
iterations, restructuring the code to meet my needs, each time checking
with ChatGPT, asking what it thought of my code. And of course there
were problems, for example at one point there were two vertical
scrollbars, and each time we worked <i>together</i> to figure out the
problem and the fix. In the end, I have a solid editor that works
exactly as I want it to, and best of all, I understand how it works.
Here’s the
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/840e8159-9988-4159-8289-5167d6fb78c8">transcript
of the work</a> I did with it, over more than 24 hours, a few different
sessions.
</p>
<p>
I’ll try to remember when this code ships as part of a product, to link
to this perspective.
</p>
<p>
Next up, I’d like to get it to understand my coding conventions, so when
it shares code with me it can save me the step of having to convert its
conventions to mine. In other words, I’d like to return the favor. It’s
doing a great job of teaching and coaching me. I’d like to teach it how
to do that better, so we work better together over time. And perhaps it
can teach human programmers what I’ve learned about programming in over
50 years of doing this work.

bit of philosophy. People say these things aren’t intelligent, but
seriously, if I can engage with it as if it were intelligent, far more
intelligent in ways than I am, what’s the difference between that and
actually being intelligent? I know from a lifetime of dealing with
supposedly intelligent humans, and being one myself, how rarely we focus
on the idea that the person we’re conversing with has an inner life
that’s vastly different from ours and no less complex, and
contradictory. We tend to think of others as being like us, or like
someone who raised us. Always in a movie, never in the moment. So why is
it interesting that ChatGPT is a machine? These are questions thinkers
and writers have been pondering for decades if not centuries, but –
<i>now we’re living it.</i> I’m so happy to have made it this far! An
amazing experience, so much learning in so little time. I don’t
understand how people can sit on the sidelines and not want to be the
first to try all this stuff out, to be part of its evolution. I feel so
lucky.
</p>
<p>
A puzzling thing, in the transcripts I’m identified as “anonymous,” but
I am logged in. It must know my name. I bet this is some kind of setting
which defaults to anonymous, to play it safe.
</p>
<p>
One more thing. I copied and pasted the text above into ChatGPT.
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5fe361cd-1fca-4e8d-82cc-920514e8c4b8">Here
are its comments</a>. A funny thing about ChatGPT is that you can’t ask
it how to use ChatGPT itself. It doesn’t know about the chat UI?
</p>
<p>
Yet another thing. I remember my father, when he was forced to retire by
illness, said how fortunate he was that the internet was there, so he
could be involved in the world even though he had stopped working. He
said his father would have loved it, and I don’t doubt that he would.
Same with ChatGPT. My parents and uncles were always looking up stuff,
wanting to understand how things worked. This is a whole new level. The
machines are now far better at collaborating over the net than humans
are. Where will that take us? Maybe this is something else we can learn
from the machines.

<h2 id="drivethru-i-am-unhappy">Drivethru, I am unhappy!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Drivethru, I am unhappy!
</h1>
<p>
The DrivethruRPG website so depends on shit that it loads from other
domains that I cannot log in no matter how many exceptions I add to
uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or the Firefox content blocking
preferences. And with every second I spend doing this, I resent them
more. And when I finally start Chromium to try and connect, I’m already
ranting as I sit at my laptop. And then I get Connection timed out from
cloudflare and really… I feel like they don’t want my money. Uuuugh.
</p>
<p>
I used their contact form. When I hit the submit button I was greeted by
a white page. I don’t know if they go an email. (I did try the next day
from a phone and that worked – which sort of illustrates the point.)
</p>
<p>
Here’s what I wrote:
</p>
<p>
I think in a world where big tech is tracking us, where everybody and
their uncle is spying on us, it is only natural that people start
locking down their browser. I have uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger
installed and I tell all my browsers to do as much content blocking as
they can, I delete all cookies when I close the browser. It’s the right
thing to do. It is all the more galling when a website such as Drivethru
becomes practically unusable as a consequence of me trying to do the
right thing. It feels as if Drivethru is betraying me to the big tech
corporations, helping them spy on me. It’s a revolting feeling. These
days, I have it every time I remember to use an unprotected Chromium
browser just to log into Drivethru. Every single time I wish for an
alternative. Every single time I hope that itch.io and other competitors
end up replacing you.
</p>
<p>
If only you had a simple, straight forward website, served your own
Javascript, had no tracking, and allowed me to browse stuff and buy it.
I don’t really expect an answer to this email. It just feels unfair to
rant on social media about the situation without telling you about it.
</p>
<p>
I hope Drivethru improves. I really do. I believe that change is
possible and I hope that you do, too.

creates a 100MB version of Windows 11 by axing the windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you know your Windows history, you’ll know that the operating
system got that name when it moved away from using pure MS-DOS and
started using a graphical user interface to show things. As it turns
out, you can force Windows 11 back to its legacy roots and reduce it
back to a command-line interface. This is what the developer of Tiny11
has achieved, calling their new creation “Minwin.” The developer of
Win11, NTDev, posted a video on YouTube about their project. There’s
absolutely nothing flashy here; no Copilot, no Start menu, and
definitely no UI. It’s as graphically complex as the Command Prompt,
which meant that NTDev had to resort to fancy 00s-era ASCII logos to
announce that Minwin was working. ↫ Simon Batt at XDA Definitely a neat
proof-of-concept, and it shows just how modular Windows could be if only
Microsoft allowed its users to take out the parts they don’t need. I
wonder how close this is to Nano Server, an installation option for
Windows Server you’ve probably never heard of. I also like the nod to
MinWin, the informal codename Microsoft used internally to refer to an
effort by a small number of expert Windows kernel engineers to untangle
the spaghetti ball of dependencies that had sprouted between the various
architectural layers of Windows. This project started around Vista, and
eventually made it possible to make broader, sweeping changes to Windows
without breaking things all over the place because the spaghetti ball of
internal, low-level dependencies wasn’t mapped out.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Another month, another pile of improvement to Servo, the rendering
engine written in Rust, originally a Mozilla project. This month the
proof-of-concept browser UI got forward and backward buttons, making
this bare-bones UI just a tiny bit more usable. Of course, the vast
majority of changes and improvements are all focused on the actual
rendering engine, which makes sense because Servo definitely isn’t ready
for any prime time use – nor is anyone claiming it is. I’m incredibly
curious to see where Servo goes in the future.</p>
