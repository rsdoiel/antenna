## Short-Lived Certificates Coming to Let‚Äôs Encrypt

date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Starting <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/11/eoy-letter-2024/">next year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our longstanding offering won&#8217;t fundamentally change next year, but we are going to introduce a new offering that&#8217;s a big shift from anything we&#8217;ve done before&#8212;short-lived certificates. Specifically, certificates with a lifetime of six days. This is a big upgrade for the security of the TLS ecosystem because it minimizes exposure time during a key compromise event.</p>
<p>Because we&#8217;ve done so much to encourage automation over the past decade, most of our subscribers aren&#8217;t going to have to do much in order to switch to shorter lived certificates. We, on the other hand, are going to have to think about the possibility that we will need to issue 20x as many certificates as we do now. It&#8217;s not inconceivable that at some point in our next decade we may need to be prepared to issue 100,000,000 certificates per day...</p></blockquote>

## Cultural power vs. economic power

The US has at least two different systems of what gets termed ‚Äúsocioeconomic class‚Äù by Siderea Economic class refers to money. It refers to the wealth or poverty of a person, and to the privileges they do or do not have because of their economic might or lack thereof. Social class is what is being [&#8230;]

The Advent calendar in Glow Blogs has now 15 wee activities for mid-upper primary. 5 minutes of Christmas fun or a brain break for each day. New ones appear at 1 minute past midnight. I have learnt a bit about the Site Editor when making the Calendar page. I used the new, to Glow, Grid [&#8230;]

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3ldeeg74mdc25">Deep in the thread</a>: "I want to give a huge volume of writing to ChatGPT or something much like it, and then ask it to give me an outline of what I wrote, and allow me to massage the outline, churn out a synopsis. I'd like to see what's there, and there's far too much writing for me to do that."

What if you had a twitter-like system that was embedded in a ChatGPT-like app. What would you do with that?

When it comes to topics I am expert in, they tell a mushed up version of extreme points of view, that (surprise!) favor the continued existence of their jobs. The choice of the <i>truth-based</i> label is kind of a clue. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">üòÑ</span>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

This post spawned quite a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3ldc6fz4sfz2v">thread</a> on Bluesky: "The AI industry could give us easy tools to build our own models, from our own archived writing, for private use. This may be a blind spot. It's as if when personal computers started, instead of spreadsheet editors, we were offered great sets of tabulated recalc'ing data. Fun to watch, maybe useful for researchers, but nothing compared to the utility of playing 'what if' on our own models."
