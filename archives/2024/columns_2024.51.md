**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end while a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef">coral reef</a> has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from. Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in the 60s,. You would have missed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles">all that followed</a>. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the 2020s. That story is far from over.

A system as capable as Twitter. It has to be privately held by a group that can be trusted not to interfere with democratic use of the system. This can't be guaranteed, it has to be based on trust. It needs to scale very quickly. Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and quickly understood as parallel to Twitter. Bluesky has a lot of what's needed, but its ownership is not clear. But it more like Twitter than Twitter is today and I expect that to continue.

## Musings on Media in the Age of AI

date: 2024-12-22, from: Om Malik blog

I recently wrote about the future of the&#160;browser and&#160;Surf, a new app from the creators of Flipboard. Both stories&#160;explore&#160;the changing nature of the&#160;web&#160;and its impact on the media landscape. I’m not shy about expressing my frustrations with the establishment media and the ever-present gulf between technology and&#160;old&#160;media&#160;companies. I’ve&#160;been involved with the&#160;internet&#160;and online publishing from the &#8230;

These guys should all be using the same protocol. It's a travesty that each of them considers their product to define the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> -- they don't understand the first thing about the web, what the miracle the web was. Before the web, the tech world was as it is now, fragmented by huge companies that didn't care about anything but their own internal drama. The last thing they would consider was reusing something that was already running. While all that was going on Unix basically agreed on a core set of functions that formed a basis for interop. They weren't perfect, there were differences in each of the Unixes, but you could reuse most of what you knew on each of the platforms. But Apple, Microsoft, Sun and IBM each ran their own ecosystems. And then one day along came the web. Instead of bookshelves of docs, it wasn't even a booklet. You could be up and running with a "website" in ten minutes. I speak from experience. My first website was authored with a freaking email. Threads, Bluesky and Mastodon are the IBM, Microsoft and Apple of 2024. It's ridiculous if they think this is a web. To paraphrase the late great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgtfEX2Pka0&t=65s">Lloyd Bentsen</a>, I knew the web, the web was a friend of mine. You are not the web.

## Plan 9 is a bicycle

date: 2024-12-21, from: Liam on Linux

Someone on Reddit asked <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/unix/comments/1hih6vs/screenshots_of_plan9_operatin_system/m30q8be/">how easy it was to do &quot;simple stuff&quot; on 9front.</a><br /><br />This is not a Linux distribution. It is an experimental research OS.<br /><br />Look, all Linux distros are the same kernel with different tools slapped on top. Mostly the GNU tools and a bunch of other stuff. Linux is one operating system.<br /><br />Linux is a GPL implementation of a simple monolithic 1970s Unix kernel. All the BSDs are BSD-licensed implementations of a simple monolithic 1970s Unix kernel.<br /><br />Taking a high-level view they are different implementations of the same design.<br /><br />So it's very easy to port the same apps to all of them. All run Firefox and Thunderbird and LibreOffice. They are slightly different flavours of a single design.<br /><br />They are all just Unixes.<br /><br />Solaris and AIX and HP/UX are the same design. All just Unixes.<br /><br />Now we get to outliers. Some break up the kernel into different programs that work together. This is called a microkernel design. Mac OS X/macOS, Minix 3, QNX, CoyotOS, keyKOS. Still pretty much Unixes but weird ones.<br /><br />The big names among them, like macOS, still run the same apps. Firefox, LibreOffice, etc.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/">Still UNIX.<br /></a><br />9front is a distro of Plan 9. Plan 9 is NOT a Unix.<br /><br />A small team -- originally 2 guys, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, designed Unix and C.<br /><br />It caught on. Lots of people built versions of it. Some of them changed the design a bit. Doesn't really matter. It is all just Unix.<br /><br />It takes the core design and adds a million layers of junk on top, implemented by well-meaning people who just had jobs to do and get stuff working, so now it's huge and vastly complex... but it's just Unix.<br /><br />It's an ancient tradition to compare computers to vehicles. Unix is a car. Lots of people make cars. It's surprisingly hard to define what a &quot;car&quot; is but it's a box on wheels, probably with a roof (but maybe not), probably with windows (but maybe not), on wheels (probably 4, maybe 3, could be 6) with an engine.<br /><br />All Unixes are types of car. You can't take the gearbox of a Ford and just bolt it into a Honda. Won't fit. But you can take a Ford and take a Honda and put 4 people in it and drive it on the same road to the same shop and buy stuff and carry it home.<br /><br />Windows is... not a car, but it's close. Let's say it's a bus. Still a box on wheels, still carries people (but lots of them.) You can buy a bus to yourself and drive to the shops, with 40 friends instead of 4, but you wouldn't want to. It's big and slow and hard to drive and expensive. But you could do.<br /><br />Plan 9 is not Unix. Plan 9 is what the guys who invented Unix did next.<br /><br />Plan 9 is not a car.<br /><br />You are only thinking of cars. We are not talking about cars any more.<br /><br />Plan 9 is, say, a bicycle. (I know, bicycles came before cars. Sue me, it's a metaphor not a history lecture.)<br /><br />It still has wheels. It still goes places. You can sit on it, and ride it, and go hundreds of miles. You can go to the shops and do your shopping and take it home, but no, 4 of you can't. You can't put the shopping in the boot. It doesn't have a boot. You need a backpack or panniers.<br /><br />Stop thinking of cars. We have left car-land behind. There are a hundred other types of &quot;things that have wheels and go&quot; that aren't cars. There are motorbikes and roller skates and skateboards and go-karts and racing cars and unicycles and roller blades and cross-country-skiing roller-trainers and wheely shoes and loads more.<br /><br />You're asking what kind of car a bicycle is. It isn't.<br /><br />&gt; I'm just wondering how easy it would be to load this on a cheap laptop and get up and running.<br /><br />It's doable. A few hours work maybe.<br /><br />&gt; Does it require a lot of tweaking to get simple things working?<br /><br />You do not define &quot;simple things&quot;. But downthread you do.<br /><br />You will never usefully browse the web on 9front. It doesn't really have a web browser. There are some kinda sorta things that do 1% of what a mainstream web browser does but you won't like them.<br /><br />It doesn't really have &quot;apps&quot;. Nobody ever wrote any. (With rounding errors. There is a tiny bit of 3rd party software, but you won't recognise anything.)<br /><br />Plan 9 is a bicycle. It can take you places but you can't drive it if you only know how to drive cars. Never mind that it has a manual gear shift and there are 27 gears in 2 different gearing systems and no clutch and you need to memorise all the combinations you need to climb a hill and speed along the flat.<br /><br />Also, you know, you need to pedal.<br /><br />There's no engine.<br /><br />&quot;I want to write Markdown text and print it to a laser printer.&quot;<br /><br />Right, well, you'll need to find a dozen separate tools, learn how to work them, and learn how to link them together... Or, you'll need to write your own.<br /><br />Plan 9 is not the end point of the story, either.<br /><br />Plan 9 was a step on the road to Inferno. Inferno is not a car and it's not a bicycle. It is, in extremely vague and general terms, a cross between an operating system, and Java, and the JVM. All in one.<br /><br />It's... a pedal-powered aeroplane. You can't ride it to the shops but it is in its way even more amazing than a bicycle... it can fly.<br /><br />What you call &quot;simple stuff&quot; is car stuff. You can't do it. It is not as &quot;simple&quot; as you think it is.<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=93196" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## dropping hyper

The ride is coming to an end. The experiment is done. We tried, but we admit defeat. Four years ago we started adding support for an alternative HTTP backend in curl. It would use a library written in rust, called hyper. The idea was to introduce an alternative implementation of HTTP internals that you could &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/12/21/dropping-hyper/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">dropping hyper</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

The feature I want is when you paste a URL and there's a selection, the selected text is turned into a link. A video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwQQPTlpNZQ">explanation</a>. I've burned two full sessions on this, seeking advice from ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity. They all pretend to know what to do, but in fact they don't. The clipboard is one of those areas of the browser that is held together with rumors and confusion, as is MediumEditor, and the intersection is rumors and confusion squared. Tomorrow I'm going to work on other things, and the day after until I have an idea for another way to approach this. I really want this feature because apparently it's supported in Slack, WordPress and other software that supports links.

Amazing that the tech industry hasn't tried to retrieve its reputation from the ones who are repping us in DC nowadays. Software doesn't <i>have</i> to treat their users like nobodies. Quite the opposite. I come from the school that says our users are the smartest most powerful people in the world and it's our privilege to create tools for them.

Ours is slightly bigger, and grows as your piece gets longer. Neatly arranged like the others, and all your writing flows through WordPress and RSS, where each of the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">TLTBs</a> only flows into their limited and incompatible views of the social web. RSS and WordPress are a powerful distribution system. Lots of software works with those two protocols, as do many programmers, and they're both marvelously open, stable over more than twenty years each, and <i>can't</i> be owned by billionaires. Pretty powerful place, kind of amazing that there's so much room here, and the people are friendly. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## 2024-12-20 Games

<h1 id="2024-12-20-games">2024-12-20 Games</h1>

<p>I ran role-playing games and I played in them.
I think I tracked almost all of them using my bot,
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/norn.git">Norn</a>.
The result is visible on the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%C3%BCrich/">Montag in Zürich</a> page.</p>

<p>The Burning Wheel game was effectively a 1-on-1 game that I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll pick up again.</p>

<p>Elredd refers to my running of the Arden Vul Megadungeon using AD&amp;D 1st ed.</p>

<p>Knochentanz is my BREAK!! RPG campaign.</p>

<p>Montag refers to my running of Stonehell and the Giant Giants hexcrawl.</p>

<p>Traveller refers to my Traveller one-hots in the Tau subsector.</p>

<p>Ultraviolet Grasslands (UVG) refers to my UVG game using 2d6 rules (Halberts).</p>

## Losing (or gaining) a Genius

date: 2024-12-20, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Sixteenth in the News Commons series. Dave Askins is shutting down the B Square Bulletin. This is tragic. And not just for Bloomington and Monroe County. (Dave covered the governing bodies of both like a glove.) It&#8217;s tragic for journalism. Because Dave was far more than an exemplar of reporting in service to the public. [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I'm thinking maybe we'll do a Kickstarter for <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>. It'll cost money to run the server and continue to develop the sofware. It fills a big enough need to ask the users to support it financially, at least to get it off the ground. The server is open source so theoretically anyone can run one. But in practice most people will probably just want to use the service. I just want to solve this problem so we can start building a developer ecosystem around WordPress that it's never had. Think of WordLand as a pump primer. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## 2024-12-19 Valais

date: 2024-12-19, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-12-19-valais">2024-12-19 Valais</h1>

<p>We are spending a week in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valais">Valais</a>. It’s the source of the Rhone river (comparable to the Rhine except it flows west instead of north). We’re at around 1300m above sea level, here.</p>

<p>The entire valley goes from east to west. There are mountains to the north, east and south. So in three out of four cardinal directions, the clouds already rained over some mountains. This region has the most sunny days in all of Switzerland.</p>

<p>The Valais has two parts: the upper part is German speaking, the lower part is French speaking. The German speaking part used to lord it over the French speaking part. The region joined Switzerland in 1815.</p>

<p>When I came here, I was about two weeks old. I don’t remember much. We left the Valais when I was at the age of learning to ride a bicycle. When is that? Maybe four years old? Not kindergarten age, in any case.</p>

<p>In the seventies, the Valais got a tunnel through the mountains to connect it to the German speaking rest of Switzerland. I remember my das thinking the locals were extremely backwards. They didn’t understand that he rode the bicycle up the mountain just for fun. They threatened to call the police when they saw him tend his tomatoes on a Sunday (no working on a Sunday, it’s the law!).</p>

<p>A little badmouthing remains. Outside of the Valais, people like to think that they are corrupt. The current and the last FIFA bosses – Blatter and Infantino – are from Valais. Enough said.</p>

<p>People here, on the other hand, like to call everybody from outside the canton “Üsseschwyzer” (people from “outer Switzerland”).</p>

<p>Historically, it was conquered by the Romans in 57 BCE, ended up as part of Burgundy in 888, was handed over to the bishop of Sion in 999 (still the capital), was part of the Holy Roman Empire in 1032, fell under the influence of Savoy, pushed them back and finally managed to conquer the lower parts during the Burgundian wars in 1475. This new, French speaking and subservient region got further expanded in 1536.</p>

<p>With the French Revolution there was a revolt in 1798 against the upper Valais; France conquered the Valais in 1799, founded an independent republic in 1802 and absorbed it in 1810. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815 they joined the Swiss.</p>

I watched <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber">Ari Melber</a> last night and noted he isn't yet on Bluesky or hasn't updated his show graphics to include it? He usually tries to be leading edge in this, and at this point he looks a bit behind the times, imho, ymmv etc. After Melber, I stayed through the opening segment of Joy Reid and was charged up by her intro. She's clicking on all cylinders. They must be thinking about gutting or reconfiguring MSNBC at this time. It's up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/01/msnbc-comcast-cable-news-for-sale-elon-musk-trump">for sale</a>, I wonder if a billionaire will see the wisdom of owning that piece of real estate as Musk saw the value in Twitter, far beyond what the stock market valued it at. (BTW, I should add that I benefited from his largesse, I was a very <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/11/15/0295.html">small shareholder</a> in Twitter at the time. I did not want to sell, but my vote didn't matter. Heh.)

Presumably these are all things the NYT wouldn't let him run? Or if he submitted them, would they edit them into mushy nonsense. I've been there, I quit Wired when they edited my pieces, with my name on them, where I said things I thought were inane, things that I most definitely did not say. There's never been a better illustration of the importance of blogging and the value that's removed by publishing in the NYT. If a <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2008/10/13/princetons-paul-krugman-wins-nobel-economics-0">Nobel Laureate</a> like Krugman can't get his ideas out that way, with the huge advantage in circulation they have (as Wired did over my humble blog), then there must be a reason to have blogs after all. I don't think he will be my BOTY for 2024, but maybe next year, if he keeps up the intelligent irreverence.

<p>I get that a single master key makes the whole system easier, but it&#8217;s very fragile security.</p>

## Every token is a feature

date: 2024-12-19, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I’m in the middle of a design tokens project and I thought I’d share something I’m learning that is probably obvious to everyone else; every design token is a feature.</p>
<p>A token is a magical contract between design and engineering, if we agree to use the same name to abstractly refer to the same value, it will produce a desired outcome. That bridge alone is probably worth the investment, but tokens solve even more organizational problems. The mobile app and the website can look the same by sharing a single JSON file. But wait, there’s more! If the blue a different team chose is not blue enough for you, you can make your own blue and apply it at the global scope or the individual element scope. Tokens as an organizational feature are a powerful concept but there’s tons of nuance packed behind it.</p>
<p>Like features, too many tokens can bloat your system. I recently learned –because I’m lucky to work with people who work on browsers– there’s a not-so-theoretical limit where the browser starts taking a performance hit based purely on the number of CSS variables. There’s no hard upper limit on the number of variables (we drew a line at ~500) because the limit ultimately depends on the size and the depth of your DOM. Style recalcs and tree walking are expensive problems for a browser. Alias tokens like <code>--foo: var(--bar)</code> compound the problem and the more static you can be, like <code>--foo: #bada55</code>, the better. Infinite customizability and peak performance are often at odds.</p>
<p>Like features, too many tokens can create organizational problems! This is the opposite of what I said above, how can that be? It’s possible to generate enough tokens that they become their own <a href="https://robinrendle.com/essays/systems-mistakes-and-the-sea/">hyperobject</a>, impossible to comprehend from the outside, so well-meaning people eject from the system. Detached instances. One-offs. Snowflakes.</p>
<p>Like features, tokens can create little piles of <a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/">technical debt</a>. “Is anyone still using <code>--color-beefcake-primary-2</code>?” you shout into the void of the team chat. No one responds because no one knows. The person who does know left the company five months ago. Alas, we’ll bolt on more until we find time to fix it. Always adding. Never subtracting.</p>
<p>Like features, some tokens are going to have a massive payoff if implemented and some tokens the user benefit is less clear. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">You’re passing organizational complexity on to the user</a>. Like features, you can build over-complicated machinery around a simple concept like sharing values. Like features, people will build every part without considering whether they actually need each facet.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if someone wants to implement hundreds or thousands of little features in an application, that’s probably a red flag. <a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/09/if-statements-should-cost-10000/">If-statements are expensive over their lifetime</a>. But from my experience, a good system of tokens inside a cascade of meaningful componentry can make a product resonate with consistency across many surfaces, while providing just enough customizability to differentiate when necessary.</p>

I also created a <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10169521-using-projects-in-chatgpt">ChatGPT project</a> with the same code. Presumably I can ask it questions about the code. Because I have a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes.md</a> file in the GitHub project, ChatGPT understands where I want to take this project. Most amazing, it wrote a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md">summary</a> of what it saw in the project. I <a href="https://github.com/scripting/davegpt/blob/main/gptnotes.md">added that</a> to the GitHub project, of course, and since it was in Markdown, it fit right in with no mods. The power of standards. I love it when things that should work, do. The next step is to implement a feature in the new Bingeworthy that can only be done with an AI bot like ChatGPT. It's such a thrill to be working on this stuff as it's happening. And what a delight that it has an API. I don't mind that I'm paying for it, I love the idea of paying to break down walls to create new things that couldn't have been created before.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

What could journalism do to help the country? Move your shows out into the red territories. Make it a requirement that Chris and Joy, Lawrence or Rachel, if they want to stay on the air, have to broadcast from one of the red states. It could be a large city in a red state. The reason is symbolic and practical. The red state voters wouldn't be such a mystery if you knew some of them from your everyday life. And you might have a few of them on the show. You have some selling to do, the idea you're selling is that you care about the people you don't know.

Maybe they should factor that into their thinking, what kind of relationship would you have with an organization that only cared about what you thought if they needed something very specific from you in that exact moment. Any other time, who are you again? We are without leaders.

## In praise of the hundred page idea

date: 2024-12-17, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

I prefer a lightweight nonfiction book to a detailed tome. I&#8217;m a dilettante of many interests, so my attention for any given topic is more likely to sustain 100 pages than 600. The sweet spot is longer than a longread internet article, but that doesn&#8217;t demand a months-long commitment: a 2-3 hour text. At about [&#8230;]

Sometimes the ideas prove workable and other times they're like the great brainstorms one had with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_boom">cocaine</a> in the 80s, not that I would know, but have heard. Anyway, I was daydreaming about what I'd do with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+bingeworthy">Bingeworthy</a> if I was going to continue working on it. I thought about the mode I want to use it in. I want to watch a series that I would like, not that Netflix thinks I'd like, because their idea of what I'd like is bullshit. I find that I'll like almost anything that's rated in the 80s by Metacritic, but really only if the NYT reviewed it well. I'll give almost any NYT <i>critics choice</i> a go. So what I really want in the middle of the Bingeworthy display of a program is 250 words about the program aggregated from various critics as Metacritic does so well. Unfortunately neither Metacritic or the NYT offer an API for this as far as I know. Oh too bad, same old thing. No access to the data where you need it (btw, ideally Bingeworthy would be baked into the TV set, or all the streamers could be played in the context of Bingeworthy). Anyway, then <i>boom</i> it hit me, holy shit the thing I was farting around with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/17.html#a164345">in the outliner</a> could actually do this. Now I'm going to need to be able to call ChatGPT from a Node app.

## Hacking Digital License Plates

date: 2024-12-17, updated: 2024-12-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Not everything needs to be digital and &#8220;smart.&#8221; License plates, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/digital-license-plate-jailbreak-hack/">for example</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Josep Rodriguez, a researcher at security firm IOActive, has revealed a technique to “jailbreak” digital license plates sold by Reviver, the leading vendor of those plates in the US with 65,000 plates already sold. By removing a sticker on the back of the plate and attaching a cable to its internal connectors, he&#8217;s able to rewrite a Reviver plate&#8217;s firmware in a matter of minutes. Then, with that custom firmware installed, the jailbroken license plate can receive commands via Bluetooth from a smartphone app to instantly change its display to show any characters or image...</p></blockquote>

I'm farting around with the OpenAI API. I have a nice encapsulation for calls to ChatGPT, one that hides all the tricky stuff, all you need is an apiToken to make it work, something that is available for free. The first place I put it is in an outliner. Basically I can write a question in a headline, click an icon and the response from ChatGPT is placed in a series of sub-heads. Interesting to see that they use Markdown to convey the response. The logical choice. I'm not sure how or if I will use this in my writing, but now I have an idea what it's good for. Here's a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/17/fartingAroundWithOpenAiApi.png">screen shot</a> of a question I asked and the answer. Also the API is very slow. A question like that would be displayed instantly in their app, in my app it takes a half minute. And I have to pay for it, whereas in their app it's all covered by my $20 a month subscription.

Via <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2024/12/weekend-reads-642/">Barry Ritholtz</a> we find this infographic entitled <i>Top Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks</i> showing the best total return over the past 5, 10, 15 and 20 years.

<br />
In each case, Nvidia is the best performing stock, and it is the only stock to appear in all four periods. Sounds great, doesn't it? Why wouldn't you just hold NVDA all the time and be guaranteed to beat the market?<br />

But follow me below the fold for more detail from someone who has been long NVDA for more than three decades..<br />

Alas,  this infographic is deeply misleading because they cherry-picked their data. Nvidia's stock price is extraordinarily volatile. The log plot of NVDA shows that on average over its history every three years it suffers a drop of between 45% and 80%. Fortunately, over the same time it has had much larger rises. Thus when discussing the return for being long NVDA for a period the start and end dates matter a lot.<br />
<br />
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody>
<tr>
<th>Dec</th><th>Close</th><th>Dec</th><th>Close</th><th>NVDA</th><th>S&amp;P</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>2004</td><td>0.19</td><td>2009</td><td>0.38</td><td>+100%</td><td>-9.1%</td></tr>
<tr><td>2009</td><td>0.38</td><td>2014</td><td>0.48</td><td>+26%</td><td>+85.8%</td></tr>
<tr><td>2014</td><td>0.48</td><td>2019</td><td>5.91</td><td>+1131%</td><td>+61.7%</td></tr>
<tr><td>2019</td><td>5.91</td><td>2024</td><td>134.25</td><td>+22715%</td><td>+87.6%</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
This table shows the performance of NVDA and the S&amp;P 500 over each of the 5-year periods in the infographic. Over three of the 5-year periods NVDA out-performed the S&amp;P 500, and over the remaining one it under-performed.  By choosing appropriate starting points it is easy to find other 5-year periods when NVDA under-performed the S&amp;P 500. For example, from 8/2007 to 8/2012 NVDA returned -63.7% but the S&amp;P returned -5.6%. Or from 11/2001 to 11/2006 NVDA returned +10.7% but the S&amp;P returned +23.5%.<br />

Although the infographic suggests that the huge out-performance started 20 years ago and has been decreasing, this is misleading for two reasons. First, the infographic's numbers are for the whole 20-year period, not for each 5-year period. Second, they are dominated by the rise in the most recent 5-year period.  The linear plot of NVDA makes it clear that, had the most recent 5-year period been like any of the others, Nvidia would not have been in the infographic at all.<br />
<br />
None of this is financial advice. Nevertheless, Nvidia is a great company, and it is possible to make money in its stock. There are two ways to do it, trading on the stock's volatility, or buying low and being prepared to hold it for many years.<br />
<br />
Remember, past performance is no guarantee of future performance. If NVDA were to repeat the past 5-year return over the next 5 years, it would be around $3,100. To maintain its current P/E of 52.85 it would need annual revenue of around $2.6T.<br />

## Getting beyond ProcessExecutionErrors when installing Ubuntu on arm64

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Getting beyond ProcessExecutionErrors when installing Ubuntu on arm64</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Currently there are precious few SystemReady Arm computers—computers like the <a href="https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-astra-a1-n1/configure">System76 Thelio Astra</a> I was sent recently to test.</p>

<p>The level or 'band' of <a href="https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Arm%20SystemReady%20Band">SystemReady SR</a> used by modern Ampere-based arm64 workstations and servers means you can install any out-of-the-box Linux distributions, as long as they provide an arm64-compatible installer.</p>

<p>Ubuntu has some of the most complete support for arm64, so I went to download a Live CD ISO I could flash to a USB stick, to install on my test Thelio Astra. For server installs (with no GUI), either 4k or 64k page sizes, there are easily-findable ISOs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm">Ubuntu Server for Arm</a></li>
</ul>

<p>However, for desktop, you can only get it via daily build downloads:</p></div>

## Short-Lived Certificates Coming to Let’s Encrypt

date: 2024-12-16, updated: 2024-12-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Starting <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/12/11/eoy-letter-2024/">next year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our longstanding offering won&#8217;t fundamentally change next year, but we are going to introduce a new offering that&#8217;s a big shift from anything we&#8217;ve done before&#8212;short-lived certificates. Specifically, certificates with a lifetime of six days. This is a big upgrade for the security of the TLS ecosystem because it minimizes exposure time during a key compromise event.</p>
<p>Because we&#8217;ve done so much to encourage automation over the past decade, most of our subscribers aren&#8217;t going to have to do much in order to switch to shorter lived certificates. We, on the other hand, are going to have to think about the possibility that we will need to issue 20x as many certificates as we do now. It&#8217;s not inconceivable that at some point in our next decade we may need to be prepared to issue 100,000,000 certificates per day...</p></blockquote>

This may be a blind spot. It's as if when personal computers started, instead of spreadsheet editors, we were offered great sets of tabulated recalc'ing data. Fun to watch, maybe useful for researchers, but nothing compared to the utility of playing 'what if' on our own models."
