**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

The problem with everyone who says you have to get off Twitter is that we're giving up the meeting place we had and spreading all the bits into the wind. Are you going to leave the United States now that Trump is going to be president again? Leaving Twitter is a lot like that. How do you know Musk isn't going to have to sell it? Might happen. How would you feel then about having quit Twitter in a huff as if it would always be the bastion of assholes. It's a mistake. He isn't making money with it. The more you use it the more it costs him, btw. By leaving you might actually be helping him survive. Nothing is so linear, first big point. Second big point, no one cares about your gestures.

If you think <i>woke</i> is the problem, try reading the US Constitution and amendments. Really read them. Pretend you didn't know it was the Constitution. One woke idea after another. Basically if you don't believe in woke, you're in the wrong freaking country.

Last night's email had a YouTube video in it. I had forgotten that they get lost somewhere in the email delivery supply chain, so the fire that I put in the email was <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/12/27/emailscreen.png">not transmitted</a>. It's even worse than it appears. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1mXNfI1cbU">link to the video</a> of the fire, with any luck that will get through in tonight's email. Happy holidays everyone!

## Casino Players Using Hidden Cameras for Cheating

date: 2024-12-27, updated: 2024-12-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/miniature-camera-poker-cheating/">basic strategy</a> is to place a device with a hidden camera in a position to capture normally hidden card values, which are interpreted by an accomplice off-site and fed back to the player via a hidden microphone. Miniaturization is making these devices harder to detect. Presumably AI will soon obviate the need for an accomplice.</p>

## The Big Picture: How we got into this mess, and how we get out of it.

Capitalism is compatible with democracy only if democracy is the dominant partner. It was dominant from 1933 until 1980. Then hyper-capitalism took over, and finally gave us Trump.

## How I’m cleaning out my music library

This week I took an aggressive initial pass on cleaning out my music library, trying to err on the side of removal. In the past, I&#8217;ve been hesitant to remove older tracks that I don&#8217;t listen to much for the sake of historical records, to keep old playlists playable. But now that I&#8217;ve cycled through [&#8230;]

## My little games workshop

date: 2024-12-26, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I always promised myself that if I was ever unemployed that I’d make a video game. When life dealt me an unpaid work hiatus though, the last thing I wanted to do was code in my spare time<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. I worried I would have to let that dream, that part of me, die on the vine. But as interviews started going well the desire to try my hand at making a game came back. And in true adult ADHD fashion I didn’t focus on one game, but rather made a half-dozen different games in different formats and three of those games have made it to the release stage. Here’s an overview of those games and a little background on how I manage to make them.</p>
<h2>Mundango, a bingo game about life’s small things</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/mundango-v1.png" alt="the bingo board ui for mundango" width="1200" height="719">
<p>During my unpaid hiatus I found myself getting a lot of pleasure in the small things; seeing a cool bird, staring at trees, or watching animals be animal-like. To not lose sight of those moments and with a desire to replace my social media addiction, I made <a href="https://mundango.daverupert.com/">Mundango</a>, a bingo game about noticing life’s small things.</p>
<p>The icon is a chill turtle because it invokes the feeling of going slow. The font is a playful little handwritten sans. And there’s a (Japan-inspired) minor pentatonic scale that plays as you check items off. I hope you enjoy it but more importantly I hope it nudges you (and myself) to stop doomscrolling on our phones so much and to start looking outside the windows a bit more often.</p>
<h2>Hard Code &amp; Soft Skills, a workplace adventure</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/hcss.jpg" alt="A character creator tool for hard code soft skills" /></p>
<p>In January, the unemployment got to my head and I got inspired to make a role playing game called <a href="https://hardcodesoftskills.daverupert.com/">Hard Code &amp; Soft Skills</a>. It’s a workplace-themed<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> clone of <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/">Lasers &amp; Feelings</a>, a one-pager by John Harper. The original game is loosely based on Star Trek, where you can use lasers or diplomacy to solve your problems. I wanted to flip that a bit and have the game world be a startup because tech needs to realize that soft skills are as valuable as code, so that’s my big social commentary.</p>
<p>It wasn’t labor intensive to clone the original game, but I put a lot of time into building a little one-page website with a character generator. It’s Astro and web components, if you’re curious. I also put a lot of mental energy in planning out the <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/646/">first episode of Hard Code &amp; Soft Skills on Shop Talk</a>.  It went better than I could have imagined and what a thrill to get it out the door.</p>
<h2>Pentablaster, an instrument with no wrong notes</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/pentablaster.png" alt="the UI for pentablaster" width="1200" height="719">
<p>The pentatonic scale sound effects in Mundango were a hit with some folks, so I dug in and built a whole instrument that only plays pentatonic scales and called it <a href="https://pentablaster.daverupert.com/">Pentablaster</a>! It took about a week and I’m pleased with how it turned out. It’s jammy and a little unique. I extended it to allow you to change the key and to choose which pentatonic scale you want to play.</p>
<p>There’s some features I’d like to add, but worry it’ll enter the “so complicated I don’t want to work on it anymore” paradox. I’ll park it for now, but I learned a lot about <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> in the process.</p>
<h2>An unreleased solitaire game</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/youdied.jpg" alt="a skull with the text you died beneath it and a button that says reset game" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;">
<p>I went on a short bender learning about Solo RPGs (like <a href="https://coisinhaverde.itch.io/ronin">Ronin</a>) and that sparked an interest in trying my hand at making one. I challenged myself to prototype the game on pen and paper first to prove the game mechanics. After an evening of brainstorming, I devised a game system based on a standard 52-card deck of playing cards as a prototype. I play-tested it with my son and we both thought that I should make a mobile app version. After some nights and weekends, I had a rough alpha prototype.</p>
<p>I play-tested the game with friends in the ShopTalk Discord and I got great, actionable feedback. They confirmed my suspicion that the RNG (randomness) was too high, creating a lack of decision making agency and thereby ruining the fun. I made some tweaks and the second round of play-tests went much better. It’s feeling pretty good now, but I think there’s one more ingredient needed to tie it all together before public release.</p>
<h2>An unreleased Playdate game</h2>
<p><video src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/newguy.mp4" muted autoplay loop playsinline alt="player walking around in office with npc boss in room, he exits and goes to a much larger room, black and white monochrome only"></video></p>
<p>Since acquiring a little yellow wind-up boi, it’s been a small dream to write a game for <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a> and I picked the idea that seemed like the easiest and most PlayDate’y and descoped the hell out of it so that I’d have an achievable goal. It’s an office-themed<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> RPG type game.</p>
<p>After playing with Playdate’s web-based game editor <a href="https://play.date/pulp/">Pulp</a> and trying PulpScript, I felt the chafing of limitations and wanted to get closer to the metal. I watched every one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPcfC98JogQ&amp;list=PLlMPQvEA0GZPOuKJyhSr3Ra0vrpCiBTnb">SquidGod’s Development Tutorials</a> and decided to download the <a href="https://play.date/dev/">Playdate SDK</a> and write the game in Lua. This is my first time writing Lua and it’s been interesting because everything in Lua is a table: Arrays are tables, Dictionaries are tables, Objects are tables… tables all the way down. That takes some “undoing” of prior programming best practices to feel comfortable but after awhile you learn to embrace the chaos and for-loopedness.</p>
<p>To short cut some of the player controllers and level building I picked <a href="https://github.com/unbelievableflavour/Cotton?tab=readme-ov-file">Cotton</a>, a Lua-based framework for Playdate. Cotton uses the <a href="https://ldtk.io/">LDtk map editor</a> for easier map making and that was a feature I was looking forward to using. However, I encountered a bug somewhere between the framework and LDtk. If I updated the map, my player could no longer get to a different room. Insecurity started to set in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this bug because I don’t know Lua?</li>
<li>Is this bug because I don’t understand LDtk?</li>
<li>Or is this a bug somewhere in Cotton?</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback from the Playdate Dev Discord was “Last commit is 2 years ago, project’s dead” and “Use [Framework X] instead”…  😮‍💨 Ugh. I thought only JavaScript dorks did this but apparently Lua dorks do it too. I understand they’re trying to be a version of helpful; but this is terrible advice for someone who is learning. “You need to start over” or in video game parlance “The Princess is in another castle” kills the dopamine rush needed when learning something new.</p>
<p>But I didn’t give up. And after many shower thoughts, I mustered up the energy to do some good ol’ fashioned debugging. The first step was step-by-step isolation where I manually diff’d thousands of lines of JSON line-by-line. That one step taught me there was a change in the exported JSON somewhere between the version of LDtk that Cotton used (v1.3) and the latest version of LDtk (v1.5.3). The primary key for joining map tiles no longer exists in v1.5.3. Then I followed the breadcrumb trail of how Cotton imports LDtk files and I fixed the bug by creating a new table (because Lua) to act as a join table for the neighboring map tiles.</p>
<p>I was able to finish my core game loop and I’m proud of that, but fixing a framework level bug cut the wind out of my sails. <a href="https://github.com/unbelievableflavour/Cotton/issues/36">I may PR the bug fix</a>… but it’s more of a patch job than a holistic fix and I’m unsure if the author of Cotton is even interested in supporting that on their abandoned project.</p>
<p>Will this game ever come out? I hope so, but it’s emotionally hard to pick up after fighting with it so much. If I buckled down, built some assets, and wrote more NPC dialog I bet I could finish it in a couple human weeks of work. Perhaps I could outsource the asset creation.</p>
<h2>How the sausage gets made</h2>
<p>I make my games after the kids and spouse go to bed or while the TV runs mindlessly. In some ways I’m borrowing from my own mental health staying up late tinkering with little apps that I’m going to give away for free. But these ideas all occupy brain RAM, so it feels good to chip away at ideas and get them out the door, to make room for more ideas, to chip away at ideas, to get them out the door… it’s a vicious cycle, but I think a net positive for my mental health.</p>
<p>To hedge against wasting my spare time, I get prototypes out for review as soon as possible to gauge interest and invest accordingly. Shopping prototypes curbs emotional over-investment in an idea. Time builds attachment to bad ideas, making them seem good and grander in your head than reality. If you build in secret too long, it ends in disappointment when the public doesn’t understand your genius you spent all your time on.</p>
<p>I default to web tech because it’s what I know best and staying in your wheelhouse means you can move faster with less mystery roadblocks (like the LDtk map issue above). But I’d like <em>NOT WORK</em> to not feel like work and see value in that, so this may change going forward.</p>
<p>At times I create artificial limitations (e.g., limit myself to a single asset pack) because if the scope is overly broad and infinite, that guarantees failure. Having rules, even if arbitrary, allows for play.</p>
<p>The last tool in the toolbelt is scoping the hell out of my ideas. When attention is your biggest limitation (e.g. ADHD) then keeping checkpoints small and achievable are critical. Then once you have the foundations established, do as much as time and ambition allow.</p>
<h2>Unsure of what’s next… or how to book all of your free time from now until death with no promise of financial gain.</h2>
<p>I have dozens of ideas kicking around in my head at all times, so my main issue is prioritization. Here’s the ideas that occupy a lot of brain RAM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finishing <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/03/gamedev-journal-1/">my son’s Zelda-like</a></li>
<li>An ambitious battle royale that would take a hundred developers a hundred years to finish</li>
<li>A platformer with a slime mechanic</li>
<li>A local multiplayer game that has a Mario Kart vibe, but isn’t a karting game.</li>
<li>A Solid Snake stealth game but for escaping awkward social situations</li>
<li>A horror game parody</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01B4BqWxtKo">Tim McGraw’s What-if? Trucks: Fates</a></li>
<li>A space shooter / medical sim</li>
<li>A Contra-like with a dumb twist</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a sampling of what’s going on up in the ol’ electric meatball. Not to be too macabre, but I’m not sure I have the lifespan left to get through even half of that short list. Hopefully there’s a banger billion dollar idea in there that allows me to retire and work on all the non-profitable dumb ideas.</p>
<p>While doing this for a living is far off and/or will never happen I am at least pleased that I lived up to the promise to myself to make games if I had spare time. I made games, smaller in scope than what I had originally imagined, but I’m comfortable with that given the timelines. No regrets there.</p>
<p>Risky as it may be, I may jump to a 3D engine because I’ve had a lot of fun building in environments like Unity in the past. That balloons the scope and raises the level of difficulty beyond my current expertise and it has never worked in the past… but perhaps this time it’ll be different! 😂</p>

## 2024-12-26 Rot Economy

date: 2024-12-25, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-12-26-rot-economy">2024-12-26 Rot Economy</h1>

<p>This essay is so good. You probably have seen it linked a few times on social media. I certainly have. And yet, perhaps you have not. If you have not, it’s a great read tying together our terrible computer experiences, us being exploited by big tech, enshittification and rot economy. The growth mindset that kills us all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Holding these people to a higher standard at scale is what brings about change. Be the wrench in the machine. Be the person that explains to a friend why Facebook sucks now, and who chose to make it suck. Be the person to explain who Prabhakar Raghavan is and what his role was in making Google Search worse. Be the person who tells people that Sam Altman burns $5 billion a year on unsustainable software that destroys the environment and is built upon the large-scale larceny of creative works because he&rsquo;s desperate for power. – <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/">Never Forgive Them</a>, by Edward Zitron</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now there is a mission statement for bloggers and people on social media.</p>

<p>It also confirms my peculiar service offerings like Emacs Wiki or Campaign Wiki. They are free for users. They are simpler and they don’t change much. There are no ads and there is no “growth” to be had. In fact, if more people set up similar sites that are similar in these respects, it’ll be better for us. We’ll be more resilient, more adapted to our local needs, it’ll be more like community tools for all of us instead of slop for us and billions for them. This is where I want to go.</p>

## As an avid Reddit user, I’ve learned…

date: 2024-12-25, from: Om Malik blog

As an avid Reddit user, I’ve learned to approach everything I read with skepticism, echoing Jerry Seinfeld’s catchphrase, “Really?” This morning, I encountered an unsourced post about Boox, a tablet and e-reader, which I viewed with a critical eye. According to the post, an upgrade to the Boox tablet’s operating system, which is based on &#8230;

I want to create rules in some kind of macro language that it will never violate. I find it has huge problems with memory, it says it's remembering something, but has forgotten it 24 hours later. This is like the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/?gift=f35zZN0v_gDFE8xNwlQAHSNkdwehtNpsP-bh1d4EoU4&utm_source=copy-link&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share">Fail Whale</a> in the early days of Twitter. Cute, because the system is doing something so new, futuristic and useful, but after a while it's not cute because we're using the system for real work. The web is programmable, our operating systems are, of course the AI-o-verse will be programmable too. We are able to create entirely new development environments, these platforms deserve a fresh new look at <i>everything.</i> I'd also like to note that at the same time, the platforms are breaking through in web user interfaces. Remarkable progress. Far beyond what we were doing in the very stagnant Web 2.0 world. They're still stuck on whether or not our writing can have titles. So bizarre to exist in a world that is deliberately hobbled, and another with infinite horizons. Anyway this is what I'm thinking about just before hunkering down with my Knicks and popcorn, a Christmas tradition for many many years. Ho ho ho.

<p>The stories of the atrocities committed by the Israelis in Gaza are so horrifying they make me want to puke.
I can&rsquo;t read this shit.</p>

<p>How will they ever dig themselves out of this again? Will they say that they didn&rsquo;t know?</p>

<p>And what happens when these soldiers come back home?
Will their deeds be forgotten or will these demons rear their ugly head in years to come?
How will they treat their partners, their children, their neighbours if they have already shown this level of violence against fellow humans?</p>

I have a fairly large and old <a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier">C application</a> that was written to run on the Mac and Windows. I still use it today on a relatively modern Macintosh. I wonder if it will soon be possible to turn this project over to an AI like ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity or some other, to convert it to run on Linux, where it should be able to run in perpetuity, or at least a lot longer than on the Macintosh. I would be willing to pay a few thousand dollars to do this work.

Another idea that we continued to push in 2024 is <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. It was what I needed to build <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, it defines its objective, to form an open social web with all the basic features writers need. Titles, links, simple styling, ability to edit, no character limit, these are basic features we will drive the adoption of. Defining a new network where if you want to play you'll need to start thinking about writers, their power, and interop. You can't be on the open web and be a silo. And some of the most insidious silo-like features seem innocuous, like character limits. Whatever forces you into copying and pasting into <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text boxes</a>, that's how you know you're in a silo. If you can use any writing tool to post to a network, then it <i>is</i> on the web. Pretty simple. Right now -- <i>none</i> of the popular ones qualify. None.

All it will take is one popular podcast client to get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump#Priming_a_pump">pump primed</a>. The second and third apps should be much easier to convince. This is how it worked with podcasting. Steady mission broadcasting, keep beating the drum, and if it's the right idea and when it's the right time, eventually, it happens. It will be that way too for this layer of the network, but at this time I don't own a podcast client, and that's the most basic ingredient in this bootstrap, so we wait, and keep beating the drum.

## CSS wants to be a system

date: 2024-12-23, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I’ve realized something obvious again, this time about CSS; that CSS wants to be a system. At the core of CSS is a series of cascading rules and classes marrying and mingling in an elegant symphony of style application. Dozens and dozens of declarative instructions for painting pixels on the screen come together in under a millisecond. Sometimes it creates magic, other times it creates memes.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/cssisawesome.png" alt="CSS is aweso-me" height="436" width="600" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">
<p>At its core, CSS wants to be a system and – besides its quirky selector power ranking algorithm – it doesn’t come with one out of the box. CSS wants you to build a system with it. It wants styles to build up, not flatten down. It even has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer">layers</a> as a feature! You can start small with a <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/">minimalist reset</a> or satisfy your inner typenerd with a <a href="https://clagnut.com/blog/2433">typographic default</a> and build up from there. You can make your own reset. You can establish your own naming convention. You can decide to nest or not. You can use IDs. You can use only-classes. You can even dip a toe into the Shadow DOM if you crave the dark arts. Hell, I encourage you to use <code>!important</code> just to feel something.</p>
<p>Not everyone wants to conduct that symphony and I understand that. A nice thing about that CSS is that it’s sharable! Plenty of pre-built systems exist to let you offload that skill. Through the magic of copy-and-paste, you too can have high quality design! But don’t mistake a shortcut as the only valid option. We as humans and technologists like to compare objects and declare winners – to be kingmakers! – but it’s a mistake to shop at only one store and only eat meatballs despite the ubiquitous appeal of Scandinavian design.</p>
<p>CSS wants to be a system and it’s not an impossible task to make your own. Will there be mistakes and bad assumptions? Yeah. Will there be a <code>junk.css</code> file? Probably. Will you commit CSS crimes? Indubitably. Is CSS just thousands of key-value pairs with random collisions implemented in an uneven distribution among a handful of different browsers? It sure is, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<p>In all my years of programming I have never loved a language more than CSS. There’s no other programming language that sparks my brain and lights up my imagination like CSS. Even after thirty years, there’s a rush of adrenaline when I see a complex design and I wonder “How am I going to make that happen?” which leads me to “And how am I going to make that happen on a phone and older browsers?” That’s the fun part of the job. And it’s good to know that there are other people out there who are great at CSS, people who can build up and tear down these systems with ease, people I can siphon knowledge from and build up my own skills when a new challenge arises.</p>
<p>So cheers to the CSS folks, the tinkerers. Your obsessive animations, pixel pushing, and system building – both delicate and strong – are fun to see and experience.</p>

In recent times a meme has been making the rounds that allegedly shows a smart way to solve interview puzzles. In these memes developers are asked to create an ASCII pattern like the following: XXXXXXX XX&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;XX X&#8195;X&#8195;X&#8195;X X&#8195;&#8195;X&#8195;&#8195;X X&#8195;X&#8195;X&#8195;X XX&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;XX XXXXXXX The solution they come up with is a simple console.log() or print command. console.log(`XXXXXXX [&#8230;]

Agree on what the Dems are, and just as important, are not. End arguments about whether the Dems are this color or that, this gender or that, this age or some other. Draw a circle of common interest and leave out everything else. Draw the biggest circle possible.

I wrote this <a href="https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113696639328781503">piece</a> in <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a> yesterday morning over breakfast. Started writing it as a Bluesky post, quickly ran out of space so I switched over to my own <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/13/214755.html?title=itsBiggerThanATinyLittleTextbox">TLTB</a>, and it's very conducive to writing flow, which is its purpose. Then I did the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@daveverse.wordpress.com@daveverse.wordpress.com/113702535391268074">same thing</a> this morning. Sorry to keep talking about the product without it being in general release yet. I want to get it right before opening it up. Still a bunch of things I want to <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/12/20.html#a230758">add/fix</a>.

BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end while a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef">coral reef</a> has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from. Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in the 60s,. You would have missed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles">all that followed</a>. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the 2020s. That story is far from over.

A system as capable as Twitter. It has to be privately held by a group that can be trusted not to interfere with democratic use of the system. This can't be guaranteed, it has to be based on trust. It needs to scale very quickly. Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and quickly understood as parallel to Twitter. Bluesky has a lot of what's needed, but its ownership is not clear. But it more like Twitter than Twitter is today and I expect that to continue.

## Musings on Media in the Age of AI

date: 2024-12-22, from: Om Malik blog

I recently wrote about the future of the&#160;browser and&#160;Surf, a new app from the creators of Flipboard. Both stories&#160;explore&#160;the changing nature of the&#160;web&#160;and its impact on the media landscape. I’m not shy about expressing my frustrations with the establishment media and the ever-present gulf between technology and&#160;old&#160;media&#160;companies. I’ve&#160;been involved with the&#160;internet&#160;and online publishing from the &#8230;

<p>Godot on iPhone, I forgot to disable it from the TestFlight and it sort of runs.</p><p>My opinion was that we should block it, but people love it.   And in the last 12 hours I can’t stop thinking of some easy wins to make it at least passable.</p><p>But perhaps the right thing is still to prevent from running on iPhone or be destroyed by unhappy users reviews</p>
