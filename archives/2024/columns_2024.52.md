## 2024-12-24 Israel

date: 2024-12-24, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-12-24-israel">2024-12-24 Israel</h1>

<p>The stories of the atrocities committed by the Israelis in Gaza are so horrifying they make me want to puke.
I can&rsquo;t read this shit.</p>

<p>How will they ever dig themselves out of this again? Will they say that they didn&rsquo;t know?</p>

<p>And what happens when these soldiers come back home?
Will their deeds be forgotten or will these demons rear their ugly head in years to come?
How will they treat their partners, their children, their neighbours if they have already shown this level of violence against fellow humans?</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-24, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I have a fairly large and old <a href="https://github.com/scripting/frontier">C application</a> that was written to run on the Mac and Windows. I still use it today on a relatively modern Macintosh. I wonder if it will soon be possible to turn this project over to an AI like ChatGPT, Claude or Perplexity or some other, to convert it to run on Linux, where it should be able to run in perpetuity, or at least a lot longer than on the Macintosh. I would be willing to pay a few thousand dollars to do this work.

How this stuff fits in? 1. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> blew a big open hole in the distribution of news and ideas. 2. Now we want to blow the equivalent hole in the <i>writer's</i> web. Put the two together and we will have finally, after 30+ years, delivered on the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/03/02/theTwowayweb.html">promise</a> of the web.

Another idea that we continued to push in 2024 is <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. It was what I needed to build <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, it defines its objective, to form an open social web with all the basic features writers need. Titles, links, simple styling, ability to edit, no character limit, these are basic features we will drive the adoption of. Defining a new network where if you want to play you'll need to start thinking about writers, their power, and interop. You can't be on the open web and be a silo. And some of the most insidious silo-like features seem innocuous, like character limits. Whatever forces you into copying and pasting into <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text boxes</a>, that's how you know you're in a silo. If you can use any writing tool to post to a network, then it <i>is</i> on the web. Pretty simple. Right now -- <i>none</i> of the popular ones qualify. None.

Really low tech, like the web. And not possible for one company to control. All it will take is one popular podcast client to get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump#Priming_a_pump">pump primed</a>. The second and third apps should be much easier to convince. This is how it worked with podcasting. Steady mission broadcasting, keep beating the drum, and if it's the right idea and when it's the right time, eventually, it happens. It will be that way too for this layer of the network, but at this time I don't own a podcast client, and that's the most basic ingredient in this bootstrap, so we wait, and keep beating the drum.

## December (with no) computing

date: 2024-12-24, from: Jirka's blog

December at  work was a  bit busy. A much  more travelling than  I have been used to and  also other things. So I had  little time for anything else.  Even my  cycling (I  normally commute  daily on  a bicycle)  was somewhat limited. Also I had some flu in November and as a result I was cautious when it came to outdoor and social activities.

## CSS wants to be a system

date: 2024-12-23, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I’ve realized something obvious again, this time about CSS; that CSS wants to be a system. At the core of CSS is a series of cascading rules and classes marrying and mingling in an elegant symphony of style application. Dozens and dozens of declarative instructions for painting pixels on the screen come together in under a millisecond. Sometimes it creates magic, other times it creates memes.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/cssisawesome.png" alt="CSS is aweso-me" height="436" width="600" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;">
<p>At its core, CSS wants to be a system and – besides its quirky selector power ranking algorithm – it doesn’t come with one out of the box. CSS wants you to build a system with it. It wants styles to build up, not flatten down. It even has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer">layers</a> as a feature! You can start small with a <a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/">minimalist reset</a> or satisfy your inner typenerd with a <a href="https://clagnut.com/blog/2433">typographic default</a> and build up from there. You can make your own reset. You can establish your own naming convention. You can decide to nest or not. You can use IDs. You can use only-classes. You can even dip a toe into the Shadow DOM if you crave the dark arts. Hell, I encourage you to use <code>!important</code> just to feel something.</p>
<p>Not everyone wants to conduct that symphony and I understand that. A nice thing about that CSS is that it’s sharable! Plenty of pre-built systems exist to let you offload that skill. Through the magic of copy-and-paste, you too can have high quality design! But don’t mistake a shortcut as the only valid option. We as humans and technologists like to compare objects and declare winners – to be kingmakers! – but it’s a mistake to shop at only one store and only eat meatballs despite the ubiquitous appeal of Scandinavian design.</p>
<p>CSS wants to be a system and it’s not an impossible task to make your own. Will there be mistakes and bad assumptions? Yeah. Will there be a <code>junk.css</code> file? Probably. Will you commit CSS crimes? Indubitably. Is CSS just thousands of key-value pairs with random collisions implemented in an uneven distribution among a handful of different browsers? It sure is, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<p>In all my years of programming I have never loved a language more than CSS. There’s no other programming language that sparks my brain and lights up my imagination like CSS. Even after thirty years, there’s a rush of adrenaline when I see a complex design and I wonder “How am I going to make that happen?” which leads me to “And how am I going to make that happen on a phone and older browsers?” That’s the fun part of the job. And it’s good to know that there are other people out there who are great at CSS, people who can build up and tear down these systems with ease, people I can siphon knowledge from and build up my own skills when a new challenge arises.</p>
<p>So cheers to the CSS folks, the tinkerers. Your obsessive animations, pixel pushing, and system building – both delicate and strong – are fun to see and experience.</p>

## Stupid interview questions will get you limited developers – is that what the market wants?

In recent times a meme has been making the rounds that allegedly shows a smart way to solve interview puzzles.

BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end while a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef">coral reef</a> has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from. Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in the 60s,. You would have missed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles">all that followed</a>. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the 2020s. That story is far from over.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/06/17/charlieTheTuna.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">What we need, now, is a system to compete with Twitter. A system as capable as Twitter. It has to be privately held by a group that can be trusted not to interfere with democratic use of the system. This can't be guaranteed, it has to be based on trust. It needs to scale very quickly. Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and quickly understood as parallel to Twitter. Bluesky has a lot of what's needed, but its ownership is not clear. But it more like Twitter than Twitter is today and I expect that to continue.

## Musings on Media in the Age of AI

date: 2024-12-22, from: Om Malik blog

I recently wrote about the future of the&#160;browser and&#160;Surf, a new app from the creators of Flipboard. Both stories&#160;explore&#160;the changing nature of the&#160;web&#160;and its impact on the media landscape. I’m not shy about expressing my frustrations with the establishment media and the ever-present gulf between technology and&#160;old&#160;media&#160;companies. I’ve&#160;been involved with the&#160;internet&#160;and online publishing from the &#8230;

<p>Godot on iPhone, I forgot to disable it from the TestFlight and it sort of runs.</p><p>My opinion was that we should block it, but people love it.   And in the last 12 hours I can’t stop thinking of some easy wins to make it at least passable.</p><p>But perhaps the right thing is still to prevent from running on iPhone or be destroyed by unhappy users reviews</p>
