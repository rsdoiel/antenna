**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-12-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW Twitter is innovating in ways that it never has. People not staying on Twitter would have no way of knowing. Another reason why, for software developers, quitting Twitter is stupid. As quitting Facebook was ten years ago. Great, now you have no idea what features your users are learning how to use. Eventually your software will be in a dead end while a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef">coral reef</a> has been forming. Where are you going to get fresh ideas from. Not using these systems would be like not listening to the Beatles in the 60s,. You would have missed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Beatles">all that followed</a>. And not just popular music. Same with Twitter in the 2020s. That story is far from over.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/06/17/charlieTheTuna.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">What we need, now, is a system to compete with Twitter. A system as capable as Twitter. It has to be privately held by a group that can be trusted not to interfere with democratic use of the system. This can't be guaranteed, it has to be based on trust. It needs to scale very quickly. Its vision is to represent democracy. And it has to be simple, clean and quickly understood as parallel to Twitter. Bluesky has a lot of what's needed, but its ownership is not clear. But it more like Twitter than Twitter is today and I expect that to continue.

## Musings on Media in the Age of AI

date: 2024-12-22, from: Om Malik blog

I recently wrote about the future of the&#160;browser and&#160;Surf, a new app from the creators of Flipboard. Both stories&#160;explore&#160;the changing nature of the&#160;web&#160;and its impact on the media landscape. I’m not shy about expressing my frustrations with the establishment media and the ever-present gulf between technology and&#160;old&#160;media&#160;companies. I’ve&#160;been involved with the&#160;internet&#160;and online publishing from the &#8230;

<p>Godot on iPhone, I forgot to disable it from the TestFlight and it sort of runs.</p><p>My opinion was that we should block it, but people love it.   And in the last 12 hours I can’t stop thinking of some easy wins to make it at least passable.</p><p>But perhaps the right thing is still to prevent from running on iPhone or be destroyed by unhappy users reviews</p>
