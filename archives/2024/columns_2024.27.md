## Dear journalism

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Dear journalism:</p>
<p>You know how Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Ave and wouldn't lose any supporters. This is the same thing except with Biden.</p>
<ol>
<li>We all knew this would happen.</li>
<li>We all saw it happen, we don't need you to tell us.</li>
<li>We're going with him anyway.That's all you need to know.Now go cover the Supreme Court, that's an even bigger story.</li>
</ol>
<p>The plan is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Biden gets disabled, or dies, before or after the election -- VP Harris steps up.</li>
<li>Now everyone can relax.</li>
</ol>
<p>BTW, am I imagining it or has journalism inadvertently admitted that they all want Trump to lose? It's logical that they would, but I thought they always said they were objective on this stuff. The famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_from_Nowhere">View From Nowhere</a>. Has that pretense accidentally been dropped?</p>

## Democratic superstars of 2024

date: 2024-07-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>On Mastodon, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sarajw@front-end.social/112746718207413752">Sara Joy writes</a>: "Let Biden run. Let Kamala and lots of other younger Dems take on lots of events. Support him from underneath. If and when he falters, the party is there to prop him up, take up the slack, or step in."</p>
<p>I had a similar idea.</p>
<p>Make this the campaign of the cabinet, governors and congress.</p>
<p>Let all the great next generation democrats shine. </p>
<p>Big stadium events where a lot of them share the stage.</p>
<p>Joe Biden dials in via satellite.</p>
<p>"Listen, I'm an old dude, so I need my rest but look at all these bright young people who help me do the business of the American people. Aren't they wonderful!"</p>
<p>He puts on his robe, sits in a rocking chair with a dog at his feet and his grandchildren playing checkers...</p>
<p>And one of the juniors is hanging out with him, making sure he doesn't spill his beer, so you know they have his back.</p>
<p>Baseball cards are handed out at the events with each of the stars of the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Collect them all!</p>
<p>You get 5 free cards with a $25 contribution.</p>
<p>Some would be very rare.</p>
<p>Also there would be Old Timers Day, where Bernie, Hillary, Barack, Michelle and Bill would have a concert. </p>
<p>Hosted by Mayor Pete!</p>
<p>Joe is at the top of the ticket, but we got him covered.</p>
<p>Out comes VP Kamala and she sings the anthem along with Taylor Swift wearing a red white and blue sequined outfit. </p>
<p>And Santa Claus, Uncle Sam, Betsy Ross, and the Founding Fathers. </p>
<p>Fredrick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and the freedom fighters. </p>
<p>All the heroes of America, standing up for America. </p>
<p>The Greatest Generation and Repubs like Ike, even Reagan and of course Lynne Cheney.</p>
<p>We don't need no freaking monarch, they all sing.</p>
<p>On the tape, the Dead sing "I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am, been hiding out, in a rock and roll band!"</p>
<p>No we don't! shouts the people. </p>
<p>We all march together to victory.</p>

## Hot take: social platforms should disallow special character growth hacking

date: 2024-07-07, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

Over the last few years something magical has happened without much fanfare: social media platforms and operating systems automatically translate text content for us. Having spent a lot of time traveling around conferences, I amassed a lot of people I follow who do not speak or write like me. And whilst it was fun following [&#8230;]

I'm glad Biden is attacking journalists, he has a much bigger voice than I do. If I had his influence I'd be saying the same things, though I wouldn't be as kind. It's time to put the journalists back where they belong, covering news, not trying to run the country.

## A Presidential Address for This Moment

date: 2024-07-07, from: James Fallows, Substack

&#8216;We&#8217;ll teach them how to say goodbye.&#8217; A dramatic way for Joe Biden to demonstrate his strength, and the nation&#8217;s. An imagined speech, with 120 days to go until the election.

## Miscellany ‚Ññ 102: books!

date: 2024-07-07, from: Shady Characters blog

<p>In the second of this mini-series of post-deadline catch-ups (<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2024/06/miscellany-101/">the first dealt with punctuation</a>), I‚Äôve collected some links on the subject of books.</p>
<hr>
<p>First is a recent exhibition at Harvard‚Äôs Houghton Library, called ‚Äú<a href="https://library.harvard.edu/exhibits/marks-books">Marks in Books</a>‚Äù, that has, sadly, run its course. But <a href="https://glammr.us/@overholt/111777818440458959">John Overholt</a>, a curator of early books and manuscripts at Houghton, writes to say that the exhibit was adapted from a 1984 exhibition on the same subject and that <a href="https://nrs.lib.harvard.edu/urn-3:fhcl.hough:40935393">the catalogue of that earlier incarnation</a> is available online.</p><a class="more-link" href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2024/07/miscellany-102-books/">Read more ‚Üí</a>

<p>We were looking after this little guy (the dog, Patches) for the weekend. He and Gidget got along so well! Very happy to sleep in close proximity and be chill. I think Gidget is happy to be the only pet again after Viv returned him home, though üòÇ</p>

Happy July 4 weekend, from my home to yours. Going to sleep for a week. (A nice thought, but actually will be back at it tomorrow.)
