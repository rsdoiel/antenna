Basically clickbait, although nonplussed is also used to mean its opposite (but that battle was lost a hundred years ago). https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/nonplussed

If anyone heading through Heathrow Terminal 3 needs a signed book, I signed everything I could find (two Good Omens, a Trigger Warning, a Norse Mythology and two Coralines) in the Bookshop.

## Paul Di Filippo Reviews Robert J. Sawyer’s The Downloaded

date: 2024-05-19, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Downloaded</strong>, Robert J. Sawyer (Shadowpaw Press 978-1989398999, trade paperback, 199pp, $14.95) May 2024</p>
<p>It’s a testament to Robert Sawyer’s skill—and his generational wisdom—that he has created, with his latest book, a novel that is at once exuberantly old-school and utterly au courant. It reads like Greg Egan rebooting Neil R. Jones’s <b>Professor Jameson</b> cycle. This book exemplifies the “best of both worlds” approach that charts a viable future  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/05/paul-di-filippo-reviews-robert-j-sawyers-the-downloaded/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p><strong>Song of the Huntress, </strong>Lucy Holland (Redhook 978-0316321655, $19.99, 448pp, tp) March 2024.</p>
<p>I’ve read a lot of Greek and Roman mythology retell­ings recently, so it’s nice to see Celtic/ British mythol­ogy getting some love too. In <strong>Song of the Huntress</strong>, Lucy Holland (<strong>Sistersong</strong>, 2021) brings the Wild Hunt to Cornwall and Wessex in the mid-700s. This is some centuries after the Roman conquest and departure; Saxons  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2024/05/alexandra-pierce-reviews-song-of-the-huntress-by-lucy-holland/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
