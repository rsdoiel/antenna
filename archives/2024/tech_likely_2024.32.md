The <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C-Xr_dcp8Vn">Bruce Springsteen</a> mention at last night's rally was no accident. Boomers are now of the age where we vote in great numbers.

Last night's Democratic rally was wonderful. I was laughing and sobbing all the way through it. What an emotional release. We needed and deserved this. Beyond hope, we're finally going to fight. I hope President Kamala is really up to it, because we have a pretty substantial cleanup job to do here.

## Developing a cryptographically secure bootloader for RISC-V in Rust

date: 2024-08-07, from: OS News

It seems to be bootloader season, because we&#8217;ve got another one &#8211; this time, a research project with very limited application for most people. SentinelBoot is a cryptographically secure bootloader aimed at enhancing boot flow safety of RISC-V through memory-safe principles, predominantly leveraging the Rust programming language with its ownership, borrowing, and lifetime constraints. Additionally, SentinelBoot employs public-key cryptography to verify the integrity of a booted kernel (digital signature), by the use of the RISC-V Vector Cryptography extension, establishing secure boot functionality. SentinelBoot achieves these objectives with a 20.1% hashing overhead (approximately 0.27s additional runtime) when compared to an example U-Boot binary (mainline at time of development), and produces a resulting binary one-tenth the size of an example U-Boot binary with half the memory footprint. ↫ Lawrence Hunter SentinelBoot is a project undertaken at the University of Manchester, and its goal is probably clear from the description: to develop a more secure bootloader for RISC V devices. An additional element is that they looked specifically at devices that receive updates over-the-air, like smartphones. In addition, scenarios where an attacker has physical access to the device in question were not considered, for obvious reasons &#8211; in such cases, the attacker can just replace the bootloader altogether anyway, and no amount of fancy Rust code is going to save you there. The details of the implementation as described in the article are definitely a little bit over my head, but the gist seems to be that the project&#8217;s been able to achieve a much more secure boot process without giving up much in performance. This being a research project with an intentionally limited scope does mean it&#8217;s most just something that&#8217;ll immediately benefit all of us, but it&#8217;s these kinds of projects that can really push the state of the art and try out the viability of new ideas.

A few years ago I published an essay called “Miss Marple and the Problem of Modern Identity,” in which I described the rise of certain technologies by which people have become “legible” to the state.

## 2024-08-06 Pocket Reform

date: 2024-08-07, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-06-pocket-reform">2024-08-06 Pocket Reform</h1>

<p>I got my <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform">MNT Pocket Reform</a> miniature laptop!
I&rsquo;m hoping that this will be my new travel laptop as the Purism laptop I got <a href="2017-12-23_New_Laptop">back in 2017</a> has a <a href="2021-08-26_New_laptop%2C_again%E2%80%BD">broken hinge</a>. The two halves are attached to each other using two super strong hinges. The hinges are so strong, in fact, that one of them ripped its screws out of the plastic. So now the screen is held up by just one super strong hinge and don&rsquo;t really want to open or close it all that often for fear of breaking it.</p>

<p>Here are my initial impressions of the new MNT Pocket Reform.</p>

<p>It is small, but chunky. It&rsquo;s definitely not flat. It also isn&rsquo;t heavy, so I&rsquo;m happy.
The small keyboard and the small trackball work.</p>

<p>I was unable to power it on for the longest time.
I had two problems.</p>

<p>First, there&rsquo;s a small standby power switch on the left hand side that you need to turn on.
The manual suggests &ldquo;using a pointed object such as a SIM card ejector.&rdquo;
Which I managed to find. And then what do you do?
You use the SIM card ejector like you always do: stab it into the small hole.
So I did that for a bit, wondering at the empty spaces I was a able to reach.
What was I supposed to press?
It was only when I started to really look into the small hole that I realized: there was actually something to be moved left and right within it!</p>

<p>Second, the manual says that to turn it on, &ldquo;hold <em>Hyper</em> + <em>Enter</em> for more than 2 seconds.&rdquo;
I pressed those two keys and the OLED display lit up. There was the menu! There it said &ldquo;Power On&rdquo;. I picked it.
Nothing happened. Then the OLED display showed a tiny &ldquo;T&rdquo; in the upper left corner.
I did this again and again, exploring the small menu.
The laptop wouldn&rsquo;t power on no matter how often I selected the menu.
That&rsquo;s because I didn&rsquo;t press <em>Hyper</em> + <em>Enter</em> for <em>more than 2 seconds</em>!
Press those keys until the keyboard lights up with the pink backlights.</p>

<p>I setup my root passwords, created my user account, ran <code>sudo apt update</code> and <code>sudo apt upgrade</code> and looked around at things.
After a few minutes I noticed that there is no indication of the batteries charging.
That made me nervous for a while as I kept seeing that &ldquo;1%&rdquo; charge in the top right corner.
It&rsquo;s probably charging, I thought.
Then the laptop turned off. Oh!
I guess it wasn&rsquo;t charging after all.
What did I miss?
Now that it is powered off, I see that the load percentage starts climbing again.</p>

<p>This is what it says right now:</p>

<pre><code>🔋 3.6                8%
🔋 3.7               Off
                  -1.07A
                  7.57V
</code></pre>

<p>Why is the second battery off?
The manual doesn&rsquo;t explain what On/Off on the second line means.
It&rsquo;s an indication of whether the computer is on or off!
For the longest time I thought that the first battery had some charge and the second battery was &ldquo;off&rdquo;.
Once I rebooted, it changed to &ldquo;On&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In any case, it seems that my problem is that when the laptop powers on without being connected to a charger, it won&rsquo;t charge if you do connect it.
Perhaps a new system image would fix it?
I&rsquo;m not sure. I downloaded an image, unzipped it, wrote it to a microSD card, and maybe booted from it, but nothing seemed to have changed.
I had to provide a root password and a first username and another password… and that&rsquo;s it.
Was I supposed to run a command? I don&rsquo;t know.
Did the <code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade</code> fix the problem? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Anyway, when the laptop suddenly lost power (see above) I waited for it to recharge for a bit and rebooted.
It looked like this had corrupted the disk, somehow.
There are plenty of recovery messages and percentages ending with an error because something cannot be written to the read-only file system.</p>

<p>The output ends with the following, in an extremely tiny font:</p>

<pre><code>...
mount: mounting /dev/mmcblk2p2 on /root failed: Structure needs cleaning
Failed to mount /dev/mmcblk2p2 as root file system
</code></pre>

<p>And now I am dropped in the <code>initramfs</code>.
I try figure what I&rsquo;m supposed to do.
I search for some keywords online but don&rsquo;t understand what I&rsquo;m seeing.
Finally, I try to leave with <code>exit</code>, Ctrl+D and whatever else I can think off.
I reboot. This time there are fewer messages about the filesystem and then I&rsquo;m
back at the login prompt.
It fixed itself.</p>

<p>Phew!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m back.</p>

<p>My take-away is this: usability and user interface issues both large and small remain a challenge in computers.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gadgets">#Gadgets</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Laptop">#Laptop</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Reform">#Reform</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-07</strong>. Before the login prompt is shown, there is a long and helpful
introduction that flashes by. At the login prompt, you can specify a different
command to run instead of starting the window manager. I did that, specifying
<code>/usr/bin/fish</code> (I have installed <code>fish</code> and prefer it over the default shell,
<code>bash</code>). This allows you to read the message. I guess it&rsquo;s the
<code>/etc/reform-help</code> message.</p>

<p>Specifically, I learned about all the commands starting with <code>reform-</code>. Nice!
In the manual these tools are mentioned on page 50.</p>

<p>When I run <code>sudo reform-check</code>, it tells me that &ldquo;eMMC does not contain the latest
uboot&rdquo; and that I can run <code>reform-flash-uboot emmc</code> to fix it. Do I dare?
The following two messages are shown and they are not identical. That&rsquo;s a bit strange.</p>

<pre><code>W: /boot/flash.bin is not the latest uboot
W: You can update it to the latest version by running as root:
reform-flash-uboot
W: eMMC does not contain latest uboot
W: You can update it to the latest version by running as root:
reform-flash-uboot emmc
</code></pre>

<p>I guess I&rsquo;ll run the first command and then <code>reform-check</code> again.</p>

<p>In the meantime I saw that I don&rsquo;t have the <code>pocket-reform-handbook</code> installed
but that I do have the <code>reform-handbook</code>. Heh. (The MNT Reform is the bigger
laptop.)</p>

<p>Anyway, when I run <code>reform-flash-uboot</code> without arguments, I get an error.</p>

<pre><code>/usr/sbin/reform-flash-uboot: 59: MMC_BOOT: parameter not set
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot decide whether this is a typo or not. It looks like one?</p>

<pre><code>alex@subterraneobombus ~&gt; sudo nl /usr/sbin/reform-flash-uboot|grep MMC_BOOT
    27	if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = false ]; then
    49		if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = true ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$SD_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    53		elif [ &quot;$MMC_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    60		if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = true ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$SD_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    71		elif [ &quot;$MMC_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
alex@subterraneobombus ~&gt; grep MMC_BOOT &quot;/usr/share/reform-tools/machines/MNT Pocket Reform with
 i.MX8MP Module.conf&quot;
EMMC_BOOT=true
</code></pre>

<p>Do I really want to do this? Luckily, I mentioned this issue on IRC, and <a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@josch" title="@josch@floss.social">@josch</a> pointed me to this post by <a class="account" href="https://macaw.social/@andypiper" title="@andypiper@macaw.social">@andypiper</a>: <a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/updating-uboot/2348">Updating uboot?</a>. This is the important bit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do <em>not</em> flash u-boot to emmc on the pocket reform.
There is a bug in the u-boot offset which will make your pocket unbootable if you fix the other bug in reform-flash-uboot. – josch on IRC</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oof! Disaster narrowly avoided. And now I understand what Andy Piper means when he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also managed to temporarily brick the machine by corrupting the uboot in flash, and needed to rig it up with Dupont wires on headers and access the machine from another via USB to get back to where I wanted to be. – <a href="https://andypiper.co.uk/2024/08/06/mnt-pocket-reform-first-impressions/">MNT Pocket Reform: first impressions</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Andy&rsquo;s post had a screenshot showing the fediverse client <a href="https://tuba.geopjr.dev/">Tuba</a> which is available on Debian testing. Nice! I&rsquo;ll give it a try.</p>

<p>Tuba requires a &ldquo;login&rdquo; keyring so I had to install <code>seahorse</code> also known as &ldquo;Passwords and Keys&rdquo;.</p>

date: 2024-08-06, from: NASA breaking news

Warming global climate is changing the vegetation structure of forests in the far north. It’s a trend that will continue at least through the end of this century, according to NASA researchers. The change in forest structure could absorb more of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, or increase permafrost thawing, resulting [&#8230;]

## Roadmap for the campaign

date: 2024-08-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A roadmap for the campaign is coming into view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Harris has her knee on Trump's neck, and she won't let up. </li>
<li>There won't be time for anyone to get tired of her. </li>
<li>Their rallies are going to be the best in a very long time. They're executing perfectly. </li>
<li>Trump is a comedian, a cross between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rickles">Don Rickles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rivers">Joan Rivers</a> with a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kinison">Sam Kinison</a>. He had a good schtick for a long run if you find fascist slapstick entertaining, as millions of Americans do or did. </li>
<li>Last night Maddow tried to get us excited about how the Repubs have planted people on voting boards in swing states with the purpose of stopping the counts, and thus preventing a vote in the Electoral College. But they're doing it too late. The administrators will feel the tide turning too. </li>
<li>This campaign will take place in the popular culture of 2024, which thankfully is not centered on cable news or the NYT. But Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are in control. In my <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">2017 piece</a> I thought Zuck would run for president, given his new style <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/06/zucksNewStyle.png">makeover</a> I wouldn't discount that, but these two will certainly have  influence over how the election goes. Both Facebook and Twitter have algorithms that are opaque and controlled by them. Same deal as with the owners of cable media. </li>
<li>Trump stoked resentment with voters for being left behind, even if individually they were doing fine. But that was eight years ago and a lot has happened. Harris saying basically "there you go again" is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN7gDRjTNf4&t=46s">echo of Reagan</a>, btw. It worked for Reagan, you just have to get the <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/derision">derision</a> right. And Harris can do that, she laughs and we laugh. Trump loses his mind.</li>
<li>The Harris candidacy happened almost as if it was staged. The campaign hit the ground running, it feels like there was a lot of advance work. Or they picked bloggers who were up and running, gave them the keys and said go. Either approach is fine, breaking through where previous Demo campaigns didn't have the nerve. Whatever it is, there's a sign of competence and urgency in the Democrats that is grounded in the challenge not in some almost religious sense that she's The One, which was understandable with Obama, but won't do now. We have no illusions about what's ahead. I think for that Biden must have been a great teacher. </li>
<li>Now we're grounded. We've seen the outline of our future. Our eyes were fully opened on Jan 6. A few weeks ago the lead Republican thinker behind Project 2025 <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4757210-heritage-blowback-bloodless-revolution/">said</a>, like an idiot, in an interview, it was up to liberals to avoid a bloodbath, as they took over. You don't hear that anymore. Those people must now be thinking more seriously about jail for what they're doing. And the Supreme Court will go to jail too if they try to support what Maddow was talking about. We must not let them overthrow the government. And that's why Maddow's concern is okay but overstated, imho.</li>
<li>I had my doubts whether Biden would stop the <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dissolution">dissolution</a> of the Supreme Court, and I don't know if Harris will, but given how purposefully the campaign in running, I suspect (hope, pray) she will. Our job is to give her the support she needs to feel that we've got her back. </li>
</ul>
<p>PS: FDR <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/83fbfae5-d28d-4332-bda1-480fed1e9584">threatened</a> to pack the court in 1937. </p>

Walz is Harris' choice. Picking Shapiro would have been leading with her chin because of Netanyahu. Walz looks older than her but they're actually the same age.

## WordStar for DOS 7.0 archive

date: 2024-08-06, from: OS News

As you all know, I continue to use WordStar for DOS 7.0 as my word-processing program. It was last updated in December 1992, and the company that made it has been defunct for decades; the program is abandonware. There was no proper archive of WordStar for DOS 7.0 available online, so I decided to create one. I’ve put weeks of work into this. Included are not only full installs of the program (as well as images of the installation disks), but also plug-and-play solutions for running WordStar for DOS 7.0 under Windows, and also complete full-text-searchable PDF versions of all seven manuals that came with WordStar — over a thousand pages of documentation. ↫ Robert J. Sawyer WordStar for DOS is definitely a bit of a known entity in our circles for still being used by a number of world-famous authors. WordStar 4.0 is still being used by George R. R. Martin &#8211; assuming he&#8217;s still even working on The Winds of Winter &#8211; and there must be some sort of reason as to why it&#8217;s still so oddly popular. Thanks to this work by author Robert J. Sawyer, accessing and using version 7 of WordStar for DOS is now easier than ever. One of the reasons Sawyer set out to do this was making sure that if he passes away, the people responsible for his estate and works will have an easy way to access his writings. It&#8217;s refreshing to see an author think ahead this far, and it will surely help a ton of other people too, since there&#8217;s quite a few documents lingering around using the WordStar format.

## US judge rules Google is a monopoly, search deals with Apple and Mozilla in peril

date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News

That sure is a big news drop for a random Tuesday. A federal judge ruled that Google violated US antitrust law by maintaining a monopoly in the search and advertising markets. “After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” according to the court’s ruling, which you can read in full at the bottom of this story. “It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.” ↫ Lauren Feiner at The Verge Among many other things, the judge mentions Google&#8217;s own admissions that the company can do pretty much whatever it wants with Google Search and its advertisement business, without having to worry about users opting to go elsewhere or ad buyers leaving the Google platform. Studies from inside Google itself made it very clear that Google could systematically make Search worse without it affecting user and/or usage numbers in any way, shape, or form &#8211; because users have nowhere else to realistically go. While the ability to raise prices at will without fear of losing customers is a sure sign of being a monopoly, so is being able to make a product worse without fear of losing customers, the judge argues. Google plans to appeal, obviously, and this ruling has nothing yet to say about potential remedies, so what, exactly, is going to change is as of yet unknown. Potential remedies will be handled during the next phase of the proceedings, with the wildest and most aggressive remedy being a potential break-up of Google, Alphabet, or whatever it&#8217;s called today. My sights are definitely set on a break-up &#8211; hopefully followed by Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft &#8211; to create some much-needed breathing room into the technology market, and pave the way for a massive number of newcomers to compete on much fairer terms. Of note is that the judge also put yet another nail in the coffin of Google&#8217;s various exclusivity deals, most notable with Apple and, for our interests, with Mozilla. Google pays Apple well over 20 billion dollars a year to be the default search engine on iOS, and it pays about 80% of Mozilla&#8217;s revenue to be the default search engine in Firefox. According to the judge, such deals are anticompetitive. Mehta rejected Google’s arguments that its contracts with phone and browser makers like Apple were not exclusionary and therefore shouldn’t qualify it for liability under the Sherman Act. “The prospect of losing tens of billions in guaranteed revenue from Google — which presently come at little to no cost to Apple — disincentivizes Apple from launching its own search engine when it otherwise has built the capacity to do so,” he wrote. ↫ Lauren Feiner at The Verge If the end of these deals become part of the package of remedies, it will be a massive financial blow to Apple &#8211; 20 billion dollars a year is about 15% of Apple&#8217;s total annual operating profits, and I&#8217;m also pretty sure those Google billions are counted as part of Tim Cook&#8217;s much-vaunted services revenue, so losing it would definitely impact Apple directly where it hurts. Sure, it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;ll make Apple any less of a dangerous behemoth, but it will definitely have some explaining to do to investors. Much more worrisome, however, is the similar deal Google has with Mozilla. About 80% of Mozilla&#8217;s total revenue comes from a search deal with Google, and if that deal were to be dissolved, the consequences for Mozilla, and thus for Firefox, would be absolutely immense. This is something I&#8217;ve been warning about for years now, and the end of this deal would be yet another worry that I&#8217;ve voiced repeatedly becoming reality, right after Mozilla becoming an advertising company and making Firefox worse in the name of quick profits. One by one, every single concern I&#8217;ve voiced about the future of Firefox is becoming reality. Canonical, Fedora, KDE, GNOME, and many other stakeholders &#8211; ignore these developments at your own peril.

## Every Microsoft employee is now being judged on their security work

date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News

After a number of very bug security incidents involving Microsoft&#8217;s software, the company promised it would take steps to put security at the top of its list of priorities. Today we got another glimpse of the step it&#8217;s taking, since the company is going to take security into account during performance reviews. Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft’s chief people officer, has outlined what the company expects of employees in an internal memo obtained by The Verge. “Everyone at Microsoft will have security as a Core Priority,” says Hogan. “When faced with a tradeoff, the answer is clear and simple: security above all else.” A lack of security focus for Microsoft employees could impact promotions, merit-based salary increases, and bonuses. “Delivering impact for the Security Core Priority will be a key input for managers in determining impact and recommending rewards,” Microsoft is telling employees in an internal Microsoft FAQ on its new policy. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge Now, I&#8217;ve never worked in a corporate environment or something even remotely close to it, but something about this feels off to me. Often, it seems that individual, lower-level employees know all too well they&#8217;re cutting corners, but they&#8217;re effectively forced to because management expects almost inhuman results from its workers. So, in the case of a technology company like Microsoft, this means workers are pushed to write as much code as possible, or to implement as many features as possible, and the only way to achieve the goals set by management is to take shortcuts &#8211; like not caring as much about code quality or security. In other words, I don&#8217;t see how Microsoft employees are supposed to make security their top priority, while also still having to achieve any unrealistic goals set by management and other higher-ups. What I&#8217;m missing from this memo and associated reporting is Microsoft telling its employees that if unrealistic targets, crunch, low pay, and other factors that contribute to cutting corners get in the way of putting security first, they have the freedom to choose security. If employees are not given such freedom, demanding even more from them without anything in return seems like a recipe for disaster to me, making this whole memo quite moot. We&#8217;ll have to see what this will amount to in practice, but with how horrible employees are treated in most industries these days, especially in countries with terrible union coverage and laughable labour protection laws like the US, I don&#8217;t have high hopes for this.

## 50 years ago, CP/M started the microcomputer revolution

date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News

CP/M is turning 50 this year. The ancient Control Program for Microcomputers, or CP/M for short, has been enjoying a modest renaissance in recent years. By 21st century standards, it&#8217;s unimaginably tiny and simple. The whole OS fits into under 200 kB, and the resident bit of the kernel is only about 3 kB. Today, in the era of end-user OSes in the tens-of-gigabytes size range, this exerts a fascination to a certain kind of hobbyist. Back when it was new, though, this wasn&#8217;t minimalist – it was all that early hardware could support. ↫ Liam Proven I&#8217;m a little too young to have experienced CP/M as anything other than a retro platform &#8211; I&#8217;m from 1984, and we got our first computer in 1990 or so &#8211; but its importance and influence cannot be overstated. Many of the conventions set by CP/M made their way to the various DOS variants, and in turn, we still see some of those conventions in Windows today. Had Digital Research, the company CP/M creator Gary Kildall set up to sell CP/M, accepted the deal with IBM to make CP/M the default operating system for the then newly-created IBM PC, we&#8217;d be living in a very different world today. Digital Research would also create several other popular and/or influential software products beyond CP/M, such as DR DOS and GEM, as well as various other DOS variants and CP/M versions with DOS compatibility. It would eventually be acquired by Novell, where it faded into obscurity.

When reporting massacres, imho we should cite the number of people who were shot. It measures of how much violence there was, and how excessive the gun tech used. Many who were injured but not killed have their lives ruined. Their suffering can go for decades.

## 2024-08-05 Free speech advocacy on the fediverse

date: 2024-08-05, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-05-free-speech-advocacy-on-the-fediverse">2024-08-05 Free speech advocacy on the fediverse</h1>

<p>It all started with <a class="account" href="https://social.wildeboer.net/@jwildeboer" title="@jwildeboer@social.wildeboer.net">@jwildeboer</a> <a href="https://social.wildeboer.net/@jwildeboer/112893255029322563">arguing</a> that the original poster (OP) of a message should be in control of what’s considered to be a reply to the their post. Apparently, this would be within the realm of how ActivityPub works, but it&rsquo;s not how Mastodon works. From my point of view, I&rsquo;d love the ability to unlink replies from my post so that people clicking through to my post don&rsquo;t end up seeing those replies. I&rsquo;d be protecting my readers from spam, trolls and detractors. Jan also argued that as a positive side-effect, servers getting the original post that starts a thread would immediately get the whole tree of replies. Finally, Jan also argued that replies should not be able to reduce the audience scope of the audience because it was used for bullying. People replying with a “followers only” audience can effectively pile-on the original poster with their friends and followers without anybody else being able to see this – you have to be a follower of the bully in order to see it.</p>

<p>There was a longer thread by <a class="account" href="https://eattherich.club/@deflarerOfClouds" title="@deflarerOfClouds@eattherich.club">@deflarerOfClouds</a> arguing that &ldquo;silencing critics is an anti-speech injustice &amp; if their replies are detached that obviously censors their ideas.&rdquo; I disagree.</p>

<p>In situations like these I like to explain the situation without using the word censorship as we’ll get bogged down in a word definition game that I find fundamentally boring. I want to make sure that speech I disagree with does not benefit from my reach; I want no part in distributing it. If somebody wants to argue that this is censorship and therefore bad, I’m bored. I’d like to hear an explanation that hows how this attachment is something I should support. Note that I&rsquo;m not interested in the question of whether people can or cannot say their words; all I care about is them not distributing their words along with mine.</p>

<p>In this sense, running a blog without comments is perfect. There&rsquo;s not even the illusion of censorship. If people want to counter, let them put it up on their blogs. I’m not in a debate club. Instead, I feel like an essayist or a book author. Other people should feel free to write their own books and their essays – and their own blog posts, possibly linking to mine – but me having to endure the inane and the boring, and inflicting it on my readers, is disrespectful to my readership. It&rsquo;s abuse of my distribution channel.</p>

<p>Similarly, I expect newspapers and academic journals to exercise their editorial powers to filter and select the replies and comments and letters to the editors worth their readers&rsquo; time. It is what I expect because life is short and the number of boring comments are endless. A world without curation is not my goal.</p>

<p>On my blog, people can find ways to contact me. And maybe I’ll post their replies or additions. But really, adversarial comments can be hosted elsewhere and I feel no compulsion to link them all. This sort of third party comment aggregation is exactly what Hacker News, Reddit or Lemmy do. It makes no sense to demand that blogs do the same. It makes no sense to demand all social media to do the same. Tools can be different and interaction models can be different.</p>

<p>To come back to the fediverse: I would prefer Mastodon (and the software I use, GoToSocial) to change their defaults because I think the original poster having control over comments provides exactly the kind of curation I like. In this social media model, I&rsquo;m following people so I implicitly trust their curation. Calling this curation censorship or suppression is an exaggeration.</p>

<p>I write on the web. I don’t plan to prevent other people from reading my words and writing posts quoting my words. What I do want is the option of having no part in their distribution. I&rsquo;m not interested in technology that allows people to use my blog or my posts to reach my readership with their adversarial replies. In other words, I&rsquo;m fine with people writing replies on their blog posts and linking to mine. I don&rsquo;t need to link back. On social media, I&rsquo;m willing to go a step further and allow people to write public replies linked to my posts. I&rsquo;d very much like the option of detaching adversarial replies from my posts.</p>

<p>The important part about this is the realization that none of this is &ldquo;natural&rdquo; – everything is engineered and the people writing the software make decisions about how the people on these platforms interact and it&rsquo;s important to think about the choices being made and the consequences these choices have. Replies being attached to original posts in the fediverse is a feature somebody developed and it is not at all clear to me that denying this features amounts to suppression or censorship.</p>

<p>The belief that denying technological features amounts to suppression and censorship is a leap I am not willing to make.</p>

## Low Leakage Cryogenic Disconnects for Fuel Transfer and Long-Term Storage

date: 2024-08-05, from: NASA breaking news

To enable deep space missions, the capability to transfer and store cryogenic fuels (typically liquid hydrogen, methane, and oxygen) without significant leakage over long duration missions is critical. NASA has been actively developing zero boil-off cryocooler technology to reduce storage losses. Another source of fuel loss is from leakage at the&#160;fuel disconnect&#160;used for in-space refueling. [&#8230;]

## styles of acting, styles of being

date: 2024-08-05, from: Ayjay blog

One of my favorite YouTubers is Thomas Flight, who makes videos about movies. In a recent video, he contrasts the “theatrical” acting style of classic Hollywood movies with the “naturalistic” style of today’s movies. Flight’s treatment of this issue is better than most, but he overlooks a key point — one that almost everyone who [&#8230;]

## 2024-08-04 Walliser Roggenbrot

date: 2024-08-05, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-04-walliser-roggenbrot">2024-08-04 Walliser Roggenbrot</h1>

<p>Wir waren zu Besuch bei Freunden in Oberösterreich und ich habe ein „Walliser“ Roggenbrot mitgebracht.</p>

<p>Man nehme:</p>

<ul>
<li>Salz</li>
<li>Dinkelmehl (ein Drittel oder ein Viertel vom Mehl); Weizenmehl geht auch</li>
<li>Roggenvollkornschrotmehl (doppelt oder drei Mal so viel wie Dinkel- oder Weizenmehl)</li>
<li>Sauerteig Starter</li>
<li>Nüsse; z.B. Walnüsse</li>
<li>Trockfrüchte; z.B. Pflaumen, Aprikosen, Feigen, je nach Wunsch</li>
</ul>

<p>Hier mit Paranüssen, Datteln, Pflaumen und Feigen:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-1.jpg" alt="Salz, Dinkelmehr, Roggenvollkornschrotmehl, Paranüsse, Datteln, gedörrte Pflaumen und gedörrte Feigen" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-2.jpg" alt="Nüsse nicht klein brechen, Früchte grob schneiden" /></p>

<p>Sauerteigstarter und ca. 150g Dinkelmehl:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-3.jpg" alt="Mehl" /></p>

<p>Etwa zwei bis drei Mal mehr Roggenvollkornschrotmehl, das wären also 300–450g, hier aufgefüllt mit etwas über 300g Roggenvollkornschrotmehl auf ca. 500g:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-4.jpg" alt="Noch mehr Mehl" /></p>

<p>Eine Hand voll Salz, oder einen Suppenlöffel, oder etwa 10g:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-5.jpg" alt="Salz" /></p>

<p>Mit etwas mehr als zwei Drittel Wasser mischen. Bei 500g Mehl wären das 333ml Wasser gewesen. Hier habe ich fast 400ml zugegeben und auf 900g aufgefüllt. Wie man nachher noch sehen wird, war das ein wenig zu viel Wasser.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-6.jpg" alt="Wasser hinzufügen" /></p>

<p>Umrühren – langes kneten finde ich unnötig. Kommt aber vielleicht auf das Mehl an.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-7.jpg" alt="Teig ist ein Klumpen" /></p>

<p>Über Nacht zudecken und gären lassen.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-8.jpg" alt="Geschirrtuch bedeckt die Schüssel" /></p>

<p>Weil es genug Dinkelmehl in der Mischung gab, ist aufgegangen.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-9.jpg" alt="Der Teig in der Schüssel ist aufgegangen" /></p>

<p>Weil es so viel Teig ist, werde ich zwei kleinere Brote machen und habe den Teig deswegen halbiert.
Nun gilt es, den Teig in viel Mehl zu wenden, so dass er nirgends mehr anklebt. Weil ich etwas zu viel Wasser verwendet habe, war das schwieriger als sonst.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-10.jpg" alt="Zwei Schüsseln mit Teigklumpen in Mehl gewendet" /></p>

<p>Nochmal zudecken und etwas gehen lassen.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-11.jpg" alt="Geschirrtuch bedeckt nun zwei Schüsseln" /></p>

<p>Diesmal warte ich nicht lange. nach einer halben Stunde oder Stunde hat es schon wieder Risse und Blasen in der Mehlschicht, weil die Hefe aktiv ist.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-12.jpg" alt="Bemehlte Teigklumpen mit Rissen und Blasen" /></p>

<p>Weil der Teig nicht sehr fest ist, lege ich ihn lieber in eine Schüssel oder eine Kuchenform statt auf das Backblech. Traditionelles Roggenbrot ist allerdings eher flach, deswegen nehme ich keine Kuchenform. Etwas flach ist OK.</p>

<p>Unten im Boden hat es einen Wasserbehälter mit einem halben Liter Wasser drinnen. Das kann man auch in eine dritte Schüssel geben, damit es im Ofen schön feucht bleibt.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-13.jpg" alt="Zwei Teigklumpen in zwei Schüsseln im Ofen" /></p>

<p>50 Minuten backen bei 180°C und das Brot ist fertig.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-14.jpg" alt="Zwei Laib Brot mit schöner Kruste" /></p>

<p>Wer ein Kuchengitter hat, kann das Brot darauf trocknen lassen. Alternativ in ein Geschirrtuch einwickeln oder kopfüber legen, damit es auch von unten etwas antrocknen kann.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-15.jpg" alt="Brot auf einem Gitter" /></p>

<p>Üblicherweise wird das Brot relativ dünn geschnitten und mit allem möglichen belegt. Fleisch, Käse, oder nur mit etwas Butter… und einem Glas Wein.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-03-walliser-roggenbrot-16.jpg" alt="Erste Scheiben vom Brot geschnitten" /></p>

<h2 id="exkurs-sauerteig">Exkurs Sauerteig</h2>

<p>Online gibt es tausend Anleitungen hierfür. Hier meine Kurzfassung.</p>

<p>Variante 1 dauert ein paar Tage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Etwas Mehl und gleich viel Wasser mischen, bis es einen zähen, feuchten Teig gibt. Diesen mit einem Papier verschlossen im Kühlschrank aufbewahren. Jeden Tag die Hälfte davon verwenden, für Pfannkuchen oder sonst etwas. Dann wieder mit Mehl und Wasser auffüllen und mischen, bis man wieder gleich viel im Glas hat. Anfangs hat es nur wenig Hefe darin. Nach sieben Tagen sieht man durch das Glas, wie es jeden Morgen Blasen im Teig hat. Der Sauerteig lebt!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Variante 2 ist um einiges schneller:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Etwas Mehl, Hefe und gleich viel Wasser mischen, bis es einen zähen, feuchten Teig gibt. Diesen mit einem Papier verschlossen im Kühlschrank aufbewahren. Schon nach einer Stunde sieht man Blasen im Teig. Der Sauerteig lebt! Nun verwendet man die Hälfte davon für das erste Brot. Dann gilt es, das Glas wieder mit Mehl und Wasser aufzufüllen und zu mischen, bis man wieder gleich viel im Glas hat. Anfangs hat es nur wenig Milchsäurebakterien darin, aber das wird im Laufe der nächsten Tage besser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Das funktioniert, weil es in der Luft Hefe und Milchsäurebakterien hat, welche die Mischung besiedeln. Da wir immer die Hälfte entfernen, sorgt die Auslese dafür, dass nur bleibt, wer sich wirklich schnell ausbreiten kann. Und das sind die Hefe und die Milchsäurebakterien. Diese halten sich gegenseitig mit ihren Produkten im Schach: Die Hefe produziert Alkohol und die Bakterien die Milchsäure, was den Teig bei andere Lebewesen unbeliebt macht. Unser Glück!</p>

<p>Theoretisch kann man den Sauerteig auch ausserhalb des Kühlschrankes aufbewahren. Früher hatten wir ja auch keine Kühlschränke und trotzdem gab es Brot. Da wir aber nicht jeden Tag ein Brot backen und deswegen auch nicht die ganze Zeit Sauerteig verbrauchen, gibt das anderen Lebewesen die Gelegenheit, unser Glas zu besiedeln. Im Kühlschrank wird das etwas ausgebremst.</p>

<h2 id="tipps-zum-glas">Tipps zum Glas</h2>

<p>Ich schliesse das Glas nicht mit einem luftdichten Deckel, weil der Sauerstoff ebenfalls unerwünschte Lebewesen fern hält.</p>

<p>Wenn ich in die Ferien gehe, mach ich eine besonders trockene Mischung, weil ich mir vorstelle, dass die Hefe und die Milchsäurebakterien dann in ein Dauerstadium übergehen und die Zeit ohne neue Nahrung besser überstehen. Weniger Wasser sorgt dafür, dass in dieser Zeit weniger unerwünschte Lebewesen das Glas besiedeln.</p>

<p>Alle ein bis zwei Wochen wechsel ich das Glas. Der halbe Sauerteig kommt in das neue Glas, das alte Glas wird beim Brot backen mit dem verwendeten Wasser ausgespült. Ich will so wenig Sauerteig wie möglich wegspülen.</p>

<p>In den letzten vier Jahren hatte ich zwei Mal den Fall, dass ich den weissen Flaum von Schimmel am Glasrand gesehen habe. Hier waren Hefe und Milchsäurebakterien nicht stark genug, um sich zu wehren. Also habe ich alles weggeworfen und eine neue Sauerteigkultur angefangen. <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykotoxin#Wirkung">Mit Schimmel ist nicht zu spassen!</a> Der weisse Flaum sind die Fruchtkörper. Der giftige Pilzkörper selber ist nicht sichtbar und breitet sich im Sauerteig aus. Deswegen darf man nicht nur das weisse Zeug entfernen. <em>Alles muss weg.</em></p>

## FreeBSD as a daily driver

date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News

Not too long ago I linked to a blog post by long-time OSNews reader (and silver Patreon) and friend of mine Morgan, about how to set up OpenBSD as a workstation operating system &#8211; and in fact, I personally used that guide in my own OpenBSD journey. Well, Morgan&#8217;s back with another, similar article, this time covering FreeBSD. After going through the basic steps needed to make FreeBSD a bit more amenable to desktop use, Morgan notes about performance: Now let’s compare FreeBSD. Well, quite frankly, there is no comparison! FreeBSD just feels snappier and more responsive on the desktop; at the same 170Hz refresh it actually feels like 170Hz. Void Linux always felt fast enough and I thought it had no lag at all at that refresh rate, but comparing them side by side (FreeBSD installed on the NVMe drive, Void running from a USB 4 SSD with similar performance), FreeBSD is smooth as glass and I started noticing just the slightest lag/stutter on Void. The same holds true for Firefox; I use smooth scrolling and on FreeBSD it really is perfectly smooth. Similarly, Youtube performance is unreal, with no dropped frames at any resolution all the way up to 4Kp60, and the videos look so much smoother! ↫ Morgan/kaidenshi This is especially relevant for me personally, since the prime reason I switched my workstation back to Fedora KDE was OpenBSD&#8217;s performance issues. While those performance issues were entirely expected and the result of the operating system&#8217;s focus on security and hardening, it did mean it&#8217;s just not suitable for me as a workstation operating system, even if I like the internals and find it a joy to use, even under the hood. If FreeBSD delivers more solid desktop and workstation performance, it might be time I set up a FreeBSD KDE installation and see if it can handle my workstation&#8217;s 270Hz 4K display. As I keep reiterating &#8211; the BSD world has a lot to offer those wishing to run a UNIX-like workstation operating system, and it&#8217;s articles like these that help people get started. A lot of the steps taken may seem elementary to many of us, but for people coming from Linux or even Windows, they may be unfamiliar and daunting, so having it all laid out in a straightforward manner is quite helpful.

## It's time to create our own media, again

date: 2024-08-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>We're depending on big companies that are nuzzling up with Trump, at best hedging their bets, to let us use their networks to organize ourselves politically. That's never worked for us, in fact it's worked against us. Trump's election in 2016, for example, could he have done it without Twitter letting him go direct to organize? </p>
<p>The Harris organization is doing great, they have to take on the journalists, where previous Democrats had no answer, they've done it in a clever way, by using their channels to talk about the things journalism should be talking about. People listen to their competition, and that's what this is. </p>
<p>It's not hard to do this, a few of us, who are good listeners and writers, to build lists of sources and provide them for people to access away from the nonstop (often entertaining) bullshit of the social web of 2024.</p>
<p>I've asked for ideas for podcasts that would go into a list of shows people who are voting Democratic would find interesting or useful. Not for spreading religion, but based on facts, not the unhinged lunacy and revenge of Trump. Our news now is too polluted by that. He shouldn't be able to lie about Harris's race, and have that be an issue carried by journalism, for example. That should not be possible but it happens. </p>

## Chrome warns uBlock Origin may soon be disabled

date: 2024-08-04, from: OS News

As uBlock Origin lead developer and maintainer Raymond Hill explained on Friday, this is the result of Google deprecating support for the Manifest v2 (MV2) extensions platform in favor of Manifest v3 (MV3). &#8220;uBO is a Manifest v2 extension, hence the warning in your Google Chrome browser. There is no Manifest v3 version of uBO, hence the browser will suggest alternative extensions as a replacement for uBO,&#8221; Hill explained. ↫ Sergiu Gatlan at Bleeping Computer If you&#8217;re still using Chrome, or any possible Chrome skins who have not committed to keeping Manifest v2 extensions enabled, it&#8217;s really high time to start thinking about jumping ship if ad blocking matters to you. Of course, we don&#8217;t know for how long Firefox will remain able to properly block ads either, but for now, it&#8217;s obviously the better choice for those of us who care about a better browsing experience. And just to reiterate: I fully support anyone&#8217;s right to block ads, even on OSNews. Your computer, your rules. There are a variety of other, better means to support OSNews &#8211; our Patreon, individual donations through Ko-Fi, or buying our merch &#8211; that are far better for us than ads will ever be.

## Limine: a modern, advanced, portable, multiprotocol bootloader and boot manager

date: 2024-08-04, from: OS News

Limine is an advanced, portable, multiprotocol bootloader that supports Linux, multiboot1 and 2, the native Limine boot protocol, and more.  Limine is lightweight, elegant, fast, and the reference implementation of the Limine boot protocol. The Limine boot protocol&#8217;s main target audience is operating system and kernel developers that want to use a boot protocol which supports modern features in an elegant manner, that GRUB&#8217;s aging multiboot protocols do not (or do not properly). ↫ Limine website I wish trying out different bootloaders was an easier thing to do. Personally, since my systems only run Fedora Linux, I&#8217;d love to just move them all over to systemd-boot and not deal with GRUB at all anymore, but since it&#8217;s not supported by Fedora I&#8217;m worried updates might break the boot process at some point. On systems where only one operating system is installed, as a user I should really be given the choice to opt for the simplest, most basic boot sequence, even if it can&#8217;t boot any other operating systems or if it&#8217;s more limited than GRUB.

## Exploring O3 optimization for Ubuntu

date: 2024-08-04, from: OS News

Following our recent work 5 with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS where we enabled frame pointers by default to improve debugging and profiling, we’re continuing our performance engineering efforts by evaluating the impact of O3 optimization in Ubuntu. O3 is a GCC optimization 14 level that applies more aggressive code transformations compared to the default O2 level. These include advanced function and the use of sophisticated algorithms aimed at enhancing execution speed. While O3 can increase binary size and compilation time, it has the potential to improve runtime performance. ↫ Ubuntu Discourse If these optimisations deliver performance improvements, and the only downside is larger binaries and longer compilation times, it seems like a bit of a no-brainer to enable these, assuming those mentioned downsides are within reason. Are there any downsides they&#8217;re not mentioning? Browsing around and doing some minor research it seems that -O3 optimisations may break some packages, and can even lead to performance degradation, defeating the purpose altogether. Looking at a set of benchmarks from Phoronix from a few years ago, in which the Linux kernel was compiled with either O2 and O3 and their performance compared, the results were effectively tied, making it seem not worth it at all. However, during these benchmarks, only the kernel was tested; everything else was compiled normally in both cases. Perhaps compiling the entire system with O3 will yield improvements in other parts of the system that do add up. For now, you can download unsupported Ubuntu ISOs compiled with O3 optimisations enabled to test them out.

<p>Pino and crew have moved a lot in the past month. On the first of July, we were in Sitka, Southeast Alaska, and then on the last day of the month we were back in Millbrook Cove, very near to the top of Vancouver Island. We sailed 590 NM and stopped in 15 different anchorages.</p>

<p>Leaving Sitka, we sailed along the west coast of Southeast Alaska for a few days to try and take advantage of a good weather window, we had some engine issues which too motivated the need for such a long passage(see our <a href="https://100r.co/media/content/maps/sealaska_2024.jpg" target="_blank">track</a>)—we spent two days troubleshooting the issue while anchored in Port Bazan, a bay far from everything, with no internet connection or way to talk to anybody, we were glad to have the physical engine manual on board. Sailing on open waters is always nice, we saw black-footed albatrosses, horned puffins, a whale per hour, and many more sea otters(Port Bazan was full of them).</p>

<p>After checking back into <a href="https://100r.co/site/prince_rupert.html" target="_blank">Prince Rupert</a>, the way back south through Northern Canada was plagued with unfavorable winds, we had to beat into it, or travel on quiet waters to make progress. We resorted to doing short hops between anchorages, conditions did not permit for long distances. Doing short hops though did allow us to discover beautiful places we might have otherwise missed. We spent many grey days waiting for weather, reading, drawing, and beginning work on <a href="https://100r.co/site/markl.html" target="_blank">markl</a>, we're giving it another go).</p>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we read <i>Erewhon</i> by Samuel Butler, <i>Technophilia and Its Discontents</i> by Ellen Ullman, <i>The Democracy Of Species</i> by Robin Wall Kimmerer, <i>I Will Fight No More Forever</i> by Merrill D. Beal, <i>In Cold Blood</i> by Truman Capote, and <i>Mrs Dalloway</i> by Virginia Woolf.</p>
