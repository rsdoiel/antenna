## Neisseria meningitidis activates pyroptotic pathways in a mouse model of meningitis: role of a two-partner secretion system

date: 2024-09-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

There is evidence that in infected cells in vitro the meningococcal HrpA/HrpB two-partner secretion system (TPS) mediates the exit of bacteria from the internalization vacuole and the docking of bacteria to the dynein motor resulting in the induction of pyroptosis. In this study we set out to study the role of the HrpA/HrpB TPS in establishing meningitis and activating pyroptotic pathways in an animal model of meningitis using a reference serogroup C meningococcal strain, 93/4286, and an isogenic hrpB knockout mutant, 93/4286ΩhrpB. Survival experiments confirmed the role of HrpA/HrpB TPS in the invasive meningococcal disease. In fact, the ability of the hrpB mutant to replicate in brain and spread systemically was impaired in mice infected with hrpB mutant. Furthermore, western blot analysis of brain samples during the infection demonstrated that: i. N. meningitidis activated canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pyroptosis pathways in the mouse brain; ii. the activation of caspase-11, caspase-1, and gasdermin-D was markedly reduced in the hrpB mutant; iii. the increase in the amount of IL-1β and IL-18, which are an important end point of pyroptosis, occurs in the brains of mice infected with the wild-type strain 93/4286 and is strongly reduced in those infected with 93/4286ΩhrpB. In particular, the activation of caspase 11, which is triggered by cytosolic lipopolysaccharide, indicates that during meningococcal infection pyroptosis is induced by intracellular infection after the exit of the bacteria from the internalizing vacuole, a process that is hindered in the hrpB mutant. Overall, these results confirm, in an animal model, that the HrpA/HrpB TPS plays a role in the induction of pyroptosis and suggest a pivotal involvement of pyroptosis in invasive meningococcal disease, paving the way for the use of pyroptosis inhibitors in the adjuvant therapy of the disease.

## Relationship between pathogenic E.coli O78-induced intestinal epithelial barrier damage and Zonulin expression levels in yaks

date: 2024-09-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

To explore whether the intestinal damage of yak colibacillosis resulted from the regulation of Zonulin expression by its pathogenic bacteria, the overexpression and interference plasmids of Zonulin were designed and cultured in Tranwell after cell transfection. Then qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the results of cell transfection, 200 mL 1×105 CFU/mL E.coli O78 was added for 4 hours, transmembrane resistance was measured by transmembrane resistance meter, FD4 fluorescence concentration in the lower chamber was detected by enzyme labeling instrument, bacterial translocation was measured by CFU counting method, and epithelial mucin (MUC1, MUC2) and tight junction protein (FABP2, Occludin, ZO-1) were detected by qRT-PCR.ResultsThe Zonulin gene overexpression and knockout cell lines were successfully constructed, the TEER value of the barrier of Zonulin overexpression cell lines began to decrease at 1 h after the addition of E.coli O78 and reached the lowest value at 4 h, and the TEER value of Zonulin interference cell lines decreased within 1-4 h after the addition of E.coli O78. At 4 h, the FD4 passing capacity of Zonulin overexpression cell lines was significantly higher than that of interfering cell lines, reaching twice as much as siRNA-1. The amount of bacterial translocation in overexpressed cell lines increased rapidly within 1-4 h, and the concentration of E.coli in the lower chamber was significantly higher than that in the siRNA-1 group at 4 h, but there was no significant change in the siRNA-1 group in the 1-4 h. There was no significant change in the mRNA level of MUC1 in Zonulin overexpression and interference cell lines after the addition of E.coli O78. In the overexpression group, the mRNA levels of MUC2, Occludin, and ZO-1 were significantly decreased, and the mRNA level of FABP2 was increased considerably. These results suggest stimulate epithelial cells to secrete Zonulin protein. Many Zonulin proteins regulate the opening of tight junction structures, reduce the transmembrane resistance of the cell barrier, and improve the permeability of the cell barrier and the amount of bacterial translocation.

## Environmental contamination with carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in healthcare settings in Fiji: a potential source of infection

date: 2024-09-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThere are multiple ongoing outbreaks of carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAb) infection in Fiji’s hospitals. CRAb is able to colonize and persist on various hospital surfaces for extended periods. We conducted a study to understand the extent of hospital environmental contamination and phylogenetic links with clinical isolates.MethodsSwabs were collected from high-touch surfaces at Colonial War Memorial Hospital (CWMH) September 2021 and December 2022; Lautoka Hospital (LTKH) August 2022; and Labasa Hospital (LBSH) November 2022. All bacterial isolates were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) performed; isolates resistant to carbapenems and producing a carbapenemase underwent whole genome sequencing. Comparison was made to clinical isolates obtained from CWMH in 2016–2017 and 2019–2021 and from LTKH and LBSH from 2020–2021.ResultsFrom the 180 environmental samples collected, ten (5.6%) CRAb were isolated; no other carbapenem-resistant gram-negative organisms were isolated. Seven (70%) of the CRAb were isolated from CWMH and three (30%) from LTKH; no CRAb were isolated from LBSH. Of the seven CWMH CRAb, two were sequence type 2 (ST2), three ST25, and two ST499. All LTKH isolates were ST499. The two environmental CRAb ST2 isolates were closely genetically linked to isolates obtained from patients in CWMH, LTKH, and LBSH 2020–2021. Similarly, the three environmental CRAb ST25 isolates were closely genetically linked to isolates obtained from patients admitted to CWMH in 2019–2021 and LBSH in 2020. The environmental CRAb ST499 isolates represented two distinct clones, with clone 1 comprising two genetically identical isolates from CWMH and clone 2 the three isolates from LTKH. Although no genetic linkages were observed when comparing environmental ST499 isolates to those from CWMH patients in 2020–2021, both clone 1 isolates were genetically identical to an isolate obtained from a patient admitted during the sampling period.ConclusionOur study highlights the contamination of high-touch surfaces within Fiji hospitals with CRAb, suggesting that these may serve as important sources for CRAb. Phylogenetic linkages to CRAb isolated from patients since 2019 underscores the persistence of this resistant pathogen in hospital settings and the ongoing risk for hospital-acquired infections.
