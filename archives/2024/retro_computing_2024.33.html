<p>Hi, folks… As I’ve already warned my patrons, I don’t have an article
for you this week. I do, however, finally have the 1997 ebook for you,

64-bit with Gerph – ROUGOL, 19th August</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-15, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>In the RISC OS world, we (should) all know that RISC OS runs on ARM
processors in either 26 or 32-bit mode, depending what hardware (or
emulator) you are running it on – and that we are now at the stage where
64-bit only ARM processors are becoming the norm, and RISC OS is unable
to run on them. Right from its outset, the ARM was a 32-bit processor
with 32-bit registers, one of which was the ‘program counter’, a special
register used to determine the address in memory from…</p>

<p>And a language poll for MACadd There are two bits of news from Kevin
Wells for some of his applications: There’s a new StreetFix release,
which now stands at version 1.09, and he’s running a poll in relation to
adding new language support to MACadd. Looking at StreetFix first, Kevin
upgraded it recently to version 1.08, adding support for multiple
languages, and he has now released version 1.09, in which that support
extends to the application’s interactive help (the facility through
