‘Shorty’ Benchcrafted Split-top Roubo?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-06, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>A few years back, we decided we had too many benches in our shop, so
I hired movers to transport and get my “Gluebo” into my basement. (Its
weight almost killed us moving it from my former workplace to Lost Art
Press in 2017.) Then we decided we had too few benches, and that we…</p>

grab this thin pry bar from Chris’s tool chest in a panic to remove
moulding and other small pieces without damaging them, and I don’t know
what else. But I grab it a lot. I have one at home that…</p>

Mid-18th-century French Tools</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-05, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>Several weeks ago I came across an illustrated collection of tools
held by Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ). The
approximate date of the collection is 1740, which pre-dates Roubo’s
“l’art du Menuisier.”  The collection, acquired in 1970, includes 84
illustrations. In the BAnQ’s description it is noted the illustrations
may be from a…</p>

brushes for gluing and for our chip brushes. Torrington is a small
Florida company that makes excellent brushes and carries some really
good imported ones. We are eager to try other brushes…</p>

<p>The following is the preface of “Campaign Furniture,” by Christopher
Schwarz. For almost 200 years, simple and sturdy pieces of campaign
furniture were used by people all over the globe, yet this remarkable
furniture style is now almost unknown to most woodworkers and furniture
designers. “Campaign Furniture” seeks to restore this style to its

<p>It’s been a while since I wrote about our work on the Anthe Building,
the old factory where our fulfillment center is located. This fall we’ve
been working on the storefront of the building, which faces Madison
Avenue in downtown Covington. And on some offices upstairs for the
editorial staff. Here’s the latest. The Storefront…</p>

completely embraced the Pica marking stuff. It is not perfect (details

scorps/inshaves are expensive and difficult to come by. Most of the used
