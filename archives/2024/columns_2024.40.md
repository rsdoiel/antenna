## Post flow

date: 2024-09-30, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

A watershed* is land that drains through a river to the sea or into an inland body of water. That&#8217;s what came to mind for me when I read this from Dave Winer: If you want to help the open web, when you write something you‚Äôre proud of on a social web site like Bluesky [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-09-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

And finally, if I were the czar of ActivityPub, I'd add Markdown support to the spec because it ain't the web if you can't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">link</a> in your writing. Maybe even invent some new kinds of links, after all it's been <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web">35 years</a> since the first web was invented.

If I were <a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/DAiuOlWpjxF">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, I'd add Markdown support to Threads so writers could use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">basic communication tool</a> of the web.

If I were <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3l5erfos4x22p">benevolent dictator of BlueSky</a>, I'd add Markdown support there too. Btw, can you really claim to be part of the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a> when you don't support the web's most basic feature -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">linking</a>??

## AI and the 2024 US Elections

date: 2024-09-30, updated: 2024-09-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>For years now, AI has undermined the public&#8217;s ability to trust what it sees, hears, and reads. The <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/04/ai-generated-political-ads-election-candidate-voter-interaction-transparency/673893/">Republican National Committee</a> released a provocative ad offering an &#8220;AI-generated look into the country&#8217;s possible future if Joe Biden is re-elected,&#8221; showing apocalyptic, machine-made images of ruined cityscapes and chaos at the border. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-robocall-new-hampshire-strategist-rcna139760">Fake robocalls</a> purporting to be from Biden urged New Hampshire residents not to vote in the 2024 primary election.

date: 2024-09-30, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Late Friday night, Tennessee House Republican Caucus chair Jeremy Faison posted &#8220;President Biden has finally approved [Tennessee governor Bill Lee&#8217;s] state of emergency request,&#8221; making it sound as if the delay in federal support for the state during the devastation of Hurricane Helene was Biden&#8217;s fault.

## 2024-09-29 Configuring Odd¬µ via environment variables

date: 2024-09-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-29-configuring-odd¬µ-via-environment-variables">2024-09-29 Configuring Odd¬µ via environment variables</h1>

<p><a href="Odd%C2%B5">Odd¬µ</a> replaced <a href="Oddmuse">Oddmuse</a> as my preferred wiki software.</p>

<ol>
<li>Odd¬µ is a <strong>wiki</strong> ‚Äì a website that can be edited on the web, using a regular web browser on my phone, for example. Only I get to edit the wiki these days and there is no way to leave a comment. Send me an email, instead. I love getting email! üòç</li>
<li>Odd¬µ is a <strong>static site generator</strong> (SSG) so that I can in theory write a bunch of Markdown files locally, run Odd¬µ and upload the result to the web. The reason I don&rsquo;t use it like that is that this disables online search. If you don&rsquo;t need online search or you&rsquo;re using some other software to handle it, static files are a great option. Static files are also a great option if you need to archive or export the whole site for offline viewing. Anybody will be able to browse the HTML files offline.</li>
</ol>

<p>Odd¬µ reacts to changes made as it runs, so I can edit the Markdown files remotely, using ssh and my favourite editor or I can edit the Markdown files locally and sync them with the server and the pages Odd¬µ serves reflect those changes immediately, no restart required. Earlier versions required a restart so that Odd¬µ would update its in-memory indexes of page names and titles.</p>

<p>Odd¬µ is also a program that doesn&rsquo;t take a config file. Oddmuse, its predecessor, was designed to be hackable. There were a gazillion options to set. You could hook into the parser and add new rules, add new actions, add new meta data, and on and on. The drawback was an incredible lock-in. After twenty years, I started to feel it: it was hard to remove features for any specific wiki because its pages used a markup that was incompatible with everything else. The sources files ended up being tied to the config files and the modules used.</p>

<p>Some of my Oddmuse wikis used the old <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Usemod_Markup_Extension">UseMod markup</a>. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used the newer <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Creole_Markup_Extension">Wiki Creole markup</a> that some wiki engine authors wanted to push <a href="2006-09-04_Wiki_Creole">back in 2006</a>. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used their own <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Markup_Extension">eclectic markup mix</a>. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Markdown_Rule_Extension">Markdown</a>. For a while I even added <a href="Gemtext">Gemtext</a> to the mix! I didn&rsquo;t like this incompatibility between sites and sometimes even between old and new pages on the same site. This is why Odd¬µ only does Markdown with three minimal extensions: hashtags, wiki links and fedi account links.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.5">oddmu(5)</a> for more.</p>

<p>Odd¬µ generates HTML using templates so there is no need for options to control the HTML output. If you want it changed, edit the templates.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu-templates.5">oddmu-templates(5)</a> for more.</p>

<p>Odd¬µ doesn&rsquo;t know anything about users, passwords and permissions. If you want authentication and authorization (which you do, if your wiki is public), then you need to configure your webserver to ask for passwords and restrict access accordingly.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu-apache.5">oddmu-apache(5)</a> and <a href="oddmu/oddmu-nginx.5">oddmu-nginx(5)</a> for more.</p>

<p>Over time, however, I did add a few configuration options to Odd¬µ.
This happens via environment variables.</p>

<p>When stdin is a socket, Odd¬µ reads requests from it instead of listening
on port. This allows for systemd-style socket activation. This is what
I use at the moment. Otherwise, it listens on
the address from <strong>ODDMU_ADDRESS</strong> and the port from <strong>ODDMU_PORT</strong>.
ODDMU_ADDRESS may be either an IPV4 address or an IPv6 address. If
ODDMU_ADDRESS is unspecified, then the listener listens on all
available unicast addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6. If ODDMU_PORT is
unspecified, it listens on port 8080.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.1">oddmu(1)</a> and <a href="oddmu/oddmu.service.5">oddmu.service(5)</a>
for more.</p>

<p>By default, Oddmu tries to identify the language used on every page in
order to allow a style sheet to enable hyphenation for the correct
language. This is important for multi-lingual sites. The library used
detects over 70 languages. This takes memory and time. <strong>ODDMU_LANGUAGES</strong>
allows admins to reduce the number of languages taken into account.
This site, for example, only considers English and German.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.1">oddmu(1)</a> and <a href="oddmu/oddmu-templates.5">oddmu-templates(5)</a>
for more.</p>

<p>A pretty hairy feature is activated using <strong>ODDMU_FILTER</strong>.
Sometimes, subdirectories are separate sites. If you do not want to
include those sites in searches or archives of the whole site, you
need to identify them. The way to do this is via the environment
variable ODDMU_FILTER. It&rsquo;s value is a regular expression matching
separate sites. On this site, my dad&rsquo;s old site resides in such a subdirectory.
I use this environment variable to exclude &ldquo;his&rdquo; pages from searches made on
&ldquo;my&rdquo; pages.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu-filter.7">oddmu-filter(7)</a> for more.</p>

<p>And finally, since linking to fediverse accounts involves an outgoing Webfinger
lookup, this feature is disabled by default. You can switch it on by setting
<strong>ODDMU_WEBFINGER</strong> to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s what I do.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.5">oddmu(5)</a> for more.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Odd¬µ">#Odd¬µ</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-09-29</strong>. I really love the fact that I picked Markdown. If I miss something, I can just write HTML directly. And with the decision to use Markdown, all the Markdown writing from years on GitHub use stays relevant. There&rsquo;s no need to tinker with the code. That still surprises me.</p>

## The secret power of a blog

date: 2024-09-30, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

A &#8220;shit blog&#8221; is a thing of power. If you only write when you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll produce brilliance, you&#8217;ll never write. Blogs can help writers trick ourselves out of performance anxiety with lower stakes. As a tool, they&#8217;re deceptively simple: a blank text field grants you free rein, with the power to style and link [&#8230;]

## 2024-09-29 How do I feel about the MNT Pocket Reform?

date: 2024-09-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-29-how-do-i-feel-about-the-mnt-pocket-reform">2024-09-29 How do I feel about the MNT Pocket Reform?</h1>

<p>SpaceLizard asked: <a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/what-brought-you-to-the-mnt-community/2132">What brought you to the MNT community</a>?
Well, actually there were three questions:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>How did you first find out about MNT Reform and/or what brought you here?</li>
<li>What do you do / want to do with your Reform Laptop most?</li>
<li>Are cats or dogs better, (or robots)?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I said:</p>

<p>I learned about MNT Reform on fedi. I had bought a Purism laptop <a href="2017-12-23_New_Laptop">in 2017</a> and <a href="2018-06-08_Librem_13_by_Purism_Mini_Review">I wasn‚Äôt happy</a>. On a blog post <a href="2021-08-26_New_laptop%2C_again%E2%80%BD">in 2021</a> I mentioned the MNT Reform laptop for the first time. I mentioned the MNT Pocket Reform in 2022, <a href="2020-11-20_Small_computer">on a blog post from 2020</a>.</p>

<p>I still use the Purism laptop as my main laptop, but one of its hinges broke in 2021 and I needed something else to take on trips. That‚Äôs why I started looking for an extra small laptop. I wanted something that was energy efficient, that would allow me to use all my Debian stable tools for system administration, to write Perl code, to use Emacs, to browse the web using Firefox, to ssh into my server and do maintenance work from hotel rooms and the like. The MNT Pocket Reform landed on the list.</p>

<p>As it stands right now, I‚Äôm still using Debian testing but I‚Äôd love to make that switch to Debian stable one day. My secret idea is that I just have to wait and one day I‚Äôd be able to do it using /etc/apt/sources.list sorcery. I managed to switch from PureOS to Debian stable doing that, so I don‚Äôt doubt that there is a way to do it from Debian testing to Debian stable. Painfully, maybe, but doable.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd love for battery and wifi to be no problem. Right now, battery life is good enough for my evening sessions if I have to move to the couch, and wifi seems to be working fine now that summer is over. I have an ethernet connection for the Pocket Reform, however, and that‚Äôs very nice. The cable is 3m long or something. But in a hotel, wifi still works, as I said.</p>

<p>I recently had some emergency sysadmin stuff to do in the evenings while on holidays and the Pocket Reform did exactly what I needed it to do.</p>

<p>Finally, cats are bird murderers and dogs are our best friends. No question, dogs are better! But also, I don‚Äôt have time in my life for a dog, so I think I‚Äôll vote for little Internet people in my computers, on forums, IRC, Discord, Fedi, newsgroups and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Luckily, <a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@josch" title="@josch@floss.social">@josch</a> had some answers for me!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of doing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> sorcery in the future, you could replace ‚Äútesting‚Äù by ‚Äútrixie‚Äù today. That way, at the point in time where ‚Äútesting‚Äù becomes ‚Äústable‚Äù you do not need to edit your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. The updates and security mirrors also exist already for trixie but are of course empty but this means that you can also add those today already and have things set up for the future:</p>

<pre><code>deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie main
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie-updates main
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security trixie-security main
</code></pre>

<p>The one point of pain may be that after the trixie release, the MNT repositories will continue to build packages for unstable which will work for a while but will break after new uploads of glibc and friends. So in the future, you might want to switch out the MNT repo for the Debian stable repositories on <code>reform.debian.net</code> which are currently only serving packages for bookworm and not trixie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like great advice.</p>

There are a few unreleased products that use the same approach. The way we read the web hasn't received enough attention, we've been so focused on the twitter-like interfaces, forgetting that reading on a full page is important too. We've settled for a pretty awful way of reading. I want to fix writing too, and have plans for this, but I thought I should do some work on reading as well. I wish I could show you all the new ideas, but I'm saving that for a big reveal at some point.
