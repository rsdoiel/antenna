## How about those Mets, day 2

date: 2024-10-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I am reminded of 2015, when the Mets were so charmed -- they could be down 9-0 in the 8th inning and you would tune into the game to see how they'd win it. It's not the usual thing for the Mets, who pull defeat from the jaws of victory far more often than the other way. </p>
<p>And omg, 2024 is shaping up the same way. </p>
<p>Sit down and shut up, here come the Mets!</p>
<p>Briefly, because I have stuff to do -- the Mets were down 1-0 in the bottom of the 8th, having been thoroughly shut down by the amazing Zach Wheeler. Imagine someone throwing a ball at you at 100 mph that looks like it's going down but actually goes up and to the left. Or next time down and to the right. You could try to swing but you'd have to be very lucky to connect. And so it was for the first seven innings until they took out Wheeler (pitchers don't do complete games any longer, they used to). </p>
<p>The Mets were ready. Hit after hit after hit and before you knew it, it was 5-1. Alonso, the star of the last Milwaukee game drove in one of the runs with a long sacrifice fly to center.  </p>
<p>The Phillies and their fans who had been so confident of victory were shocked. And left to plan for today's game at 4PM on Fox. You gotta know where I'll be -- glued to the set and dreaming about the fate of this Mets team who shows real signs of strong <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mets+philosophy+site%3Ascripting.com">philosophy</a>. </p>

## WordPress destiny, day 2

date: 2024-10-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Glad I wrote the piece I wrote <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/05/142118.html?title=wordPressDestiny1">yesterday</a>. </p>
<p>I could have written it any time in the last year as I was investigating and developing on the WordPress API and back end, but now seemed to be a good time, with all the attention its getting, and Matt's interviews, I and others are getting a better idea of what the various components of the community are. I don't know about the rest of you, but I had only a vague idea of what WordPress is beyond a piece of software used for commerce and to a lesser extent these days, writing on the web.</p>
<p>A few ideas -- not in any particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>From my point of view, blogging and the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>, WordPress is being built <i>around</i> more than being built on, when it is such a <a href="https://textcasting.org/">potent</a> and surprisingly open <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+coral+reef">platform</a>. I took the time to look, and underneath the cluttered user interface is a strong foundation that you could build <i>any kind of writing software</i> on. </li>
<li>If a community developed at this level, writing tools, we'd be compatible at a very deep level, so the opportunities for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop">interop</a> are amazing. I don't say that lightly. (I had asked them to allow apps to attach their own data to posts for years, until I discovered earlier this year the API has that feature. If only they had listened to the question and answered it thoughtfully, we could have saved years. The company desperately needs an evangelism function.)</li>
<li>The WordPress platform could be a very strong part of the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">social web</a>. The comparison between developer freedom on the WordPress platform and the Facebook one (which is what Threads is built on) is stark. I have worked on the Facebook platform, btw -- and from a software design perspective it's brilliant, a breakthrough, something to emulate, which I did in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity">wpidentity</a> package I wrote. But from a policy standpoint, after the 2016 election Facebook's API was radically restricted, not something many people know about (it was a fully public event). WordPress has an API that doesn't appear to have any such limits, and even if they imposed them, in theory their server could be cloned (it's open source) but it certainly could be emulated at an API level. </li>
<li>It's enticing. All those users -- there should be a market for writing tools there, but there isn't. Why is that??</li>
<li>I feel like we're like ships passing in the night. I thought I should point this out, at least once, as Matt and company go off in a direction I don't understand and don't see why I should want to. Did they care when the move to HTTPS undermined what remains of the original blogosphere? I don't see any evidence of it. It's like Walmart sought to build a shopping center on the remains of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>. People don't seem to have any respect for independent writing on the web, what we dreamed of in the beginning, and <i>the dream was realized.</i> No wonder the tech industry wants to tear it down. It contradicts a basic premise of the programming priesthood. And no wonder journalism doesn't defend it, they are offended by the idea of people writing for free, based on the incorrect assumption about what we do. We're their sources, dammit, not their competitors, at least if they would do their jobs (which is another problem altogether) and if they spent any time thinking and questioning before condeming.</li>
<li> Look at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/05/the-blogosphere-is-in-full-bloom-the-rest-of-the-internet-has-wilted-dave-winer">John Naughton's piece</a> today in the Guardian. He's doing more to focus attention on the web as a writing environment than the whole tech industry which is built on our work, especially Automattic. The ignorance and in some cases resentment in the industry is huge, something else Naughton points out so well. We can turn this around, I guess since WordPress is open source, it doesn't have to wait for Matt to turn in that direction. </li>
</ul>
<p>Just some thoughts as the world seems to be converging on something, not sure what. There are so many doors that are now open that never were before, the question is -- do we have the courage to connect the dots and work together, or do we all insist on going our own ways to a fairly dark future.  </p>

## Geothermal power in the North Bay

date: 2024-10-05, from: Jonudell blog

I was aware of The Geysers, a geothermal field about 35 miles north of my home in Santa Rosa, but I never gave it much thought until my first bike ride through the area. Then I learned a number of interesting things. It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s largest geothermal field, producing more than 700 megawatts.

## A WordPress app ecosystem?

date: 2024-10-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A few years before WordPress came out, I did a product called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22radio+userland%22">Radio UserLand</a> which was a combination <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/15/024232.html?title=radioUserlandScreenShot">blogging tool</a> and feed reader. Two main screens, a streamlined UI. You could get in quickly, write and publish a post in a minute, and see it show up in the reader a moment later. It worked, and it added a major new component to the blogging world, and I think still represents the simplest most focused UI for writing. It was a really popular product. </p>
<p>The same idea, really simple blog post writing and editing, with all the <a href="https://textcasting.org/">features</a> that should be available to web writers, optional titles, links, simple styling, enclosures, the ability to edit. The things the common social web apps generally <i>don't</i> have. </p>
<p>This imho is a huge opportunity. I wish this is where the focus in the WordPress community was, but I think right now the world is building <i>around</i> WordPress, not on it. It could be great, it could totally solve the problem of a new document standard in the social web that makes it really like the web. Instead they're fighting over who owns what part of the WordPress trademark, at least as far as I can tell. </p>
<p>Last year I created a Node.js package called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wpIdentity">wpidentity</a> that acts as a bridge between a browser-based JavaScript app and the WordPress back-end, and the result is fine. It suggests that there could be a developer community writing apps that all join up in the middle in WordPress's database. Pretty powerful idea! </p>
<p>And I think the users, the writers, would love it, because we developers could <b>compete to delight them</b>, and not have to worry about building a huge server capability as Automattic already has debugged and scaled. And maybe the battle that's going on now could fade into the background.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-10-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I think a lot of confusion about AI products comes from the name. It's not clear what intelligence in humans is or how it works. We just believe it exists. So then the question is, can machines do the same thing? The truth is no one knows. It could be that human intelligence, once we figure out what it is, will be as trivial as they tell us the AI "intelligence" is. So if you're trying to make sense of it, or if the idea is offensive, try pretending that "intelligence" was "pomegranate" or "cauliflower" -- these are two terms <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JKoFCUaUbY">John Lennon</a> suggested George Harrison use in place of words in <a href="https://genius.com/The-beatles-something-lyrics">lyrics</a> he hasn't come up with. Say ChatGPT is "Artificial Cauliflower" and that should be less offensive, yes? It would make as much sense as calling it intelligence. On the other hand, conversation with my favorite Artificial Cauliflower app does feel pretty much exactly like conversing with a human. A very patient and very knowledgeable and intelligent (whatever that means) but not infallible human.

## How about those Mets!

date: 2024-10-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/04/caseyStengelMetsManager.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">We are a Mets family. Around the kitchen table in my childhood home, the default question was "What did the Mets do?" Before I was born we were a Brooklyn Dodgers family, always National League, but the Dodgers left shortly after I was born and the Mets came along when I was seven, and that was it for us. It was the one thing we all agreed on -- the Mets. Much later when my Mom and I would fight about something, a pretty regular thing -- I invented what I called <a href="https://hello.typepad.com/hello/2009/11/shea-stadium-rules.html">Shea Stadium Rules</a>, which meant that a disagreement could be tabled when we remember that underneath everything we are true Mets fans, and ultimately Mets fans can find something to agree on -- that rain or shine and there was plenty of rain, we always stood with our team. A deeper truth of the Mets was we didn't really mind when they lost. Because underneath it all at a whole other level, the Mets have a <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">philosophy</a> that is strong. We are the Mets and that's all you need to know. </p>
<p>Anyway, last night it wasn't lookin good. It was a winner-take-all game with the hated (for now) Milwaukee Brewers. We hated them because it looked like they were going to end the Mets season in the first round of the playoffs. I was getting ready to take off my Mets cap for the year, and put on my Knicks cap, when Lindor walked, then Nimmo singled, and with runners on first and third and one out, Pete Alonso comes to the plate. He's been cold all year. I hoped for a base hit or at least a long sacrifice fly to bring in the runner on third. I couldn't watch but forced myself to. And then <b>it happened</b>. </p>
<p>We who have been joined at the heart to this team and have been through it all, have come to expect failure, but sometimes winning happens, as it did last night. A big swing. The bat connects. Oh please let it land anywhere but the glove of a Brewer, and then all of a sudden Alonso is jogging around the bases, and delirium takes over, in the living room of my mountain home and everywhere Mets fans were at that fateful hour. </p>
<p>We figured at that point they might as well just retire the side, but the Metsies, who Casey Stengel, the first manager asked "Can't anyone play this stinkin game!" -- brought in another run, which it turns out we didn't need. </p>
<p>The Brewers were overwhelmed. They tried to score in the bottom of the ninth but the Mets <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+mets+philosophy">philosophy</a> was too strong.</p>
<p>It's like every baseball kid's fantasy -- the count is 3 and 2 ,the team's back is to the wall, up comes the slugger, the crowd is silent and then he hits it <b>out of the park</b> and the team emerges victorious and the young person's fantasy saves the day. We've all been there, many times. Last night we got to live it, again, this time for real. </p>
<p>And now we go to Philadelphia to give them a proper dose of New York love. </p>
<p>Meet the Mets meet the Mets, step right up and greet the Mets, etc. </p>
<p>Game 1 of the NLDS begins tomorrow at 4PM. Good times will be had by all (except Philadelphia fans of course).</p>
<p>PS: This wasn't <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/10/08/baseballCanTeachUsAboutLif.html#p9">Mookie</a> in <a href="https://baseballhall.org/discover-more/stories/whole-new-ballgame/new-york-mets-1986-world-series">game 6 </a>of the 1986 World Series, but it was along those lines of improbability.</p>
<p>PPS: I love that they give a realtime readout on screen of the probability of each team winning. At the top of the ninth, before all the michegas, the Mets had only a 6% chance of winning. I think every game should come with a graph over time of this stat. It would be an emotional map, much more interesting than the other stats.</p>

Former Republican representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming joined Vice President Kamala Harris on a stage hung with red, white, and blue bunting and signs that said &#8220;Country Over Party.&#8221; As Cheney took the stage, the crowd chanted, &#8220;Thank you, Liz!&#8221; The two were on the campaign trail today in Ripon, Wisconsin, the town that claims to be the birthplace of the Republican Party.

## What is a writing portal?

date: 2024-10-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>So far we've only created reading portals. What I want for myself and for you, is a writing portal. </p>
<ul>
<li>A reading portal brings a lot of writers together so you can read them all in one place.</li>
<li>A writing portal is the same idea but in reverse. I write in my portal, and it flows where ever I want it to.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is the reading portals aren't open to allow this to work.</p>
<p>They all want you to write in their <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text boxes</a>.</p>

You could register as an independent blogger, and push your writing up to their cloud in real time. And then readers could ask what experts on <i>whatever</i> think about <i>what just happened</i> and it would know what your expertise is, and it could build the report also in realtime, in response to a very detailed question you could ask. And you could tell it whether or not you want lies, or if they should omit the lies. Personally I would opt out of the lies, but some people like lies in their news, kind of like menthol in cigarettes. And forget about paying the news orgs. They don't give you a way to opt out of the lies.

## AI deflates the value of expertise

date: 2024-10-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I didn't read the WSJ story about the deflation of expertise, quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla">Vinod Khosla</a>, Silicon Valley venture capitalist, who I know from my time in California. He says AI leads to a deflation of expertise. I agree with him, AI absolutely deflates the value of expertise. </p>
<p>It aggregates all of our knowledge in one place where it's easy to access, about anything you want to know. It answers questions that you can't get any other way. </p>
<p>Some technological developments are profound. We never understand all the implications of a new technology when it comes online, but you do get some strong clues. You have to use it to know learn how to think about it. That's not unreasonable because we all grew up in a world that didn't have this technology, as my parents grew up in a world without television, and I didn't use a computer until I was 18 or use the web until I was 37. None of us grew up with anything but fiction about AI, and the fiction imho didn't grasp the implications very well.  </p>
<p>If I ask good questions ChatGPT stretches my mind in ways it never has been stretched before and I'm well educated and in my work have explored frontiers of knowledge, even so -- this is the most mind-stretching experience I've ever had. Not kidding. And I'm not a VC or prone to overhyping tech. </p>

## Weird Zimbra Vulnerability

date: 2024-10-03, updated: 2024-10-03, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Hackers can execute commands on a remote computer by sending <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/attackers-exploit-critical-vulnerability-recently-patched-in-zimbra-servers/">malformed emails</a> to a Zimbra mail server. It&#8217;s critical, but difficult to exploit.</p>
<blockquote><p>In an email sent Wednesday afternoon, Proofpoint researcher Greg Lesnewich seemed to largely concur that the attacks weren&#8217;t likely to lead to mass infections that could install ransomware or espionage malware. The researcher provided the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>While the exploitation attempts we have observed were indiscriminate in targeting, we haven&#8217;t seen a large volume of exploitation attempts
<li>Based on what we have researched and observed, exploitation of this vulnerability is very easy, but we do not have any information about how reliable the exploitation is

## How I Use This Site

date: 2024-10-03, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>I wanted to write a blog post with some thoughts I&rsquo;ve been having about how I&rsquo;ve been using this site in recent times, and how that&rsquo;s likely to change (or not) in the short to medium-term. Basically, as you may have noticed, I&rsquo;ve been posting much less this year (and even last year) than I used to, in the early years of me having this site. There are a couple of reasons for that, which mainly boil down to me just not being in a frame of mind to blog so much. I&rsquo;ve been pregnant for most of the year, which has sapped me of a lot of the energy I used to have. I also kind of don&rsquo;t want to blog about being pregnant all the time, but it&rsquo;s been such a big thing going on in my life that it&rsquo;s like I have no ideas for anything else to blog about! It&rsquo;s just&hellip; a weird time. What else can I say?</p>
<p>Another thing that&rsquo;s been going on is that I&rsquo;ve been posting much more <a href="https://toot.cat/jayeless" title="my Mastodon profile">on Mastodon<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> in the first instance, and then copying posts back here ‚Äì often in a big batch ‚Äì when I find the energy at some point down the line. In <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/indieweb.html">IndieWeb</a> parlance, I&rsquo;ve been <abbr title="Post Elsewhere, Syndicate on Own Site">PESOS</abbr>ing, not <abbr title="Post on Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere">POSSE</abbr>ing (and often, like I say, significantly after I first posted the posts on Mastodon). I feel like the whole &ldquo;IndieWeb&rdquo; approach to online socialising, which appealed to me so much when I first came across the idea, worked really well for so long as I had the enthusiasm to keep up with janky multi-step publication workflows&hellip; but as time has gone on, it&rsquo;s come to feel like a hassle. It&rsquo;s so much <em>easier</em> to post on Mastodon than it is to post on my own site, especially from my phone. I do have an <a href="https://getindiekit.com/">Indiekit<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> server which is <em>supposed</em> to make posting on this site just as hassle-free, but see &ldquo;janky multi-step publication workflows&rdquo;&hellip; it&rsquo;s not the fault of Indiekit itself but it feels like there&rsquo;s <em>always</em> some reason why it doesn&rsquo;t work. The server (deployed on fly.io) crashes for no good reason. The authentication to GitLab somehow breaks. I make a mistake not escaping an apostrophe in an image&rsquo;s alt text and then the Hugo rebuild fails and I can&rsquo;t fix it until I get back on my computer. Considering I feel like the vast majority of people who read my posts read them via Mastodon anyway, I just can&rsquo;t be bothered any more! There are some things I do post here exclusively (mainly link posts), or here simultaneously with Mastodon, but I can only do that from my computer, which I&rsquo;m not using 100% of the time. Otherwise it&rsquo;s a lot easier to post first there, and use this site to archive those posts.</p>
<p>And I mean, as I suggested, I am currently <em>very</em> pregnant. I&rsquo;m anticipating that once Baby is here, an even larger proportion of the &ldquo;internet time&rdquo; that I have will be via my phone, rather than via my computer, and I&rsquo;ll probably have less &ldquo;internet time&rdquo; overall too. So&hellip; that suggests to me that I&rsquo;m not going to get back to using this site as a &ldquo;home base&rdquo;, and <abbr title="Post on Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere">POSSE</abbr>ing out from here, any time soon.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;giving up&rdquo; on having a personal site, by any means. Certainly, even if I do post first on Mastodon, I like that archiving posts here means I&rsquo;m way more able to find them again later. If I want to browse all the Gidget pics I&rsquo;ve posted, or the thoughts I&rsquo;ve posted about pretty much any specific topic, I can do so using the tag archive pages here (or the search function). Mastodon makes it a lot harder to browse old posts. Mastodon is also not a place to post full-length blog posts (like this one) so if and when I have one of those to put out there, those&rsquo;ll be going up here first. I also like having a <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/">personal wiki</a> (even if I&rsquo;ve found that pages on anything topical are freaking impossible to keep updated), dedicated &ldquo;sections&rdquo; for link posts and book reviews, the ability to create alternate language versions to further my <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/international-auxiliary-language.html">auxlanging</a> hobby, and so forth&hellip; I mean, I could solve a lot of my own problems by migrating back to <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> if all I wanted was a blog (micro + macro combined), but I like having the freedom to keep adding stuff to this site beyond the standard blog posts.

(That said, the <em>bad</em> thing about Hugo is that sometimes a new version of Hugo itself comes out that fucks up something I&rsquo;ve been doing with this website. That&rsquo;s generally not fun to try to resolve when I&rsquo;m lacking the energy for website workflow debugging in the first place. So, I have to be careful not to cavalierly run <code>brew upgrade</code> on my computer unless I&rsquo;m prepared to risk losing the ability to locally preview stuff, haha.) So you know, this post isn&rsquo;t really to say I&rsquo;m going to be changing anything about this site. It&rsquo;s more to acknowledge the way I&rsquo;ve already been using it, over the last few months.</p>
<p>I do wish the IndieWeb would be <em>easier</em> for people who aren&rsquo;t professional-tier web developers who can code their own <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>es and admin their own servers. Or maybe I&rsquo;m just in an awkward place where my wants are too &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; for a ready-made solution like Micro.blog but I also don&rsquo;t have the skills (or consistent enthusiasm) to maintain something bespoke. And honestly, I feel like I&rsquo;m seeing this loss of enthusiasm among other &ldquo;IndieWeb but not diehards about it&rdquo; people that I used to follow on Micro.blog&hellip; and still do follow on Micro.blog, technically, but I so rarely even open my Micro.blog timeline any more (instead following Micro.blog accounts on Mastodon, if not the person&rsquo;s Mastodon account). People are using federated social media more, and trying other blogging platforms like <a href="https://bearblog.dev">Bear<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> and <a href="https://pika.page">Pika<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a> (or continuing with their own blogging setups like me, but pulling away from more specific &ldquo;IndieWeb&rdquo; stuff like <abbr title="Post on Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere">POSSE</abbr>ing or webmentions).

## On the SGI again (for a moment)

date: 2024-10-03, from: Jirka's blog

I'm  writing  this   post  on  my  SGI  O2.  Why?   Because  it's  more distraction-free environment (no https so almost no "Internet" at all). It makes some things harder, however. Wikipedia searches are limited to the gopher interface and so on.

It has been pointed out that this blog will be 30 years old on <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/10/07.html">October 7</a>, not October 10, as I had previously reported.

It's pretty short. We knew what we were doing. We loved what RSS did for news. Now we were doing the same for radio. Not just talking about it, but finally -- doing it. It worked, pretty freaking well. There's a podcast episode to go with it, coming out shortly.

## 2024-10-02 Control the ssh login messages

<h1 id="2024-10-02-control-the-ssh-login-messages">2024-10-02 Control the ssh login messages</h1>

<p>I found that the settings in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> had no effect.
Namely, <code>PrintLastLog no</code> and <code>PrintMotd no</code>.</p>

<p>Instead, what helped was to edit <code>/etc/pam.d/sshd</code> and comment the first line (to get rid of the <code>uname -a</code> stuff identifying the system). I kept the second line because <code>/etc/motd</code> just says &ldquo;This is the server.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code># session    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic                                                          
session    optional     pam_motd.so noupdate
</code></pre>

<p>I got rid of the <code>fish</code> greeting by using <code>set -U fish_greeting &quot;&quot;</code> ‚Äì although using <code>set -U fish_greeting &quot;üêü&quot;</code> would be a cute alternative. üòÑ</p>

<h4>Now that's the kind of stability we like</h4>

<p>I wrote myself the following <code>fish</code> function that uses <a href="https://jdhao.github.io/2021/01/05/nvim_copy_from_remote_via_osc52/">OSC 52 as explained by jdhao</a> in order to copy text from within a <code>ssh</code> session into the local (client-side) clipboard.
OSC stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#OSC">Operating System Command</a>.</p>

<pre><code>function ssh-copy --description 'Copy text to the local clipboard'
    read -z -l input
    printf &quot;\033]52;c;&quot;
    printf &quot;%s&quot; $input | base64
    printf &quot;\a&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>I need to install this for every remote account, of course, because it has to exist on the remote end.
Use <code>funced --save ssh-copy</code> to do it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of how to use it:</p>

<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ssh sibirocobombus
This is the server.
You have new mail.
alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; echo hello | ssh-copy
alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; exit
Connection to alexschroeder.ch closed.
alex@melanobombus ~&gt; wl-paste
hello

</code></pre>

<p><code>wl-paste</code> and <code>wl-copy</code> are from the <code>wl-clipboard</code> package for Wayland.</p>

## California AI Safety Bill Vetoed

date: 2024-10-02, updated: 2024-10-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Governor Newsom has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/california-governor-vetoes-controversial-ai-safety-bill/">vetoed</a> the state&#8217;s AI safety bill.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/from-sci-fi-to-state-law-californias-plan-to-prevent-ai-catastrophe/">bill</a>. There&#8217;s a lot to like about it, and I want governments to regulate in this space. But, for now, it&#8217;s all <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/">EU</a>.</p>
<p>(Related, the Council of Europe <a href="https://rm.coe.int/1680afae3c">treaty on AI</a> is <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/-/council-of-europe-opens-first-ever-global-treaty-on-ai-for-signature">ready for signature</a>. It&#8217;ll be legally binding when signed, and it&#8217;s a big deal.)</p>

## 2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China

date: 2024-10-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-18-emacs-wiki-and-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</h1>

<p><strong>2024-09-14</strong>. I&rsquo;m somewhere in the Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland with my wife. There is a lot of running, hiking, hugging, kissing, eating and drinking involved. ü•∞</p>

<p><strong>2024-09-15</strong>. Still on the trip but late at night I spent more than an hour trying to figure out why my server had a load of nearly 40. üíª</p>

<p>All I discovered is that load went down when I shut down Emacs Wiki. See also <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/2024-09-16">2024-09-16</a> on Emacs Wiki.</p>

<p>Well, I needed to sleep and I‚Äòve got plans for the next few days so I shut it down while I slept hoping that the misconfigured spider is fixed or the inept programmer discovers their mistake. Just another day in the Butlerian Jihad. Some misguided soul probably wanted to download it all and wrote a broken web crawler and when that got blocked they bought some nice scaling infrastructure from Amazon, Hetzner, OHV or Alibaba Cloud or whatever they are called, allowing them to use a gazillion different IP numbers that will eventually lead me to implement some sort of cloud service provider block.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-09-15-emacs-china.png" alt="Load shoots up to nearly 40 around midnight. The graph is for an entire week so the peaks are not shown. It just goes up to 30 multiple times." /></p>

<p><strong>2024-09-16</strong>. Switched Emacs Wiki back on after a few hours of sleep and it did fine. But then it restarted again&hellip; at 18:00, 19:00, 21:00, 22:00&hellip; and so I switched Emacs Wiki off again. Time to ban some networks!</p>

<p>Anybody interested in my banning of IP ranges and possibly interested in me reverting any of these, take a look at <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> &hellip; from a network that isn&rsquo;t banned, I guess. üòè</p>

<p><strong>2024-09-17</strong>. This continues to keep me busy and angry every evening. Too bad I don&rsquo;t have a real fast <a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a> to firewall ban pipeline. I&rsquo;m using this script instead of carefully checking IP numbers and networks. I&rsquo;m also sick and tired of the same networks popping up again and again.</p>

<p>I added over a hundred Chinese networks to the firewall rules and I&rsquo;m seriously considering blocking the whole country for a week. It seems that most of the offenders are networks run by China Telecoms and China Mobile.</p>

<p><strong>2024-09-18</strong>. So far, so good. Load stays below two.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s example usage for <code>network-lookup</code>, filtering for Emacs Wiki and a URL parameter used when requesting recent changes or a RSS feed for a single page only. That would count as suspicious misbehaving crawler behaviour in my book.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, all deserve to be banned. Over-banning? Maybe. What do you think?</p>

<p>For demonstration purposes, this is what I ran:</p>

<pre><code>ssh sibirocobombus.root grep '&quot;^www.emacswiki.org.*rcidonly&quot;' /var/log
/apache2/access.log \
| tail -n 20 \
| ssh sibirocobombus.root bin/admin/network-lookup \
| wl-copy
</code></pre>

<p>So now I&rsquo;m ready to ban them all:</p>

<pre><code>wl-paste | grep ipset
</code></pre>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Emacs">#Emacs</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Administration">#Administration</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-10-01</strong>. Today I came back to the server with load at 40. Again! Here&rsquo;s me filtering the log for requests that got a server error status code (500‚Äì509).</p>

<pre><code>root@sibirocobombus ~# tail -n 20000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
| grep -v ^social \
| grep &quot; 50[0-9] &quot; \
| tail -n 50 \
| bin/admin/network-lookup
Made 44 DNS requests.
6 cache hits.
</code></pre>

<p>I think the only one I didn&rsquo;t ban was the unknown one, Gwene and Bing (Microsoft).</p>

## Cross-posting

date: 2024-10-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Cross-posting is here now. I am not surprised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/croissant-debuts-a-cross-posting-app-for-threads-bluesky-and-mastodon/">Croissant</a> is getting such a positive reception. </p>
<p>That is where the fediverse will be defined imho, in the intersection between the competing social web services. </p>
<p>You'll know it's working when they feel they have to match each others' features because with cross-posting their difference in character limits, titles, styling, links etc will be much more visible. </p>
<p>Activitypub is too much. Cross-posting is exactly right and here now.</p>

I had a dream last night with many of my dead relatives present. We were at some kind of social event. My grandfather had a new wife or girlfriend, but he didn't recognize me, though he pretended to. My mother was far off in the distance taking pictures. I wonder what that means. Some of them <i>were</i> dead and gone. I had to remind myself of that. Meanwhile both my parents were alive and being themselves. (Heh.) My subconscious has a clear idea of who they are/were, only it doesn't register that some of them are gone.

If one of them did, we could start curated lists of feeds put together by smart people and influencers. The first podcast client that did this would open up the market, and stand out from the pack. I've been <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/06/29/twoSuggestionsForPodcastCl.html">asking</a> for this from the inception of podcasting twenty years ago. I had it in my first podcatcher. It would be great if one of the popular clients of today adopted the idea. Happy to help.

## Hacking ChatGPT by Planting False Memories into Its Data

date: 2024-10-01, updated: 2024-09-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>This vulnerability hacks a feature that allows ChatGPT to have long-term memory, where it uses information from past conversations to inform future conversations with that same user. A researcher <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/false-memories-planted-in-chatgpt-give-hacker-persistent-exfiltration-channel/">found</a> that he could use that feature to plant &#8220;false memories&#8221; into that context window that could subvert the model.</p>
<blockquote><p>A month later, the researcher submitted a new disclosure statement. This time, he included a PoC that caused the ChatGPT app for macOS to send a verbatim copy of all user input and ChatGPT output to a server of his choice. All a target needed to do was instruct the LLM to view a web link that hosted a malicious image. From then on, all input and output to and from ChatGPT was sent to the attacker&#8217;s website...</p></blockquote>

The University had a pre-release copy of Ubuntu MATE 14.10, along with a podcast from Alan Pope and Martin Wimpress, and before I could turn around I had it on my Asus.

Getting in touch with some medical friends, they were concerned she&rsquo;d had a heart attack. This was near the mark: she had contracted a virus which had destroyed a third of her heart muscle. It took her a few years to die, and a miserable time it was for her and for us both. After the funeral, I had rented out my house and bought a Toyota motor home, and I began traveling around the country. I ran my Asus through a solar panel hooked up to an inverter, a system which worked well and kept the beast going.</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:7pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;">After a couple of years, I decided to have a look around Australia.

## When Radio Delivers

date: 2024-09-30, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Helene was Western North Carolina&#8216;s Katrina‚Äîespecially for the counties surrounding Asheville: Buncombe, Mitchell, Henderson, McDowell, Rutherford, Haywood, Yancey, Burke, and some adjacent ones in North Carolina and Tennessee. As with Katrina, the issue wasn&#8217;t wind. It was flooding, especially along creeks and rivers. Most notably destructive was the French Broad River, which runs through Asheville. [&#8230;]

## Post flow

A watershed* is land that drains through a river to the sea or into an inland body of water. That&#8217;s what came to mind for me when I read this from Dave Winer: If you want to help the open web, when you write something you‚Äôre proud of on a social web site like Bluesky [&#8230;]

And finally, if I were the czar of ActivityPub, I'd add Markdown support to the spec because it ain't the web if you can't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">link</a> in your writing. Maybe even invent some new kinds of links, after all it's been <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web">35 years</a> since the first web was invented.

## AI and the 2024 US Elections

date: 2024-09-30, updated: 2024-10-03, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>For years now, AI has undermined the public&#8217;s ability to trust what it sees, hears, and reads. The <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/04/ai-generated-political-ads-election-candidate-voter-interaction-transparency/673893/">Republican National Committee</a> released a provocative ad offering an &#8220;AI-generated look into the country&#8217;s possible future if Joe Biden is re-elected,&#8221; showing apocalyptic, machine-made images of ruined cityscapes and chaos at the border. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-robocall-new-hampshire-strategist-rcna139760">Fake robocalls</a> purporting to be from Biden urged New Hampshire residents not to vote in the 2024 primary election.

Late Friday night, Tennessee House Republican Caucus chair Jeremy Faison posted &#8220;President Biden has finally approved [Tennessee governor Bill Lee&#8217;s] state of emergency request,&#8221; making it sound as if the delay in federal support for the state during the devastation of Hurricane Helene was Biden&#8217;s fault.

## 2024-09-29 Configuring Odd¬µ via environment variables

date: 2024-09-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-29-configuring-odd¬µ-via-environment-variables">2024-09-29 Configuring Odd¬µ via environment variables</h1>

<p><a href="Odd%C2%B5">Odd¬µ</a> replaced <a href="Oddmuse">Oddmuse</a> as my preferred wiki software.</p>

<ol>
<li>Odd¬µ is a <strong>wiki</strong> ‚Äì a website that can be edited on the web, using a regular web browser on my phone, for example. Only I get to edit the wiki these days and there is no way to leave a comment. Send me an email, instead. I love getting email! üòç</li>
<li>Odd¬µ is a <strong>static site generator</strong> (SSG) so that I can in theory write a bunch of Markdown files locally, run Odd¬µ and upload the result to the web. The reason I don&rsquo;t use it like that is that this disables online search. If you don&rsquo;t need online search or you&rsquo;re using some other software to handle it, static files are a great option. Static files are also a great option if you need to archive or export the whole site for offline viewing. Anybody will be able to browse the HTML files offline.</li>
</ol>

<p>Odd¬µ reacts to changes made as it runs, so I can edit the Markdown files remotely, using ssh and my favourite editor or I can edit the Markdown files locally and sync them with the server and the pages Odd¬µ serves reflect those changes immediately, no restart required. Earlier versions required a restart so that Odd¬µ would update its in-memory indexes of page names and titles.</p>

<p>Odd¬µ is also a program that doesn&rsquo;t take a config file. Oddmuse, its predecessor, was designed to be hackable. There were a gazillion options to set. You could hook into the parser and add new rules, add new actions, add new meta data, and on and on. The drawback was an incredible lock-in. After twenty years, I started to feel it: it was hard to remove features for any specific wiki because its pages used a markup that was incompatible with everything else. The sources files ended up being tied to the config files and the modules used.</p>

<p>Some of my Oddmuse wikis used the old <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Usemod_Markup_Extension">UseMod markup</a>. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used the newer <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Creole_Markup_Extension">Wiki Creole markup</a> that some wiki engine authors wanted to push <a href="2006-09-04_Wiki_Creole">back in 2006</a>. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used their own <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Markup_Extension">eclectic markup mix</a>. Some of my Oddmuse wikis used <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/Markdown_Rule_Extension">Markdown</a>. For a while I even added <a href="Gemtext">Gemtext</a> to the mix! I didn&rsquo;t like this incompatibility between sites and sometimes even between old and new pages on the same site. This is why Odd¬µ only does Markdown with three minimal extensions: hashtags, wiki links and fedi account links.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.5">oddmu(5)</a> for more.</p>

<p>Odd¬µ generates HTML using templates so there is no need for options to control the HTML output. If you want it changed, edit the templates.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu-templates.5">oddmu-templates(5)</a> for more.</p>

<p>Odd¬µ doesn&rsquo;t know anything about users, passwords and permissions. If you want authentication and authorization (which you do, if your wiki is public), then you need to configure your webserver to ask for passwords and restrict access accordingly.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu-apache.5">oddmu-apache(5)</a> and <a href="oddmu/oddmu-nginx.5">oddmu-nginx(5)</a> for more.</p>

<p>Over time, however, I did add a few configuration options to Odd¬µ.
This happens via environment variables.</p>

<p>When stdin is a socket, Odd¬µ reads requests from it instead of listening
on port. This allows for systemd-style socket activation. This is what
I use at the moment. Otherwise, it listens on
the address from <strong>ODDMU_ADDRESS</strong> and the port from <strong>ODDMU_PORT</strong>.
ODDMU_ADDRESS may be either an IPV4 address or an IPv6 address. If
ODDMU_ADDRESS is unspecified, then the listener listens on all
available unicast addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6. If ODDMU_PORT is
unspecified, it listens on port 8080.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.1">oddmu(1)</a> and <a href="oddmu/oddmu.service.5">oddmu.service(5)</a>
for more.</p>

<p>By default, Oddmu tries to identify the language used on every page in
order to allow a style sheet to enable hyphenation for the correct
language. This is important for multi-lingual sites. The library used
detects over 70 languages. This takes memory and time. <strong>ODDMU_LANGUAGES</strong>
allows admins to reduce the number of languages taken into account.
This site, for example, only considers English and German.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.1">oddmu(1)</a> and <a href="oddmu/oddmu-templates.5">oddmu-templates(5)</a>
for more.</p>

<p>A pretty hairy feature is activated using <strong>ODDMU_FILTER</strong>.
Sometimes, subdirectories are separate sites. If you do not want to
include those sites in searches or archives of the whole site, you
need to identify them. The way to do this is via the environment
variable ODDMU_FILTER. It&rsquo;s value is a regular expression matching
separate sites. On this site, my dad&rsquo;s old site resides in such a subdirectory.
I use this environment variable to exclude &ldquo;his&rdquo; pages from searches made on
&ldquo;my&rdquo; pages.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu-filter.7">oddmu-filter(7)</a> for more.</p>

<p>And finally, since linking to fediverse accounts involves an outgoing Webfinger
lookup, this feature is disabled by default. You can switch it on by setting
<strong>ODDMU_WEBFINGER</strong> to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s what I do.
See <a href="oddmu/oddmu.5">oddmu(5)</a> for more.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Odd¬µ">#Odd¬µ</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-09-29</strong>. I really love the fact that I picked Markdown. If I miss something, I can just write HTML directly. And with the decision to use Markdown, all the Markdown writing from years on GitHub use stays relevant. There&rsquo;s no need to tinker with the code. That still surprises me.</p>

## The secret power of a blog

date: 2024-09-30, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

A &#8220;shit blog&#8221; is a thing of power. If you only write when you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll produce brilliance, you&#8217;ll never write. Blogs can help writers trick ourselves out of performance anxiety with lower stakes. As a tool, they&#8217;re deceptively simple: a blank text field grants you free rein, with the power to style and link [&#8230;]

## 2024-09-29 How do I feel about the MNT Pocket Reform?

date: 2024-09-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-09-29-how-do-i-feel-about-the-mnt-pocket-reform">2024-09-29 How do I feel about the MNT Pocket Reform?</h1>

<p>SpaceLizard asked: <a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/what-brought-you-to-the-mnt-community/2132">What brought you to the MNT community</a>?
Well, actually there were three questions:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>How did you first find out about MNT Reform and/or what brought you here?</li>
<li>What do you do / want to do with your Reform Laptop most?</li>
<li>Are cats or dogs better, (or robots)?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I said:</p>

<p>I learned about MNT Reform on fedi. I had bought a Purism laptop <a href="2017-12-23_New_Laptop">in 2017</a> and <a href="2018-06-08_Librem_13_by_Purism_Mini_Review">I wasn‚Äôt happy</a>. On a blog post <a href="2021-08-26_New_laptop%2C_again%E2%80%BD">in 2021</a> I mentioned the MNT Reform laptop for the first time. I mentioned the MNT Pocket Reform in 2022, <a href="2020-11-20_Small_computer">on a blog post from 2020</a>.</p>

<p>I still use the Purism laptop as my main laptop, but one of its hinges broke in 2021 and I needed something else to take on trips. That‚Äôs why I started looking for an extra small laptop. I wanted something that was energy efficient, that would allow me to use all my Debian stable tools for system administration, to write Perl code, to use Emacs, to browse the web using Firefox, to ssh into my server and do maintenance work from hotel rooms and the like. The MNT Pocket Reform landed on the list.</p>

<p>As it stands right now, I‚Äôm still using Debian testing but I‚Äôd love to make that switch to Debian stable one day. My secret idea is that I just have to wait and one day I‚Äôd be able to do it using /etc/apt/sources.list sorcery. I managed to switch from PureOS to Debian stable doing that, so I don‚Äôt doubt that there is a way to do it from Debian testing to Debian stable. Painfully, maybe, but doable.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd love for battery and wifi to be no problem. Right now, battery life is good enough for my evening sessions if I have to move to the couch, and wifi seems to be working fine now that summer is over. I have an ethernet connection for the Pocket Reform, however, and that‚Äôs very nice. The cable is 3m long or something. But in a hotel, wifi still works, as I said.</p>

<p>I recently had some emergency sysadmin stuff to do in the evenings while on holidays and the Pocket Reform did exactly what I needed it to do.</p>

<p>Finally, cats are bird murderers and dogs are our best friends. No question, dogs are better! But also, I don‚Äôt have time in my life for a dog, so I think I‚Äôll vote for little Internet people in my computers, on forums, IRC, Discord, Fedi, newsgroups and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Luckily, <a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@josch" title="@josch@floss.social">@josch</a> had some answers for me!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of doing <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> sorcery in the future, you could replace ‚Äútesting‚Äù by ‚Äútrixie‚Äù today. That way, at the point in time where ‚Äútesting‚Äù becomes ‚Äústable‚Äù you do not need to edit your <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. The updates and security mirrors also exist already for trixie but are of course empty but this means that you can also add those today already and have things set up for the future:</p>

<pre><code>deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie main
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian trixie-updates main
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security trixie-security main
</code></pre>

<p>The one point of pain may be that after the trixie release, the MNT repositories will continue to build packages for unstable which will work for a while but will break after new uploads of glibc and friends. So in the future, you might want to switch out the MNT repo for the Debian stable repositories on <code>reform.debian.net</code> which are currently only serving packages for bookworm and not trixie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like great advice.</p>

There are a few unreleased products that use the same approach. The way we read the web hasn't received enough attention, we've been so focused on the twitter-like interfaces, forgetting that reading on a full page is important too. We've settled for a pretty awful way of reading. I want to fix writing too, and have plans for this, but I thought I should do some work on reading as well. I wish I could show you all the new ideas, but I'm saving that for a big reveal at some point.
