## Trump’s welcome SALT switch: Restore the tax break back to what it was

date: 2024-09-23, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Donald Trump is a late convert to restoring the federal income tax deduction of state and local taxes (SALT) that were capped at $10,000 when he signed his big Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2018. But Trump&#8217;s support is still most welcome and his fellow Republicans in Congress should follow his lead. The current law is simply unfair, putting an extra burden on people in states like New York. </p>

## Visit artsy, urban Antwerp

				<p>Belgium&#8217;s capital, Brussels, is undeniably a great place to get a feel for modern-day Europe.

My favorite place to feel the pulse of modern Belgium is Antwerp, the port city north of Brussels. It&#8217;s an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place with a true sense of local identity.</p>
