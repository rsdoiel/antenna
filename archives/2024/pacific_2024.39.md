But Trump&#8217;s support is still most welcome and his fellow Republicans in Congress should follow his lead. The current law is simply unfair, putting an extra burden on people in states like New York. </p>

## Visit artsy, urban Antwerp

date: 2024-09-22, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Belgium&#8217;s capital, Brussels, is undeniably a great place to get a feel for modern-day Europe. But as the capital of the EU it&#8217;s an international hub that doesn&#8217;t give you a sense of Belgium per se. My favorite place to feel the pulse of modern Belgium is Antwerp, the port city north of Brussels. It&#8217;s an honest, what-you-see-is-what-you-get place with a true sense of local identity.</p>
