## Silver nanoparticles loaded with pomegranate peel extract and hyaluronic acid mediate recovery of cutaneous wounds infected with Candida albicans

date: 2024-11-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Smart innovative nanocomposites based on active ingredients and metallic nanoparticles with effective wound healing and antifungal properties are efficient in overcoming the limitations of traditional therapeutic products. Open wounds provide an ideal niche for colonization by Candida albicans (C. albicans) which poses substantial global health issues owing to delayed wound healing and disordered healing mechanisms. Therefore, proficient innovative therapies that control C. albicans infection and promote wound healing are of imperative importance for the management of wounds and prevention of infection and possible complications. This study aims to design a novel nanocarrier platform based on a hydrogel loaded with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and doped with pomegranate peel extract (PPE) and hyaluronic acid (HA), offering an unprecedented opportunity to achieve skin repair and manage C. albicans colonization with an efficient wound healing process. Sprague-Dawley rats (n=100) were assigned to 5 groups and infected with C. albicans and distributed as follows: control positive (untreated) and four cutaneous wound-healing model groups treated topically with commercial cream and PPE-HA-AgNPs at full, 50%, and 25% concentrations for 15 days, respectively. Our findings revealed that the severity of clinical signs, C. albicans burden, and the expression of biofilm-related genes ALS1, HYR1, and PLB1 were diminished following treatment with PPE-HA-AgNPsIII. Notably, the formulated nanocomposite was very effective in extending the release of PPE-HA-AgNPs in infected wounds with retention percentages of 65.4% for PPE-HA-AgNPsIII. Topical administration of PPE-HA-AgNPsIII successfully alleviated the extensive inflammatory response and healed wounded skin via downregulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 and IL-1 beta, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) levels as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. Interestingly, PPE-HA-AgNPsIII modulated angiogenic and wound healing markers as evidenced by the downregulation of MMP-9 and the upregulation of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (up to 10 days post-treatment), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), bFGF, EGF, Ki-67, and collagen I and III with efficient wound closure capability. This was evidenced by the lessening of histopathological severity, which accelerated the healing of the infected skin wounds post-treatment with PPE-HA-AgNPs. Overall, our formulated PPE-HA-AgNPs provide an effective innovative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cutaneous wounds infected with C. albicans with maximized wound healing efficacy, indicating their potential in clinical practice.

## Inflammation and immune response in the development of periodontal disease: a narrative review

date: 2024-11-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

We present this critical review with the aim of highlighting the current status of periodontal diseases, focusing on the relevance of host modulating agents and immune pathways, in addition to new complementary therapeutic approaches for the treatment of these pathologies. Periodontal diseases are prevalent pathologies worldwide and the main cause of edentulism in the adult population. Their pathogenesis seems to be based on a dysbiosis of the oral microbiota that interacts with the host’s immune defenses and is responsible for the inflammatory/immune response, which would be modified by a number of conditions such as individual susceptibility, environmental and sociodemographic factors, certain systemic pathologies and the individual’s genetic condition, among others. Numerous studies have reported on the complex web of inflammatory mediators in periodontal disease and their role in tissue destruction as well as in homeostatic imbalance. Precisely, the role of epigenetics as a modifier of the host genetic condition has captured research attention in recent years. Therefore, this mini-review first discusses an updated etiological hypothesis of periodontal disease and the roles of certain cytokines in the immune response. In addition, the latest therapeutic trends with new developments and future perspectives are summarized.

## ZIKV prM hijacks PIM1 kinase for phosphorylation to prevent ubiquitin−mediated degradation and facilitate viral replication

date: 2024-11-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionViral infection usually stimulates a variety of host cell factors to modulate the life cycle of the virus. PIM1, a serine/threonine protein kinase widely involved in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and apoptosis, was recently reported to be upregulated by Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. However, how ZIKV-PIM1 interactions affect the viral life cycle are not fully understood.Methods and resultsHere, we demonstrated that ZIKV replication was suppressed by the PIM1 kinase inhibitor SGI-1776 in both wt and Ifnar1-/- murine peritoneal macrophages, indicating that PIM1 functions independently of type I IFN signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays revealed that the ZIKV structural protein precursor membrane (prM) interacted with PIM1. Moreover, we found that prM protein stability was enhanced by PIM1, which was attributed to its kinase activity. Mechanistically, we revealed that prM can undergo ubiquitin‒mediated proteolysis and the E3 ubiquitin ligase AMFR can target prM for degradation. Importantly, PIM1 catalyzed phosphorylation of prM at Ser101 and Thr107, and this phosphorylation prevented the proteasome-dependent degradation of prM by impairing its association with AMFR. Therefore, the S101/T107-D phosphorylation mimic mutant of prM was more resistant to PIM1-induced increases in cellular abundance.DiscussionThese findings revealed PIM1 as a critical host factor that is advantageous to ZIKV and revealed that targeting the PIM1‒prM axis is a conducive strategy for controlling ZIKV infection.

## Immunological characteristics in elderly COVID-19 patients: a post-COVID era analysis

date: 2024-11-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAdvanced age is a primary risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes, potentially attributed to immunosenescence and dysregulated inflammatory responses. In the post-pandemic era, with containment measures lifted, the elderly remain particularly susceptible, highlighting the need for intensified focus on immune health management.MethodsA total of 281 elderly patients were enrolled in this study and categorized based on their clinical status at the time of admission into three groups: non-severe (n = 212), severe survivors (n = 49), and severe non-survivors (n = 20). Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to identify independent risk factors associated with disease severity and in-hospital outcomes. The diagnostic performance of risk factors was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were utilized to compare the 30-day survival rates. Furthermore, the transcriptomic data of CD4+ T cells were extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was applied to reveal biological processes and pathways involved.ResultsIn the comparison between severe and non-severe COVID-19 cases, significant elevations were observed in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Serum Amyloid A (SAA) levels, concurrent with a notable reduction in CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes (all p < 0.05). CD4+ T cells (OR: 0.997 [0.995-1.000], p<0.05) and NLR (OR: 1.03 [1.001-1.060], p<0.05) were independent risk factors affecting disease severity. The diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19 severity, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC) for CD4+ T cells and NLR, was 0.715 (95% CI: 0.645-0.784) and 0.741 (95% CI: 0.675-0.807), respectively. Moreover, patients with elevated NLR or IL-6 levels at admission exhibited significantly shorter survival times. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed several biological pathways that are implicated in the regulation of immune responses and metabolic processes.ConclusionsLymphocytopenia and the cytokine storm onset are significant predictors of an unfavorable prognosis in elderly patients. The decrease in CD4+ T cells among elderly patients is detrimental to disease recovery, and the biological pathways regulated by these cells could potentially heighten vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby exacerbating the development of associated complications.

## CISepsis: a causal inference framework for early sepsis detection

date: 2024-11-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe early prediction of sepsis based on machine learning or deep learning has achieved good results.Most of the methods use structured data stored in electronic medical records, but the pathological characteristics of sepsis involve complex interactions between multiple physiological systems and signaling pathways, resulting in mixed structured data. Some researchers will introduce unstructured data when also introduce confounders. These confounders mask the direct causality of sepsis, leading the model to learn misleading correlations. Finally, it affects the generalization ability, robustness, and interpretability of the model.MethodsTo address this challenge, we propose an early sepsis prediction approach based on causal inference which can remove confounding effects and capture causal relationships. First, we analyze the relationship between each type of observation, confounder, and label to create a causal structure diagram. To eliminate the effects of different confounders separately, the methods of back-door adjustment and instrumental variable are used. Specifically, we learn the confounder and an instrumental variable based on mutual information from various observed data and eliminate the influence of the confounder by optimizing mutual information. We use back-door adjustment to eliminate the influence of confounders in clinical notes and static indicators on the true causal effect.ResultsOur method, named CISepsis, was validated on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Compared to existing state-of-the-art early sepsis prediction models such as XGBoost, LSTM, and MGP-AttTCN, our method demonstrated a significant improvement in AUC. Specifically, our model achieved AUC values of 0.921, 0.920, 0.919, 0.923, 0.924, 0.926, and 0.926 at the 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 time points, respectively. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method was confirmed through ablation experiments.DiscussionOur method, based on causal inference, effectively removes the influence of confounding factors, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of the model. Compared to traditional methods, this adjustment allows for a more accurate capture of the true causal effects of sepsis, thereby enhancing the model's generalizability, robustness, and interpretability. Future research will explore the impact of specific indicators or treatment interventions on sepsis using counterfactual adjustments in causal inference, as well as investigate the potential clinical application of our method.

## Development a risk prediction nomogram for multidrug−resistant bacterial and fungal infection in gastrointestinal fistula patients during the perioperative period

date: 2024-11-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThis study aims to develop a risk prediction model for multidrug-resistant bacterial and fungal infections in patients with gastrointestinal fistulas during the perioperative period.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted at Anhui No. 2 Provincial People’s Hospital from January 2022 to July 2024. We analyzed the distribution, resistance patterns, and mechanisms of multidrug resistance. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors. A nomogram was constructed based on these risk factors, and its performance was evaluated using calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsA total of 266 patients were included, with 157 (59.02%) testing positive for multidrug-resistant infections. We isolated 329 pathogenic strains: 84 Gram-positive (25.53%), 215 Gram-negative (65.35%), and 30 fungal strains (9.11%). The most common isolate was Klebsiella pneumoniae (57 strains, 17.33%). Patients were divided into a training cohort (n = 177) and a validation cohort (n = 89). Multivariate analysis identified six key indicators: secondary surgery, length of hospital stay, preoperative white blood cell (WBC) count, preoperative neutrophil count, postoperative WBC count, and postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The nomogram demonstrated excellent predictive ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905 in the training cohort and 0.793 in the validation cohort. Calibration curves indicated high consistency between predicted probabilities and observed values. DCA confirmed the clinical utility of the nomogram.ConclusionOur study shows that multidrug-resistant infections in patients with gastrointestinal fistulas are predominantly caused by Gram-negative bacilli, especially carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Key risk factors include secondary surgery and various blood count parameters. The developed nomogram provides robust predictive accuracy, aiding healthcare providers in implementing targeted infection prevention strategies.

## Altered gut microbiome in convalescent patients with coronavirus disease 2019

date: 2024-11-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) alters the gut microbiome. This study aimed to assess the association between the disease severity of COVID-19 and changes in stool microbes through a seven-month follow-up of stool collection.MethodsWe conducted a multicentre, prospective longitudinal study of 58 COVID-19 patients and 116 uninfected controls. Differences in the gut microbiota were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. The first stool samples were collected at an early convalescent phase of COVID-19, and the second sample was collected at least seven months after COVID-19 infection.Results and discussionAt the order level, Eubacteriales and Bifidobacteriales decreased, while Bacteroidales and Burkholderiales increased in the COVID-19 group compared to the controls. Alpha diversity also decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls, with imperfect recovery of the gut microbiome after seven months. The compositional change in the gut microbiome between the early and late convalescent phases was largest in the moderate and severe groups. The severity of COVID-19 was the most influential clinical variable for microbiome composition (Sum of Sqs = 0.686, P = 0.006), and its effect persisted even after partialling out other effects such as antibiotic use and age. Thus, our study indicates a possible interaction between respiratory viral infection and the composition of the gut microbiota community, warranting future mechanistic and prospective longitudinal studies. Additionally, we were able to detect microbiome changes in patients who were re-infected with SARS-CoV-2. Notably, the dominant bacteria in the re-infected group were Lachnospiraceae and Faecalimonas umbilicata, compared to the one-time infected group.

## Characteristics of lower respiratory tract pathogens in critically ill patients with heatstroke: a retrospective multi-center study

date: 2024-11-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

This retrospective multicenter study was conducted across 83 intensive care units (ICUs) in 16 cities in Sichuan, China. Critically ill patients diagnosed with heatstroke and lung infections were included in the study. Specimens from the lower respiratory tract were collected for microbiological testing, and the characteristics of the pathogens were described. A total of 462 patients diagnosed with heatstroke-related pulmonary infections were included, 134 patients (29.0%) tested positive for respiratory pathogens. The most frequently isolated strain was Klebsiella pneumoniae (34.3%), followed by Escherichia coli (28.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (20.9%). The results revealed that in the hyperthermic resistance group, there was a higher proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [14(34.1%) vs 11(11.8%), p=0.002] and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [4(9.8%) vs 1(1.1%), p=0.030] compared to the hyperthermic control group. And a higher proportion of Staphylococcus aureus [27(29.7%) vs 1(2.3%), p<0.001], were obtained during the earlier stages with elevated temperatures. Patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae (38.3 ± 1.9°C), Staphylococcus aureus (38.5 ± 2.2°C), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38.7 ± 1.9°C) exhibited a higher temperature environment. Our study provides crucial insights into the lower respiratory tract pathogenesis of heatstroke patients, identifying key pathogens and their temperature-dependent characteristics, thus providing a foundation for future empirical treatment strategies in heatstroke.

## Progress in the study of mefloquine as an antibiotic adjuvant for combination bacterial inhibition treatment

date: 2024-11-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Antimicrobial resistance is among the greatest threats to public health globally, and drug repurposing strategies may be advantageous to addressing this problem. Mefloquine, a drug traditionally used to treat malaria, has emerged as a promising antibiotic adjuvant, due to its ability to enhance the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics against resistant bacterial strains. In this paper, we first outline the enhancement properties of mefloquine and its mechanisms of action as an adjuvant antibiotic against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Mefloquine exhibits synergistic bacteriostatic effects when combined with colistin, β-lactams, antituberculosis drugs, quinolones, and linezolid. Potential mechanisms underlying its synergistic effects include inhibition of antibiotic efflux, disruption of bacterial cell membrane integrity, and disturbance of biofilm formation. In addition, we explore the bacteriostatic effects of several mefloquine derivatives against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and some fungi. Further, we summarize the findings of recent studies on other aspects of mefloquine activity, including its antiviral and antitumor effects. Finally, the advantages and challenges of mefloquine use as an antibiotic adjuvant in combination with antibiotics for bacterial inhibition are discussed. Overall, mefloquine shows excellent potential as an antibiotic adjuvant therapy against multidrug-resistant bacteria and is a promising candidate for combination therapy; however, further studies are needed to fully elucidate its mechanism of action and address the challenges associated with its clinical application.

## The prognostic value of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in adult carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection: a retrospective cohort study

date: 2024-11-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSystemic inflammatory indicators such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can effectively predict the prognosis of various inflammatory diseases. However, its prognostic effect on patients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infection is little known. The objective of this study was to investigate the risk factors for mortality associated with CRKP infection and the clinical value of NLR in predicting prognosis in these patients.MethodsA total of 190 inpatients with CRKP infection from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 were enrolled in this study, namely, 73 fatal cases and 117 survival cases in hospital. The medical data and examination results of these patients were collected. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between the NLR on the day of CRKP infection onset and all-cause mortality in hospital.ResultsThe overall mortality rate of patients with CRKP infection was 38.42% (73/190). Of the 190 patients, 91 were co-infected with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii/carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRAB/CRPA). Multifactor regression analysis confirmed that carbapenem exposure in the past 14 days, central line insertion, and chronic Foley catheter requirement were independent risk factors for carbapenem-resistant bacteria co-infection. The multivariate analysis shows that admission to an ICU, co-infection with CRAB/CRPA, and higher NLR were independent risk factors for the mortality in hospital, while appropriate treatment within 3 days was an independent protective factor. The area under the curve (AUC) of the NLR was 0.696, and the cutoff value of the NLR was 10.73.ConclusionsThe NLR on the day of CRKP infection onset, admission to an ICU, and co-infection with CRAB/CRPA were identified as independent risk factors for all-cause mortality of patients with CRKP infection, while appropriate treatment within 3 days was recognized as an independent protective factor. The NLR serves as a conveniently accessible and independent prognostic biomarker for patients with CRKP infection.

## Terpenoids as principal bioactive compound of Cissampelos oppositifolia essential oils: enhancing synergistic efficacy with conventional antibiotics

date: 2024-11-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe rise of antibiotic resistance imposes the search for novel antimicrobial strategies as natural products or its combination with antibiotics. This study investigates the synergistic effects of terpenoids from Cissampelos oppositifolia (C. oppositifolia) essential oil in combination with antibiotics against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The aims were to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy, analyze functional group modifications and assess molecular interaction.MethodsEssential oil was extracted from C. oppositifolia by hydro-distillation. The EO was analyzed for terpenoid content via Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). Antimicrobial activity was assessed using the disc diffusion method and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration determinations (MIC) by broth dilution followed by bactericidal essay (Time-killing). FTIR and UV spectroscopy were employed to detect functional group modifications in terpenoid-antibiotic combinations. Molecular docking studies assessed interaction energies between terpenoids and antibiotics.ResultsTLC identified α-pinene, δ-carene, and caryophyllene in the EO. δ-Carene exhibited the highest synergy with antibiotics, showing the lowest MIC of 0.04 mg/mL against S. aureus ATCC-43300 and 0.05 mg/mL against E. coli MTCC-739. Time-kill assays demonstrated that α-pinene, δ-carene, and caryophyllene achieved complete bacterial eradication by 4 hours in combination with amoxicillin against E. coli, and by 2 hours against S. aureus in combination with erythromycin. FTIR analysis revealed peak shifts at 1599, 1774, and 2259 cm−1 for amoxicillin + α-pinene, and new peaks at 1648 and 1287 cm−1 for δ-carene + erythromycin. UV spectra indicated potential complex formations. Docking studies showed δ-carene’s strong interaction with erythromycin and amoxicillin, with interaction energies of -96.10 and -87.75 kcal/mol, respectively.ConclusionTerpenoids from C. oppositifolia enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of antibiotics. Functional group modifications and complex formations suggest that these interactions may contribute to synergistic effects. These findings support the potential use of terpenoid-antibiotic combinations in overcoming antibiotic resistance and warrant further investigation into their mechanisms of action.

## Antibiotics combined with vaginal probiotics in the embryo transfer cycle of infertile patients with chronic endometritis

date: 2024-11-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionChronic endometritis (CE) is a prolonged, mild inflammation of the endometrial lining. This study investigated the impact of the impact of antibiotic treatment combined with vaginal Lactobacillus on pregnancy outcomes in infertile patients with CE during frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles.MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 7,385 patients who underwent FET. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 254 patients diagnosed with CE were eligible for inclusion. Of these, 119 patients received antibiotics alone, whereas 135 were treated with a combination of doxycycline and vaginal Lactobacillus. All patients underwent embryo transfer within 6 months following treatment. The general characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of the first FET cycle post-treatment were compared between the two groups.ResultsThere were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of general characteristics, clinical pregnancy rate, early miscarriage rate, and ectopic pregnancy rate. Patients who received a combination of doxycycline and Lactobacillus showed a higher biochemical pregnancy rate compared to those who received doxycycline alone, though this difference was not statistically significant (70.37% vs. 64.71%, P=0.313). Furthermore, the incidence rate of premature rupture of membranes was lower in the doxycycline-Lactobacillus group than in the doxycycline group (50.00% vs 33.33%, P=0.037).ConclusionsAlthough this study observed the potential benefits of the antibiotic and vaginal probiotic treatment regimen in increasing the biochemical pregnancy rate and reducing the incidence of premature rupture of membranes, the current findings are insufficient to recommend the combined use of antibiotics and vaginal Lactobacillus as an intervention to improve reproductive outcomes in infertile patients with CE.

## Prevalence of respiratory pathogens among hospitalised patients with acute respiratory infection during and after the COVID-19 pandemic in Shijiazhuang, China

date: 2024-11-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have led to changes in the epidemiology of other respiratory pathogens. This study was conducted to explore the epidemiological characteristics of 13 respiratory pathogens, including 11 respiratory viruses and 2 non-classical microorganisms, in hospitalised patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and to compare the prevalence of respiratory pathogens during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsWe conducted a single-centre retrospective study involving 8979 patients with ARTIs in Shijiazhuang City from December 2019 to December 2023. The GeXP analysis platform and multiple reverse transcription–PCR (mRT–PCR) technology were used to simultaneously detect 13 respiratory pathogens. The ARIMA model was constructed to predict the pathogen detection rate in each quarter of Shijiazhuang City in the next 2 y.ResultsAmong the 8979 patients, 4169 (46.43%) tested positive for respiratory pathogens. The total pathogen detection rate rebounded in the year after the COVID-19 pandemic. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the positive rates in men were slightly higher than those in women and the positive rates in spring and winter were significantly higher than those in summer. The dominant pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic were Influenza A viru (InfA; 24.08%) and Human Rhinovirus (HRV; 21.77%), and after the COVID-19 pandemic were InfA (27.92%) and H3 (21.17%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, InfA and HRV frequently occurred in all age groups. After the COVID-19 pandemic, InfA and Seasonal Influenza virus H3N2 (H3) frequently occurred in all age groups.ConclusionsA series of NPIs introduced by the Chinese government during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on acute upper respiratory pathogenic infections. After the withdrawal of the NPIs, the spectrum of respiratory pathogens changed.

## Improved influenza A whole-genome sequencing protocol

date: 2024-11-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Influenza A virus poses significant public health challenges due to its high mutation rate and zoonotic potential. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is crucial for monitoring and characterizing these viruses. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Illumina next-generation sequencing platforms are commonly used, with ONT being advantageous for its long-read capabilities, portability, and unique ability to access raw data in real-time during sequencing, making it suitable for rapid outbreak responses. This study optimizes the ONT Ligation Sequencing Influenza A Whole Genome protocol by refining RT-PCR kits, primers, and purification methods, and evaluating automation for high-throughput processing. The alternative RT-PCR kits, combined with alternative primers, significantly improved read depth coverage and reduced short, untargeted reads compared to the original ONT protocol. The improvement was particularly evident in the minimum read depth coverage of polymerase segments, which often face challenges with achieving uniform coverage, displaying higher coverage at the 5’ and 3’ termini, and lower coverage in the central regions. This optimized protocol for targeted influenza A WGS not only enhances sequencing quality and efficiency, but is applicable to all NGS platforms, making it highly valuable for studying influenza adaptation and improving surveillance. Additionally, this protocol can be further refined and adapted for the sequencing of other pathogens, broadening its utility in various pathogen monitoring and response efforts.

## Sustained antiviral insulin signaling during West Nile virus infection results in viral mutations

date: 2024-11-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Arthropod-borne viruses or arboviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) pose significant threats to public health. It is imperative to develop novel methods to control these mosquito-borne viral infections. We previously showed that insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS)-dependent activation of ERK and JAK-STAT signaling has significant antiviral activity in insects and human cells. Continuous immune pressure can lead to adaptive mutations of viruses during infection. We aim to elucidate how IIS-signaling in mosquitoes selects for West Nile virus escape variants, to help formulate future transmission blocking strategies. We hypothesize that passage of WNV under activation of IIS will induce adaptive mutations or escape variants in the infecting virus. To test our hypothesis, WNV was serially passaged through Culex quinquefasciatus Hsu cells in the presence or absence of bovine insulin to activate IIS antiviral pressure. We sequenced WNV genes encoding for E, NS2B, NS3, and NS5 and identified variants in E and NS5 arising from IIS antiviral pressure. In parallel to the genetic analyses, we also report differences in the levels of virus replication and Akt activation in human cells and mosquitoes using virus passaged in the presence or absence of insulin. Finally, using adult Culex quinquefasciatus, we demonstrated the enhancement of immune response gene expression in virus-infected mosquitoes fed on insulin, compared to control. Notably, virus collected from insulin-fed mosquitoes contained a non-synonymous mutation in NS3. These results contribute towards achieving our long-term goal of manipulating mosquito IIS-dependent antiviral immunity to reduce WNV or other flavivirus transmission to mammalian hosts.

## The depletion of gut microbiome impairs the beneficial effect of Gui-Shen-Wan in restoring mice ovarian function and associated protein expression of ovarian tissues

date: 2024-11-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), specifically Gui-Shen-Wan, has shown promise in restoring ovarian function among reproductive-age women who had impaired ovarian functions, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Recent studies highlight the pivotal role of the gut microbiome (GM) in mediating the therapeutic effects of TCM. However, it is unclear whether the GM contributes to Gui-Shen-Wan’s therapeutic restoration of ovarian functions.MethodsThis study employed a mouse model with cyclophosphamide-induced decreased ovarian function (P_T and P_AT groups) and a control group without modeling. The P_AT group received a 7-day course of oral antibiotics to deplete the GM prior to a 20-day Gui-Shen-Wan treatment regimen.ResultsBoth P_T and P_AT mice exhibited prolonged metestrus/diestrus phases compared to controls (p<0.05), indicating menstrual disruption post-modeling. Following 20 days of Gui-Shen-Wan treatment, P_T mice showed a shorter metestrus/diestrus phase (4 days) compared to P_AT mice (5 days) (p<0.05). Notably, P_T mice had a higher number of normal follicles(primitive/primary/secondary/antral follicles) in their ovaries post-treatment (median 15) compared to P_AT mice (median 8.5). Proteome analysis revealed that ovarian proteins enriched in P_T mice were primarily associated with oxidative phosphorylation and DNA replication pathways, suggesting GM-mediated enhancement of these processes.DiscussionThis study underscores the pivotal role of the GM in the therapeutic benefits of Gui-Shen-Wan, highlighting the potential for microbiome-targeted interventions in promoting beneficial effects of Gui-Shen-Wan on the restoration of decreased ovarian functions.

## Multiple factors regulate the expression of sufCDSUB in Streptococcus mutans

date: 2024-11-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe sufCDSUB gene cluster, encoding the sole iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly system in S. mutans, was recently shown to be up-regulated in response to oxidative stressors and Fe limitation.MethodsIn this study, luciferase reporter fusion assays, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays (EMSA) and in vitro transcription assays (IVT) were used to dissect the cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate the expression of sufCDSUB.Results and discussionResults showed deletion of perR, for the only Fur-family transcriptional regulator in S. mutans, resulted in >5-fold increases in luciferase activity under the control of the sufCDSUB promoter (P<0.01), as compared to the parent strain, UA159 when the reporter strains were grown in medium with no supplemental iron. Site-directed mutagenesis of a PerR-box in the promoter region led to elevation of the reporter activity by >1.6-fold (P<0.01). In an EMSA, recombinant PerR (rPerR) was shown to bind to the cognate sufCDSUB promoter leading to mobility retardation. On the other hand, the reporter activity was increased by >84-fold (P<0.001) in response to the addition of cysteine at 4 mM to the culture medium. Deletion of cysR, for a LysR-type of transcriptional regulator, led to reduction of the reporter activity by >11.6-fold (P<0.001). Addition of recombinant CysR (rCysR) to an EMSA caused mobility shift of the sufCDSUB promoter probe, indicative of rCysR-promoter interaction, and rCysR was shown to enhance sufC transcription under the direction of sufCDSUB promoter in vitro. These results suggest that multiple factors are involved in the regulation of sufCDSUB expression in response to environmental cues, including cysteine and Fe availability, consistent with the important role of sufCDSUB in S. mutans physiology.

## Potential protective role of interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) in COVID-19

date: 2024-11-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a quest to understand why certain individuals remain uninfected or asymptomatic despite repetitive exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we focused on six exposed females residing with their symptomatic and reinfected SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive COVID-19 partners. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from couples were analysed for poly (I:C)-induced mRNA expression of type I/III interferons and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Remarkably, we found a significant upregulation of the ISG interferon-inducible protein with tetrapeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3) gene exclusively in exposed uninfected or asymptomatic females, suggesting a potential role in protective immunity against symptomatic COVID-19.

## Direct and indirect effects of estrogens, androgens and intestinal microbiota on colorectal cancer

date: 2024-11-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Sex differences in colorectal cancer (CRC) has received considerable research attention recently, particularly regarding the influence of sex hormones and the intestinal microbiota. Estrogen, at the genetic and epigenetic levels, directly inhibits CRC cell proliferation by enhancing DNA mismatch repair, regulating miRNAs, blocking the cell cycle, and modulating ion channels. However, estradiol’s activation of GPER promotes oncogene expression. Conversely, androgen contributes to epigenetic dysregulation and CRC progression via nuclear receptors while inducing apoptosis through membrane receptors. Specific gut microorganisms produce genotoxins and oncogenic metabolites that damage colonic cell DNA and contribute to cancer induction. Regarding the tumor microenvironment, estrogen mitigates intestinal inflammation, reverses immunosuppression, increases gut microbiome diversity and commensal bacteria abundance, and decreases pathogen enrichment. On the contrary, androgen disrupts intestinal microecology, diminish immunotherapy efficacy, and exacerbate colonic inflammation and tumor growth. The impact of estrogen and androgen is closely tied to their receptor status, elucidating their dual roles in CRC pathogenesis. This review comprehensively discusses the direct and indirect effects of sex hormones and the intestinal microbiota on CRC, considering environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle to propose novel prevention and treatment strategies.

## Development and application of a quadruplex TaqMan real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR assay for four porcine digestive pathogens

date: 2024-11-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionSalmonella, Escherichia coli, Lawsonella intracellularis, and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae are the primary pathogens responsible for gastrointestinal diseases in pigs, posing a significant threat to the health and productivity of pig production systems. Pathogen detection is a crucial tool for monitoring and managing these infections.MethodsWe designed primers and probes targeting the invA gene of Salmonella, the 23S rRNA gene of Escherichia coli, the aspA gene of Lawsonella intracellularis, and the nox gene of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. We developed a quadruplex TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR assay capable of simultaneously detecting these four pathogens.ResultsThis assay demonstrated high sensitivity, with detection limits of 100 copies/μL for the recombinant plasmid standards pEASY-23S rRNA, pEASY-aspA, and pEASY-nox, and 10 copies/μL for pEASY-invA. The standard curves exhibited excellent linearity (R2 values of 0.999, 0.999, 1, and 0.998, respectively) and high amplification efficiencies (93.57%, 94.84%, 85.15%, and 81.81%, respectively). The assay showed high specificity, with no cross-reactivity detected against nucleic acids from Streptococcus suis, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Pasteurella multocida, Clostridium perfringens, Gracilaria parapsilosis, porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), porcine group A rotavirus (GARV), and porcine teschovirus (PTV). The assay also exhibited excellent repeatability, with inter- and intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 0.15% to 1.12%. High concentrations of nucleic acids did not interfere with the detection of low concentrations, ensuring robust performance in complex samples. Among 263 diarrhoeic samples, the assay detected Salmonella in 23.95%, Escherichia coli in 26.24%, Lawsonella intracellularis in 33.84%, and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae in 22.43%.DiscussionThis quadruplex TaqMan qPCR assay offers a rapid, sensitive, and specific tool for the simultaneous detection of Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Lawsonella intracellularis, and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae in pigs.

## The causal relationship between the human gut microbiota and pyogenic arthritis: a Mendelian randomization study

date: 2024-11-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRecent studies have indicated the role of the gut microbiota in the progression of osteoarticular diseases, however, the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and pyogenic arthritis remains unclear. There is also a lack of theoretical basis for the application of the gut microbiota in the treatment of pyogenic arthritis.MethodsIn our study, we utilized the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the MiBioGen Consortium involving 13,400 participants and extracted summary statistical data of the microbiota metabolic pathways of 7,738 participants of European descent from the Dutch Microbiome Project (DMP) The data of pyogenic arthritis were derived from the FinnGen R10 database, including 1,086 patients and 147,221 controls. We employed the two-sample Mendelian randomization approach to investigate the causal association between the gut microbiota and pyogenic arthritis. Our methods comprised inverse variance weighting, Mendelian Randomization Egger regression, weighted median, and weighted modal methods. Subsequently, polygenic and heterogeneity analyses were conducted.ResultsAt the class level, β-proteobacteria is positively correlated with the risk of pyogenic arthritis. At the order level, Burkholderia is positively associated with the disease. At the genus level, the unclassified genus of Sutterellaceae is positively correlated with the disease, while the unnamed genus of Lachnospiraceae, Rothia, and the unnamed genus of Erysipelotrichaceae are negatively correlated with the disease. In addition, Faecalibacterium and Finegoldia are also negatively correlated with the disease. Sensitivity analysis did not show any abnormal evidence.ConclusionThis study indicates that β-proteobacteria, Burkholderiales, and the unclassified genus of Sutterellaceae are associated with an increased risk of the disease, while the unnamed genus of Lachnospiraceae, Rothia, the unnamed genus of Erysipelotrichaceae, Faecalibacterium, and Finegoldia are related to a reduced risk. Future studies are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which these specific bacterial groups affect pyogenic arthritis.

## Propionimicrobium lymphophilum in urine of children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis

date: 2024-11-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundDespite a unique microbiome in urine, the relationship between nocturnal enuresis and the urobiome remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the presence of specific bacterial species in the urine of children with and without nocturnal enuresis.MethodsWe used 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to analyze the urobiome in urine samples obtained from the two groups of children. The presence of Propionimicrobium lymphophilum was examined using real-time PCR in the urine of 25 children diagnosed with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE), and 17 children without this condition.ResultsChildren with MNE exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of P. lymphophilum: 16 out of 25 (64.0%) compared to 4 out of 17 (23.5%) in the control group. Among children with frequent bedwetting, there was a significantly higher prevalence of P. lymphophilum;15 out of 16 (93.8%) compared to 2 out of 9 (22.2%) in those with infrequent bedwetting. Bacterial culture tests confirmed the anaerobic growth of P. lymphophilum isolates from urine samples of two PCR-positive patients with MNE. These isolates were found to be susceptible to ampicillin.ConclusionThese findings suggest that P. lymphophilum may be associated with chronic urinary tract infections and potentially contribute to the development of MNE in children.

## Predicting survival in patients with SARS-CoV-2 based on cytokines and soluble immune checkpoint regulators

date: 2024-11-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widespread for over four years and has progressed to an endemic stage. Accordingly, the evaluation of host immunity in infected patients and the development of markers for prognostic prediction in the early stages have been emphasized. Soluble immune checkpoints (sICs), which regulate T cell activity, have been reported as promising biomarkers of viral infections.MethodsIn this study, quantitative values of 17 sICs and 16 cytokines (CKs) were measured using the Luminex multiplex assay. A total of 148 serum samples from 100 patients with COVID-19 were collected and the levels were compared between survivors vs. non-survivors and pneumonic vs. non-pneumonic conditions groups. The impact of these markers on overall survival were analyzed using a machine learning algorithm.ResultssICs, including sCD27, sCD40, herpes virus entry mediator (sHVEM), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (sTIM-3), and Toll-like receptor 2 (sTLR-2) and CKs, including chemokine CC motif ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α), were statistically significantly increased in the non-survivors compared to those of in the survivors. IL-6 showed the highest area under the receiver-operating curve (0.844, 95% CI = 0.751–0.913) to discriminate non-survival, with a sensitivity of 78.9% and specificity of 82.4%. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with procalcitonin over 0.25 ng/mL, C-reactive protein (CRP) over 41.0 mg/dL, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio over 18.97, sCD27 over 3828.8 pg/mL, sCD40 over 1283.6 pg/mL, and IL-6 over 21.6 pg/mL showed poor survival (log-rank test). In the decision tree analysis, IL-6, sTIM-3, and sCD40 levels had a strong impact on survival. Moreover, IL-6, CD40, and CRP levels were important to predict the probability of 90-d mortality using the SHapley Additive exPlanations method.ConclusionsICs and CKs, especially IL-6, sCD27, sCD40, and sTIM-3 are expected to be useful in predicting patient outcomes when used in combination with existing markers.

## Microplastics and human health: unveiling the gut microbiome disruption and chronic disease risks

date: 2024-11-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Microplastics (MPs), defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, are increasingly recognized as environmental contaminants with potential health risks. These emerge as breakdown products of larger plastics and are omnipresent in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems. They are primarily composed of polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and additives that enhance their performance. MPs also adsorb harmful environmental chemicals like persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, posing risks to human and environmental health. Human exposure to MPs occurs mainly through ingestion and inhalation, with MPs detected in food products, water, and even the air. MPs have been shown to accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, disrupting the gut microbiome, and causing dysbiosis-a harmful imbalance between beneficial and harmful bacteria. This disruption has been linked to various health issues, including gastrointestinal disorders, systemic inflammation, and chronic diseases. Furthermore, the gut-brain axis may be affected, with potential neuroinflammatory consequences. As research continues to unravel the health impacts of MP exposure, understanding the mechanisms of accumulation and the broader implications on human health is crucial. This review highlights the effects of MPs on human health, emphasizing their impact on the gut microbiome. We discuss the potential connections between MP exposure and cardiometabolic and inflammatory diseases, and disorders related to the Gut-Brain Axis. By synthesizing the latest research, this work sheds light on the silent yet pervasive threat posed by MPs and underscores the importance of further studies to understand their health impacts fully.

## Anticariogenic activity of marine brown algae Padina boergesenii and its active components towards Streptococcus mutans

date: 2024-11-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Streptococcus mutans is a well-recognized bacterium that plays a predominant role in the progression of dental caries. Its pathogenicity is linked to several key characteristics, including the ability to produce organic acids (acidogenicity), thrive in low pH environments (aciduricity), synthesize exopolysaccharides (EPS) via glucosyltransferases, and form retentive biofilms. The treatment of dental caries with conventional antibiotics is often ineffective due to the bacterium’s capacity to form recalcitrant biofilms. To address these challenges, strategies that specifically target the pathogen’s virulence without affecting its viability have emerged as promising alternatives. In this context, we investigated the anticariogenic properties of the methanolic extract of Padina boergesenii (MEPB). MEPB demonstrated substantial, dose-dependent antibiofilm activity, with a maximum inhibition of 93% at 128 μg/mL, without compromising the viability of S. mutans. Anti-virulence assays using sub-MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) levels of MEPB showed significant reductions in key virulence factors: 75% reduction in sucrose-dependent adherence, 65% reduction in sucrose-independent adherence, along with notable decreases in acid production, acid tolerance, and water-insoluble (85%) and water-soluble (52%) glucan synthesis. Additionally, MEPB significantly reduced cell surface hydrophobicity (55%) and extracellular DNA (eDNA) production (64%). qPCR analysis corroborated these in vitro findings, revealing that MEPB suppresses the expression of genes involved in S. mutans virulence, particularly genes related to EPS synthesis (gtfB, gtfC & gtfD) biofilm formation(gbpB & gbpC) and two-component regulatory system (vicR) were downregulated. Toxicity testing on human buccal epithelial cells confirmed the non-toxic nature of MEPB, suggesting its safety for potential therapeutic use. Furthermore, GC-MS/MS analysis identified palmitic acid, myristic acid, and stearic acid as the major active constituents of the MEPB extract. Subsequent biofilm inhibitory assays confirmed the potent antibiofilm efficacy of these compounds: palmitic acid (85%), myristic acid (72%) and stearic acid (83%). In conclusion, this study identifies P. boergesenii and its active biomolecules as potential anticariogenic agents, offering an alternative approach to combat dental caries by targeting bacterial virulence mechanisms rather than viability.

## Galectin-3 plays a key role in controlling infection by Toxoplasma gondii in human trophoblast cells and human villous explants

date: 2024-11-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a β-galactoside-binding lectin expressed in cells of the placental microenvironment. This lectin is involved in various biological processes, such as modulation of the immune system and control of parasitic illness. Toxoplasma gondii infection can lead to congenital transmission and cause miscarriages, prematurity and fetal anomalies. However, little is known about the role of Gal-3 in T. gondii infection in the placental microenvironment. This study aimed to unravel the underlying mechanisms of Gal-3 during T. gondii infection. For this purpose, we promoted the knockdown of Gal-3 expression by using RNA interference (RNAi) in BeWo cells or by using a synthetic inhibitor (GB1107) in human villous explants. We showed that the decreased Gal-3 expression in BeWo cells and human villous explants increases the invasion and proliferation of T. gondii probably by downregulating MIF and IL6 levels, highlighting thus the role of this lectin in modulating the immune response. Collectively, our study reveals Gal-3 as a promising target protein during congenital toxoplasmosis.

## Gut metagenomic features of frailty

date: 2024-11-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

This study investigates the relationship between frailty severity and gut microbiome characteristics in adults in Kazakhstan. We analyzed 158 participants across four frailty severity (mild to very severe) using metagenomic sequencing of stool samples. Frailty was significantly correlated with age, weight, and functional measures like walking speed and grip strength. Microbial diversity decreased significantly with increasing frailty. Beta diversity analysis revealed distinct clustering patterns based at phylum level. Taxonomically, we observed a significant inverse correlation between Firmicutes abundance and frailty. Classes like Clostridia and Erysipelotrichia decreased with frailty, while Bacteroidia and Actinobacteria increased. At the family level, Oscillospiraceae showed a positive correlation with frailty. Functionally, we identified significant correlations between frailty measures and specific metabolic pathways. The frailty index negatively correlated with pathways involved in cobalamin, arginine and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis and positively correlated with folate biosynthesis. Physical performance measures strongly correlated with pathways related to nucleotide biosynthesis, and one-carbon metabolism. We propose these identified features may constitute a “frailty-associated metabolic signature” in the gut microbiome. This signature suggests multiple interconnected mechanisms through which the microbiome may influence frailty development, including modulation of inflammation, alterations in energy metabolism, and potential impacts on muscle function through microbial metabolites.

## Shedding light on negative cultures in osteoarticular infections: leveraging mNGS to unravel risk factors and microbial profiles

date: 2024-11-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe objective of this study is to utilize metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to analyze the risk factors causing negative microbial cultures, comprehensively delineate the microbial profiles neglected by traditional cultures, and optimize the pathogenetic diagnostic procedure accordingly.Research design and methodsWe enrolled 341 patients diagnosed with OI at our center between 2016 and 2022, and gathered data including age, gender, clinical diagnosis, duration of antibiotic use prior to sampling, microbial culture results, and mNGS results for these patients. According to microbial detection results, risk factors for negative microbial culture and mNGS results were investigated through univariate and multivariate analyses, and the microbial profile in cases with negative microbial cultures was summarized in conjunction with mNGS results. Building upon this, we suggest strategies to enhance the positivity rate of microbial cultures based on clinical experience.ResultsInvasive osteoarticular infection (IOI), multi-infections, rare pathogen infections, and prior antibiotic use are risk factors for negative microbial cultures. When the duration of prior antibiotic use is ≥3 days, mNGS demonstrates significantly higher pathogen detection efficiency than microbial culture. Moreover, the risk of negative microbial culture increases by 4.8 times with the exposure to each additional risk factor (OR=4.043, 95%CI [2.835, 5.765], P<0.001). Additionally, over one-third of culture-negative OI involve polymicrobial infections or rare pathogens.ConclusionsClinicians should tailor microbial culture strategies based on patient conditions. When needed, they can collaborate with mNGS or optimize microbial culture conditions based on mNGS results to enhance the efficiency of pathogen diagnosis.

## The antipsychotic drug lurasidone inhibits coronaviruses by affecting multiple targets

date: 2024-11-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Coronaviruses (CoVs) share key genomic elements critical for viral replication, suggesting the feasibility of developing therapeutics with efficacy across different viruses. In a previous work, we demonstrated the antiviral activity of the antipsychotic drug lurasidone against both SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43. In this study, our investigations on the mechanism of action of lurasidone suggested that the drug exhibits antiviral activity by targeting the papain-like protease (PL-Pro) of both viruses, and the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, thereby hampering both the entry and the viral replication. In vitro assays demonstrate that lurasidone significantly reduces viral load in infected cells, showing that the drug is a promising candidate for further development as a dual-action antiviral, offering a potential new strategy in the fight against COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related diseases.
