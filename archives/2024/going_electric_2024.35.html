‘Cortex’ Supercomputer Is What Its Robotaxi Hopes Ride On</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: Inside EVs News</p>
<p>Tesla claims it is building “the world’s most powerful AI-training
cluster.” But it, and Full Self-Driving, are far from proven.</p>

<p>
In what continues to feel like the ultimate tool hack, I’ve been running
my electric tractor completely off-grid. I haven’t paid to charge it in
months and it feels like I’m somehow cheating, always having the power
of heavy machinery at my fingertips with absolutely zero fuel cost.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how I wake up to a full “tank” every day, for free.

Canada is set to impose a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs, following similar
