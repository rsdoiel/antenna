## Fitness Boxing 3 can and should kick your ass

date: 2024-12-31, updated: 2024-12-30, from: Polygon Website

Boxing is a full-body workout. Deceptively so — you’re just moving your arms, how tough could it be, right? But if you’re throwing a punch correctly, you’re putting your entire body into that motion. A boxing punch should involve a whole set of simultaneous movements that engage your legs, your core, your shoulders, and your [&#8230;]

## Defunctland’s Disney park videos are so good, I had to ration them out

date: 2024-12-31, updated: 2024-12-22, from: Polygon Website

For someone who’s really into theme parks, Disney history, and the stories behind childhood favorites, I became a Defunctland fan far too late — but I’m so glad I did. The channel has a wonderful spread of videos, from the feature-length documentary-style ones that the channel is primarily known for to the shorter, quicker bite-sized dives [&#8230;]

## Every movie and show coming to Netflix in January

Even with Netflix’s recommendation algorithm serving you new movies, new TV shows, and original programming tailored to your viewing habits, the streaming service’s fire hose of content makes what’s coming difficult to parse. The Netflix back catalogue is delivering this month — there’s the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy; Love Actually, in case you’re still in [&#8230;]

## Can Togetic be shiny in Pokémon Go?

date: 2024-12-31, updated: 2024-12-17, from: Polygon Website

Togetic, the happiness Pokémon from Johto, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Togetic can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Togekiss is a great fairy-type attacker, as it has bulk and a decent moveset. It also does see use in PvP, meaning grabbing a ton of Togetic to check their IVs is [&#8230;]

## YouTube turned me into a backpacker. These are my 3 favorite outdoor creators on the platform

date: 2024-12-30, updated: 2024-12-23, from: Polygon Website

In the fall of 2021 the burnout, my friends, was real. That October, I determined that I needed to rapidly disassemble my day-to-day routine, yeet myself clear of everything that I considered normal, and not deal with… anything for just a little while, at least. The tool I used to break the chains that bound [&#8230;]

Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, the devs behind the Like a Dragon (formerly Yakuza) series, shared pre-alpha footage of its next game at The Game Awards on Dec. 12, but studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama says the short video reveals absolutely none of the project’s contents.

## Marvel’s What If…? was nothing more than a slew of missed opportunities

date: 2024-12-30, updated: 2024-12-27, from: Polygon Website

One of Marvel Comics&#8217; oldest traditions has been the What If title, a series that aims to take the Marvel universe as we know it and ponder what said universe would be like if something (whether it be a small, seemingly insignificant detail or the absence of entire superteams) was different. So when Marvel Studios [&#8230;]

## Watching this YouTuber restore old consoles is oddly satisfying

YouTube channel Odd Tinkering doesn’t hold many surprises — other than the disbelief at how good the consoles, controllers, and keyboards they restore look when the work is done. What starts as a broken, dirty Game Boy Color in this video becomes a crisp, clean handheld fit to be a 1998 Christmas present. The creator, [&#8230;]

## ‘Outside In’ makes a complex math concept fun and approachable

date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: Polygon Website

When it comes to good YouTube videos, I’m biased in favor of content made explicitly for the platform: media critiques, long-form investigations, and pointless tests of human endurance. “Outside In” is an exception. This educational video comes from a strange and distant land: the 1990s. Based on the mathematical concept of sphere inversion, it should [&#8230;]
