## FreeBSD is building a graphical installer

date: 2024-05-03, from: OS News

FreeBSD is working on a graphical installer. Finally. The first hurdle to overcome when testing a new Operating System is to get it installed. What is more, the first impression new users gather from an Operating System is its installation process. The state of the art for Operating System installers nowadays definitely involves a graphical process. This is the case for mainstream systems but also for other UNIX systems comparable to FreeBSD: RedHat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Debian GNU/Linux, or even Devuan GNU+Linux Regardless of the technical level of the actual user, this is how the platform will be compared in the public eye.  Instead, with knowledge of the current bsdinstall(8) and bsdconfig(8) utilities, I envisioned a BSD-licensed replacement for Xdialog(1). Just like when invoking bsdconfig with the -X switch for graphical mode, it could be dropped in instead of bsddialog(1) and allow graphical installation &#8211; while sharing the infrastructure of the current installer. To avoid confusion with the current implementation of Xdialog from the x11/xdialog port, I have named its replacement gbsddialog(1). It also has to be said that Xdialog is quite obsolete (latest release in 2006) and this shows visually too. ↫ Pierre Pronchery in the FreeBSD status report I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s taken FreeBSD this long to both consider and build a graphical installer. Currently being enveloped in the world of OpenBSD, there&#8217;s clearly so much the BSD world has to offer to desktop users such as myself, but at the same time, there&#8217;s a lot of low-hanging fruit that the various BSDs can address to make the experience just that little bit more pleasant. They obviously don&#8217;t have to &#8211; not every project is aiming at desktop use &#8211; but it just makes onboarding so much nicer. The next step &#8211; perhaps in 2037 &#8211; would be to offer a desktop-oriented installation image, with a default desktop environment and settings optimised for desktop use. Right now, a lot of fiddling and optimisation for this use case is left to the user, and for newcomers such as myself this means a lot of reading, making sense of contradictory advice and suggestions, wading through endless, often outdated, online guides, and so on. Now, I don&#8217;t particularly mind doing this, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s chasing people away who could end up making meaningful contributions. Meanwhile, after trying out FreeBSD for a while a few weeks ago but it not being a good fit for me, I&#8217;m now exploring and using OpenBSD and it&#8217;s been a great experience. Although unlikely, I hope OpenBSD, too, can perhaps consider making some minor affordances to desktop users &#8211; because as I&#8217;ve learnt, OpenBSD feels right at home on a desktop, more so than I ever expected.

## How to install the COSMIC desktop environment on Fedora 40

date: 2024-05-03, from: OS News

COSMIC Desktop Environment (DE) is a new project by System76, the company behind the popular Linux distribution Pop!_OS. In this tutorial, we will give you an overview about COSMIC DE and its features, and then we will walk you through the steps to install COSMIC Desktop Environment in the latest Fedora 40 Linux system. ↫ Senthilkumar Palani at OSTechNix A very easy way to try out the current pre-alpha state of COSMIC. I&#8217;ll definitely be waiting on a more official release later this year, but man, does COSMIC ever seem way more polished and complete than it has any right to be at this point in time.

## Microsoft overhaul treats security as ‘top priority’ after a series of failures

date: 2024-05-03, from: OS News

Microsoft is making security its number one priority for every employee, following years of security issues and mounting criticisms. After a scathing report from the US Cyber Safety Review Board recently concluded that “Microsoft’s security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul,” it’s doing just that by outlining a set of security principles and goals that are tied to compensation packages for Microsoft’s senior leadership team. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge The devil is in the details regarding tying executive pay to security performance, but it we take it at face value and assume good intent &#8211; which is a laughable assumption in our corporatist world, but alas &#8211; I would like to see more of this. It&#8217;s high time executives start paying &#8211; literally and figuratively &#8211; for the failings of the companies and teams they claim to run.

## Error -609 Launching App From the Mac App Store

Matthias Gansrigler: Does anybody here know what macOS&#8217; error -609 is when launching an app from the App Store? &#8220;The application &#8220;XYZ&#8221; can&#8217;t be opened. -609&#8221; And, maybe more importantly, how to fix it?

## Your Low Code Solution Needs an Escape Hatch

date: 2024-05-03, updated: 2024-05-03, from: Deno blog

A low-code solution is a simple way to offer some flexibility for your users. However, to accommodate further customization (especially for enterprise users), you should have an “escape hatch” — simple, code-level customization. Here are three product scenarios and where an escape hatch makes most sense.

In AWS, in order to access resources in other accounts without creating new users or handling passwords, you can use sts:AssumeRole.
Let&rsquo;s say that you have some resources in AccountA (AWS Managed Prometheus for example) that you want to access from AccountB
Account A In AccountA create a role account_a_role that has 2 types of policies:
a Trust Relationship that define which entities can assume this role { &#34;Version&#34;: &#34;2012-10-17&#34;, &#34;Statement&#34;: [ { &#34;Sid&#34;: &#34;AllowAssumeRoleFromAccountB&#34;, &#34;Effect&#34;: &#34;Allow&#34;, &#34;Principal&#34;: { &#34;AWS&#34;: &#34;arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_B_ID:role/account_b_role&#34; }, &#34;Action&#34;: &#34;sts:AssumeRole&#34; } ] } You can also set Conditions to filter which entities can AssumeRole and even configure AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity for users who have been authenticated with a web identity provider.

## The soundtrack of your life

date: 2024-05-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I've developed new appreciation for two musicians from my generation: George Harrison and Bob Dylan, thanks to the encouragement of two friends, both of whom have links to my childhood believe it or not, but who are current friends in my <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dotage">dotage</a> and they're both on Facebook. </p>
<p>So my first friend said she likes <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Harrison">George Harrison</a> the best of all the Beatles, and I thought that's weird because it really was down to Paul and John, I thought -- and then I heard this interview with George asking why he didn't explain in his memoir how he worshipped John as a kid, and George took exception, saying yeah in John's mind that's who I am, a kid who worshipped him, which I never did (says George). So now I have gone back through his music and see holy shit he really was as unique as either of the others, and he was more of a collaborator in his later life than either (of course we never got to find out how John would have evolved past 1980). And he was never going to be taken seriously by the others, so he had to get out of there to have the creative life he wanted. </p>
<p>About Dylan, the credit goes to my local friend and <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/song-173-all-along-the-watchtower-part-one-hes-not-the-messiah/">Andrew Hickey</a>, who focused my attention on the <i>music</i> of Dylan's songs, when I had only been focusing on the lyrics. Silly of me. He only ever wanted to be seen as a musician, not a leader of anything, and that's where the difficulty came from, and why I wasn't really interested, even though I had listened to all the Dylan songs many times, and had a few of his albums growing up. So I just played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangled_Up_in_Blue">Tangled Up in Blue</a> and realized this has been rolling around in my mind for days, and I wasn't even aware of it.</p>
<p>Kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Along_the_Watchtower">All Along the Watchtower</a> (another Dylan song) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar Galactica</a>, which I just heard is currently <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Battlestar-Galactica-Season-1/dp/B000UU2YKE">on Amazon</a>. I think it's time for another binge of that. ;-)</p>
<p>Anyway, two doors open, and that's always good. You know this is why you pick your music when you're young and stay with it, because it's the soundtrack of your life, and it has new relevance at every step of your evolution. Sure I listen to other music, but -- it's the songs that were big when I was little that matter most. </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-05-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW, there are plenty of relatively low priced <a href="https://www.stubhub.com/indiana-pacers-indianapolis-tickets-5-10-2024/event/152902691/?quantity=2">tickets available</a> at the Pacers arena for the May 10 game when the playoff heads to Indiana. This is one of the Knicks fans' favorite tactics. Since there are so many New Yorkers, spread out all over the country, and we're pretty much all Knicks fans, this can create a demoralizing effect for the opposition players who assume their hometown crowd will be rooting for them, not the other team. It had a pretty adverse effect on the Sixers a few days ago. I was chatting about this with fellow Knicks fan <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=NakedJen">NakedJen</a> during last night's harrowing game, and said this might be a good tactic somehow in the election, if every time the opposition had a rally they discovered that most of the attendees were actually in favor of democracy and abortion rights.

## P&B: Cory Dransfeldt

date: 2024-05-03, from: Manu - I write blog

You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>If you're enjoying the People and Blogs series and you want to see it grow, consider supporting on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>My name is Cory Dransfeldt and I'm located in Camarillo, California (a suburban town north of Los Angeles and where I grew up). I studied business in college and minored in economics. At the time I thought it was a practical choice and I was also terrified of the math involved in studying computer science. In hindsight, I wish I'd made a different choice, but don't necessarily regret the one I made at the time.</p>
<p>My first job out of college was working on the website of the local newspaper (I started as a freelance employee during college and became full-time after). This role was focused on updating the website with content the night before the print edition became available and was done in a utilitarian, but reliable Django-based CMS. I picked up some basic front end development knowledge working on multimedia projects and building my own tools to make the job easier.</p>
<p>I began to learn JavaScript by writing themes for <a href="http://bowtieapp.com/">Bowtie</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoute">Ecoute</a> as part of the MacThemes forum community. I expanded my web development knowledge by volunteering to build websites for metal bands I remain a fan of and friends with like <a href="https://linktr.ee/cyniconline">Cynic</a> and <a href="https://augurymetal.com/">Augury</a>. I gained a lot of knowledge and ended up with merch, concert tickets and some really great experiences out if it all.</p>
<p>I've built a career out of being a self-taught frontend-focused developer and have worked at startups, nationally recognized retailers (I've worked on every eCommerce stack short of Shopify) and several different SaaS providers. The backend developer I worked with at my first startup told me to learn languages and pickup frameworks as needed — that advice continues to serve me well.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, programming and blogging remain my favorite hobbies, along with searching for and discovering new music (I enjoy everything from artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits">Tom Waits</a> to punk acts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomeansno">NoMeansNo</a> and myriad death metal artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcass_(band)">Carcass</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy_(band)">Autopsy</a> and newer groups like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Mold">Tomb Mold</a>). If I'm not at the computer, I'm spending time with my lovely wife of 9 years, our two children and our 4 rescue dogs (all terrier/chihuahua mixes). I also mentor via <a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org/">Underdog Devs</a> and help organize the <a href="https://11tymeetup.dev/">Eleventy meetup</a>. I've been getting tattooed more over the past few years and am in the process of completing a sleeve on my right arm but am not sure that qualifies as a hobby.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I started blogging after I graduated from college in 2010 and have managed to recover posts dating back to 2013 that I've imported into the current iteration on my site. I was inspired by blogs like Daring Fireball and MacStories, though I don't follow them quite as closely as I once did. I viewed blogging as both a creative outlet and as a way to continue practicing web development by having my own project to experiment on and iterate with.</p>
<p>I started out on Tumblr, before moving to the first version of Kirby, then on to Statamic, Jekyll, Next.js, <a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>'s weblog service and now, finally (and quite happily) <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. All of these presented me with an opportunity to learn new languages, frameworks, tools and development approaches. I love the simplicity and flexibility of Eleventy and adore the community around both it and omg.lol. I like the simplicity of blogging under my own name and settled on a domain name that reflects both that and the development/technology focus.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>My creative process tends to be very informal — I read a lot of articles via the blogs I follow through RSS and enjoy both audio and written books. I'm interested in web development, the state of the industry and music, so my posts typically center around those topics (and, occasionally, how they connect or overlap). I'll often write a single draft, edit it for clarity, brevity and correctness before my confidence in the post wanes and publish it.</p>
<p>I want to grow into doing more research-focused writing to compliment these briefer pieces and am excited about that approach as an area where I can grow as a writer.</p>
<p>I write posts in markdown using <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> and then insert Eleventy frontmatter that I store as a snippet in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I typically write in an office that I share with my wife — I work from home and have a corner desk with my personal machine (a typically docked M2 MacBook Air), work machine and a lightly-used TV in between. I struggle to concentrate in silence and will typically write and program with death or black metal playing. I find the music helps me focus and the lack of intelligible lyrics keeps it from distracting me.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>My blog is hosted at Netlify and I pay for the pro plan while staying well under its limits, but this allows me the piece of mind to rebuild the site regularly to update <a href="https://coryd.dev/now">my now page</a> and other dynamically populated elements like <a href="https://coryd.dev/links/">my links page</a>.</p>
<p>I moved my domains to DNSimple last year after Gandi was acquired.</p>
<p>The code for my site is versioned and <a href="https://github.com/cdransf/coryd.dev">available to view at GitHub</a>. I use a GitHub action to trigger hourly rebuilds of my site, another to post content from a feed that combines my blog posts, shared links, read books and watched movies to Mastodon, another to add my blog posts to my README, another to test my site's performance using a <a href="https://speedlify.coryd.dev/">Speedlify instance</a> and yet another to retrieve and cache the chart data for music I've listened to over the last week from <a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/building-a-scrobbler-using-plex-webhooks-edge-functions-and-blob-storage/">the charts I derive from Plex</a> (this is then syndicated to Mastodon via the aforementioned feed and action).</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>If I were to start a blog today, I suppose I'd start from where I've arrived at now, but I don't think I could've arrived here without the experience and discovery I went through along the way. I'm not a particularly great designer, so I favor simplicity and performance in presentation and, from a technical perspective, 11ty really lends itself to that. I think I've found a set of tools and a community that I deeply enjoy engaging with.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>The expenses to run my site are fairly straightforward: hosting (Netlify), analytics (Clicky) and feed hosting/analytics (Feedpress). A quick estimate for a given year would be around $400 which I'm happy with for something I enjoy so much. There's also a tiny fee monthly for a Backblaze B2 bucket I use to cache JSON used to populate my links page (they're fetched from the Readwise Reader API which is paginated and rate-limited — this allows me to persist link data and puts less of a burden on their service).</p>
<p>I'm not opposed to bloggers monetizing their sites, but I appreciate when, say, content is clearly marked as sponsored. I have a Buy Me a Coffee link in my site's navigation, but nothing outside of that — if someone wants to send something along I appreciate it and, if not, that's totally fine too!</p>
<p>I support a few larger publications that started on and have since left Substack. Among my favorites are Paris Marx's <a href="https://disconnect.blog/">Disconnect</a> and <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/">Garbage Day</a>.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>I'll start off by saying I <em>love</em> the resurgence of blogs and personal sites we're seeing. I have a <a href="https://coryd.dev/blogroll">blogroll</a> on my site with some of my favorites (they're also bundled into a .opml file that you can download). <a href="https://rknight.me/">Robb Knight</a>'s blog remains one of my favorites — the design is stellar and he's constantly experimenting with and adding new features. I also thoroughly enjoy <a href="https://notes.neatnik.net/">Adam Newbold</a>'s writing and seeing what he's working on for omg.lol. I could go on and on I love <a href="https://gkeenan.co/avgb">Keenan</a>'s writing, <a href="https://blog.mayank.co/">Mayank</a> is a gifted developer and similarly talented writer, <a href="https://sarajoy.dev/">Sara Joy</a> is exceedingly kind and has created awesome projects like <a href="https://rs.sjoy.lol/">RS.S JOY.lol dev</a>. The internet's changing and seeing everyone writing and building makes me so happy.</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>If you want to mentor some great, deserving folks, check out <a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org/">Underdog Devs</a>. If you're building with Eleventy we'd love to have you <a href="https://11tymeetup.dev/">present at the meetup</a>. The best book I've finished this year has been <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/05de5de3-3572-4d50-b70e-651909502ca1"><em>NoMeansNo: From Obscurity to Oblivion</em></a> — they're my favorite band so, naturally,  I'm biased, but it's a fun read and is built around interviews with the band, their friends, family and other popular musicians. </p>
<p>I don't have any active side projects at the moment (but I'm kicking around some ideas) — fitting everything in is tough! I'd love to build something that makes it easier for small bands to quickly build lightweight websites that they can host anywhere and really bring my journey full circle — a static site generator as a service with portable code and easy CMS integration?  More robust than LinkTree, with less overhead than Squarespace and more open than both. I'm more interested in supporting musicians than I am in monetizing anything I suppose.</p>
<p>I'm also excited to see what Robb Knight is cooking up with <a href="https://echofeed.app/">EchoFeed</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! I post a lot on <a href="https://coryd.dev/">my site</a> and on <a href="https://social.lol/@cory">Mastodon</a> so come say hi!</p>

<p>You know what really grinds my gears?</p><p>At some point some real jerk-of-a-boss told his team, "I don't care if it's not done. Ship it anyway and we'll charge the customer to get the rest," and it actually worked. And now we get games that require DLCs to play anything. I hate that we fell for it and that guy probably got promoted. </p><p>(This is not a commentary on Unity's new CEO... but in a way...)</p>

## Lateral Thinking

date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog

For me, lateral thinking is:
Solving problems using an indirect and creative approach. Using reasoning that is not immediately obvious and involving ideas that might not be obtainable by using traditional step-by-step logic.
One &ldquo;simple&rdquo; approach to &ldquo;think outside the box&rdquo; is:
Understanding WHAT you want to achieve. Understanding WHY you want to achieve it. Knowing the rules of the game (constraints like environment, budget, physical limitations, etc.) Reframing WHAT you want in a way that ignores these rules of the game.

## Simplicity vs familiarity

date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog

I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about how we interact with technology, and I&rsquo;ve come to realize that being familiar with something doesn&rsquo;t always mean it&rsquo;s simple. In fact, it can sometimes make things more complicated.
For example, when I&rsquo;m working on code or documentation, I find myself getting too close to the issue. It&rsquo;s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture and get caught up in the details. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important for us to take a step back, look at our work from a different perspective, and ask for feedback.

## Microservices vs monoliths

date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog

Which architecture should I choose?
I don&rsquo;t think this is the right question to ask. A better question would be, given the current state of my service/product, which architecture will provide what I&rsquo;m looking for? For example, performance, independent deployments, application boundaries, etc.
For example, many people mention that we should start with a monolith and while I agree with some of the arguments (simplified development and deployment, consistent performance), it tends to ignore the fact that it might be better to prioritize freedom and experimentation at early stages rather than performance.

## My issue with Github Actions

date: 2024-05-02, from: Memo Garcia blog

GitHub actions are a problem because they lock you by the balls and you cannot reproduce your pipelines.
Getting to depend on all those small Actions saves 5 minutes today, only to make migrations immensely painful tomorrow.
Build, package, and release software should be written as standalone scripts that in principle could even run in the developer&rsquo;s machine. Moving them to CI is just changing the machine that will run the scripts.

## RISC OS Open 5.30 arrives with Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi support

date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News

This is, in a way, a mature OS with an ecosystem and an aftermarket. (Which, we feel we must explicitly spell out, means that quite a few of those third-party applications and drivers will cost you money.) There are emulators that will let you run 20th century Acorn apps that you can find online, but this isn&#8217;t an emulated vintage environment like Amiga Forever. It&#8217;s not meant for running games from thirty years ago. This is a native bare-metal OS, built on 1980s roots but updated for 21st century hardware. It&#8217;s also not an experimental project with little practical use, like Redox OS or Serenity OS, interesting though those are. ↫ Liam Proven at The Register I grew up with RISC OS and still run a RISC OS machine to this day. As Liam Proven explains affectionately in this article, while as an operating system it&#8217;s missing many features we now take for granted (memory protection, pre-emptive multitasking, compositing), some of the user interface ideas it implements still manage to feel advanced compared to modern-day desktops (no need for menu bars, no clunky file dialogues, elegant mouse button assignments). The fact it&#8217;s found a home on the Raspberry Pi and continues to support an active community is testament to its enduring appeal and the amazing work of the RISC OS Open project. Some additional notes from Thom: this new release supports 7 ARM platforms, most notably the Raspberry Pi Zero, 1, 2, 3 and 4 (but not the 5), and it even supports WiFi on the 3 and 4, which is an absolutely incredible achievement. The number of fixed bugs and addressed issues is massive, and there&#8217;s even more to come later during the year, as The Register&#8217;s article notes. I was waiting on this release to spur me on to buy a new Raspberry Pi (my only other Pi is our Pi-Hole), so I&#8217;ll definitely be on the lookout for a good deal. This release deserves my full attention for OSNews.

## The BASIC programming language turns 60

date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News

Sixty years ago, on May 1, 1964, at 4 am in the morning, a quiet revolution in computing began at Dartmouth College. That&#8217;s when mathematicians John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz successfully ran the first program written in their newly developed BASIC (Beginner&#8217;s All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language on the college&#8217;s General Electric GE-225 mainframe. Little did they know that their creation would go on to democratize computing and inspire generations of programmers over the next six decades. ↫ Benj Edwards at Ars Technica Even I have used BASIC in the past, when I was a child and discovered QBasic (or possibly GW-BASIC, I&#8217;m a bit hazy on the details) and started messing around with it. My experiences with BASIC didn&#8217;t lead to a path of ever more complex programming languages, but for huge numbers of people, it did &#8211; it&#8217;s wild just how many people over a certain age got their programming start with BASIC in the 8 bit home computer era. I mean, 30 GOTO 10 is such a widespread morsel of knowledge it made its way into all kinds of popular media, such as a few Easter egg jokes in Futurama. BASIC has effectively achieved immortality.

## Inside the Snapdragon 855’s iGPU

date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News

Qualcomm’s Adreno 6xx architecture has been superseded Adreno 7xx, but it’s still used in countless devices, including the current-gen Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3. Here, I’ll be looking at the Adreno 640 GPU in the Snapdragon 855. Zarif98 on Reddit kindly provided a OnePlus 7 Pro, and I’ll be using that to check out Adreno 640. Compared to the older Snapdragon 821’s Adreno 530, Adreno 640 dramatically increases compute throughput while still working within a very constrained power and thermal envelope. Process node improvements help, and TSMC’s 7 nm process should be far better than the 14 nm Samsung node used in the Snapdragon 821. But cell phone SoC constraints meant Qualcomm couldn’t go around copy-pasting basic GPU building blocks and call it a day. ↫ Chips and Cheese Chips and Cheese with another deep dive.

## At Microsoft, years of security debt come crashing down

date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News

Years of accumulated security debt at Microsoft are seemingly crashing down upon the company in a manner that many critics warned about, but few ever believed would actually come to light.&#160; Microsoft is an entrenched enterprise provider, owning nearly one-quarter of the global cloud infrastructure services market and, as of Q1 last year, nearly 20% of the worldwide SaaS application market, according to Synergy Research Group. Though not immune to scandal, in the wake of two major nation-state breaches of its core enterprise platforms, Microsoft is facing one of its most serious reputational crises. ↫ David Jones at Cybersecurity Dive It&#8217;s almost like having the entire US government dependent on a single vendor is a bad idea. Just spitballing here.

Apple (MacRumors): Today, we&#8217;re introducing two additional conditions in which the CTF is not required: First, no CTF is required if a developer has no revenue whatsoever. This includes creating a free app without monetization that is not related to revenue of any kind (physical, digital, advertising, or otherwise). This condition is intended to give [&#8230;]

## EagleFiler 1.9.14

date: 2024-05-02, from: Michael Tsai

EagleFiler 1.9.14 is a maintenance release for my Mac information organizer app. Some interesting bugs were: EagleFiler uses NSXMLParser to read Evernote&#8217;s ENEX files, which it then converts to standard RTF/RTFD files that any app can read. Some customers had files that were causing it to fail with NSXMLParserUndeclaredEntityError even though the referenced entities did [&#8230;]

## What became of 1999.io

date: 2024-05-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>TL;DR: It's gone -- you can't get <a href="http://1999.io/">there</a>. Because it uses Twitter for identity. It and bingeworthy.io are the two apps I miss the most. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+1999.io">1999 was a rewrite</a> of blogging software from the point of view of both 1999 and 2016. Both timeframes. I had learned a lot inbetween, and the art of online interaction had moved forward a lot. I had become a user of Facebook, and was impressed with how their software worked. I was imploring them to turn it into a blogging system, it was achingly close. When I realized they weren't going to do it, I set out to do it myself, how I imagined Facebook would do a blogging system. Of course I didn't have their source code, so I built it from scratch. </p>
<p>Because 1999 used Twitter for identity, I couldn't use it. I also couldn't use Radio, because it ran on Windows and a now-obsolete version of the Mac OS. It's made me think that maybe in a few years or even months you might not be able to use <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> or <a href="http://drummer.land/">Drummer</a>. Then I thought about how I can better future-safe them for users. And that led me to adding a simple feature to FeedLand that will help if a FeedLand server you depend on should go off the air. See the next post, below.</p>

## Protecting your FeedLand subscription lists

date: 2024-05-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First and foremost, you should keep a current backup copy of your subscription list. It's very easy to do. </p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>, choose <i>My feed list</i> in the first menu.</li>
<li>Click on the white-on-orange XML icon, in the upper right corner of the page.</li>
<li>That will open a standard OPML version of your subscription list. This is the format that all feed reading software understands. </li>
<li>In your browser, choose the <i>Save Page As</i> command in the File menu (or something like that, there are lots of browsers) and save it along with your other backups.</li>
<li>You can also automate it if you can run a script that gets stuff over the internet. Once a night would be fine, not a huge burden on the server. </li>
</ul>
<p>I added another way to preserve your feed list, using localStorage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every time you sign in FeedLand now saves a copy of your subscription list in localStorage. </li>
<li>And if the FeedLand server you're using should happen to disappear, if you have not taken a backup in a while, if you have a tab open, you'll at least have a copy in localStorage. </li>
<li>If you want to see it -- visit feedland.org or feedland.com, wherever you have an account, and do a hard reload. Then open the JavaScript console, and enter this line:</li>
<ul>
<li><code>console.log (localStorage.savedUserSubs)</code></li>
</ul>
<li>If you have questions, here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandSupport/issues/240">thread</a>.</li>

Whooping seems to be back. Shouting &#8216;whoo!&#8217; as a way of expressing your enthusiasm. Either that, or it never went away and I have grown inured to it. Explain it how you will, but after five whooping experiences in the last three weeks - one at a concert, one at a play, two at anniversary parties and one at Passover - I can now say definitively that I&#8217;m hearing it again.

## 2024-04-22 Gopher, again

date: 2024-05-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-22-gopher-again">2024-04-22 Gopher, again</h1>

<p>Having found a separate server, written in Go, monitored by systemd, to be the superior solution for double hosting my site for Gemini, I kept thinking about Gopher. With <a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> using a version of Markdown that is very close to the standard, and having found a library that I understand, more or less, which I had successfully grafted onto <a href="https://sr.ht/~gsthnz/satellite/">Satellite</a>, the Gemini server I’m using, based on renderer code I found in the <a href="https://github.com/tdemin/gmnhg">Hugo-to-Gemini converter</a> that used the same Markdown parsing library I was using for Oddµ, I figured that I might use the same library to turn Markdown into suitable Gopher pages.</p>

<p>It took some wrangling and it’s probably not great, but the main menu matches my front page and the blog posts look mostly OK, and so the site is back as a gopher hole on port 70!</p>

<p>See <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/markdown-gopher.git">Markdown Gopher</a> for the Gopher server code.</p>

<p>See my <a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/satellite.git">patched Satellite</a> for the Gemini server code, <a href="2023-11-03-other-ports">discussed back in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>And naturally I’m immediately annoyed by the lack of UTF-8 support in this client I’m using.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Gopher">#Gopher</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-05-01</strong>. I think I finally managed to get decent word-wrapping!</p>

<p><strong>2024-05-02</strong>. I think I&rsquo;m fine with the limitations I&rsquo;ve set myself for the Markdown Gopher server. It really leans into the plain text aesthetic.</p>

## IndieWeb Carnival: Natural creativity

date: 2024-05-02, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I spend the vast majority of my time doing creative work. I code for a living, sometimes I design for a living. I code as a hobby, sometimes I do design as a hobby. I also write. Being creative ain’t easy. At least not for me. I sit at my desk, staring at the same screen day after day and sometimes it’s hard to find inspiration. But every time I find myself stuck I can get unstuck with one simple trick: I leave.</p>
<p>My creative environment is when I’m outside, not trying to do anything creative. And this is especially true when I’m walking in nature. I’m not the first one to realise that there’s a connection between walking in nature and creativity. There’s something about moving through space that makes my brain work differently.</p>
<p>Nature is, more often than not, my creative environment. Back in 2019, I started a very random project called <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/writing-hiking-and-sharing">From the Summit</a>. It was an attempt to capture this exact phenomenon, the bursts of creativity born from moving through space. It’s easily my favourite digital experiment.</p>
<p>At the end of the day though, the only environment that matters, when it comes to creativity, is the mental space I’m in. That’s why I find nature so useful. The cadence of the walk, the sounds, the light, the smell. All the senses are engaged when I’m outside in nature and as a result, my brain becomes more creative.</p>
<p>The next time you’re creatively stuck, if you can, go for a walk in nature. You won’t regret it.</p>
<hr />
<p>This post was part of May's <a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">IndieWeb Carnival</a> on the topic of <a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/indie-web-carnival-may-2024-creative-environments/"><em>Creative environments</em></a>.

## pgEdge Distributed PostgreSQL Introduces Automatic DDL Replication and Snowflake Sequences for Postgres

date: 2024-05-02, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>New capabilities advance state of the art in Postgres logical replication</p>
<p>Alexandria, VA - April 17, 2024 - pgEdge, Inc., the leading company dedicated to distributed Postgres, today unveiled two major advances in logical replication for the widely adopted open-source PostgreSQL database. These are automatic DDL (Data Definition Language) replication, and snowflake sequences, an innovative solution to the problem of maintaining unique sequence identifiers across a distributed Postgres cluster.  pgEdge Distributed PostgreSQL is the first and only fully distributed PostgreSQL database solution that is open (source available) and completely based on the PostgreSQL database itself.</p>
<p>Automatic Replication of DDL Commands.
DDL is used to create and modify Postgres objects like tables, indexes, views and constraints through command statements like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.  DML (data manipulation language) is used to perform operations on the data within those database objects through command statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.  </p>
<p>Traditionally, logical replication in Postgres only allowed for the replication of DML statements and not DDL.  Manual efforts were required on each node to modify table definitions through DDL commands that had to be executed on every node. </p>
<p>With the introduction of automatic DDL replication on pgEdge, developers can now update the database schema on a single node and have it automatically propagated to other nodes in the cluster. This feature makes it far easier to support distributed Postgres applications where the database schema is frequently updated because of active development or maintenance. </p>
<p>Snowflake Sequence in Postgres Extension:
Managing sequences in a distributed PostgreSQL environment can be complex, especially in multi-master replication scenarios.  A Postgres sequence provides a unique integer number to use as an ID for the database table and its records. If you insert new records it will assign the next number in the sequence without issue.  </p>
<p>In a distributed application, however, the sequence must be updated across different regions and if each node updates the sequence independently you will have conflicts that cannot be resolved.  For example, if a sequence is being used as a primary key, the next value of the sequence on a node in the US could be selected at the exact same time the next value of the sequence is selected on a node in Australia, resulting in a primary key conflict.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, pgEdge has integrated snowflake sequences into a Postgres extension. A snowflake sequence allows for the utilization of a guaranteed unique sequence within a cluster without the need for application code or schema modifications. By automatically installing the Snowflake extension in pgEdge Platform and pgEdge Cloud databases, users can easily maintain unique sequence numbers across different regions, eliminating conflicts and enhancing scalability. </p>
<p>An exclusive presentation and paper on the Snowflake extension will be showcased at the Silicon Valley Postgres conference in San Jose this week.</p>
<p>“By offering these cutting-edge capabilities built on open, standard-based Postgres, we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to making advanced distributed Postgres capabilities available to the Postgres community. Our goal is to make it easier and faster to deliver distributed Postgres applications that are always on, always available and always responsive,” remarked Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO of pgEdge.</p>
<p>Availability
Automatic DDL Replication and Snowflake Sequences are available now within both pgEdge Platform (self hosted) or pgEdge Cloud (fully managed cloud service).</p>
<p>For more information, to signup for pgEdge Cloud, or to download pgEdge Platform, visit www.pgedge.com.  To learn how to configure pgEdge’s Auto DDL, view the documentation at https://docs.pgedge.com/platform/advanced/autoddl.  The pgEdge Snowflake extension is available on the project's GitHub repository at https://github.com/pgEdge/snowflake-sequences. </p>
<p>About pgEdge
pgEdge, the leading company dedicated to distributed Postgres, has made its mission to make it easy for developers to build and deploy highly distributed database applications across the global network. Founded by industry veterans who have championed enterprise usage of the PostgreSQL database for several decades and helped run the world’s largest managed database cloud services, pgEdge is headquartered in Northern Virginia.

## Chinese Tencent-owned Riot Games installs rootkit on every League of Legends players’ computer

date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News

With 14.9, Vanguard, Riot’s proprietary Anti-Cheat system will be deployed and active in League of Legends. This means that active enforcement of Vanguard will be in effect and working hard to make sure your queues are free from scripters, botters, and cheaters! We recently released a blog detailing the “why” behind bringing Vanguard to League that you can check out here. It’s a bit of a long read, but it does have some pictures. ↫ Lilu Cabreros in the League of Legends patch notes The basic gist is that Vanguard is a closed-source, kernel-level rootkit for Windows that runs at all times, with the supposed goal of detecting and banning cheaters from playing League of Legends. This being a rootkit designed specifically to inject itself into the Windows kernel, it won&#8217;t work on Linux, and as such, the entire League on Linux community, which has been playing League for years now and even at times communicated with Riot employees to keep the game running, is now gone. Interestingly enough, Riot is not implementing Vanguard on macOS, which League of Legends also supports &#8211; because Apple simply doesn&#8217;t allow it. This is probably the most invasive, disturbing form of anticheat we&#8217;ve seen so far, especially since it involves such a hugely popular game. It&#8217;s doubly spicy because Riot Games is owned by Tencent, a Chinese company, which means a company owned and controlled by the Chinese government now has rootkits installed on the roughly 150 million players&#8217; computers all over the world. While we&#8217;re all (rightly, in my opinion) worried about TikTok, China just slipped 150 million rootkits onto computers all over the world. One really has to wonder where these increasingly invasive, anti-privacy and anti-user anticheat measures are going from here. Now that this rootkit can keep tabs on literally every single thing you do on your Windows computer, what&#8217;s going to be the next step? Anticheat might have to move towards using webcams to watch you play to prevent you from cheating, because guess what? The next level of cheating is already here, and it doesn&#8217;t even involve your computer. Earlier this year, hardware maker MSI showed off a gaming monitor that uses &#8220;AI&#8221; to see what&#8217;s going on on your monitor, and then injects overlays onto your monitor to help you cheat. MSI showed off how the monitor will use the League of Legends minimap to follow enemy champions and other relevant content, and then show warnings on your screen when enemies approach from off-screen. All of this happens entirely on the monitor&#8217;s hardware, and never sends any data whatsoever to the computer it&#8217;s attached to. It&#8217;s cheating that literally cannot be detected by anything running on your computer, rootkit or not. So, the only logical next step as such forms of cheating become more advanced and widespread is to force users to turn on their webcams, and point them at their displays. I fired up League of Legends today on my gaming computer &#8211; which runs Linux, of course &#8211; and after the League client &#8220;installed&#8221; the rootkit, it just got stuck in an endless loop of asking me to restart the client. I&#8217;ve been playing League of Legends for close to 14 years, and while I know the game &#8211; and especially its community &#8211; has a deservedly so bad reputation, I&#8217;ve always enjoyed the game with friends, and especially with my wife, who&#8217;s been playing for years and years as well. Speaking of my wife &#8211; even though she runs Windows and could easily install the rootkit if she wanted to, she has some serious doubts about this. When I explained what the Vanguard rootkit can do, her mouse pointer slowly moved away from the &#8220;Update&#8221; button, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about this&#8230;&#8221;

If you're a blogger, here's something to think about. Whose writing influenced the way you write? Here's my list: Kurt Vonnegut, My uncle Ken (not his writing, rather his way of telling stories), my father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker">Russell Baker</a>, Robert Hunter (lyricist for the Dead), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Coupland">Douglas Coupland</a> (specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microserfs">MicroSerfs</a>), the Suck.com guys, everyone who was writing at Hotwired in 1995. I'll think of others, but those are the ones who come to mind. I have been a constant reader since I was a little kid, so there's a mix of writing styles from authors I don't immediately remember. I should also do one of these lists for who inspired my software.

It felt like the Knicks had won the game when Maxie single-handedly pulled the Sixers back into contention. Now the Knicks are up 3-2 with the next game in Philadelphia tomorrow night. But! I didn't flip out this time like I did for the last game, and I think it was because I was able to watch it on <a href="https://www.msgnetworks.com/">local TV</a> with the familiar play by play guy, Mike Breen, and the best color guy for any sport, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=walt+clyde+frazier">Walt Clyde Frazier</a>. If he wasn't flipping out why should I. One of the things I love about his <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=clydisms">narration</a> is that he uses words incorrectly, kind of like <a href="https://thelastdrivein.com/2015/07/02/the-archie-bunker-malapropism-dictionary-of-mangled-english/">Archie Bunker</a>. I keep wanting to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means">say</a> "I do not think it means what you think it means," but then I realized, last night, for the first time, it's freaking poetry! A lot of it even rhymes. And it's a poem that will go on as long as the Knicks do. Unfortunately I don't think the MSG crew is going to be doing the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+schedule&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=nba+schedule&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i56i59j0i131i433i512j0i20i263i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512l3j0i512.30465j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11vwxq3z2y;3;/m/05jvx;dt;fp;1;;;">next game</a>. And btw, they do a much better job of camera work than ESPN. Maybe it's because the TV people have been able to iterate the camera setup the same way I iterate the UI of a piece of software. The same company owns the TV network as owns the arena as owns the team. It's all totally horizontally integrated. At dinner the other night a friend asked, if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Dolan">owner</a> of the Knicks wasn't a putz. I said of course, he's the worst but, the Knicks now are being well managed. So maybe he's mellowed out a bit?

## Linux Mint: non-GNOME GTK desktop environments need to work together in the face of libadwaita

date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News

Anyone who has spent any time recently using non-GNOME GTK desktop environments, like Cinnamon, MATE, or Xfce, has had to deal with the unfortunate reality of a lot of GTK applications becoming GNOME applications instead, using GNOME&#8217;s own libadwaita. These applications are hard to theme, and do not integrate at all with the proper GTK applications non-GNOME desktop environments ship with. With how popular GNOME is, this has meant that the number of non-GNOME GTK applications has been dwindling. Linux Mint, the popular Linux distribution that also develops the Cinnamon desktop environment, has long made a bundle of GTK applications called XApps &#8211; basically forks of various core GNOME 3.x applications to ensure they would have access to non-GNOME GTK applications. With GNOME effectively forking GTK into its own, unique, GNOME-specific style (like libaidwaita), other GTK environments have suffered, and XApps were intended to close that gap. That hasn&#8217;t really happened though, as XApps remained mostly a Mint-only thing, managed by Mint, as part of the Mint/Cinnamon GitHub projects. Other distributions and GTK desktop environments, such as Xfce, MATE, Budgie, and so on, didn&#8217;t really pick them up. The Linux Mint project intends to change that, and will &#8216;spin off&#8217; the XApps into its own, dedicated, independent project to facilitate cross-distribution and cross-DE collaboration, decision-making and development, all in an effort to ensure the long-term viability of non-GNOME GTK desktop environments. They also intend to fork a lot more of the GNOME 3 applications, for the same reason I mentioned earlier: GNOME applications are no longer GTK applications, but GNOME applications &#8211; they look and feel horribly out of place in environments that don&#8217;t use the GNOME-specific libadwaita. As such, Celluloid, GNOME Calculator, Simple Scan, Baobab, System Monitor, GNOME Calendar, File Roller, and Zenity were recently downgraded in Linux Mint to their last GTK 3 versions, and will most likely be forked in the near future. In addition, the Adwaita theme, the default GNOME/GTK theme, will be removed from the list of available themes in Cinnamon 6.2. Adwaita, too, has become increasingly GNOME-only, and thus, increasingly broken on non-GNOME desktop environments. Flat-our removing Adwaita altogether is not possible, since it&#8217;s a GTK dependency, but hiding it from the theme selector is not an issue, of course. As project lead Clément Lefèbvre writes: libAdwaita is for GNOME and GNOME only. We can’t blame GNOME for this, they’ve been very clear about it from the start. It was made specifically for GNOME to have more freedom and build its own ecosystem without impacting GTK. We want to send a strong signal upstream and towards other projects. We cannot and will not support applications which do not support our users and environments. We can’t promote applications to our users which don’t support our users. The software manager will be vigilant towards that going forward and list compatible software by default. ↫ Clément Lefèbvre All of this is great news to hear. I&#8217;ve been making extensive use of Xfce on OpenBSD lately, and on the Fedora Xfce spin in the weeks before that, and the situation has become almost comical. If you install any GNOME application on Xfce, theming just breaks down completely, as most themes are either not made to support the massive headerbars GNOME uses, or they do support it but still look horribly out of place compared to the more sane titlebar plus menubar plus toolbar layout of traditional desktop environments like Xfce. I&#8217;ve long been saying that the non-GNOME GTK desktop environments need to work together to formulate an answer to the onslaught of libadwaita and the GNOME-ification of GTK, because each of them risks becoming entirely tied to whatever GNOME and libadwaita decides to do, for better or worse. It seems the Linux Mint team has finally realised this as well, and I really hope &#8211; and strongly suggest &#8211; Xfce, MATE, and others join them as well. If they don&#8217;t, there won&#8217;t be an Xfce in a few years. What&#8217;s the point in developing Xfce if you&#8217;re at the mercy of whatever choices GNOME makes?

## Redox gets USB HID support

date: 2024-05-01, from: OS News

Another month, another detailed report about the progress made in Redox, the Rust-based operating system. A major improvements this month is support for USB HID, allowing USB keyboards and mice to work on Redox, but the project does note USB hubs are still problematic and might not work properly. Thanks to these USB improvements, Redox&#8217; desktop environment Orbital now also ran on ARM64 in Qemu for the first time, which is a great step towards running it on real ARM64 hardware. A massive documentation pass has also taken place, fixing various errors and improving and simplifying the writing. More programs have been ported, of course, and various lower-level improvements and fixes, along with a number of other fixes and changes across the operating system.

## Seeking consultancy: understanding joining obstacles for non-member journals

<p>Crossref is undertaking a large program, dubbed <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">'RCFS' (Resourcing Crossref for Future Sustainability)</a> that will initially tackle five specific issues with our fees. We haven’t increased any of our fees in nearly two decades, and while we’re still okay financially and do not have a revenue growth goal, we do have inclusion and simplification goals. <a href="https://www.crossref.org/pdfs/research-consulting-rcfs-report-public.pdf">This report from Research Consulting</a> helped to narrow down the five priority projects for 2024-2025 around these three core goals:</p>

</ol>
</span>
</div>
<h2 id="work-to-date">Work to date</h2>
<p>As part of the RCFS program, we are working closely with our Membership &amp; Fees Committee to discuss insights, gather feedback, and make recommendations to the Board. As a first step, we have surveyed and received responses from around 1000 of the current 8,000 Crossref members in our lowest membership fee tier ($275 USD). We are now starting to distill that data and will discuss it on our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/the-shape-of-things-to-come">community call on May 8th</a> and subsequently with the M&amp;F Committee to inform recommendations for fee changes that may going into effect in 2025 or 2026.</p>
<h2 id="request-for-information-rfi-about-community-consultation-project">Request For Information (RFI) about community consultation project</h2>
<p>While we have useful data from existing Crossref members, we know that there are many thousands of journals that are not (yet) members, and we need to understand this group better, in particular, to document and address the financial obstacles as well as the technical or social challenges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for community facilitation expertise, with multiple language skills, to conduct a series of focus groups with non-member journals, with a summary and insights report (in English) provided by the end of June 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the data and documentation will be available publicly on the dedicated <a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/">RCFS Program website</a></p>
<p>As well as designing, conducting, and summarising the results of some focus groups (participants for which will be gathered via our own contacts and those of partners such as DOAJ, EIFL, and the Free Journal Network) we would like the consultant to review work such as the <a href="https://diamasproject.eu/diamas-results-institutional-landscape-survey/" target="_blank">DIAMAS institutional publishing report</a>, and identify data relevant to Crossref’s fee model.</p>
<p>If you would like to respond, please provide the following information and send it to Kora Korzec at <a href="mailto:feedback@crossref.org">feedback@crossref.org</a> by <strong>15th May</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your consultancy organisation and your role within it</li>
<li>Examples of similar market research undertaken</li>
<li>Languages spoken within your team</li>
<li>Confirmation that the timeline is workable</li>
<li>Approximate fee, likely range, or structure/basis for your fee</li>
</ul>
<p>Equally, if you represent a journal or group of journals, such as Diamond Open Access journals, and are not yet using Crossref, please get in touch and we can include your group in the research.</p>

## You can’t just assume UTF-8

date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News

Humans speak countless different languages. Not only are these languages incompatible, but runtime transpilation is a real pain. Sadly, every standardisation initiative has failed. At least there is someone to blame for this state-of-affairs: God. It was him, after-all, who cursed humanity to speak different languages, in an early dispute over a controversial property development. However, mankind can only blame itself for the fact that computers struggle to talk to each other. And one of the biggest problems is the most simple: computers do not agree on how to write letters in binary. ↫ Cal Paterson For most users, character encoding issues are not something they have to deal with. Programmers and other people who deal with the lower levels of computing, however, deal with this way more often than they should.

## A few facts about POSIX

date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News

Over 35 years ago, these problems with software portability led to the emergence of the first POSIX standard in 1988. The acronym was coined by Richard Stallman, who added &#8220;X&#8221; to the end of Portable Operating System Interface. It&#8217;s meant to provide a specification of the interface that different Unix operating systems should have in common, including programming languages and tools. It&#8217;s important to note that the interface is portable, and not the implementation. ↫ vorakl While POSIX certainly isn&#8217;t perfect, and support for it in various operating systems claiming to support POSIX even less so, there&#8217;s no denying its success. Even if the dream of 100% source code portability isn&#8217;t possible under POSIX for applications that are a little more complex than basic CLI tools, there&#8217;s enough portability that platforms like Linux, the various BSDs, macOS, and others, can share quite a bit of code. One of my favourite things about POSIX is that it shows up in the most unexpected of places. Windows, for instance, has had various options for POSIX compatibility, some of which straight from Microsoft itself, like the currently well-known Windows Subsystem for Linux, but also mostly forgotten options like the Microsoft POSIX subsystem that shipped with Windows NT until Windows 2000, or the very rudimentary POSIX compatibility in the Windows C Runtime Library and Windows Sockets API. OS/2 had POSIX compatibility as well, through EMX (Eberhard Mattes eXtender). It gave OS/2 &#8211; and MS-DOS &#8211; a POSIX API, and even provided access to native OS/2 APIs as well, and could run 32bit applications. You&#8217;d be surprised by how many more operating systems offered forms of POSIX compatibility, either out of the box or through first or third party add-ons.

## RISC-V support in Android just got a big setback

date: 2024-04-30, from: OS News

Although Google has shown significant progress in recent weeks in improving RISC-V support in Android, it seems that we’re still quite a bit away from seeing RISC-V hardware running certified builds of Android. Earlier today, a Senior Staff Software Engineer at Google who, according to their LinkedIn, leads the Android Systems Team and works on Android’s Linux kernel fork, submitted a series of patches to AOSP that “remove ACK’s support for riscv64.” The description of these patches states that “support for risc64 GKI kernels is discontinued.” ↫ Mishaal Rahman Google provided Android Authority with a statement, claiming that Android will continue to support RISC-V. What these patches do, however, is remove support for the architecture from the Generic Kernel Image, which is the only type of kernel Google certifies for Android, which means that it is now no longer possible to ship a certified Android device that uses RISC-V. Any OEM shipping a RISC-V Android device will have to create and maintain its own kernel fork with the required patches. This doesn&#8217;t seem to align with Google&#8217;s statement. So, unless Google intends to add RISC-V support back into GKI, there won&#8217;t be any officially certified Android devices running on RISC-V. Definitely an odd chain of events here.

## It's different after its gone

date: 2024-04-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>Note: This post is the summary of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/30/weNeedMoreChange.m4a">podcast</a>. </i></p>
<p>When my mother died in 2018, it didn't settle in that the context in which I lived, my whole life, was gone. </p>
<p>She lived in the house I was raised in. Very little had changed in that house. I hadn't lived there since I went away to college, but it still defined who I was, an adult who didn't live in his childhood home. When we sold the house, the last time I saw it, it was empty, and that was when it hit me. That part of my life is over. I no longer have a home I can return to.</p>
<p>The same is true with our understanding of who we are as adult American citizens. Until now we felt we had a vote. But that is over, unless we change our view of the country we live in. It's not that it's about to change, which is what you hear in the news, and on social web -- <i>it has already changed. </i></p>
<p>We now understand that Trump may be above the law but that masks a bigger truth, the Supreme Court is already above the law. They take bribes, openly. They cannot be prosecuted (just try it and see what happens). They openly side with the insurrection, yet don't recuse when deciding issues of what to do with the insurrectionists. They imagine the president is a monarch. </p>
<p>We're already living in the authoritarian state we're worried about. We haven't caught up with that reality yet. </p>
<p>Our government is more concerned about our right to own guns than it is with our right to own our own bodies. Stop for a moment and let that sink in. If I said you don't own your own body, what would you think I'm talking about? Answer: Slavery. </p>
<p>If we did catch up with that reality, we would start organizing now to undo that mistake. We would not only re-elect Biden in a landslide, but we'd insist that he expand the court to 100 members serving 10-year terms each, retroactive. And thus we would eliminate one of the huge problems in our system of government. Have they proved they need this kind of correction? Yes, the overturning of Roe, and the lack of prosecution of Trump for trying to overthrow the government are all the proof we need. </p>
<p>And from then-on, no politician in any branch of government would take us for granted.</p>

The Company Rockwell International has been around for quite a while. Willard Rockwell started the company in 1919 to sell a newly designed truck axle bearing. Over the years, Rockwell acquired businesses in many different fields, including defense, industrial electronics, automotive components, and more. They built both the Apollo spacecraft and the Space Shuttle program. In 1967, they merged with North American Aviation. Before the merger, North American Aviation had developed a

## 9front “DO NOT INSTALL” released

date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News

There&#8217;s a new 9front release! So, what exactly is 9front, you may ask? Well, after it became clear that Bell Labs wasn&#8217;t doing much with plan9, a group of developers took matters into their own hands and created 9front, a fork of plan9. Their latest release is called DO NOT INSTALL, and brings things like more USB audio support, DNS over TLS, WiFi support for the Raspberry Pi, I2C support, and much more. I&#8217;m not particularly well-versed in the world of plan9, and more often than not it feels like a form of high-level programming performance art that I&#8217;m just not smart enough to understand. The whole community and its associated web sites have a very unique feel to it, and I always feel like I&#8217;m just not cool enough to be part of it. That&#8217;s not a dig at the plan9 community &#8211; it&#8217;s more of an indictment of my lack of coolness. Which really shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise.

## run0: a systemd-based, more secure replacement for sudo

date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News

Lennart Poettering, main developer of systemd, has announced run0, a systemd-based replacement for the well-known sudo command that fixes many of he inherent issues with the widely used tool to gain temporary elevated privileges. There are various problems with sudo, which basically come down to that it&#8217;s a large SUID binary, meaning it consists of privileged code that unprivileged users can run from their own context. This makes sudo a fairly large attack surface, and why OpenBSD uses doas instead; while doas suffers from the same main problem, it&#8217;s much smaller and reduces the attack surface considerably. SUID processes are weird concepts: they are invoked by unprivileged code and inherit the execution context intended and controlled by unprivileged code. By execution context I mean the myriad of properties that a process has on Linux these days, from environment variables, process scheduling properties, cgroup assignments, security contexts, file descriptors passed, and so on and so on. A few of these settings the kernel is nice enough to clean up automatically when a SUID binary is invoked, but much of it has to be cleaned up by the invoked suid binary. This has to be done very very carefully, and history has shown that SUID binaries are generally pretty shit at that. ↫ Lennart Poettering Poettering wants to address this problem, and has come up with run0, which behaves like sudo, but works entirely differently and is not SUID. Run0 asks the services manager to create a shell or command under the target user&#8217;s ID, creating a new PTY, sending data back and forth from the originating TTY and the new PTY. Or in other words: the target command is invoked in an isolated exec context, freshly forked off PID 1, without inheriting any context from the client (well, admittedly, we *do* propagate $TERM, but that&#8217;s an explicit exception, i.e. allowlist rather than denylist). One could say, &#8220;run0&#8221; is closer to behaviour of &#8220;ssh&#8221; than to &#8220;sudo&#8221;, in many ways. Except that it doesn&#8217;t bother with encryption or cryptographic authentication, key management and stuff, but instead relies on the kernel&#8217;s local identification mechanisms. run0 doesn&#8217;t implement a configuration language of its own btw (i.e. no equivalent of /etc/sudoers). Instead, it just uses polkit for that, i.e. how we these days usually let unpriv local clients authenticate against priv servers. ↫ Lennart Poettering This approach addresses a whole slew of attack vectors on sudo, and it comes with fun additional features like being able to give your terminal a different background tint when using it, or displaying a little red dot in the terminal window title to further indicate you&#8217;re using elevated privileges. It will ship as part of the upcoming release of systemd 256.

## Microsoft At Work

date: 2024-04-29, from: OS News

Well, this was a wild goose chase of a read. J. B. Crawford dove into the history of something I&#8217;ve never heard of &#8211; Microsoft At Work &#8211; and came away with a story that&#8217; while clearer thanks to his research, is still frustratingly nebulous. I&#8217;m still not entirely sure what Microsoft At Work really was, but I think it had the goal of running Windows on communications devices like faxes, to make it easier to share and work on documents across various devices. Crawford did a lot of digging, and eventually settles on what he thinks might be a description of what MAW really consisted of. I am being a bit dismissive for effect. MAW was more ambitious than just installing Windows on a grape. The effort included a unified communications protocol for the control of office machines, including printers, for which a whole Microsoft stack was envisioned. This built on top of the Windows Printing System, a difficult-to-search-for project that apparently predated MAW by a short time, enough so that Windows Printing System products were actually on the market when MAW was announced&#8212;MAW products were, we will learn, very much not.  MAW devices like the Ricoh IFS77 ran 16-bit Windows 3.1 with a new GUI intended to appear more modern while reducing resource requirements. Some reporters at the time noted that Microsoft was cagey about the supported architectures, I suspect they were waiting on ports to be completed. The fax machine was probably x86, though, as there&#8217;s little evidence MAW actually ran on anything else. ↫ J. B. Crawford The &#8217;90s were a wild time, especially as Microsoft, and this MAW project seems to have &#8217;90s written all over it, but I&#8217;d still love to learn a lot more about this. I hope this article will bring out some former Microsoft execs or employees who can give us more details, and possibly even some code. I want to know how this works and what it did.

## The first video game, Spacewar!, on the DEC PDP-1 in your browser

This is a virtual DEC PDP-1 (emulated in HTML5/JavaScript) running the original code of &#8220;Spacewar!&#8221;, the earliest known digital video game. If available, use gamepads or joysticks for authentic gameplay — the game was originally played using custom “control boxes”. Spacewar! was conceived in 1961 by Martin Graetz, Stephen Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen. It was first realized on the PDP-1 in 1962 by Stephen Russell, Peter Samson, Dan Edwards, and Martin Graetz, together with Alan Kotok, Steve Piner, and Robert A Saunders. ↫ Norbert Landsteiner It&#8217;s wild to me that even for the very first video game, they already made what are effectively controllers anyone today could pick up and use. Note that this emulator can run more than just Spacewar!.

## Thoughts on Cosmotechnics

date: 2024-04-29, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>A fine post by Ethan Marcotte called <a href="https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/the-negotiation-cycle/"><em>The negotiation cycle</em></a> led me to an incredible essay by Alan Jacobs called <a href="https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/from-tech-critique-to-ways-of-living"><em>From Tech Critique to Ways of Living</em></a>. It references an old idea called “The SCT<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>” which is new to me but based on thinking by the likes of Ursula Franklin and Neil Postman who I am familiar with. Neil Postman’s <em>Technopoly</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> –which I read in March– was one of the best books on technology I’ve ever read, so this is relevant for me.</p>
<p>Jacobs’ essay takes an unexpected yet welcome turn towards Daoism linking to a heavier essay by Yuk Hui called <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/86/161887/cosmotechnics-as-cosmopolitics/"><em>Cosmotechnics and Cosmopolitics</em></a>. I’m not smart enough to fully understand all these philosophical (epistemological?) arguments<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>, but reading the word “cosmotechnics” felt like a beacon in the night for a concept I’ve intuitively felt but never had a word to describe. In Hui’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me give you a preliminary definition of cosmotechnics: it is the unification of the cosmos and the moral through technical activities, whether craft-making or art-making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that science and technology are moral. Try as we may to divorce a tool from an outcome, there is always an interplay. As a contrived example, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component and it would by itself be morally neutral. But if I make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that someone with a disability cannot use, then I have made a moral decision through either action or inaction. Similarly, I can make a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> that puts a stuffed animal in a digital shopping cart, that is morally neutral. But if that stuffed animal is knowingly assembled with child labor and dropshipped from afar with an immense carbon cost relative to the value of the item, I have made an immoral <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code>. It’s not hard for me to imagine that someone somewhere is making a <code>&lt;Button/&gt;</code> component that launches a nuclear missile…</p>
<p>In the words of Dr. King from his sermon <em><a href="https://daverupert.com/2019/06/the-three-evils-of-society/">The Three Evils of Society</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided missiles and misguided men.”<br />
– Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if you believe technology is moral, then the next larger follow up question is “Whose morals?”</p>
<hr />
<p>This question of “Whose morals?” permeates my thoughts, specifically in regards to global challenges like climate change. Call me unpatriotic, but I don’t think rugged American individualism is going to manifest destiny our way out of the climate crisis. A technological breakthrough seems unlikely. We need to rely on the knowledge and experiences of African, Asian, and Indigenous societies who have a different ontology, a different Dao (a code of behavior that is in harmony with the natural order); one that prioritizes the group over the individual. In less metaphysical terms, I believe we need to listen to societies built on cooperation and sharing of limited resources over societies built on the continuous expansion of dominion through exploitation of markets, labor, and people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need a new language of cosmopolitics to elaborate this new world order that goes beyond a single hegemon.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with Hui that a singular perspective cannot and will not solve the current crisis we are facing. Technology alone will not save us. We need scientific power in the hands of moral-powered men and women. And the longer we wait the more we risk erasing the communities and ancient knowledge we need to find an equitable solution.</p>
<hr />
<p>Climate change, geopolitical conflict, the rise of authoritarianism brought about by social media companies… these are all large problems that take governments decades to solve. That puts cosmotechnics far away from me, a would-be practitioner. Hui thankfully provides a story from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)">Zhuangzi</a></em>; the butcher Pao Ding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pao Ding is excellent at butchering cows. He claims that the key to being a good butcher doesn’t lie in mastering certain skills, but rather in comprehending the Dao. Replying to a question from Duke Wen Huei about the Dao of butchering cows, Pao Ding points out that having a good knife is not necessarily enough; it is more important to understand the Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter into the gaps between them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of web development I like. It agrees with me. I better understand the <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/dao/">Dao of web design</a>. Our apps and websites are like water, flowing in and out of viewports. Contextualizing themselves to the recipient’s limitations or preferences. Those who find the easier paths through the gaps become excellent butchers of websites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pao Ding adds that a good butcher has to change his knife once a year because he cuts through tendons, while a bad butcher has to change his knife every month because he cuts through bones. Pao Ding, on the other hand—an <em>excellent</em> butcher—has not changed his knife in nineteen years, and it looks as if it has just been sharpened with a whetstone. Whenever Pao Ding encounters any difficulty, he slows down the knife and gropes for the right place to move further.</p>

<p>Another translation I read phrased the bad butcher as “hacking” through bones and what a serviceable metaphor we’ve found! The knife, a technology. The medium, a cow or software. Our tools will last longer if we learn how to slow down and understand the nature of the medium, <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">the grain</a>, rather than hacking against it.</p>
<p>The hustle and bustle of capitalism and keeping up with the zeitgeist makes this hard. There’s a pressure to keep up, lest you fall off the cliff of irrelevance. After all, technology always only advances and there’s always a better knife in the distance… right?</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve heard myself referred to as a “curmudgeon”, “old guard”, “gatekeeper”, and “dinosaur”. That is due in part to my loudmouthed punditry but also because I dislike a specific technology from an <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-part-i-the-setup">immoral company</a> that does our industry, society, and users irreparable harm. Moving fast and rethinking best practices spawned untold lifetimes worth of human hours dedicated to knife swapping each year. And when tools dull, we throw stones at each other.</p>
<p>I’ve always been overly cautious and considered in the tools I use but I’ve never thought of the tools I use as  a moral choice. Perhaps now I will. I’m not a Daoist by any means, but this idea of <em>cosmotechnics</em> begins to provide a mental framework for expressing the relationship between technology and morality. From the large scale of the cosmos to the small scale of the knife, I’m glad to have vocabulary to think about future problems.</p>

<p>My library’s copy of <em>Technoloply</em> had a copyright date of 2012. A ten year old book being so relevant to me in 2024 was impressive. But that was the reprint date!

<p>One nuanced point I disagree with Hui on is on who should hold the leading power in this new cosmopolitical system.

We shouldn’t use new technology to reinstate old Cold War era superpowers of oppression. We need something entirely new. That said, I sit in a comfortable seat of privilege and systemic power well within the borders of the American Empire… <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

## more rational choices

date: 2024-04-28, from: Ayjay blog

My recent posts on how I choose what fiction to read and what’s going on with the publishing industry share a theme: perverse incentives. (Indeed, it seems that a lot of my writing is about perverse incentives, but more about that another time.) The intellectual/political monoculture of the modern university leads to an intellectual/political monoculture [&#8230;]

## Windows NT and NetWare on PA-RISC, and a HP-UX port to x86

date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News

Back when I was working on my article about PA-RISC, HP-UX, and UNIX workstations in general, I made extensive use of OpenPA, Paul Weissmann&#8217;s invaluable and incredibly detailed resource about HP&#8217;s workstation efforts, HP-UX, and tons of related projects and products. Weissmann&#8217;s been doing some serious digging, and has unearthed details about a number of essentially forgotten operating system efforts. First, it turns out HP was porting Windows NT to PA-RISC in the early &#8217;90s. Several magazine sources and USEnet posts around 1993 point to HP pursuing a PA-RISC port to NT, modified the PA-RISC architecture for bi-endianess and even conducted a back-room presention at the ’94 Comdex conference of a (modified HP 712?) PA-7100LC workstation running Windows NT. Mentions of NT on PA-RISC continued in 1994 with some customer interest but ended around 1995. ↫ Paul Weissmann at OpenPA The port eventually fizzled out due to a lack of interest from both customers and application developers, and HP realised its time was better spent on the future of x86, Intel&#8217;s Itanium, instead. HP also planned to work together with Novell to port NetWare to PA-RISC, but the work took longer than expected and it, too, was cancelled. The most recent secretive effort was the port of HP-UX to x86, an endeavour that took place during the final days of the UNIX workstation market. Parts of the conversation in these documents mention a successful boot of HP-UX on x86 in December of 2009, with porting efforts projected to cost 100M+ between 2010 and 2016. The plan was for mission-critical x86 systems (ProLiant DL980 and Superdome with x86) and first releases projected in 2011 (developer) and 2012 (Superdome and Linux ABI). ↫ Paul Weissmann at OpenPA I&#8217;m especially curious about that last one, as porting HP-UX to x86 seems like a massive effort during a time where it was already obvious Linux had completely obliterated the traditional UNIX market. It really feels like the last death saving throws of a platform everybody already knew wasn&#8217;t going to make it.

I'm also blocking people who hype ActivityPub in comments to my posts about social web stuff that has nothing to do with AP. I've been down this road before. I just want to find people with <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/16/140810.html">active minds</a>, whose business is interop, who want to try stuff out. AP is not a good foundation to build on, at least until they come up with a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22busy+developer+guide%22">BDG</a> for it. Basically it isn't a standard even though they say it is. If you want to help your cause: 1. Stop hyping. 2. Get busy with that BDG.

## A cautionary travel tale

On Monday evening, I had a ticket booked to bring me back on the overnight ferry from the Hook of Holland to Harwich. (Here&#8217;s a bit of trivia for you: &#8216;Hook of Holland&#8217; is actually a mistranslation of the Dutch name Hoek van Holland. &#8216;Hoek&#8217;, in Dutch, means &#8216;corner&#8217;, not &#8216;hook&#8217;.

If someone I don't know posts a negative comment on Facebook, in response to something I posted, I just delete it, because they have that feature (other systems don't, they should). Any lurker who happens by is free to enjoy what I write. But if I don't know you, I honestly don't care what you think, esp if it's negative and has less than ten syllables total. It's hit and run spam for sure. I'm widening my definition of spam all the time. If you add up all the responses that actually mean anything, it doesn't amount to much. Let's see what the social web looks like without hearing from all assholes.

## GNOME Foundation in financial trouble

date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News

As you may be aware, the GNOME Foundation has operated at a deficit (nonprofit speak for a loss – ie spending more than we’ve been raising each year) for over three years, essentially running the Foundation on reserves from some substantial donations received 4-5 years ago. The Foundation has a reserves policy which specifies a minimum amount of money we have to keep in our accounts. This is so that if there is a significant interruption to our usual income, we can preserve our core operations while we work on new funding sources. We’ve now “hit the buffers” of this reserves policy, meaning the Board can’t approve any more deficit budgets – to keep spending at the same level we must increase our income. ↫ Robert McQueen Learning that the GNOME Foundation can barely scrape by financially makes me irrationally angry. As much as I&#8217;ve grown to dislike using GNOME and thus switched all my machines over to KDE, GNOME is still the most popular desktop environment and used extensively by pretty much all the big corporate Linux distributions. How is it possible that this hugely popular and important open source project has to beg individual users for donations like they&#8217;re running an independent tech website or something? Where&#8217;s all the financial support from Red Hat, IBM, Oracle, Canonical, and so on? If not even an insanely popular project like GNOME can be financially stable, what hope is there for the countless small, unknown open source projects that form the basis of our entire computing world?

## A BSD person tries Alpine Linux

date: 2024-04-28, from: OS News

In February last year I wrote about running a FreeBSD desktop, and concluded that sometimes you need to give yourself permission to tinker. Well recently I’ve started tinkering with Alpine Linux! It’s been recommended to me for years, so I’m finally getting around to checking it out. There’s a lot to like if you come from BSD, which we’ll dig into here. ↫ Ruben Schade Just a quick look at this unexpectedly popular Linux distribution that really has its own identity.
