<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I signed up to buy a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Dev Kit the second I found out about it.

<p>
They even promoted it with
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24158603/qualcomm-windows-snapdragon-dev-kit-x-elite">this
amazing-looking transparent shell</a>, and I and hundreds of other devs
were ready to pony up the $899 Qualcomm was asking.
</p>
<p>
Their pre-order form said it would be out June 18. Almost exactly one
month later, I got an email saying it was available. Great!

<p>
So I went to
<a href="https://www.arrow.com/en/products/c8380-12c-mp-32g/thundercomm">the

about 15 minutes after receiving the email.

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I’m Luke, I’m 29, and I live in Chicago with my partner and five cats. I
grew up in Austin, Texas. I was homeschooled—which was horrific—and
haven’t gone to college yet.
</p>
<p>
I’m in-between jobs at the moment; I’ve been looking for IT and web
development work. For the last eleven years I’ve been doing web design
on the side in addition to full-time jobs in electrical, HVAC, apartment
maintenance, logistics brokering, and healthcare IT. Web design and
working in tech was The Dream™ for a long time; with each new non-tech
job I kept telling myself it was just a brief interlude before I was
“discovered” and hired for a wonderful position doing what I love. But
experience and rejection slowly eroded the naivety away. I still love
this stuff but with how turbulent things have been in the industry these
last few years, I’ve been looking at what else I can do for a career
besides drawing rectangles and making logos bigger.
</p>
<p>
My hobbies include blogging (whoa), playing video games, reading books,
listening to music, and coding. Lately I’ve been playing Helldivers 2,
Diablo IV, and Rimworld. Learning Go has been an obsession for the last
year and I’ve been having fun building a form handler. The code is a
complete mess right now but a couple weeks ago I got it to take a form
submission and send me an email—which made me so excited that I haven’t
touched the project since.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
My first blog was on Blogger in 2010. I frequented a number of forums at
the time and I saw other people had their blogs linked in their
signature, and I thought it was cool to have a spot all my own for
topics that didn’t fit the theme of those forums. Early posts centered
around the computer forum I started during that time.
</p>
<p>
In March 2011 I moved to WordPress and decided the previous posts
weren’t worth moving, and their teenage angst is lost to time.
Frustrated with WordPress, I moved over to Tumblr for a couple months
before pulling a 180 and moving right back to WordPress in June 2011. My
posts continued to revolve around running my forums—now multiple—and
random computer activities I was up to that day.
</p>
<p>
In 2013 I switched to Anchor CMS (RIP Charlotte). This is when the first
rendition of the cactus logo I use on my site showed up. I
<em>loved</em> the Markdown approach to blogging after fighting the
WordPress editor, but I wasn’t able to delete comments and I missed the
WordPress media gallery. Later that same year I moved to WordPress for
the third time. For the next couple of years I wrote about my solutions
to problems I encountered and my adventures in Elite: Dangerous.
</p>
<p>
2016 saw a decline in posts and the beginning of a 4-year hiatus from
blogging altogether. I met my partner that same year. Embarrassed by my
teenage self and uncertain how to market my web design services, I took
down the blog and switched my site to a resume-like Gatsby template.
</p>
<p>
I started things back up again in 2020 with the fourth return to
WordPress, this time embracing the Gutenberg editor and boasting about
how not-Jamstack my site was—out of exasperation with Gatsby’s build
times. But as usual at this point, my time on WordPress wouldn’t last
long and in 2021 I moved to Eleventy, followed by Hugo a few months
later.
</p>
<p>
For the first year after my return to blogging, I mainly wrote about web
development and tech. In 2022 I grew tired of this; I love those things
but they can be incredibly dry and I wanted to express myself more. I
started writing more about life and posted about
<a href="https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2022/08/wiper-adventure/">my trip to
purchase wiper blades</a>, which became a reader favorite. I went back
and forth on whether to separate the tech posts or keep posting through
it, and ultimately decided it doesn’t matter. I write about what
interests me and let the people following my blog decide for themselves.
</p>
<p>
My blog also functioned as my portfolio, and I went back and forth on
this for years until I removed the portfolio and business parts for good
a couple years ago. I felt like trying to attract business on my
personal site limited what I could write about, and it was so freeing to
finally rip that stuff out.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
I consume an unhealthy amount of articles every day and a lot of my
inspiration comes from the excellent people who live in my RSS reader.
I’ll get an idea in my head and start writing to uncover more meaning
behind it—like sculpting but less cool. Sometimes I start with a good
title and then the rest flows out as I think through it in real time.
Other times I might be journaling my thoughts and a sentence will grow
into three paragraphs, a title will appear, and eventually the whole
mess finds its way into my blog. I try to publish posts the same day I
start them; my drafts folder is where posts go to die.
</p>
<p>
I research almost every post, which is a problem because I can get way
too into the research portion and kill my writing flow. Even the
personal posts will have me going through maps and photos to make sure
I’ve got the story and names straight. I keep reminding myself that I
don’t need to provide proof for absolutely everything.
</p>
<p>
On days or topics where I feel less confident I ask my partner to
proofread. I re-read what I write about 15-20 times and when the
frustration reaches a breaking point I switch to Sublime Merge, close my
eyes, hit the keys to stage/commit/push, and whisper a prayer to the
gods of blogging.
</p>
<p>
Once a post is published I have a habit of re-reading what I wrote 5–10
<em>more</em> times because the context switch from my editor to the
wild web tends to inspire additional changes. I consider this part an
unhealthy obsession and I’m working on not doing that and posting
carefree to the wind.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
My ideal creative environment is on an airplane mid-flight after they’ve
passed out the complimentary snacks and drinks that you can’t taste
because you’ve temporarily surfaced above nature’s tender embrace, and
in your newfound godhood your thoughts drift to thinking about how we
never should have left the trees all those years ago. Many posts have
started in the shower, where I’ll strike upon a turn of phrase that I
like and then do my darnedest to remember it when I’m dry enough to type
it out.
</p>
<p>
I can’t be airborne or in the shower perpetually, so I gladly settle for
my desk in the corner with a nice cup of coffee and one of five cats in
my lap. The physical space I’m in absolutely influences my creativity; I
struggle to think in loud environments with sounds I can’t tune out.
</p>
<p>
Noise-cancelling headphones help a lot. I find being unable to hear my
keystrokes to be incredibly helpful for staying in the trance-like state
of the zone while writing. I put on music that I’ve either heard a
bazillion times or with few lyrics. Lately my go-to has been Chicago
house inspired.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
My blog is generated with Hugo and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. The
domain is registered through Namecheap. My CMS is my operating system
and text editor, which can be a frustrating combination at times but it
works. I use Hugo’s archetypes feature to start a new post with the
front matter populated, and then Hugo opens it in iA Writer. Final edits
happen in Sublime Text.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
There’s a lot I’d do with hindsight. For example, I had to switch my
domain from a .work to a .com TLD a few years ago because the .work TLD
made it onto a few widely-used corporate firewall blocklists years after
I registered mine, to the point where I couldn’t access my own website
in a coffee shop one day. While preventing potential employers and
coworkers from accessing my site could be a useful feature, I’d go with
a boring TLD from the start.
</p>
<p>
I would have separated my consulting from my personal site earlier. And
I would have kept my site as my main online presence, instead of dumping
words into various social media platforms for five minutes of fame. A
lot of those words and images are lost now.
</p>
<p>
I’d still switch up my tech stack with the season though. Part of me
enjoys creating problems for my future self.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Domains renewal: $28 USD/year
</li>
<li>
Cloudflare Pages: <span class="math inline">$0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way back near the start I had banner ads, but they produced
pennies a year and looked terrible. I &lt;a
href="https://ko-fi.com/lkhrs"&gt;recently set up a Ko-fi page&lt;/a&gt;
and added the link to the bottom of my blog posts, and a couple
wonderful readers have funded domain renewals for the next couple of
years. And I’ve been hired by people who found me via my blog—that
counts, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I absolutely support monetizing personal blogs. Those recurring
costs add up and it’s another avenue for people to send you warm and
fuzzy feelings. But it should be tasteful. Am I running around town
wearing clothing plastered with ads for the latest VC-funded grift? (No,
but please reach out if that’s an option. People don’t need to know it’s
me). On the blog it’s different; my literal name and persona is wrapped
up in it. When I added banner ads it felt filthy, like I sold my soul to
the company with the largest fraction of a penny on AdSense. It would
take a large—not small—dump truck load of pennies to make me consider
doing that again. The sponsored article people have tried hard, but
every time I ask for the load of zinc measured in cubic yards,
negotiations fall through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage a cautious, almost hesitant approach. Monetization
should be an afterthought, not the primary goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend checking out each of these blogs and interviewing
their wonderful owners. A few of them have been interviewed
already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing this I came across the album &lt;a
href="https://song.link/https://music.apple.com/us/album/ease-the-work/1725718657"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ease
the Work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the instrumental group Hour. It feels
like a nice stroll at sunset with a cool breeze behind you and an
endless expanse of tired and dusty landscape in front. It beckons you to
explore its gentle swells and sweeping strings while the beat steadily
plods along, kicking up little swirls of vague nostalgia. Thoughts
you’ve thought before but hadn’t properly put to rest will surface and
demand to be explored, to be wholly perceived; thoughts that may have
first surfaced decades prior. They nibble at your attention, threatening
the tranquil state of your mind, but it is effortless to cast them away.
You lose yourself in the fiery sun, yearning to someday follow its
passage behind the hazy horizon. Not today though. Today is a great day
to write a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

<p>This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image features the dwarf
irregular galaxy NGC 5238, located 14.5 million light-years from Earth
in the constellation Canes Venatici. Its unexciting, blob-like

classic image of a galaxy. Its lackluster appearance belies its

issue is causing massive computer outages worldwide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Well, this sure is something to wake up to: a massive worldwide
outage of computer systems due to a problem with CrowdStrike software.
Payment systems, airlines, hospitals, governments, TV stations – pretty
much anything or anyone using computers could be dealing with
bluescreens, bootloops, and similar issues today. Open-heart surgeries
had to be stopped mid-surgery, planes can’t take off, people can’t board
trains, shoppers can’t pay for their groceries, and much, much more, all
over the world. The problem is caused by CrowdStrike, a sort-of
enterprise AV/monitoring software that uses a Windows NT kernel driver
to monitor everything people do on corporate machines and logs it for…
Security purposes, I guess? I’ve never worked in a corporate setting so
I have no experience with software like this. From what I hear, software
like this is deeply loathed by workers the world over, as it gets in the
way and slows systems down. And, as can happen with a kernel driver, a
bug can cause massive worldwide outages which is costing people billions
in damages and may even have killed people. There is a workaround,
posted by CrowdStrike: This is a solution for individually fixing
affected machines, but I’ve seen responses like “great, how do I apply
this to 70k endpoints?”, indicating that this may not be a practical
solution for many affected customers. Then there’s the issue that this
may require a BitLocker password, which not everyone has on hand either.
To add insult to injury, CrowdStrike’s advisory about the issue is
locked behind a login wall. A shitshow all around. Do note that while
the focus is on Windows, Linux machines can run CrowdStrike software
too, and I’ve heard from Linux kernel engineers who happen to also
administer large numbers of Linux servers that they’re seeing a huge
spike in Linux kernel panics… Caused by CrowdStrike, which is installed
on a lot more Linux servers than you might think. So while Windows is
currently the focus of the story, the problems are far more widespread
than just Windows. I’m sure we’re going to see some major consequences
here, and my – misplaced, I’m sure – hope is that this will make people
think twice about one, using these invasive anti-worker monitoring
tools, and two, employing kernel drivers for this nonsense.</p>

<h1 id="2024-07-19-trusting-a-self-signed-certificate">
2024-07-19 Trusting a self-signed certificate
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@sarahjamielewis" title="@sarahjamielewis@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation"
data-cites="sarahjamielewis">@sarahjamielewis</span></a> recently
announced an IRC server with a self-signed certificate. What if you have
an IRC client that keeps complaining about this?
</p>
<p>
On a system like Debian, you can download the certificate and install it
such that all applications trust it.
</p>
<pre><code># Get certificate from the correct port
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect resistant.tech:6697 \
  &lt; /dev/null \
  2&gt; /dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -outform PEM \
  &gt; resistant-tech.pem

# Compare fingerprint with
# 63:B1:2E:A7:8A:BD:8A:33:B5:62:21:7C:42:71:75:66:43:BA:D2:78:21:09:8E:80:17:7E:28:D2:58:65:E6:48
openssl x509 -in resistant-tech.pem -noout -sha256 -fingerprint

# Install on Debian (the new extension is important)
sudo mv --interactive resistant-tech.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/resistant-tech.crt
sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates

# The output above should say &quot;1 added, 0 removed; done&quot; somewhere

# Test it
gnutls-cli resistant.tech:6697
</code></pre>
<p>
If the output says “PKI verification of server certificate failed…” then
the installation didn’t work.
</p>
<p>
If the output says “Handshake was completed” and seems to hang, that’s
because you can now type raw IRC commands.

<h2 id="summer-rental">Summer rental</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
4:05am<br /> The windows are open, hoping to capture the faint winds and
convert them into a mythical cooling cross-breeze. A gust passes through
vacuuming all the doors shut, cancelling hope for a miracle.<br /> I’m
awake. It’s cool but I’m on top of the covers and not cool enough.<br />
The plastic thump-thump-thump of the oscillating fan reaching the end of
its arc is rhythmic yet not. After three-to-six attempts, it yields to
the resistance and heads the other way. It will be back soon.<br />
Another fan in the room sounds like a far off propeller plane looping
around the property. I await its arrival at each approach.<br /> The
alleyway ebbs and flows throughout the night with the smell of marijuana
smoke, teens cussing, and the clinking of bottles as passers-by rummage
through recycling bins.<br /> There’s a sick child in the other room. My
child. Been sick for days, poor thing. On antibiotics now. Spit the
first dose on the floor because she didn’t like the taste.<br /> I can
hear her labored breath as different subconscious systems battle for
what they deem as comfortable. Warm, yet shivering. Cold, yet burning
up. Asleep, yet aware.<br /> My wife is there next to her. Also sick
with a persistent unspecified cough.<br /> Since arriving at the rental
three days ago, I have only left the house to buy medicine and wine.
</p>
<p>
7:23am<br /> Scuttling in the alleyway. Two voices. A truck starts. A
woman pleads, “I’m sorry, I fucked up.” The truck drives off.<br /> I
put on a pot of coffee.
</p>
<p>
9:15am<br /> Left the rental to walk and pick up breakfast. Peeked at
the ocean to remind myself of the magnitude. I’m a block away but hadn’t
seen it in days.<br /> I got a breakfast burrito. The potatoes were a
little al dente, but it had black beans and wasn’t a soupy mess so I
call that a win.<br /> PCR tests came back and it’s not Covid and it’s
not strep, but we don’t have any answer for what sickness(es?) our
family is dealing with.<br /> I’m on vacation but it’s not quite
vacation anymore.<br /> I’m working a bit. Dysfunctional but I
appreciate a place to channel anxiety.<br /> Caretaking is much harder
than computer work.
</p>
<p>
4:46pm<br /> We made it to the beach. Wife and son thought it was too
windy for my solar shade —and it was— but I persevered. After naysaying
me they had the audacity to want to join me in my solar fortress. Haha.
Nice try.<br /> My congested little one made me pretend food with wet
sand. She’s allowed to join me in my fortress.<br /> We left as the tide
came in and ordered pizza. The pizza was just okay.
</p>
<p>
9:44pm<br /> A good day. A long day.<br /> Another member of the family
is reporting a sore throat, so that’s less than ideal.<br /> “When this
vacation is over I’m going to need another vacation,” the protagonist
says looking directly through the fourth wall. The canned laughter
erupts.<br /> Do wells of rage fill up faster than waters of peace? Am I
broken or is the underlying system broken?
</p>
<p>
5:32am<br /> Awakened by two crows squawking at each other.<br /> I went
to bed after midnight. A new day begins.

transitions fully towards open-source GPU Linux kernel modules</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a Linux news day today – it happens – but this one is
good news we can all be happy about. After earning a bad reputation for
mishandling its Linux graphics drivers for years, almost decades, NVIDIA
has been turning the ship around these past two years, and today they
made a major announcement: from here on out, the open source NVIDIA
kernel modules will be the default for all recent NVIDIA cards. We’re
now at a point where transitioning fully to the open-source GPU kernel
modules is the right move, and we’re making that change in the upcoming
R560 driver release. ↫ Rob Armstrong, Kevin Mittman and Fred Oh There
are some caveats regarding which generations, exactly, should be using
the open source modules for optimal performance. For NVIDIA’s most
cutting edge generations, Grace Hopper and Blackwell, you actually must
use the open source modules, since the proprietary ones are not even
supported. For GPUs from the Turing, Ampere, Ada Lovelace, or Hopper
architectures, NVIDIA recommends the open source modules, but the
proprietary ones are compatible as well. Anything older than that is
restricted to the proprietary modules, as they’re not supported by the
open source modules. This is a huge milestone, and NVIDIA becoming a
better team player in the Linux world is a big deal for those of us with
NVIDIA GPUs – it’s already paying dividend in vastly improved Wayland
support, which up until very recently was a huge problem. Do note,
though, that this only covers the kernel module; the userspace parts of
the NVIDIA driver are still closed-source, and there’s no indication
that’s going to change.</p>

<h2 id="linux-patch-to-disable-snapdragon-x-elite-gpu-by-default">Linux
patch to disable Snapdragon X Elite GPU by default</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Not too long ago it seemed like Linux support for the new ARM laptops
running the Snapdragon X Pro and Elite processors was going to be pretty
good – Qualcomm seemed to really be stepping up its game, and detailed
in a blog post exactly what they were doing to make Linux a first-tier
operating system on their new, fancy laptop chips. Now that the devices
are in people’s hand, though, it seems all is not so rosy in this new
Qualcomm garden. A recent Linux kernel DeviceTree patch outright
disables the GPU on the Snapdragon X Elite, and the issue is, as usual,
vendor nonsense, as it needs something called a ZAP shader to be useful.
The ZAP shader is needed as by default the GPU will power on in a
specialized “secure” mode and needs to be zapped out of it. With OEM key
signing of the GPU ZAP shader it sounds like the Snapdragon X laptop GPU
support will be even messier than typically encountered for laptop
graphics. ↫ Michael Larabel This is exactly the kind of nonsense you
don’t want to be dealing with, whether you’re a user, developer, or OEM,
so I hope this gets sorted out sooner rather than later. Qualcomm’s
commitments and blog posts about ensuring Linux is a first-tier platform
are meaningless if the company can’t even get the GPU to work properly.
These enablement problems should’ve been handled well before the devices
entered circulation, so this is very disheartening to see. So, for now,
hold off on X Elite laptops if you’re a Linux user.</p>

looks like the Queens kid he is. People from Queens don’t feel like we
really belong, except with other Queens people. We expect to be thought

<h2 id="unified-kernel-image">Unified kernel image</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>UKIs can run on UEFI systems and simplify the distribution of small
kernel images. For example, they simplify network booting with iPXE.
UKIs make rootfs and kernels composable, making it possible to derive a
rootfs for multiple kernel versions with one file for each pair. A
Unified Kernel Image (UKI) is a combination of a UEFI boot stub program,
a Linux kernel image, an initramfs, and further resources in a single
UEFI PE file (device tree, cpu µcode, splash screen, secure boot
sig/key, …). This file can either be directly invoked by the UEFI
firmware or through a boot loader. ↫ Hugues If you’re still a bit
unfamiliar with unified kernel images, this post contains a ton of
detailed practical information. Unified kernel images might become a
staple for forward-looking Linux distributions, and I know for a fact
that my distribution of choice, Fedora, has been working on it for a
while now. The goal is to eventually simplify the boot process as a
whole, and make better, more optimal use of the advanced capabilities
UEFI gives us over the old, limited, 1980s BIOS model. Like I said a few
posts ago, I really don’t want to be using traditional bootloaders
anymore. UEFI is explicitly designed to just boot operating systems on
its own, and modern PCs just don’t need bootloaders anymore. They’re
points of failure users shouldn’t be dealing with anymore in 2024, and
I’m glad to see the Linux world is seriously moving towards negating the
need for their existence.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-give-up-social-media">Should you give up social
media?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-18, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevquirk.com/blog/could-you-give-up-social-media&quot;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt;, Kev used the magic words to summon me and make me write something on this site: he talked about social media, mentioned me, and posed a question. Rather than focusing on the could/should/would why don’t we focus on the actual product and figure out what is that we’re getting out of social media? And I’m saying “we” even though I’m not really on any traditional social media platform. But more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
The quality and usefulness of a social platform are a by-product of
three factors: my inputs, other people’s inputs, and the platform
creator’s intentions. The first two are quite obvious since social media
is the product of what people decide to put into it. The third is what
really shapes a platform. Not all platforms are created equal and as a
result of that the mixture of inputs and outputs can differ widely from
one digital place to another. Fame and money are terrible incentives
when it comes to digital spaces because people are willing to do pretty
much everything to get a following if that can help them earn money. So
every time a platform gets big enough you just know things are doomed to
turn to shit. That’s an inescapable reality of social platforms. So if
you’re looking for a decent social media space you probably want to stay
on one that’s designed to either stay small in size or one that’s
designed to stay small in scope.
</p>
<p>
You might be tempted to think that a Mastodon server is a good example
of the first type but you’d be wrong. The decentralised social media
experiments—Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky—are not designed to stay small.
Quite the contrary. They can stay small but you have to fight against
the main concept behind those platforms. In the past, I argued that
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/small-communities-are-the-best-communities">small
communities are the best type of communities</a> and so one potential
solution to this social media conundrum is to find—or create!—a
closed-door, small community that wants to stay small on purpose in
order to keep it sane.
</p>
<p>
Another potential solution is to not join a kitchen-sink social platform
where (almost) everything goes and instead join one that is specifically
designed to cater for a specific audience.
<a href="https://literal.club">Literal</a> is a good example. It’s a
social platform but the focus is books so everything that’s happening
there is related to books and book reading. You won’t find people
sharing memes or random links or anything like that but if you care
about books you’ll find plenty of those.
</p>
<p>
Another good example is <a href="https://read.cv/">read.cv</a> and its
sibling, <a href="https://posts.cv/">posts.cv</a>. The first one gives
out very early Dribbble vibes but with a different overall aesthetic and
the second, since it’s tied to the first one, is a Twitter clone where
everyone’s a designer posting stuff about design or photography. I have
a profile on both so technically I am on social media but my activity on
there is non-existent. I update the
<a href="https://read.cv/manuelmoreale">read.cv profile</a> periodically
since it’s my online CV and I never posted anything on post.cv even
though every three or four weeks I scroll through it for 5 minutes to
see what people are creating. And it’s an incredibly positive
experience. No flame wars, no memes, and nobody is trying to crypto scam
anyone. Just a chill place that’s mainly focused on design (and cats).
</p>
<p>
The main issue with social media is that we want them to be everything.
We want them to be a place for casual interactions, for discovery, for
news, for serious discourse. And that’s a mistake. Because the moment
you put a stupid amount of people in one room and you let them do
whatever they want the only reasonable outcome you can expect is chaos.
Sure, you might get some positive results out of it but you’ll also
likely get someone shitting in a corner and someone trying to fuck the
power outlet. Because that’s the world we live in. Now sprinkle some
nonsense AI on top of it all and Bob’s your uncle.
</p>
<p>
So, to circle back to the original question you asked Kev, I don’t think
it’s a matter of wanting to give up social media entirely. You should be
asking if you’re willing to give up this specific flavour of social
media, you should be asking what parts of this type of social media
you’re treasuring and then figure out if there are saner ways to get
those same things elsewhere.

<p>The Repubs can win by throwing the election into the House. They can
probably get it by the courts in enough places, just a couple of swing
states, and they win even if they lose by normal vote-counting methods.
The whole bit about Biden’s age is meant to distract us from the fact it
probably doesn’t matter how old the Democratic candidate is.</p>

<p>I never had a regular “lunch break” until recently. Early in my
career it was not by choice — in surgery training there’s really no such
thing as a break, only a stolen minute or two here and there to pee or
wolf down whatever food you can scrounge or nap in a chair if it’s the
middle of the night and you’re on call. We did get a $5 meal coupon for
the hospital cafeteria which could get you a cup of terrible coffee and
a bagel drier than a bag of silica gel in the Sahara desert.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-minimal-nncp-setup-to-get-started">2024-07-16 What’s

<h1 id="2024-07-16-what-s-the-minimal-nncp-setup-to-get-started">
2024-07-16 What’s the minimal NNCP setup to get started?
</h1>
<p>
This page is for you if you are curious about NNCP and you don’t know
how to get started. It contains instructions on how to set up your
laptop such that it can exchange files with my laptop (melanobombus) via
my server (sibirocobombus).
</p>
<p>
Before testing it, you need to send me an email with some info but we’ll
get to that.
</p>
<p>
First, switch to the root user. Everything will be easier that way.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo su
</code></pre>
<p>
The instructions are going to assume a Debian system.
</p>
<p>
Begin by installing the <code>nncp</code> package.
</p>
<pre><code>apt install nncp
</code></pre>
<p>
Generate a new <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file and secure it:
</p>
<pre><code>nncp-cfgnew &gt; /etc/nncp.hjson
chown nncp:nncp /etc/nncp.hjson
chmod 660 /etc/nncp.hjson
</code></pre>
<p>
You need to add my server to your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file, in
the <code>neigh</code> section.
</p>
<pre><code>    sibirocobombus: {
      id:       CCAIPFSAZWYICBQ5BIURX4UMEJIXVSZFIING7HRUFTDOFV5XISVQ
      exchpub:  NGEIDPDVZ2I6CTRKCBT734VV4W2YFVTV6YFBU5UGB6IHBA3QDJUQ
      signpub:  VXBMWXS74IGAYQCLJY4UPAXXQXPT3K53QI5XCFHOAKL4I2FQNLKQ
      noisepub: MGGBAOHRHEWEC6CGT47GA2DOQXQFZUAKJ66PD734Y5WNWP364UXQ
      addrs: {
        internet: &quot;alexschroeder.ch:5400&quot;
      }
      calls: [
        {
          cron: &quot;@daily&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
What does it mean?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you know how to contact my server via the <code>.addrs.internet</code>
key – you need this, but you can specify <code>campaignwiki.org</code>
instead, if your prefer
</li>
<li>
you connect to my server every now and then via the
<code>calls[0].cron</code> entry – this is not necessary if you don’t
mind using <code>nncp-call</code> every now and then
</li>
</ol>
<p>
My laptop can only be reached via my server. You need to add it as well.
</p>
<p>
As far as the <code>melanobombus.incoming</code> key goes, pick a
suitable directory that your regular account has access to.
</p>
<pre><code>    melanobombus: {
      id:       R23WEIHB52TMA4EKGJPKUDBFSYP2HG4HHW2HGJ3RJATCCRLYDUZQ
      exchpub:  EGP2MMLQJQUKWTHI22JTIRMR2UV3BA2ATE3AYLVOFODMTNRGAMEA

      noisepub: 6ECO4WXJNDED6WHJ6SM2HGRQMUO75X65ALT2YRKZ3YGGBDXRNV4A
      via:      [&quot;sibirocobombus&quot;]
      incoming: &quot;/home/alex/incoming/melanobombus&quot;
      exec: {
        rsmtp:  [&quot;/usr/sbin/sendmail&quot;, &quot;-bS&quot;]
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
What does it mean?
</p>
<ol>
<li>
you know how to contact my laptop via my server using the
<code>.via[0]</code> key – you need this and the name needs to match the
name you used for my server
</li>
<li>
you allow my laptop to save incoming files in a directory via the
<code>.incoming</code> key – you only need this if you want to receive
files (the directory must exist and the <code>nncp</code> group must be
allowed to write to it)
</li>
<li>
you allow my laptop to send mail to local users via the
<code>.exec.rsmtp</code> key – this is not necessary if you don’t want
to receive mail
</li>
</ol>
<p>
You would create the incoming directory as follows, as your regular
user:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir --parents ~/incoming/melanobombus
sudo chgrp nncp ~/incoming/melanobombus
sudo chmod g+w ~/incoming/melanobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
You need to send me your system’s public keys from the
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file so that I can set up similar entries
on my laptop and my server.
</p>
<p>
Once I’ve added your public keys to my server, we can test it.
</p>
<p>
My server will not call you, since it doesn’t know your Internet
address. It waits for you to call it both when you want to send or when
you want to receive something. You would do this as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call sibirocobombus
</code></pre>
<p>
Otherwise, the <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="daily">@daily</span></code> entry in the
<code>sibirocobombus.cron[0]</code> entry of your
<code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file will call my server once a day, at
midnight.
</p>
<p>
To send me a README file, you’d run:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u nncp nncp-file README melanobombus:
2024-07-12T18:12:15Z Tx README 486 B/486 B 100% (73 KiB/sec)
2024-07-12T18:12:15Z File README (282 B) is sent to melanobombus:README
</code></pre>
<p>
At this point, the file is in the queue.
</p>
<p>
You need to to call my server using <code>sudo -u nncp nncp-call
sibirocobombus</code> to actually send the files or you’ll have to wait
for the cron job. My server will receive the packets encrypted and
addressed to my laptop and enqueue them again. The next time my laptop
calls my server, it’ll get them.
</p>
<p>
You probably want to let me know about the file via
<a href="Contact">another channel</a>. But soon enough we can set up
mail via NNCP. 😁

id="safari-already-contains-ad-tracking-technology-and-theyre-now-adding-it-to-safaris-private-browsing-mode-too">Safari
already contains ad tracking technology, and they’re now adding it to
Safari’s Private Browsing mode, too</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve been talking a lot about sleazy ways in which the online
advertising industry is conspiring with browser makers – who also happen
to be in the online advertising industry – to weaken privacy features so
they can still track you and the ads they serve you, but with “privacy”.
They’re trying really hard to make it seem as if they’re doing us a huge
favour by making tracking slightly more private, and browser makers are
falling over themselves to convince us that allowing some user and ad
tracking is the only way to stop the kind of total everything,
everywhere, all at once tracking we have now. We’ve got Google and
Chrome pushing something called “Privacy Sandbox“, and we’ve got Mozilla
and Facebook pushing something called “Privacy-Preserving Attribution“,
both of which are designed to give the advertising industry slightly
more private tracking in the desperate hope they won’t still be doing a
lot more tracking on the side. Safari users, meanwhile, have been
feeling pretty good about all of this in the knowledge Apple cares about
privacy, so surely Safari won’t be doing any of this. You know where
this is going, right? Today, the WebKit project published a lengthy blog
post detailing all the various additional measures it’s taking to make
its Private Browsing mode more, well, private, and a lot of them are
great moves, very welcome, and ensure that private browsing on Safari is
a little bit more private than it is on Chrome, as the blog post
gleefully points out. However, not long into the blog post, the shoe
drops. We also expanded Web AdAttributionKit (formerly Private Click
Measurement) as a replacement for tracking parameters in URL to help
developers understand the performance of their marketing campaigns even
under Private Browsing. ↫ John Wilander, Charlie Wolfe, Matthew Finkel,
Wenson Hsieh, and Keith Holleman A little further down, they go into
more detail: Web AdAttributionKit (formerly Private Click Measurement)
is a way for advertisers, websites, and apps to implement ad attribution
and click measurement in a privacy-preserving way. You can read more
about it here. Alongside the new suite of enhanced privacy protections
in Private Browsing, Safari also brings a version of Web
AdAttributionKit to Private Browsing. This allows click measurement and
attribution to continue working in a privacy-preserving manner. ↫ John
Wilander, Charlie Wolfe, Matthew Finkel, Wenson Hsieh, and Keith
Holleman So not only does Safari already include the kind of tracking
technology everyone is – rightfully – attacking Mozilla over for adding
it to Firefox, Apple and the Safari team are actually taking it a step
further and making this ad tracking technology available in private
browsing mode. The technology is limited a bit more in Private Browsing
mode, but its intent is preserved: to track you and the ads you see
online. I would hazard a guess that when you enable a browser’s private
browsing or incognito mode, you assume that means zero tracking. We
already know that Chrome’s Incognito mode leaks data like a sieve with
bullet holes in it, and now it seems Safari’s Private Browsing mode,
too, is going to allow advertisers to track you and the ads you see –
blog post full of fancy privacy features be damned. Do you know those
“Around the web” chumboxes? Even if you’re unfamiliar with the term,
you’ve most definitely seen these things all over the web, and really
hate them. A major player in the chumbox business is a company called
Taboola, a name that’s quite despised and reviled online. Popular Apple
blogger John Gruber called Taboola a “slumlord” and the “lowest common
denominator clickbait property“. Do you want to know which major
technology company just signed a massive deal with Taboola? Ad tech
giant Taboola has struck a deal with Apple to power native advertising
within the Apple News and Apple Stocks apps, Taboola founder and CEO
Adam Singolda told Axios. ↫ Sara Fischer at Axios Apple needs to find
new markets to keep growing, and clearly, pestering its users with
upsells and subscriptions to its services isn’t enough. The online
advertising industry is massive – just look at Google’s and Facebook’s
financial disclosures – and Apple seems to be interested in taking a
bigger slice of that fat pie. And as Google and now Mozilla are finding
out, a browser that blocks ads and ad tracking kind of gets in the way
of that. Anyone who can make and sell plug-and-play Pi-Hole devices even
normal people can use is going to make a killing.</p>

esp the last three episodes. I found it enlightening, even though I
lived through most of this history, I never saw it all put together in a
series of events over decades. I came out of it with a much clearer
perspective of where we are in the Cold War. It never was over. “The end
of history” was too good to be true. Also glad I read so much about
slavery a few years ago. If you put both these together, you get the

<p>“Houston, Tranquility Base here, the Eagle has landed.” “That’s one
small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” “Magnificent
desolation.” Three phrases that recall humanity’s first landing on and
exploration of the lunar surface. In July 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts
Neil A. Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin E. “Buzz” Aldrin completed
humanity’s first […]</p>

<h2 id="the-dark-net">2024-07-16 The Dark Net</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-07-16-the-dark-net">
2024-07-16 The Dark Net
</h1>
<p>
I haven’t read The Dark Forest but I read a few blog posts about it.
What really got me interested, however, was
<a href="https://www.ystrickler.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet/">The
Dark Forest Theory of the Internet</a> by Yancey Strickler in 2019:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other
predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the
internet, and away from the mainstream. – Yancey Strickler
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I often think of where the world is headed, politically. I’m a doomer at
heart.
</p>
<p>
As part of that, I think about the Internet in a few decades. In the
worst case, the public Internet is gone. An alternative that is slightly
less bad is that governments will have discovered that blocking at the
level of the national Domain Name System (DNS) won’t work because it’s
easy to circumvent using alternative name servers. And so, slowly at
first but then ever faster, from the top down, people will think that
perhaps the Great Firewall is cool: for the children, against porn,
against spam, against vandalism, to fight tax evasion, to fight
terrorism, you know the deal. And yes, even to fight fascism. So many
people are telling me that we should ban Telegram, for example.
</p>
<p>
I’m honestly not sure what to recommend. Is the free press our problem?
I don’t think so. It’s the incentives and the power imbalances that are
a problem. Rich people pay other people to create companies, to buy
companies, to sponsor some programs and to cancel others, and slowly the
landscape changes. Big corporations buy small ones. Rich people buy
failing ones. The prime example here in Switzerland is how the Weltwoche
was bought by billionaires and handed to somebody who supports a flat
tax, who supports the ban on minarets, who supports supports tax evasion
abroad, who supports anti-refugee policies… all of it legal, of course,
but these laws are nauseating. The same pattern can be seen in how the
state tries to support media diversity and still the big publishers
manage to profit the most. The same pattern can be seen in how the right
wing parties fight against state radio and state TV.
</p>
<p>
So what I recommend is to not go dark. Have friends. Have social media.
But be aware that our time might be short. We might have to build the
infrastructure while we can. Those of us who can should build for the
rest of us who have other things on their mind. We should build this to
be as easy to use as possible. We should build this so that we can
detach from the public Internet and it will still work.
</p>
<p>
The sneaker-net will be back. They will call it the dark net but to me,
it will forever be friends meeting in a place, with mass storage in our
backpacks (at the time) or in our pockets, exchanging stuff. And even if
this future is not great at all, we need that alternative. How else will
our future selves and our children organize? And even if it turns out to
be unnecessary because we keep riding that wild horse of freedom,
forever teetering at the brink of fascism, alternative needs to be there
to keep the next level of services in line. I still believe that the
availability and ubiquity of bit-torrent is what keeps the prices of
streaming services down. It’s the threat of piracy that keeps the
official channels honest. Because we can always go back. The
infrastructure is still around. The software is still around.
</p>
<p>
This is why I’m interested in
<a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@jgoerzen" title="@jgoerzen@floss.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jgoerzen">@jgoerzen</span></a>’s
<a href="https://changelog.complete.org/archives/10231-recovering-our-lost-free-will-online-tools-and-techniques-that-are-available-now">Recovering
Our Lost Free Will Online: Tools and Techniques That Are Available
Now</a>. In my case, the thing I’m most interested in is NNCP.
</p>
<p>
NNCP allows us to connect all services that can be made to work with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_and_forward">store and
forward</a> architecture. The simplest and oldest protocols in this
respect are mail and file copying, and services built on top of that,
such as net news. These services grew big with UUCP, the precursor to
NNCP. Store-and-forward precludes the kind of interactive applications
many of us are used to. Instead, it’s a bit like a library or a book
store: you order a book and at some point you get the book. There is a
delay. The postal system works the same way: write a letter and send it
off, wait for some days, maybe get a reply back. Basically, anything
that can be imagined as requesting something and getting back a reply
after some time can be implemented using store-and-forward architecture.
</p>
<p>
If you think of the web as serving static documents, it can be made to
work. Imagine reading Wikipedia via email: you send the URL via email to
a service, and some time later you get back an email with the response.
Soon we would be thinking of extensions to this. What if the response
returned an archive of the page requested, all the images it includes,
and the same for all the Wikipedia content pages it links to? Fewer
visits to the library, so to say! It would be much harder to do the same
thing using traditional social media because the web sites are more like
web apps. There are a gazillion ways to view things: in a time line (or
multiple time lines!), on a profile (so many profiles!), in threads, in
search results, and so on. If every click on a button requires a trip
that can take many days, it’s doesn’t work. Instead, such social media
sites must be restructured to work a bit like net news: new posts
satisfying some filters are sent in regular updates and your local
client rearranges the, filters them, searches them.
</p>
<p>
All of this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking">delay-tolerant
networking</a> is possible with Unix to Unix Copy
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP">UUCP</a>). What Node to
Node Copy (<a href="http://www.nncpgo.org/">NNCP</a>) adds is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption">end-to-end
encryption</a> (in a multi-hop setup the packets remain encrypted so the
carrier cannot read them) and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing">onion routing</a>
(in a multi-hop setup the carrier doesn’t know where the packet is
originally from or where the packet is going to end up). And with that,
the sneaker-net is back. You can imagine a low-tech future where most of
the last miles are burned, the copper stolen and repurposed, the optical
fibre no longer functional, and a service springs up where the post or
some other courier is used to send USB sticks and SD cards from
community to community in order to exchange letters, reports, movies,
pictures, music, and so on. Or if the government is monitoring the
airwaves and declaring mesh networks illegal or taking over the mesh
networks (like Cuba’s Street Network,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Cuba#SNET">SNET</a>),
we’ll have to rely on USB sticks and SD cards, too.
</p>
<p>
This is where we’re getting back to the Dark Forest. I don’t have an
answer to that. It’s a bit like members-only bit-torrent sites. Do you
trust them? Do they trust you? How are you going to learn about the
trustworthy ones?
</p>
<p>
In order to learn more, to be prepared, to think things through, I want
to experiment with the technology. I want to see what can be done, run
into the issues, pick the low hanging fruits. Play with the technology
before we really need it.
</p>
<p>
I remember audio cassettes being sent back and forth as a kid when we
were living in South-West Africa (back before they finally got their
freedom and renamed the country to Namibia) and my grandparents were
living in Austria. Phone calls were very expensive. So the family sat
around a tape recorder, each of us speaking in turn, saying something,
and weeks later, all of us gathering again, listening to the replies.
</p>
<p>
Using images like these virtual, delay-tolerant family gatherings worked
long before I knew anything at all about computers.

problem with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance">JD
Vance</a> is that he’s empty inside, he’ll be whatever he needs to be to
get more power, and he’s young. He’s as empty as Trump, and much
younger, so we can’t hope to outwait him. Now we have a real problem,
because Trump has a successor. I imagine Trump’s sons probably aren’t
happy about this. Had he picked
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio">Little Marco</a>, no
one would mistake him as an heir, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum">Doug Burgum</a> who
is a bit too old to be an heir (same age as I am). We <i>do</i> have a
problem with Biden, he hasn’t prepared for this moment. Old or not, they
had 3.5 years to get ready, and they didn’t. As I wrote
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/15.html#a124845">yesterday</a>,
the biggest most important thing is that we <b>organize ourselves.</b>
That’s the best defense all around. Every attempt to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_(enclosure)">corral</a> the
insurrection has been either non-existent or overwhelmingly inadequate.
Trump should be out of the picture, and for a while it seemed as if he
was getting there, but now he’s back, and probably a bigger threat than
ever. I don’t think replacing Biden is anywhere near enough. We need
leadership. Not wait to be led. We’ve waited too long. People who appear
ready to step up – AOC, Bernie Sanders. Who else? I wouldn’t put Obama
on that list, he tried to welcome Trump, even let him have his Supreme
Court pick, just to be a nice guy. We are not going to prevail by being
nice, unfortunately. We’re also not going to prevail by each of us
taking care of Number One. We have to work together. Organize and work
together. Those ought to be our mantras until we achieve them.</p>

<p>
Today, on the <strong>tenth anniversary</strong> of
<a href="https://marco.org/2014/07/16/overcast">Overcast 1.0</a>, I’m
happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app,
built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Like podcasts better than blog posts?
<a href="https://atp.fm/596">Listen to ATP #596</a> for more!</strong>
</p>
<h3>
What’s new
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Much faster,</strong> more responsive, more reliable, and more
accessible.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Modern design,</strong> optimized for easily-reached controls on
today’s phone sizes.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Improvements</strong> throughout, such as undoing large seeks,
new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
What’s not
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Most features.</strong> Overcast is still Overcast!
</li>
<li>
<strong>The audio engine.</strong> It’s the best part of Overcast, and
still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume
normalization. (More soon!)
</li>
<li>
<strong>The business.</strong> I’m still a one-person operation, with no
funding or external ownership, serving <em>only</em> my customers.
</li>
<li>
<strong>My principles.</strong> I always want to make the best podcast
app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
What’s gone
</h3>
<p>
<strong>Streaming.</strong> Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad
insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming
playback.<sup id="fnref:pMYQjMdU5streambugs"><a href="#fn:pMYQjMdU5streambugs" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is
<em>much</em> more reliable.
</p>
<p>
Tapping a non-downloading episode will now open the playback screen,
download it, <em>then</em> start playback. It works similarly to the way
streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes,
not after a portion of it is buffered.
</p>
<p>
On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds.
</p>
<p>
And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control
over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience
for people who don’t automatically download every episode.
</p>
<h3>
What’s next
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts
support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will
return soon.
</li>
<li>
More options for downloading and deleting episodes.
</li>
<li>
Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch
app is currently unchanged from the previous one.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested
features over the last decade.
</p>
<p>
Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for
your patience as I work through this list!
</p>
<h3>
Why?
</h3>
<p>
Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome
or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS
functionality, or add new features, especially as one person.
</p>
<p>
That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years.
</p>
<p>
You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as
I wanted.
</p>
<p>
For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its
second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app
with Swift, SwiftUI,
<a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/Blackbird">Blackbird</a>, and
modern Swift concurrency.
</p>
<p>
Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating
more quickly, and ultimately making the app <em>much</em> better.
</p>
<p>
Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast.
</p>
<p>
Here’s to the next one.

Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two
downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So,
for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the
download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request,
the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing
or repeating
content. <a href="#fnref:pMYQjMdU5streambugs" rev="footnote">↩︎</a>

I submitted an entry for the One Page Dungeon Contest. Since I would
like the dungeons to be close to the prep I do for my own games so that
I feel like I belong to a community of referees that spends a similar
amount of time for their adventures I took some of my (German) prep
notes, cleaned them up and added some text boxes using Inskape and
decided against spending time on polishing it up.

<p>
At the time I had a second 10-headed hydra, too…
</p>
<p>
The boss orcs had 3, 5 and 7 hit dice.
</p>
<p>
And later, when the players had killed all the orcs, a bunch of goblins
led by one Eye Poker resettled the halls.
</p>
<p>
These are the stats I would use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>orcs</strong> HD 1 AC 6 1d6 F1 MV 12 ML 8 XP 100</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Grishg</strong> HD 3 AC 6 1d6 F3 MV 12 ML 8 XP 300; with
<em>gauntlets of max strength</em> granting +3; under the influence of
the demon
</li>
<li>
<strong>Shagdog</strong> HD 5 AC 6 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 8 XP 500; lightning
bolt 1×/day for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; very loyal to Maufimbul
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ashuak</strong> HD 5 AC 3 1d6 F5 MV 6 ML 9 XP 500; willing to
buy freedom and leave
</li>
<li>
<strong>Maufimbul</strong> HD 7 AC 3 1d6 F7 MV 6 ML 9 XP 700; wielding
<em>Fur Hunter</em> +1/+3 vs. mammals; traditionalist spear dancer
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>boars</strong> HD 3+1 AC 6 1d8 F1 MV 15 ML 9 XP 300
</li>
<li>
<strong>hell hounds</strong> HD 5 AC 4 1d6 F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; fire
2/6 for 5d6, save vs. spells for half; see invisible (that pack of hell
hounds is also the random encounter)
</li>
<li>
<strong>small pyrohydra</strong> HD 5 (40hp, 8hp per head) AC 5 1d10 per
head F5 MV 12 ML 9 XP 500; regrowing heads (unless cauterized with fire
or ice, up to 7 more heads may grow, one per round, each with 8 hp);
fire breath 3×/day: deal as much damage as it has hit-points left, save
vs. breath for half; poisonous blood: when cutting off a head in melee,
save vs. poison or die; immune to fire and poison
</li>
<li>
<strong>fire demon</strong> HD 9+1 AC 4 1d6/2d6 F20 MV 12 ML 11; flying;
aura of fire 1d6 (everybody within 10 ft); when the first attack with
the flaming whip hits, the second attack with the flaming sword is at
+4; only harmed by magic and magical weapons; immune to fire (the
flaming whip and the flaming sword are two magic items that can be taken
from the demon)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Clearly, the pyrohydra is the worst if you fight it without multiple
lightning bolts or the like.
</p>
<p>
As for intelligent monsters, I figured that it would be possible to
somehow sneak in and overhear orcs talk about the four bosses. If
somebody wanted to, the power dynamic could be exploited. As it turned
out, though, my players tried to force the front gate with sleep spells,
alerted the guards, which brought on the fire demon and all the hell
hounds. The enemies were destroyed but the party had to retreat. Next
time, the party found the outlook, sent up a ranger with dark vision and
a magic item that could charm humanoids. He killed the four orc guards,
climbed down the netting into the cavern, found the way to the shooting
gallery, started killing all the orcs and that was the signal the others
needed to begin the race down the the long stairs. At the bottom, the
orcs had cajoled a ten-headed pyrohydra into the Merchant Hall but it
died in the first round after being hit by lightning bolts and other
spells.
</p>
<p>
The treasure map to the Cistern of Sulphur does not contain any new
monsters or traps; it’s not a new lair or dungeon. It’s part of the
treasure gained here so all it takes is a one day trip up the mountains
to that sulphur cavern. The only risk involved is random encounters.

id="i-told-you-so-mozilla-working-with-facebook-to-weaken-firefox-privacy-and-anti-tracking-features">I
told you so: Mozilla working with Facebook to weaken Firefox’ privacy
and anti-tracking features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve long been warning about the dangers of relying on just one
browser as the bullwark against the onslaught of Chrome, Chrome skins,
and Safari. With Firefox’ user numbers rapidly declining, now stuck at a
mere 2% or so – and even less on mobile – and regulatory pressure
possibly ending the Google-Mozilla deal with makes up roughly 80% of
Mozilla’s income, I’ve been warning that Mozilla will most likely have
to start making Firefox worse to gain more temporary revenue. As the
situation possibly grows even more dire, Firefox for Linux would be the
first on the chopping block. I’ve received quite a bit of backlash over
expressing these worries, but over the course of the last year or so
we’ve been seeing my fears slowly become reality before our very eyes,
culminating in Mozilla recently acquiring an online advertising
analytics company. Over the last few days, things have become even
worse: with the release of Firefox 128, the enshitification of Firefox
has now well and truly begun. Less than a month after acquiring the
AdTech company Anonym, Mozilla has added special software co-authored by
Meta and built for the advertising industry directly to the latest
release of Firefox, in an experimental trial you have to opt out of
manually. This “Privacy-Preserving Attribution” (PPA) API adds another
tool to the arsenal of tracking features that advertisers can use, which
is thwarted by traditional content blocking extensions. ↫ Jonah Aragon
If you have already upgraded to Firefox 128, you have automatically been
opted into using this new API, and for now, you can still opt-out by
going to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Website Advertising
Preferences, and remove the checkmark “Allow websites to perform
privacy-preserving ad measurement”. You were opted in without your
consent, without any widespread announcement, and if it wasn’t for so
many Firefox users being on edge about Mozilla’s recent behaviour, it
might not have been snuffed out this quickly. Over on GitHub, there’s a
more in-depth description of this new API, and the first few words are
something you never want to hear from an organisation that claims to
fight tracking and protect your privacy: “Mozilla is working with Meta”.
I’m not surprised by this at all – like I, perhaps gleefully, pointed
out, I’ve been warning about this eventuality for a long time – but I’ve
noted that on the wider internet, a lot of people were very much
unpleasently surprised, feeling almost betrayed by this, the latest in a
series of dubious moves by Mozilla. It’s not even just the fact they’re
“working with Meta”, which is entirely disqualifying in and of itself,
but also the fact there’s zero transparency or accountability about this
new API towards Firefox’ users. Sure, we’re all technologically inclined
and follow technology news closely, but the vast majority of people
don’t, and there’s bound to be countless people who perhaps only
recently moved to Firefox from Chrome for privacy reasons, only to be
stabbed in the back by Mozilla partnering up with Facebook, of all
companies, if they even find out about this at all. It’s right out of
Facebook’s playbook to secretly experiment on users. This is what I
wrote a year ago: I’m genuinely worried about the state of browsers on
Linux, and the future of Firefox on Linux in particular. I think it’s
highly irresponsible of the various prominent players in the desktop
Linux community, from GNOME to KDE, from Ubuntu to Fedora, to seemingly
have absolutely zero contingency plans for when Firefox enshittifies or
dies, despite everything we know about the current state of the browser
market, the state of Mozilla’s finances, and the future prospects of
both. Desktop Linux has a Firefox problem, but nobody seems willing to
acknowledge it. ↫ Thom Holwerda It seems my warnings are turning into
reality one by one, and if, at this point, you’re still not worried
about where you’re going to go after Firefox starts integrating even
more Facebook technologies or Firefox for Linux gets ever more resources
pulled away from it until it eventually gets cancelled, you’re
blind.</p>

AMD Zen 5 microarchitecture: powering Ryzen AI 300 series for mobile and
Ryzen 9000 for desktop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Built around the new Zen 5 CPU microarchitecture with some
fundamental improvements to both graphics and AI performance, the Ryzen
AI 300 series, code-named Strix Point, is set to deliver improvements in
several areas. The Ryzen AI 300 series looks set to add another footnote
in the march towards the AI PC with its mobile SoC featuring a new XDNA
2 NPU, from which AMD promises 50 TOPS of performance. AMD has also
upgraded the integrated graphics with the RDNA 3.5, which is designed to
replace the last generation of RDNA 3 mobile graphics, for better
performance in games than we’ve seen before. Further to this, during
AMD’s recent Tech Day last week, AMD disclosed some of the technical
details regarding Zen 5, which also covers a number of key elements
under the hood on both the Ryzen AI 300 and the Ryzen 9000 series. On
paper, the Zen 5 architecture looks quite a big step up compared to Zen
4, with the key component driving Zen 5 forward through higher
instructions per cycle than its predecessor, which is something AMD has
managed to do consistently from Zen to Zen 2, Zen 3, Zen 4, and now Zen
5. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech Not the review and deep analysis quite
yet, but a first thorough look at what Zen 5 is going to bring us,

Nim</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>I decided to document my journey of writing an OS in Nim. Why Nim?
It’s one of the few languages that allow low-level systems programming
with deterministic memory management (garbage collector is optional)
with destructors and move semantics. It’s also statically typed, which
provides greater type safety. It also supports inline assembly, which is
a must for OS development. Other options include C, C++, Rust, and Zig.
They’re great languages, but I chose Nim for its simplicity, elegance,
and performance. ↫ Fusion OS documentation website I love it when a
hobby operating system project not only uses a less common programming
language, but the author also details the entire development process in
great detail. It’s not a UNIX-like, and the goals are a single 64 bit
address space, capability-based security model, and a lot more. It’s
targeting UEFI machines, and the code is, of course, open source and
available on GitHub.</p>

<h1 id="2024-07-02-the-importance-of-moderation">
2024-07-02 The importance of moderation
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a> recently wrote
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/usenet">Usenet had to die</a>,
arguing that Usenet was wasteful, everybody carrying a copy of everybody
else, including spam and binaries. I agree with all the points made. The
idea that there is one global network of groups, with everybody carrying
all the groups and everybody being allowed to post led to the downfall
of Usenet.
</p>
<p>
Having recently hooked my laptop and server server to a handful of other
servers using UUCP, NNCP and NNTP for file copies, mail and news, I just
want to emphasize that the same technology can be used to build a
different net.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UUCP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Calling systems can be required to
have a username and password.
</li>
<li>
NNTP doesn’t have to be anonymous. Systems can be known peers based on
IP numbers and users can be required to authenticate themselves.
</li>
<li>
Servers don’t have to mirror all the groups. Systems can be selective in
what they accept and in what they pass on.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The spam problem arises when two systems “trust” each other and peer
messages but one of the systems doesn’t act on abuse and moderation
reports. Perhaps Usenet generated too much of a workload for system
administrators so they stopped following up on those reports. Perhaps
some servers had become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
I think we have the exact same problems with fedi. Some instances seem
too big to defederate from.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, individual blocking doesn’t work. If my posts end up on
an unmoderated server because somebody I like is following me, the post
shows up in the federated feed on that server and all the other users
that I don’t like can comment and those comments are sent back to me. I
can block them all individually or block the large instance including my
small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
<p>
To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are not
to blame for the downfall of Usenet. It was the lack of moderation that
killed Usenet. It was the ease of setting up web forums and being able
to moderate them that made Usenet irrelevant. In the end, to all these
people federation was not as important as moderation.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to drop the groups that were overrun with
people that needed moderation. This is a problem on all platforms with
groups, e.g. Reddit.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to create new groups for people in their
niches. At least nobody seems to be making that mistake again. IRC,
Reddit, Discord – they all demonstrated that ad-hoc group formation and
self-moderation was viable.
</p>
<p>
This is why I think moderation, group forming and selectivity of
federation are the most important quality of a platform.
</p>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.

Ah, that’s not a super new post, it’s from September 2023. I dug it out
again since we were talking about Illuminant, which seems awesome. It
uses hashtags only as post keywords and instead, if I understand things
correctly, relies on FEP-1b12 to provide group support.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s not quite the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s a bad thing that I’ve being hesitant to defederate from m.soc
even though I get more spam from it over Fedi than I’ve been getting
from email fro the past several years.
</p>
<p>
But I’m still only getting individual posts from m.soc or any other
server. (Which is also why hashtags don’t work the way people think.)
</p>
<p>
On Usenet, the typical behavior would be to carry the whole thing.
Currently, I get dozens of spam messages from m.soc. If I were to mirror
the whole thing (which is possible with AP relays, and is what would be
necessary for hashtags to work like channels, me mirroring the entirety
of all the non-banned servers), I’d have to deal with thousands of
messages. My server would croak.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A problem. But again something that was way worse with usenet because on
there, not only would I mirror or moderate abusive replies to me. I had
to mirror abusive replies to <em>everybody</em>.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I’m, for the most part, glad that the servers-that-can-comment
aren’t allowlisted, that it works like email, that I can get comments
from anyone. The downside of that is having to ban ban ban like crazy,
but if it didn’t work like that I’m not sure it even would be federated.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I can block them all individually or block the large instance including
my small number of friends. That instance has become too big to ban.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A problem. But on Usenet, <em>every</em> instance was too big to ban
since every instance was expected to carry everything.
</p>
<p>
Individual blocks is one way around it. That’s why I, a small instance
op, while I’ve banned many small mainly-abuse instances, my need to ban
the big sloppily moderated silos like m.soc or threads is a li’l lower
since I don’t have hundreds of users to protect, which a midsize
instance would have. I can absolutely see why midsize “safe space”
instances would ban m.soc for example.
</p>
<p>
Also I “silence” every instance since I don’t have a “whole known
network” tab.
</p>
<p>
Killfiles was a user-level way to mute users on newsgroups. So there was
<em>some</em> mitigation, but Fedi additionally has several other
moderation tools like instance bans or silencing.
</p>
<p>
More fundamentally: ActivityPub is about sending individual posts.
Usenet was about mirroring entire servers. Those two are not the same.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To come back to net news: From my point of view, the protocols are not
to blame for the downfall of Usenet.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The context that I wrote that Usenet post last September was to rant
about hashtags. (A topic that I’m gonna return to every now and then
until the group/tag situation gets a li’l better, which might require
new UX affordances or perhaps only education.)
</p>
<p>
That problem, summarized:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Servers can only show you the posts that it has already stumbled over,
through following or commenting
</li>
<li>
So when you browse a hashtag, you only see a very small subset of those
posts
</li>
<li>
Which is fine for organizing a handful of persons posts, like “I wanna
see all of Marie’s <code>#tidying</code> posts” or “I wanna go back and
take a look at all of my already-followed-friends
<code>#mosstodon</code> posts” or even for filtering out stuff. I.e.
it’s OK as a tool for <em>subsets</em> and <em>intersection</em>
</li>
<li>
It’s a disaster for <em>union</em>, for discovery, for “emulating
channels” which people are used to from Tumblr and Twitter, which worked
there since those are centralized
</li>
<li>
For hashtags to work the way people expect them to, servers would have
to mirror all posts. Like on Usenet.
</li>
<li>
There was an effort in that direction early on, with the “relay” system.
</li>
<li>
But small servers would croak. <strong>That’s</strong> the problem. It’d
be an environmental waste heap.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And that’s absolutely a protocol level problem!
</p>
<p>
A protocol level problem that Usenet had even without hashtags. (Well,
there was one hashtag: Kibo.)
</p>
<p>
I’ve said a couple of times that servers mirror each other and for the
sticklers in the audience I’ve got to add that not literally
<em>every</em> server carried <em>every</em> group. For example, some
didn’t carry Anarchists Lunatics Terrorists a.k.a. the <code>alt</code>
hierarchy. But that’s the fundamental intended flow. Group mirroring.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Usenet_servers_and_clients.svg" alt="Usenet
architecture" />
</p>
<p>
So in that way, Usenet is unlike mailing lists, where individual
messages are sent to individual users. FEP-1b12 group servers on Fedi
(like PieFed and MBin) are awesome because they get the best of both
worlds of the “only send the relevant posts” nature of mailing lists,
and the “we’re hosting this post anyway so we only need to store it once
in the SQL” nature of Usenet. As long as one user on a Lemmy server is
subscribed to <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="garderning">@garderning</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="foo.bar">@foo.bar</span></code>, like an email user might be
subscribed to a mailing list, it might-as-well display a copy of that
group since it’s getting those messages anyway. It’s not perfect and
we’re still paying a hefty “decentralization tax”, but it’s more robust
than mail and news.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It was the lack of moderation that killed Usenet. It was the ease of
setting up web forums and being able to moderate them that made Usenet
irrelevant.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Naw, Usenet kept puttering along after that, for a while, until the cost
(and legal danger) of mirroring huge binaries archives which was the
nail of nails. And that was a protocol level issue.
</p>
<p>
Fedi absolutely has a moderation problem. That is being addressed
although it seems to me that there are still unsolved problems.<br>
Usenet had a much bigger moderation problem and much of the reason for
that was on the protocol level. We have instances and instance bans to
help moderate clusters of users where each instance op helps moderate
the users on their instance. Moderation is happening on a user level
which makes much more sense than on a group level. (Someone can be a
saint on <code>alt.suicide.holiday</code> but a jerk on
<code>alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork</code> for example.)
</p>
<p>
But Usenet also has a scalability problem. Resource use. Better
moderation wouldn’t be nearly enough to fix that.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Administrators were unwilling to ban the instances that didn’t moderate
their users. This is a problem on all federated platforms, e.g. Mail.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Email can’t moderate their users since email isn’t supposed to be
world-readable. (With exceptions like mailing lists; we can ban someone
who sends abusive messages to those.) But even so, instance banning is
very common on email.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We can have a small network of servers offering mail and news exchange,
like in the old days. The problem is unmoderated growth.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Last time I talked about this I got the world’s most stubborn reply guy
on my neck who (since he was on a huge instance) could use hashtags to
find at least some amount of interesting posts and was resistant to
change. Since I mentioned scalability issues and how my server would
croak if it were to try to mirror even <em>one</em> of the big
instances, he started going on and on about “scalability is only for
capitalists”.
</p>
<p>
Yet another case of Smolnet Wishful Thinking Syndrome. The kind of
thinking that hates Eternal September more than anything but keeps
designing protocols that lead to more Eternal Septembers since they’re
about everyone-seeing-everyone and then they resort to technical
gatekeeping or even bullying to keep people out. Not into it.
</p>
<p>
My criticism of Usenet’s protocol here has nothing to do with capitalist
scaling, which is about “throwing computers at it”. Sure, that’d be one
solution to the protocol problems inherent to Usenet and
relay-laden-ActivityPub.
</p>
<p>
Real Smolnet scaling is about designing protocols that are about
connecting people to people (and to topic groups or other communities),
and in a non-wasteful, mottainai way create small overlapping villages
instead of one big shout-loud-and-go-viral channel.
</p>
<p>
There are two kinds of protocols. Those where everyone must see
everything (like Antenna and CAPCOM, and Twitter), and those where
that’s not the case (like ActivityPub and email).
</p>
<p>
Here are three network layouts:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://ellen.idiomdrottning.org/baran_networks.png" alt="Baran networks" />
</p>
<p>
First we have a centralized network. One hub server and then every
client is a spoke connected to that center core. The most efficient way
to organize an “everyone-must-see-everything” protocol, but vulnerable
to disasters like meteor strikes, nuclear explosions, billionaire
takeovers, or earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
Then we have a decentralized network. Several hubs connected to each
other, mirroring each other. Usenet worked like that. The hubs need to
be just as beefy as the ones in a centralized network. This has some
advantages like redundancy and robustnesss, and it’s more politically
appealing to the anarchists that built the internet. (Not sure why since
there’s still two tiers and a mod group that rules everything for
everyone.) It can be wasteful. It can handle
everyone-must-see-everything protocols. It can also really shine when
everyone <em>doesn’t</em> need to see everything, like IRC which is
super efficient. IRC is a brilliant protocol design that, like a mailing
list, only sends the messages to a server that that server needs.
</p>
<p>
Finally we have a distributed network. No hubs. It looks more like a
mesh where every machine is connected to only a handful of “nearby”
machines. This type of network is an absolute disaster for the
everyone-must-see-everything scenario! Redundant to the point of
wastefulness. That’s a future we must fight tooth and nail! And that’s
exactly where the relay-centered version of ActivityPub was headed, and
that’s what would be “needed” for hashtags-as-groups-and-discovery to
“work”.
</p>
<p>
Here’s where we the grassroots federalized ancom degrowth community need
to check ourselves before we wreck ourselves because even though
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/energy-is-undercosted" title="Energy is undercosted">energy
and e-waste is underpriced</a>, a capitalist for-profit silo company
would never in a million years set up a system like this because it’s
too wasteful ever for them, while we’re liable to do so since each
instance op only sees their <em>own</em> costs, not the cost for the
network as a whole. The megacorps are OK with centralization because for
them, the power consolidation in the first two network types is a
positive, while for us it’s a huge negative so we’re drawn to the third
type, so we need to be really careful and really responsible here.
</p>
<p>
But as bad as this layout is for everyone-must-see-everything, it’s
really awesome for protocols where everyone <em>doesn’t</em> need to see
everything. It’s economical, robust, cozy. ActivityPub (without the
relentless mirroring) is a good fit here. I can follow a handful of
users and be connected to their instances and only their posts are sent
to my instance, I don’t mirror the entire server. It’s actually pretty
awesome! It’s good for moderation too because I only need to moderate my
“neighborhood”. Yeah, a “neighborhood” is the perfect analogy for this;
neighborhoods that can and overlap but are still small and managed. A
system set up like that can remain smol and cozy even as it invites
everyone on Earth. It’s great. ActivityPub is awesome.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<strong>2024-07-08</strong>. I got a reply from
<a href="https://koldfront.dk/">Adam Sjøgren</a> regarding Sandra’s
comment on hashtag use in
<a href="https://illuminant.asjo.org/">Illuminant</a>.
</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
⁂
</div>
<p>
ActivityPub hashtags are translated to Keywords: and vice versa in
Illuminant. So far I haven’t had the need to use hashtags/keywords for
more than showing/writing them in Keywords: - I did have a plan to have
groups like fediverse.keyword.music, fediverse.keyword.askfedi etc. etc.
but I haven’t implemented it.
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry to say that I do not know what FEP-1b12 is, so I don’t think
Illuminant implements any of the group support defined in that.
</p>
<p>
Since Illuminant is very much driven by what I personally want and feel
like implementing/have the energy to implement, it has a kind of skewed
subset of what I guess is expected from a fediverse server/user
interface by most…
</p>
<p>
While it is fun for me to hear somebody call Illuminant awesome, I must
say that I’m pretty sure there is only one person in the universe who
actually runs it. Being proven wrong would be awesome, though.

id="google-can-totally-explain-why-chromium-browsers-quietly-tell-only-its-websites-about-your-cpu-gpu-usage">Google
can totally explain why Chromium browsers quietly tell only its websites
about your CPU, GPU usage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s time for Google being Google, this time by using an undocumented
APIs to track resource usage when using Chrome. When visiting a
*.google.com domain, the Google site can use the API to query the
real-time CPU, GPU, and memory usage of your browser, as well as info
about the processor you’re using, so that whatever service is being
provided – such as video-conferencing with Google Meet – could, for
instance, be optimized and tweaked so that it doesn’t overly tax your
computer. The functionality is implemented as an API provided by an
extension baked into Chromium – the browser brains primarily developed
by Google and used in Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and others. ↫ Brandon
Vigliarolo at The Register The original goal of the API was to give
Google’s various video chat services – I’ve lost count – the ability to
optimise themselves based on the available system resources. Crucially,
though, this API is only available to Google’s domains, and other,
competing services cannot make use of it. This is in clear violation of
the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, and with Chrome being by far
the most popular browser in the world, and thus a clear gatekeeper, the
European Commission really should have something to say about this. For
its part, Google told The Register it claims to comply with the DMA, so
we might see a change to this API soon. Aside from optimising video chat
performance, the API, which is baked into a non-removable extension,
also tracks performance issues and crashes and reports these back to
Google. This second use, too, is at its core not a bad thing –
especially if users are given the option to opt out of such crash
analytics. Still, it seems odd to use an undocumented API for something
like this, but I’m not a developer so what do I know. Mind you, other
Chromium-based browsers also report this data back to Google, which is
wild when you think about it. Normally I would suggest people switch to
Firefox, but I’ve got some choice words for Firefox and Mozilla, too,
later today.</p>

pictures, bootable floppy disks, and the first Canon Cat demo?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>About a month ago, Cameron Kaiser first introduced us to the Canon
Cat, a computer designed by Jeff Raskin, but abandoned within six months
by Canon, who had no idea what to do with it. In his second article on
the Cat, Kaiser dives much deeper into the software and operating system
of the Cat, even going so far as to become the first person to write
software for it. One of the most surprising aspects of the Cat is that
it’s collaborative; other users can call into your Cat using a landline
and edit the same document you’re working on remotely. Selecting text
has other functions too. When I say everything goes in the workspace, I
do mean everything. The Cat is designed to be collabourative: you can
hook up your Cat to a phone line, or at least you could when landlines
were more ubiquitous, and someone could call in and literally type into
your document remotely. If you dialed up a service, you would type into
the document and mark and send text to the remote system, and the remote
system’s response would also become part of your document. (That goes
for the RS-232 port as well, by the way. In fact, we’ll deliberately
exploit this capability for the projects in this article.) ↫ Cameron
Kaiser You can also do calculations right into the text, going so far as
allowing the user to define variables and reuse those variables
throughout the text to perform various equations and other mathematic
operations. If you go back and change the value of a variable, all other
equations using those variables are updated as well. That’s quite nifty,
especially considering the age of the Cat, and since the Cat is fixed
width, you can effectively create spreadsheets this way, too. There’s
really far too much to cover here, and I strongly suggest you head on
over and read the entire thing.</p>

quietly updates official lightweight Windows 11 Validation OS ISOs for
24H2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft has again quietly updated its Validation OS ISOs. In case
you are not familiar with it, Validation OS is an official lightweight
variant of Windows and it is designed for hardware vendors to test,
validate and repair hardware defects. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin I had no
idea this variant of Windows existed, but it kind of makes sense when
you think about it. OEMs or other companies making devices that run or
work with Windows may need to test, reboot, test, reboot, and so on,
endlessly, and having a lightweight and fast version of Windows that
doesn’t load any junk you don’t need – or just loads straight into your
company’s hardware testing application – is incredibly valuable.
According to Microsoft, the Windows Validation OS boots to a command
line that allows you to run Win32 applications. This has made me wonder
if I can use it for the one thing I am forced to use Windows for:
playing League of Legends (I cobbled together a spare parts machine
solely for this purpose). My guess is that either the Validation OS will
lack certain components or frameworks League of Legends requires, or is
so different from regular Windows that it will trip Riot Games’ rootkit,
or both. Still, I’m curious. I might load this up on a spare hard drive
and what’s possible.</p>

<h2 id="github-is-starting-to-feel-like-legacy-software">GitHub is
starting to feel like legacy software</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>The corporate branding, the new “AI-powered developer platform”
slogan, makes it clear that what I think of as “GitHub”—the traditional
website, what are to me the core features—simply isn’t Microsoft’s
priority at this point in time. I know many talented people at GitHub
who care, but the company’s priorities just don’t seem to value what I
value about the service. This isn’t an anti-AI statement so much as a
recognition that the tool I still need to use every day is past its
prime. Copilot isn’t navigating the website for me, replacing my need to
the website as it exists today. I’ve had tools hit this phase of decline
and turn it around, but I’m not optimistic. It’s still plenty usable
now, and probably will be for some years to come, but I’ll want to know
what other options I have now rather than when things get worse than
this. ↫ Misty De Meo Apparently, GitHub is in the middle of a long,
drawn-out process where it’s rewriting its frontend using React. De Meo
was trying to use a particular feature of GitHub – the blame view, which
also works through the command line but is apparently much harder to
parse there – and realised the browser search feature just couldn’t find
the line of code they absolutely knew for sure was there. After
scrolling for a while, the browser search feature suddenly found the
line of code. I’d heard rumblings that GitHub’s in the middle of
shipping a frontend rewrite in React, and I realized this must be it.
The problem wasn’t that the line I wanted wasn’t on the page—it’s that
the whole document wasn’t being rendered at once, so my browser’s
builtin search bar just couldn’t find it. On a hunch, I tried disabling
JavaScript entirely in the browser, and suddenly it started working
again. GitHub is able to send a fully server-side rendered version of
the page, which actually works like it should, but doesn’t do so unless
JavaScript is completely unavailable. ↫ Misty De Meo Seem like a classic
case of people being told to develop something in too little time, with
the wrong tools, while management is breathing down their necks and
pulling engineers away to work on buzzwords like “AI”.</p>

BTW, I’m intermittently locked out of my
<a href="https://www.threads.net/@davew/post/C9Z5Tc5JZOa">Threads</a>
account.
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/07/14/threadsMessage.png">They
say</a> it has to do with automated stuff they don’t explain. I don’t
have any apps that do anything with Instagram or Threads. I tried
changing the password. Anyway, I was just starting to like the network,
it has its own feel, and have made some friends there, but I have no
energy to fight it, at least not right now. If you don’t see me over
there, this is why.

How I found out about Trump’s assassination. By accident, I was watching
CNN when they switched over to his rally. I listened to the first few
minutes, ugly lies, the usual disgusting stuff, so I switched over to
season 6 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Duty">Line of
Duty</a>, which isn’t very great. I couldn’t focus on the show. I got my
iPad and checked out Bluesky and saw a message from someone regretting
that <i>he</i> hadn’t been killed, and somehow I knew that “he” was
Trump, so I switched back to the news, and saw the live events, Trump
asking for his shoes, and then doing that disgusting thing with his
fist, looking right into the camera. He’s 100 percent television actor.
Either the whole thing was staged, or he just thinks that way, it didn’t
cross his mind that a bullet aimed at his brain had barely missed
killing him. He’s thinking of his business model. Now I must confess my
first thought was just like the person on Bluesky. Now Trump who lies
about being a victim, really is a victim, and we’ll never hear the end
of it. And it didn’t take long before a random Republican asshole was
saying this was Biden’s fault for saying Trump would end democracy,
which he has said he will, promised to do, and <i>we saw him try to do
it</i> on Jan 6. And the CNN reporter went along with it, saying the
temperature has to be lowered on both sides. There it was. Both sides.
It didn’t take any time for the Republican talking points to dominate.
This was Biden’s fault they all agree. Occam’s Razor says this is over.
We aren’t going to vote in November. The deal is done because the
journos, who really control who is elected, have made their choice. I’ve
yet to hear another explanation from them.
</p>
<p>
If someone from Russia or Ukraine were to read the previous paragraph,
they’d nod their heads and say the US is now Russia. That’s how our
journalism and politics work. The oligarchs have sold out to the
dictator. This is what it’s like after that happened. People inside big
companies look the other way all the time, and try to compartmentalize.
Now their malaise becomes ours.
</p>
<p>
BTW, if Biden steps aside don’t expect the Repubs won’t sue saying it’s
illegal, so guess what – not only don’t you get Biden, you don’t even
get a replacement. The election will be like a Russian election, with
just one actual candidate on the ballot and a few total losers for
appearances. A great card to hold in your pocket. I bet they have the
arguments already written.

My opinion about yesterday’s assassination as a political tool is that
using F-16s to kill 100 Palestinians was unjustifiable.
</p>
<p>
The Lancet now puts the death toll in Gaza at about 10% of the
population.
</p>
<p>
And Gaza having the most children amputees in the world in nine months
is depraved.
