## The immunoregulatory role of gut microbiota in the incidence, progression, and therapy of breast cancer

date: 2024-07-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Breast cancer (BrCa) is the most prevalent malignant tumor in women and one of the leading causes of female mortality. Its occurrence and progression are influenced by various factors, including genetics, environment, lifestyle, and hormones. In recent years, the gut microbiota has been identified as a significant factor affecting BrCa. The gut microbiota refers to the collective population of various microorganisms in the human gastrointestinal tract. Gut microbiota is closely associated with human health and disease development, participating in crucial physiological functions such as digestion, metabolism, immune response, and neural regulation. It has been found to influence the occurrence and treatment of BrCa through a variety of mechanisms. This article aims to review the immunomodulatory role of the gut microbiota in the development and treatment of BrCa.

## MDSCs use a complex molecular network to suppress T-cell immunity in a pulmonary model of fungal infection

date: 2024-07-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundParacoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic endemic fungal disease prevalent in Latin America. Previous studies revealed that host immunity against PCM is tightly regulated by several suppressive mechanisms mediated by tolerogenic plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the enzyme 2,3 indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO-1), regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and through the recruitment and activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We have recently shown that Dectin-1, TLR2, and TLR4 signaling influence the IDO-1-mediated suppression caused by MDSCs. However, the contribution of these receptors in the production of important immunosuppressive molecules used by MDSCs has not yet been explored in pulmonary PCM.MethodsWe evaluated the expression of PD-L1, IL-10, as well as nitrotyrosine by MDSCs after anti-Dectin-1, anti-TLR2, and anti-TLR4 antibody treatment followed by P. brasiliensis yeasts challenge in vitro. We also investigated the influence of PD-L1, IL-10, and nitrotyrosine in the suppressive activity of lung-infiltrating MDSCs of C57BL/6-WT, Dectin-1KO, TLR2KO, and TLR4KO mice after in vivo fungal infection. The suppressive activity of MDSCs was evaluated in cocultures of isolated MDSCs with activated T-cells.ResultsA reduced expression of IL-10 and nitrotyrosine was observed after in vitro anti-Dectin-1 treatment of MDSCs challenged with fungal cells. This finding was further confirmed in vitro and in vivo by using Dectin-1KO mice. Furthermore, MDSCs derived from Dectin-1KO mice showed a significantly reduced immunosuppressive activity on the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Blocking of TLR2 and TLR4 by mAbs and using MDSCs from TLR2KO and TLR4KO mice also reduced the production of suppressive molecules induced by fungal challenge. In vitro, MDSCs from TLR4KO mice presented a reduced suppressive capacity over the proliferation of CD4+ T-cells.ConclusionWe showed that the pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) Dectin-1, TLR2, and TLR4 contribute to the suppressive activity of MDSCs by inducing the expression of several immunosuppressive molecules such as PD-L1, IL-10, and nitrotyrosine. This is the first demonstration of a complex network of PRRs signaling in the induction of several suppressive molecules by MDSCs and its contribution to the immunosuppressive mechanisms that control immunity and severity of pulmonary PCM.

## Beyond antibiotics: CRISPR/Cas9 triumph over biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance infections

date: 2024-07-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

A complex structure known as a biofilm is formed when a variety of bacterial colonies or a single type of cell in a group sticks to a surface. The extracellular polymeric compounds that encase these cells, often consisting of proteins, eDNA, and polysaccharides, exhibit strong antibiotic resistance. Concerns about biofilm in the pharmaceutical industry, public health, and medical fields have sparked a lot of interest, as antibiotic resistance is a unique capacity exhibited by these biofilm-producing bacteria, which increases morbidity and death. Biofilm formation is a complicated process that is controlled by several variables. Insights into the processes to target for the therapy have been gained from multiple attempts to dissect the biofilm formation process. Targeting pathogens within a biofilm is profitable because the bacterial pathogens become considerably more resistant to drugs in the biofilm state. Although biofilm-mediated infections can be lessened using the currently available medications, there has been a lot of focus on the development of new approaches, such as bioinformatics tools, for both treating and preventing the production of biofilms. Technologies such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, nanotherapeutics and proteomics are also used to develop novel anti-biofilm agents. These techniques help to identify small compounds that can be used to inhibit important biofilm regulators. The field of appropriate control strategies to avoid biofilm formation is expanding quickly because of this spurred study. As a result, the current article addresses our current knowledge of how biofilms form, the mechanisms by which bacteria in biofilms resist antibiotics, and cutting-edge treatment approaches for infections caused by biofilms. Furthermore, we have showcased current ongoing research utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to combat bacterial biofilm infections, particularly those brought on by lethal drug-resistant pathogens, concluded the article with a novel hypothesis and aspirations, and acknowledged certain limitations.

## Detection technology and clinical applications of serum viral products of hepatitis B virus infection

date: 2024-07-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Viral hepatitis, caused by its etiology, hepatitis virus, is a public health problem globally. Among all infections caused by hepatitis-associated viruses, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the most serious medical concern. HBV infection particularly affects people in East Asia and Africa, the Mediterranean region, and Eastern Europe, with a prevalence rate of > 2%. Currently, approximately 1 billion people worldwide are infected with HBV, and nearly 30% of them experience chronic infection. Chronic HBV infection can lead to chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), resulting in the related death of approximately 1 million people annually. Although preventative vaccines and antiviral therapies are currently available, there is no cure for this infection. Clinical testing is not only the gateway for diagnosis of HBV infection, but also crucial for judging the timing of medication, evaluating the effect of antiviral therapy, and predicting the risk of relapse after drug withdrawal in the whole follow-up management of hepatitis B infected persons. With advances in detection technology, it is now possible to measure various viral components in the blood to assess the clinical status of HBV infection. Serum viral products of HBV infection, such as HBV DNA, HBV RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e-antigen, and hepatitis B core-related antigen, are non-invasive indicators that are critical for the rapid diagnosis and management of related diseases. Improving the sensitivity of monitoring of these products is essential, and the development of corresponding detection technologies is pivotal in achieving this goal. This review aims to offer valuable insights into CHB infection and references for its effective treatment. We provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of classical and novel methods for detecting HBV serum viral products and discusses their clinical applications, along with the latest research progress in this field.

## Histone deacetylase 8 promotes innate antiviral immunity through deacetylation of RIG-I

date: 2024-07-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Histone deacetylates family proteins have been studied for their function in regulating viral replication by deacetylating non-histone proteins. RIG-I (Retinoic acid-inducible gene I) is a critical protein in RNA virus-induced innate antiviral signaling pathways. Our previous research showed that HDAC8 (histone deacetylase 8) involved in innate antiviral immune response, but the underlying mechanism during virus infection is still unclear. In this study, we showed that HDAC8 was involved in the regulation of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication. Over-expression of HDAC8 inhibited while knockdown promoted VSV replication. Further exploration demonstrated that HDAC8 interacted with and deacetylated RIG-I, which eventually lead to enhance innate antiviral immune response. Collectively, our data clearly demonstrated that HDAC8 inhibited VSV replication by promoting RIG-I mediated interferon production and downstream signaling pathway.

## Implications of lncRNAs in Helicobacter pylori-associated gastrointestinal cancers: underlying mechanisms and future perspectives

date: 2024-07-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a harmful bacterium that is difficult to conveniently diagnose and effectively eradicate. Chronic H. pylori infection increases the risk of gastrointestinal diseases, even cancers. Despite the known findings, more underlying mechanisms are to be deeply explored to facilitate the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies of H. pylori infection. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are RNAs with more than 200 nucleotides. They may be implicated in cell proliferation, inflammation and many other signaling pathways of gastrointestinal cancer progression. The dynamic expression of lncRNAs indicates their potential to be diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. In this paper, we comprehensively summarize the processes of H. pylori infection and the treatment methods, review the known findings of lncRNA classification and functional mechanisms, elucidate the roles of lncRNAs in H. pylori-related gastrointestinal cancer, and discuss the clinical perspectives of lncRNAs.

date: 2024-07-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Background/purpose(s)The continuously increasing carbapenem resistance within Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas poses a threat to public health, nevertheless, the molecular characteristics of which in southern China still remain limited. And carbapenemase identification is a key factor in effective early therapy of carbapenem-resistant bacteria infections. We aimed to determine the molecular characteristics of these pathogens and compare commercial combined disc tests (CDTs) with the modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM) and EDTA-CIM (eCIM) in detecting and distinguishing carbapenemases using whole genome sequencing (WGS).MethodsA total of 78 Enterobacterales, 30 Pseudomonas were obtained from two tertiary hospitals in southern China. Susceptibility tests were conducted using an automated VITEK2 compact system with confirmation via the Kirby–Bauer method. The WGS was conducted on all clinical isolates and the molecular characteristics were analyzed by screening the whole genome sequences. CDTs with or without cloxacillin, mCIM, and eCIM, were performed and compared by taking WGS results as the benchmark.ResultsA total of 103 carbapenem non-susceptible and 5 carbapenem susceptible bacteria were determined, with Klebsiella pneumoniae (42.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.3%) and Escherichia coli (18.4%) being most prevalent. Carbapenemase genes were detected in 58 (56.3%) of the 103 carbapenem-non-susceptible clinical isolates, including 46 NDM, 6 KPC, 3 IMP, 1 IPM+VIM,1NDM+KPC, and 1 OXA-181. Carbapenemase-producing isolates were detected more frequently in Enterobacterales (76.3%). Among K. pneumoniae, the major sequence types were st307 and st11, while among E. coli and P. aeruginosa, the most prevalent ones were st410 and st242 respectively. For carbapenemase detection in Enterobacterales, the mCIM method achieved 100.00% (95% CI, 92.13–100.00%) sensitivity and 94.44% (70.63–99.71%) specificity (kappa, 0.96); for Pseudomonas, detection sensitivity was 100% (5.46–100.00%), and 100% (84.50–100.00%) specificity (kappa, 0.65). Commercial CDT carbapenemase detection sensitivity for Enterobacterales was 96.49% (86.84–99.39%), and 95.24% (74.13–99.75%) specificity (kappa, 0.90); for Pseudomonas, carbapenemase detection sensitivity was 100.00% (5.46–100.00%) and 37.93% (21.30–57.64%) specificity (kappa, 0.04). When cloxacillin testing was added, CDT specificity reached 84.61% (64.27–94.95%).ConclusionThe molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-non-susceptible isolates from pediatric patients in Southern China exhibited distinctive characteristics. Both the mCIM–eCIM combination and CDT methods effectively detected and differentiated carbapenemases among Enterobacterales isolates, and the former performed better than CDT among Pseudomonas.

## Seasonal dynamics of intestinal microbiota in juvenile Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) in the Yangtze Estuary

date: 2024-07-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionIn this study, the seasonal differences in the intestinal microbiota of Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) larvae were investigated at different sites in the intertidal zone of the Yangtze River Estuary.Methods16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology was used to compare and analyze the microbial community structure in the intestines of juvenile crab from different seasons.ResultsThe results showed that the main microbial phyla in all seasons and sites were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, which accounted for 97.1% of the total microbiota. Composition analysis revealed that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria decreased from summer to winter at each station, whereas Bacteroidetes showed the opposite trend. Alpha diversity analysis showed that species richness increased from summer to winter at the upstream site (P < 0.05), but decreased at the downstream site (P < 0.05), with no significant differences observed in other comparisons. Biomarker species analysis showed that juvenile crab exhibited a more specialized microbial community in summer compared with autumn and winter. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that microbial interaction network complexity was lower in autumn compared with summer and autumn. Functional prediction analysis showed that the microbial community only exhibited seasonal differences in amino acid biosynthesis, cofactor, prosthetic group, electron carrier, and vitamin biosynthesis, aromatic compound degradation, nucleotide and nucleoside degradation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways.DiscussionThe results indicated that the microbiota did not significantly differ among sites, and seasonal variation was a main factor influencing the differences in intestinal microbiota of Chinese mitten juvenile crab. Moreover, the microbial community was more complex in summer compared with autumn and winter.

date: 2024-07-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionUlcerative colitis is an inflammatory disorder characterized by chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the colon and rectum. Although the precise etiology of ulcerative colitis remains unclear, recent research has underscored the significant role of the microbiome in its development and progression.MethodsThe aim of this study was to establish a relationship between the levels of specific gut bacterial species and disease relapse in ulcerative colitis. For this study, we recruited 105 ulcerative colitis patients in remission and collected clinical data, blood, and stool samples. Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides distasonis levels were quantified in the stool samples of ulcerative colitis patients. Binary logistic regression was applied to collected data to predict disease remission.ResultsThe median time in remission in this cohort was four years. A predictive model incorporating demographic information, clinical data, and the levels of Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides distasonis was developed to understand remission patterns.DiscussionOur findings revealed a negative correlation between the levels of these two microorganisms and the duration of remission. These findings highlight the importance of the gut microbiota in ulcerative colitis for disease prognosis and for personalized treatments based on microbiome interventions.

## Repairing gut barrier by traditional Chinese medicine: roles of gut microbiota

date: 2024-07-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Gut barrier is not only part of the digestive organ but also an important immunological organ for the hosts. The disruption of gut barrier can lead to various diseases such as obesity and colitis. In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gained much attention for its rich clinical experiences enriched in thousands of years. After orally taken, TCM can interplay with gut microbiota. On one hand, TCM can modulate the composition and function of gut microbiota. On the other hand, gut microbiota can transform TCM compounds. The gut microbiota metabolites produced during the actions of these interplays exert noticeable pharmacological effects on the host especially gut barrier. Recently, a large number of studies have investigated the repairing and fortifying effects of TCM on gut barriers from the perspective of gut microbiota and its metabolites. However, no review has summarized the mechanism behand this beneficiary effects of TCM. In this review, we first briefly introduce the unique structure and specific function of gut barrier. Then, we summarize the interactions and relationship amidst gut microbiota, gut microbiota metabolites and TCM. Further, we summarize the regulative effects and mechanisms of TCM on gut barrier including physical barrier, chemical barrier, immunological barrier, and microbial barrier. At last, we discuss the effects of TCM on diseases that are associated gut barrier destruction such as ulcerative colitis and type 2 diabetes. Our review can provide insights into TCM, gut barrier and gut microbiota.

## Antimicrobial resistance genes harbored in invasive Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex isolated from Korean children during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic periods, 2015–2020

date: 2024-07-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAcinetobacter baumannii (AB) has emerged as one of the most challenging pathogens worldwide, causing invasive infections in the critically ill patients due to their ability to rapidly acquire resistance to antibiotics. This study aimed to analyze antibiotic resistance genes harbored in AB and non-baumannii Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (NB-ACB) complex causing invasive diseases in Korean children. MethodsACB complexes isolated from sterile body fluid of children in three referral hospitals were prospectively collected. Colistin susceptibility was additionally tested via broth microdilution. Whole genome sequencing was performed and antibiotic resistance genes were analyzed.ResultsDuring January 2015 to December 2020, a total of 67 ACB complexes were isolated from sterile body fluid of children in three referral hospitals. The median age of the patients was 0.6 (interquartile range, 0.1–7.2) years old. Among all the isolates, 73.1% (n=49) were confirmed as AB and others as NB-ACB complex by whole genome sequencing. Among the AB isolates, only 22.4% susceptible to carbapenem. In particular, all clonal complex (CC) 92 AB (n=33) showed multi-drug resistance, whereas 31.3% in non-CC92 AB (n=16) (P<0.001). NB-ACB showed 100% susceptibility to all classes of antibiotics except 3rd generation cephalosporin (72.2%). The main mechanism of carbapenem resistance in AB was the blaoxa23 gene with ISAba1 insertion sequence upstream. Presence of pmr gene and/or mutation of lpxA/C gene were not correlated with the phenotype of colistin resistance of ACB. All AB and NB-ACB isolates carried the abe and ade multidrug efflux pumps.ConclusionsIn conclusion, monitoring and research for resistome in ACB complex is needed to identify and manage drug-resistant AB, particularly CC92 AB carrying the blaoxa23 gene.

## Modified transport medium for improving influenza virus detection

date: 2024-07-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAccurate detection of influenza virus in clinical samples requires correct execution of all aspects of the detection test. If the viral load in a sample is below the detection limit, a false negative result may be obtained. To overcome this issue, we developed a modified transport medium (MTM) for clinical sample transportation to increase viral detection sensitivity.MethodWe first validated the MTM using laboratory-stocked influenza A viruses (IAVs: H1N1, H3N2, H7N3, H9N2) and influenza B viruses (IBVs: Yamagata, Victoria). We also tested clinical samples. A total of 110 patients were enrolled and a pair of samples were collected to determine the sensitivity of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) following MTM treatment.ResultAfter 24 h culturing in MTM, the viral loads were increased, represented by a 10-fold increase in detection sensitivity for H1N1, H9N2, and IBVs, a 100-fold increase for H3N2, and a 1,000-fold increase for H7N3. We further tested the effects of MTM on 19 IAV and 11 IBV stored clinical samples. The RT-PCR results showed that the positive detection rate of IAV samples increased from 63.16% (12/19) without MTM culturing to 78.95% (15/19) after 48 h culturing, and finally 89.47% (17/19) after 72 h culturing. MTM treatment of IBV clinical samples also increased the positive detection rate from 36.36% (4/11, 0 h) to 63.64% (7/11, 48 h) to 72.73% (8/11, 72 h). For clinical samples detected by RT-PCR, MTM outperformed other transport mediums in terms of viral detection rate (11.81% increase, P=0.007).ConclusionOur results demonstrated that the use of MTM for clinical applications can increase detection sensitivity, thus facilitating the accurate diagnosis of influenza infection.

## Bacterial protein acetylation: mechanisms, functions, and methods for study

date: 2024-07-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Lysine acetylation is an evolutionarily conserved protein modification that changes protein functions and plays an essential role in many cellular processes, such as central metabolism, transcriptional regulation, chemotaxis, and pathogen virulence. It can alter DNA binding, enzymatic activity, protein-protein interactions, protein stability, or protein localization. In prokaryotes, lysine acetylation occurs non-enzymatically and by the action of lysine acetyltransferases (KAT). In enzymatic acetylation, KAT transfers the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) to the lysine side chain. In contrast, acetyl phosphate (AcP) is the acetyl donor of chemical acetylation. Regardless of the acetylation type, the removal of acetyl groups from acetyl lysines occurs only enzymatically by lysine deacetylases (KDAC). KATs are grouped into three main superfamilies based on their catalytic domain sequences and biochemical characteristics of catalysis. Specifically, members of the GNAT are found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and have a core structural domain architecture. These enzymes can acetylate small molecules, metabolites, peptides, and proteins. This review presents current knowledge of acetylation mechanisms and functional implications in bacterial metabolism, pathogenicity, stress response, translation, and the emerging topic of protein acetylation in the gut microbiome. Additionally, the methods used to elucidate the biological significance of acetylation in bacteria, such as relative quantification and stoichiometry quantification, and the genetic code expansion tool (CGE), are reviewed.

## Emergence of a clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae harboring an acrAB-tolC in chromosome and carrying the two repetitive tandem core structures for blaKPC-2 and blaCTX-M-65 in a plasmid

date: 2024-07-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThe emergence of clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae strains harboring acrAB-tolC genes in the chromosome, along with the presence of two repetitive tandem core structures for blaKPC-2 and blaCTX-M-65 genes on a plasmid, has presented a significant clinical challenge.MethodsIn order to study the detailed genetic features of K. pneumoniae strain SC35, both the bacterial chromosome and plasmids were sequenced using Illumina and nanopore platforms. Furthermore, bioinformatics methods were employed to analyze the mobile genetic elements associated with antibiotic resistance genes.ResultsK. pneumoniae strain SC35 was found to possess a class A beta-lactamase and demonstrated resistance to all tested antibiotics. This resistance was attributed to the presence of efflux pump genes, specifically acrAB-tolC, on the SC35 chromosome. Additionally, the SC35 plasmid p1 carried the two repetitive tandem core structures for blaKPC-2 and blaCTX-M-65, as well as blaTEM-1 with rmtB, which shared overlapping structures with mobile genetic elements as In413, Tn3, and TnAs3. Through plasmid transfer assays, it was determined that the SC35 plasmid p1 could be successfully transferred with an average conjugation frequency of 6.85 × 10-4.ConclusionThe structure of the SC35 plasmid p1 appears to have evolved in correlation with other plasmids such as pKPC2_130119, pDD01754–2, and F4_plasmid pA. The infectious strain SC35 exhibits no susceptibility to tested antibioticst, thus effective measures should be taken to prevent the spread and epidemic of this strain.

## 1H-Pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid, a quorum sensing inhibitor from one endophytic fungus in Areca catechu L., acts as antibiotic accelerant against Pseudomonas aeruginosa

date: 2024-07-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Pseudomonas aeruginosa has already been stipulated as a “critical” pathogen, emphasizing the urgent need for researching and developing novel antibacterial agents due to multidrug resistance. Bacterial biofilm formation facilitates cystic fibrosis development and restricts the antibacterial potential of many current antibiotics. The capacity of P. aeruginosa to form biofilms and resist antibiotics is closely correlated with quorum sensing (QS). Bacterial QS is being contemplated as a promising target for developing novel antibacterial agents. QS inhibitors are a promising strategy for treating chronic infections. This study reported that the active compound PT22 (1H-pyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylic acid) isolated from Perenniporia tephropora FF2, one endophytic fungus from Areca catechu L., presents QS inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa. Combined with gentamycin or piperacillin, PT22 functions as a novel antibiotic accelerant against P. aeruginosa. PT22 (0.50 mg/mL, 0.75 mg/mL, and 1.00 mg/mL) reduces the production of QS-related virulence factors, such as pyocyanin and rhamnolipid, and inhibits biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa PAO1 instead of affecting its growth. The architectural disruption of the biofilms was confirmed by visualization through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) indicated that PT22 significantly attenuated the expression of QS-related genes followed by docking analysis of molecules against QS activator proteins. PT22 dramatically increased the survival rate of Galleria mellonella. PT22 combined with gentamycin or piperacillin presents significant inhibition of biofilm formation and eradication of mature biofilm compared to monotherapy, which was also confirmed by visualization through SEM and CLSM. After being treated with PT22 combined with gentamycin or piperacillin, the survival rates of G. mellonella were significantly increased compared to those of monotherapy. PT22 significantly enhanced the susceptibility of gentamycin and piperacillin against P. aeruginosa PAO1. Our results suggest that PT22 from P. tephropora FF2 as a potent QS inhibitor is a candidate antibiotic accelerant to combat the antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa.

## Investigations of microbiota composition and neuroactive pathways in association with symptoms of stress and depression in a cohort of healthy women

date: 2024-07-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundDespite mounting evidence of gut-brain involvement in psychiatric conditions, functional data remain limited, and analyses of other microbial niches, such as the vaginal microbiota, are lacking in relation to mental health. This aim of this study was to investigate if the connections between the gut microbiome and mental health observed in populations with a clinical diagnosis of mental illness extend to healthy women experiencing stress and depressive symptoms. Additionally, this study examined the functional pathways of the gut microbiota according to the levels of psychological symptoms. Furthermore, the study aimed to explore potential correlations between the vaginal microbiome and mental health parameters in young women without psychiatric diagnoses.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, 160 healthy Danish women (aged 18-40 years) filled out questionnaires with validated scales measuring symptoms of stress and depression and frequency of dietary intake. Fecal and vaginal microbiota samples were collected at the beginning of the menstrual cycle and vaginal samples were also collected at cycle day 8-12 and 18-22. Shotgun metagenomic profiling of the gut and vaginal microbiome was performed. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used for functional profiling and 56 Gut Brain Modules were analyzed in the fecal samples.ResultsThe relative abundance in the gut of the genera Escherichia, Parabacteroides, and Shigella was higher in women with elevated depressive symptoms. Women with high perceived stress showed a tendency of increased abundance of Escherichia, Shigella, and Blautia. Amongst others, the potentially pathogenic genera, Escherichia and Shigella correlate with alterations in the neuroactive pathways such as the glutamatergic, GABAeric, dopaminergic, and Kynurenine pathways. Vaginosis symptoms were more prevalent in women reporting high levels of stress and depressive symptoms.ConclusionsThe findings of this study support the concept of a microbiota-associated effect on the neuroactive pathways even in healthy young women. This suggest, that targeting the gut microbiome could be a promising approach for future psychiatric interventions.

## The mechanism of Gejie Zhilao Pill in treating tuberculosis based on network pharmacology and molecular docking verification

date: 2024-07-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionGejie Zhilao Pill (GJZLP), a traditional Chinese medicine formula is known for its unique therapeutic effects in treating pulmonary tuberculosis. The aim of this study is to further investigate its underlying mechanisms by utilizing network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques.MethodsUsing TCMSP database the components, potential targets of GJZLP were identified. Animal-derived components were supplemented through the TCMID and BATMAN-TCM databases. Tuberculosis-related targets were collected from the TTD, OMIM, and GeneCards databases. The intersection target was imported into the String database to build the PPI network. The Metascape platform was employed to carry out Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Heatmaps were generated through an online platform (https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn). Molecular docking was conducted between the core targets and core compounds to explore their binding strengths and patterns at the molecular level.Results61 active ingredients and 118 therapeutic targets were identified. Quercetin, Luteolin, epigallocatechin gallate, and beta-sitosterol showed relatively high degrees in the network. IL6, TNF, JUN, TP53, IL1B, STAT3, AKT1, RELA, IFNG, and MAPK3 are important core targets. GO and KEGG revealed that the effects of GJZLP on tuberculosis mainly involve reactions to bacterial molecules, lipopolysaccharides, and cytokine stimulation. Key signaling pathways include TNF, IL-17, Toll-like receptor and C-type lectin receptor signaling. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated a robust binding affinity between the core compounds and the core proteins. Stigmasterol exhibited the lowest binding energy with AKT1, indicating the most stable binding interaction.DiscussionThis study has delved into the efficacious components and molecular mechanisms of GJZLP in treating tuberculosis, thereby highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of tuberculosis.

## Burkholderia cepacia in cystic fibrosis children and adolescents: overall survival and immune alterations

date: 2024-07-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundIn current literature there are only scarce data on the host inflammatory response during Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) persistence. The primary objective of the present research was to carry out cross-sectional analyses of biomarkers and evaluate disease progression in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with chronic Bcc infection and pathogen-free ones. The secondary aim was to assess prospectively overall survival of the study participants during up to 8 years of follow-up.MethodsThe study included 116 paediatric patients with CF; 47 CF patients were chronically infected with Bcc, and 69 individuals were Bcc free. Plasma and sputum biomarkers (neutrophil elastase, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-12, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, IL-22, IL-23, IL-17, IFN-γ, TGFβ1, TNF-α) were analysed using commercially available kits. Besides, inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on proliferative response of PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes had been assessed.ResultsBcc infected patients did not differ from Bcc free ones in demographic and clinical parameters, but demonstrated an increased rate of glucose metabolism disturbances and survival disadvantage during prolong follow-up period. Biomarkers analyses revealed elevated TNF-α and reduced IL-17F levels in sputum samples of Bcc infected patients. These patients also demonstrated improvement of peripheral blood lymphocyte sensitivity to steroid treatment and reduction in plasma pro-inflammatory (IL-17F and IL-18) and anti-inflammatory (TGFβ1 and IL-10) cytokine concentrations.ConclusionsReduction in IL-17F levels may have several important consequences including increase in steroid sensitivity and glycemic control disturbances. Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of IL-17 cytokines in CF complication development. Low plasma TGFβ1 and IL-10 levels in Bcc infected group may be a sign of subverted activity of regulatory T cells. Such immune alterations may be one of the factors contributing to the development of the cepacia syndrome.

## Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing for rapid molecular identification in spinal infection diagnosis

date: 2024-07-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of metagenomic next−generation sequencing (mNGS) for detecting pathogens in spinal infections and to identify the differences in the diagnostic performance between mNGS and targeted next−generation sequencing (tNGS).MethodsA total of 76 consecutive patients with suspected spinal infections who underwent mNGS, culture, and histopathological examinations were retrospectively studied. The final diagnosis of the patient was determined by combining the clinical treatment results, pathological examinations, imaging changes and laboratory indicators. The sensitivity and specificity of mNGS and culture were determined.ResultsThe difference between the two detection rates was statistically significant (p < 0.001), with mNGS exhibiting a significantly higher detection rate (77.6% versus 18.4%). The average diagnosis time of mNGS was significantly shorter than that of bacterial culture (p < 0.001, 1.65 versus 3.07 days). The sensitivity and accuracy of mNGS were significantly higher than that of the culture group (p < 0.001, 82.3% versus 17.5%; 75% versus 27.6%), whereas the specificity of mNGS (42.9%) was lower than that of the culture group (p > 0.05, 42.9% versus 76.9%). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive value (PPV) of pus were higher than those of tissue samples for mNGS, whereas for culture, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and PPV of tissue samples were higher than those of pus. tNGS demonstrated higher sensitivity and accuracy in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) than mNGS (80% versus 50%; 87.5% versus 68.8%).ConclusionmNGS for spinal infection demonstrated better diagnostic value in developing an antibiotic regimen earlier, and it is recommended to prioritize pus samples for testing through mNGS. Moreover, tNGS outperformed other methods for diagnosing spinal TB and identifying antibiotic-resistance genes in drug-resistant TB.
