## Burkholderia cepacia in cystic fibrosis children and adolescents: overall survival and immune alterations

date: 2024-07-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundIn current literature there are only scarce data on the host inflammatory response during Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) persistence. The primary objective of the present research was to carry out cross-sectional analyses of biomarkers and evaluate disease progression in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with chronic Bcc infection and pathogen-free ones. The secondary aim was to assess prospectively overall survival of the study participants during up to 8 years of follow-up.MethodsThe study included 116 paediatric patients with CF; 47 CF patients were chronically infected with Bcc, and 69 individuals were Bcc free. Plasma and sputum biomarkers (neutrophil elastase, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-12, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, IL-22, IL-23, IL-17, IFN-γ, TGFβ1, TNF-α) were analysed using commercially available kits. Besides, inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on proliferative response of PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes had been assessed.ResultsBcc infected patients did not differ from Bcc free ones in demographic and clinical parameters, but demonstrated an increased rate of glucose metabolism disturbances and survival disadvantage during prolong follow-up period. Biomarkers analyses revealed elevated TNF-α and reduced IL-17F levels in sputum samples of Bcc infected patients. These patients also demonstrated improvement of peripheral blood lymphocyte sensitivity to steroid treatment and reduction in plasma pro-inflammatory (IL-17F and IL-18) and anti-inflammatory (TGFβ1 and IL-10) cytokine concentrations.ConclusionsReduction in IL-17F levels may have several important consequences including increase in steroid sensitivity and glycemic control disturbances. Further investigations are needed to clarify the role of IL-17 cytokines in CF complication development. Low plasma TGFβ1 and IL-10 levels in Bcc infected group may be a sign of subverted activity of regulatory T cells. Such immune alterations may be one of the factors contributing to the development of the cepacia syndrome.

## Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing for rapid molecular identification in spinal infection diagnosis

date: 2024-07-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of metagenomic next−generation sequencing (mNGS) for detecting pathogens in spinal infections and to identify the differences in the diagnostic performance between mNGS and targeted next−generation sequencing (tNGS).MethodsA total of 76 consecutive patients with suspected spinal infections who underwent mNGS, culture, and histopathological examinations were retrospectively studied. The final diagnosis of the patient was determined by combining the clinical treatment results, pathological examinations, imaging changes and laboratory indicators. The sensitivity and specificity of mNGS and culture were determined.ResultsThe difference between the two detection rates was statistically significant (p < 0.001), with mNGS exhibiting a significantly higher detection rate (77.6% versus 18.4%). The average diagnosis time of mNGS was significantly shorter than that of bacterial culture (p < 0.001, 1.65 versus 3.07 days). The sensitivity and accuracy of mNGS were significantly higher than that of the culture group (p < 0.001, 82.3% versus 17.5%; 75% versus 27.6%), whereas the specificity of mNGS (42.9%) was lower than that of the culture group (p > 0.05, 42.9% versus 76.9%). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive predictive value (PPV) of pus were higher than those of tissue samples for mNGS, whereas for culture, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and PPV of tissue samples were higher than those of pus. tNGS demonstrated higher sensitivity and accuracy in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) than mNGS (80% versus 50%; 87.5% versus 68.8%).ConclusionmNGS for spinal infection demonstrated better diagnostic value in developing an antibiotic regimen earlier, and it is recommended to prioritize pus samples for testing through mNGS. Moreover, tNGS outperformed other methods for diagnosing spinal TB and identifying antibiotic-resistance genes in drug-resistant TB.
