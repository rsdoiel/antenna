<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/26/154836.html">Join a Parade
Today</a>. When people talk about What You Can Do on podcasts or on TV,
they say lame things that don’t work that well. One thing for sure is
that when Bernie and Alexandria do a rally in your area, you can go and
enjoy the energy. This is a good thing because it gives the TV cameras
something to focus on. But here’s what I think the best thing to do is.
Don’t start something, join something. Because two is way more powerful
than one, and three is way more powerful than two. When people work
together on something good, more people doing it is usually even
better.</p>

<h2 id="cve-program-almost-unfunded">CVE Program Almost Unfunded</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-16, updated: 2025-04-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Mitre’s CVE’s program—which provides common naming and other
informational resources about cybersecurity vulnerabilities—was about to
<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3963190/cve-program-faces-swift-end-after-dhs-fails-to-renew-contract-leaving-security-flaw-tracking-in-limbo.html">be
cancelled</a>, as the US Department of Homeland Security failed to renew
the contact. It was funded for eleven more months at the last minute.
</p>
<p>
This is a big deal. The CVE program is one of those pieces of common
infrastructure that everyone benefits from. Losing it will bring us back
to a world where there’s no single way to talk about vulnerabilities.
It’s kind of crazy to think that the US government might damage its own
security in this way—but I suppose no crazier than any of the other ways
the US is working against its own interests right now…

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">It’s
easier than ever to de-censor videos</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Last month I asked people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/gaV-O6NPWrI?t=297&quot;&gt;hack part of my YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, specifically to de-pixelate the contents of a folder I had pixelated starting at the 4:57 mark.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p>
<p>
For years, people have used the censor tool to blur or pixelate out
parts of videos where there’s sensitive information. And for years,
every time I’ve used it, I get a few comments from people saying that’s
not a safe way to censor information.
</p>
<p>
So is that true?
</p>
<p>
I wanted to find out, so I put a message saying I’d send fifty bucks to
anyone who could tell me what it said under the pixelation. And you know
what? Less than a day later, <em>three</em> people solved it, using
three slightly different techniques—scary!

seems like a good time to talk about fascism. In this post, I use
linguistic data to probe the deep origins of fascist thought. And I gaze
at the rising tide of fascist sentiment in anglophone writing.

Last Tuesday Cliff Lynch delivered an abbreviated version of his
traditional closing summary and <i>bon voyage</i> to CNI’s
<a href="https://www.cni.org/events/membership-meetings/past-meetings/spring-2025">2025
Spring Membership Meeting</a> via Zoom from his sick-bed. Last Thursday
night he died, still serving as Executive Director. CNI has posted
<a href="https://www.cni.org/news/in-memoriam-clifford-lynch"><i>In
Memoriam: Clifford Lynch</i></a>.<br /> <br /> Cliff impacted a wide
range of areas. The best overview is
<a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2013/05/digital-preservation-pioneer-clifford-lynch/">Mike
Ashenfelder’s 2013 profile of Cliff Lynch</a> in the Library of
Congress’ <i>Digital Preservation Pioneer</i> series, which
starts:<br />
<blockquote>
Clifford Lynch is widely regarded as an oracle in the culture of
networked information. Lynch monitors the global information ecosystem
for cultural trends and technological developments. He ponders their
variables, interdependencies and influencing factors. He confers with
colleagues and draws conclusions. Then he reports his observations
through lectures, conference presentations and writings. People who know
about Lynch pay close attention to what he has to say.<br /> <br />
Lynch is a soft-spoken man whose work, for more than thirty years, has
had an impact — directly or indirectly — on the computer, information
and library science communities.
</blockquote>
Below the fold are some additional personal notes on Cliff’s
contributions.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Ashenfelder
notes Cliff’s focus on collaboration:<br />
<blockquote>
Lynch is also a catalyst for action. He helps steer the conversation
toward real results, such as standards creation, funding, tool
development, metadata creation and interoperability. Ultimately, Lynch
seems most fervent about collaboration as a crucial force.<br /> <br />
“I would be reluctant to attribute much of anything just to my actions,”
he said. “Most important successes come through the work of a lot of
different people, collaborating and pulling it together. Maybe I can
think of a place or two where there was a meeting that I spoke at or
convened or I wrote or did something that just happened to fall at a
pivotal moment. But any of that to me feels a bit accidental, at best
just good luck, being in the right place at the right time.”
</blockquote>
Michael Nelson and Herbert Van de Sompel’s
<a href="https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2025/04/cliff-lynch-invisible-influencer-in.html"><i>Cliff
Lynch: The Invisible Influencer in Information Infrastructure</i></a>
provides an in-depth account of one occasion when Cliff was “in the
right place at the right time” to spark a collaboration. The occasion
was an October 1999 meeting in Santa Fe:<br />
<blockquote>
In order to further optimize the chances of success for the meeting, the
collaboration of Cliff Lynch and Don Waters as moderators had been
secured and turned out to be fundamentally important. In the
Acknowledgments section of his
<a href="https://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-522209">PhD thesis</a>, Herbert
put Cliff’s impact on the direction of the meeting and on his own
thinking as follows:<br />
<blockquote>
When starting to work on this thesis, I went back reading several of his
early papers and could not feel other than intimidated by the far
forward-looking vision expressed therein. At several occasions, I heard
Cliff address large audiences, discussing complicated digital library
matters with an amazing clarity. Cliff’s work has always been a great
inspiration to me. I met Cliff for the first time in person at the Open
Archives meeting in Santa Fe, for which he had enthusiastically accepted
my invitation to serve as a moderator. His involvement was crucial to
the successful conclusion of the meeting.
</blockquote>
…<br /> Prior to the start of the second day, he vented his frustration
about the lack of progress to Cliff, who was about to start moderating
the first session. Cliff was nice enough to let him ramble on a bit,
and, in a manner that exemplified one of Cliff’s many unparalleled
capabilities, he went on to open the meeting by providing two discussion
topics regarding interoperability that he somehow had been able to
synthesize from the first day’s discussions, which most had experienced
as enjoyable yet lacking in any sense of concrete direction. One was
whether archive functions, such as data collection and maintenance,
should be decoupled from user functions, such as search. The other was
about the choice between distributed searching across repositories and
harvesting from them to build cross-repository search engines.
</blockquote>
The meeting solidified the long and productive collaboration between Van
de Sompel and Nelson.<br /> <br /> But easily the best way to understand
how Cliff worked is the
<a href="http://www.educopia.org/sites/educopia.org/files/ANADP_Educopia_2012.pdf"><i>Report
of ANADP I</i></a> from 13 years ago. Cliff’s “Closing Thoughts” are
transcribed verbatim starting on page 309, and they are a wonderful
example of his ability to summarize a meeting and set the agenda for
future work with an extemporaneous address. You have to read all twelve
pages — it is hard to summarize Cliff’s summary, but here are a couple
of gems:<br />
<blockquote>
With a portfolio of aligned strategies, we can collectively speak more
effectively about the importance of the work we do, and certainly that
has come up in a background way again and again as we’ve spoken about
economics, education, about legal issues and barriers. I think that this
question of really clarifying the fundamental importance of digital
preservation to maintaining the cultural and intellectual record, the
memory of our nations and of the world, has got to be a central
objective. We have a great challenge in educating both the broad public
in our nations and the governments that represent these publics; to the
extent that we can align strategies we can make that case better.
</blockquote>
And:
<blockquote>
There are two words that I didn’t hear in the technical discussions. I
get very scared whenever I hear a lengthy discussion of technical issues
in digital preservation that doesn’t mention these two words. The first
is <i>Monoculture</i>. There is a possibility, a danger, of doing too
much alignment here. The reason for that is the second word that I
didn’t hear, which is <i>Hubris</i>. We need to acknowledge that we
don’t really know how to do long-term digital preservation. We’re going
to have a lot more confidence that we know what we’re doing here about a
hundred years from now as we look at what efforts actually brought data
successfully a hundred years into the future. But in the relatively
early stages of technologies like these, it’s much easier to identify
failures than long-term successes.
</blockquote>
From <a href="https://www.cni.org/news/in-memoriam-clifford-lynch">CNI’s
<i>In Memoriam</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Active on many advisory boards and visiting committees throughout his
career, including serving as co-chair of the National Academies Board on
Research Data and Information (BRDI) from 2011-16, Lynch’s contributions
were recognized with numerous awards, including the American Library
Association’s Joseph W. Lippincott Award, the American Society for
Information Science and Technology’s Award of Merit, and the EDUCAUSE
Leadership Award in Public Policy and Practice. He was a past president
of the American Society for Information Science, and a fellow of the
Association for Computing Machinery, the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, and the National Information Standards
Organization.

Cliff made a very valuable contribution to my career by inviting me to
debug important talks before I gave them “for real” by giving early
versions to the the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250315013526/https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/events/ias">Information
Access Seminar</a> at U.C. Berkeley’s
<a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/">School of Information</a>.
Fortified by tea and cookies, I could talk and then be subject to
detailed and insightful questioning by Cliff and the participants. I
always meant to take notes during the questioning but I was so into it I
never did. I had to re-construct the necessary changes to the talk from
memory.<br /> <br />

it’s not natural language search, all that tells me is you haven’t

long time ago, based on my experience at Berkman in the 00s, I proposed
the idea of a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/10/30/developingBetterDevelopers.html">Developing

teaching hospital atmosphere around creating new communication systems
out the web and (key point) not compromising the openness of the web. It
would be as sacred as academic freedom is in the university, or the
First Amendment of the Constitution. It seemed to me that a university
is the perfect place to create something like this. If we had such a
setup, anywhere, at this time – we would be working in earnest on an
open alternative to twitter, one that is truly billionaire-proof right
now, as opposed to “would be nice to have sometime in the future.”</p>

<h2 id="what-is-inbound-rss">What is Inbound RSS?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wrote a complex piece here earlier, but it’s much simpler than it made
it sound, so I decided to start again.
</p>
<p>
Feed readers view RSS as inbound, and blogging tools regard it as
outbound. Same feed, different contexts. Like trains going in and out of
a station. Inbound and outbound.
</p>
<p>
But some software views RSS in both directions. The best example is
Twitter and its successors such as Mastodon, Threads and Bluesky. These
products are for both for reading and writing. It makes sense to have
outbound feeds, like a blogging tool, and it makes just as much sense as
a consumer of feeds, like a feed reader, so we can easily publish stuff
from other environments and people can subscribe to them exactly as if
they used their editor to write it. No reason anyone needs to know.
<i>This is absolutely the simplest and most web-like way to do
federation. </i>And you don’t need any new formats or protocols. It’s
all <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> on both
sides. We totally know how to do RSS. It’s ready to go.
</p>
<p>
What got me thinking about this a few years ago was Substack. I wanted
to publish a nightly email newsletter from what I had posted that day on
my blog, but I didn’t have the patience to copy and paste and then
reformat the text, by hand, when I already have that automated. They
wanted to turn me into a computer. I tried that with Medium for a couple
of years and it was awful. No thanks. What I needed them to have support
Inbound RSS.
</p>
<p>
That’s it. You now know all there is to know about

keep <a href="https://this.how/bluesky/">beating the drum</a> about
Bluesky. Their story says they know they need to be replaceable. But
until they deliver on replaceability, it’s a 5-alarm fire because of
what happened with Twitter. It should not have been possible to acquire
Twitter’s user base. In hindsight we know it could have been avoided.
And it can be avoided by Bluesky, but my guess is the last thing they
want is to be replaced. If they really meant it, we could make it happen
in a few weeks, and then we could build some really incredible systems,
starting in late May, early June. I really believe that. Next journalist
that interviews them should ask about this. Thanks for listening.</p>

<h2 id="aufsteigende-rüstungsklasse">2025-04-04 Aufsteigende
Rüstungsklasse</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-13, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-04-04-aufsteigende-rüstungsklasse">
2025-04-04 Aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse
</h1>
<p>
Ich hatte schon vor einiger Zeit angefangen, über einen Wechsel zur
aufsteigenden Rüstungsklasse nachzudenken. Neue Spieler fanden die
traditionelle, absteigende Rüstungsklasse meistens doof. Die Leute, mit
denen ich schon spielte, hatten sich an die absteigende Rüstungsklasse
gewöhnt und wollten nicht umsteigen. Was tun? Mir gefällt die
Absteigende Rüstungsklasse und die kleine Tabelle, wo man sich
aufschreibt, welche Rüstungsklasse welchen Wurf benötigt, oder die
seltsame Notation aus AD&amp;D Zeiten mit dem ETW0 (Engl. THAC0).
</p>
<p>
Irgendwann hatte ich mich halb durchgerungen, einen Versuch zu starten.
Positiv aufgefallen ist sofort, dass die Tabellen im Handbuch für die
Spielenden kompakter werden. Auf den Charakterbögen hat es nun auch
etwas mehr Platz. Beides finde ich sehr positiv.
</p>
<p>
Eher unangenehm war, dass in allen anderen Dokumenten immer noch
absteigende Rüstungsklassen zu finden war. Oje! Mit dem aktuellen Update
hoffe ich, sie alle gefunden zu haben. Und wer ansonsten eine
Rüstungsklasse unter 10 findet, konvertiert wie folgt:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Für Menschen ohne Rüstung wird RK 9 zu RK 10.
</li>
<li>
Für alle anderen ist die aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse = 20 minus die
absteigende Rüstungsklasse.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Beispielsweise: Ork mit RK 6 wird zu Ork mit RK 14.
</p>
<p>
Warum nicht “19 minus die absteigende Rüstungsklasse”? Nun ist alles um
eins besser geschützt, würde man meinen. Der Vorteil ist aber, dass es
nun zu neueren D&amp;D Versionen passt. Wenn ich beispielsweise bei
D&amp;D 3.5 reinschaue:
</p>
<p>
Krieger mit Stufe 1 hat einen Angriffsbonus von +1 (gleich wie die
Stufe, was mir sehr gefällt). Die Rüstungen sind: beschlagene
Lederrüstung 13 (20-7); Kettenpanzer 15 (20-5); Plattenpanzer 17 (20-3).
Aus dem Rahmen fällt “ohne Rüstung”, denn 10 ist nicht 20-9. Tja… Dafür
habe ich keine Lösung. RK 11 für Leute ohne Rüstung gefällt mir auch
nicht.
</p>
<p>
Und was ist mit den Trefferchancen? Vorher benötigte ein Krieger Stufe 1
eine 13 um einen Ork mit RK 6 zu treffen. Jetzt hat der Krieger einen
Bonus von +1 um eine Ork mit RK 14 (20-6) zu treffen und braucht also
immer noch eine 13. Insofern ist also alles gleich geblieben.

I used to treat email as a communication tool for the various
communities I belonged to. But many of those communications take place
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Email still plays plenty of roles, but heavy social and interaction ones
is not the bulk of it. It seems dominated by todo-like tasks.

It doesn’t seem like we have upgraded our clients to this new reality.
