<p><strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Dave">@Dave</span> Winer’s
Scripting News</strong> (date: 2025-04-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting
News)</p>
<p>A long time ago, based on my experience at Berkman in the 00s, I
proposed the idea of a
<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/10/30/developingBetterDevelopers.html">Developing
Better Developers</a> function at a university, as a pilot, to create a
teaching hospital atmosphere around creating new communication systems
out the web and (key point) not compromising the openness of the web. It
would be as sacred as academic freedom is in the university, or the
First Amendment of the Constitution. It seemed to me that a university
is the perfect place to create something like this. If we had such a
setup, anywhere, at this time – we would be working in earnest on an
open alternative to twitter, one that is truly billionaire-proof right
now, as opposed to “would be nice to have sometime in the future.”</p>

<h2 id="what-is-inbound-rss">What is Inbound RSS?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wrote a complex piece here earlier, but it’s much simpler than it made
it sound, so I decided to start again.
</p>
<p>
Feed readers view RSS as inbound, and blogging tools regard it as
outbound. Same feed, different contexts. Like trains going in and out of
a station. Inbound and outbound.
</p>
<p>
But some software views RSS in both directions. The best example is
Twitter and its successors such as Mastodon, Threads and Bluesky. These
products are for both for reading and writing. It makes sense to have
outbound feeds, like a blogging tool, and it makes just as much sense as
a consumer of feeds, like a feed reader, so we can easily publish stuff
from other environments and people can subscribe to them exactly as if
they used their editor to write it. No reason anyone needs to know. This
is absolutely the simplest and most web-like way to do federation. And
you don’t need any new formats or protocols. It’s all RSS on both sides.
We totally know how to do RSS. It’s ready to go.
</p>
<p>
What got me thinking about this a few years ago was Substack. I wanted
to publish a nightly email newsletter from what I had posted that day on
my blog, but I didn’t have the patience to copy and paste and then
reformat the text, by hand, when I already have it automated. They
wanted to turn me into a computer. I tried that with Medium for a couple
of years and it was awful. No thanks. What I needed them to have is
inbound RSS.
</p>
<p>
That’s it. You now know all there is to know about

RSS</a>. 😀

<p>
Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret December meeting that Beijing
was behind a widespread series of alarming cyberattacks on U.S.
infrastructure, according to people familiar with the matter,
underscoring how hostilities between the two superpowers are continuing
to escalate.
</p>
<p>
The Chinese delegation linked years of intrusions into computer networks
at U.S. ports, water utilities, airports and other targets, to
increasing U.S. policy support for Taiwan, the people, who declined to
be named, said.

keep <a href="https://this.how/bluesky/">beating the drum</a> about
Bluesky. Their story says they know they need to be replaceable. But
until they deliver on replaceability, it’s a 5-alarm fire because of
what happened with Twitter. It should not have been possible to acquire
Twitter’s user base. In hindsight we know it could have been avoided.
And it can be avoided by Bluesky, but my guess is the last thing they
want is to be replaced. If they really meant it, we could make it happen
in a few weeks, and then we could build some really incredible systems,
starting in late May, early June. I really believe that. Next journalist
that interviews them should ask about this. Thanks for listening.</p>

<h2 id="aufsteigende-rüstungsklasse">2025-04-04 Aufsteigende
Rüstungsklasse</h2>

<h1 id="2025-04-04-aufsteigende-rüstungsklasse">
2025-04-04 Aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse
</h1>
<p>
Ich hatte schon vor einiger Zeit angefangen, über einen Wechsel zur
aufsteigenden Rüstungsklasse nachzudenken. Neue Spieler fanden die
traditionelle, absteigende Rüstungsklasse meistens doof. Die Leute, mit
denen ich schon spielte, hatten sich an die absteigende Rüstungsklasse
gewöhnt und wollten nicht umsteigen. Was tun? Mir gefällt die
Absteigende Rüstungsklasse und die kleine Tabelle, wo man sich
aufschreibt, welche Rüstungsklasse welchen Wurf benötigt, oder die
seltsame Notation aus AD&amp;D Zeiten mit dem ETW0 (Engl. THAC0).
</p>
<p>
Irgendwann hatte ich mich halb durchgerungen, einen Versuch zu starten.
Positiv aufgefallen ist sofort, dass die Tabellen im Handbuch für die
Spielenden kompakter werden. Auf den Charakterbögen hat es nun auch
etwas mehr Platz. Beides finde ich sehr positiv.
</p>
<p>
Eher unangenehm war, dass in allen anderen Dokumenten immer noch
absteigende Rüstungsklassen zu finden war. Oje! Mit dem aktuellen Update
hoffe ich, sie alle gefunden zu haben. Und wer ansonsten eine
Rüstungsklasse unter 10 findet, konvertiert wie folgt:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Für Menschen ohne Rüstung wird RK 9 zu RK 10.
</li>
<li>
Für alle anderen ist die aufsteigende Rüstungsklasse = 20 minus die
absteigende Rüstungsklasse.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Beispielsweise: Ork mit RK 6 wird zu Ork mit RK 14.
</p>
<p>
Warum nicht “19 minus die absteigende Rüstungsklasse”? Nun ist alles um
eins besser geschützt, würde man meinen. Der Vorteil ist aber, dass es
nun zu neueren D&amp;D Versionen passt. Wenn ich beispielsweise bei
D&amp;D 3.5 reinschaue:
</p>
<p>
Krieger mit Stufe 1 hat einen Angriffsbonus von +1 (gleich wie die
Stufe, was mir sehr gefällt). Die Rüstungen sind: beschlagene
Lederrüstung 13 (20-7); Kettenpanzer 15 (20-5); Plattenpanzer 17 (20-3).
Aus dem Rahmen fällt “ohne Rüstung”, denn 10 ist nicht 20-9. Tja… Dafür
habe ich keine Lösung. RK 11 für Leute ohne Rüstung gefällt mir auch
nicht.
</p>
<p>
Und was ist mit den Trefferchancen? Vorher benötigte ein Krieger Stufe 1
eine 13 um einen Ork mit RK 6 zu treffen. Jetzt hat der Krieger einen
Bonus von +1 um eine Ork mit RK 14 (20-6) zu treffen und braucht also
immer noch eine 13. Insofern ist also alles gleich geblieben.

<p>It was just 20 days ago—on March 24—that editor in chief of The
Atlantic Jeffrey Goldberg reported that the most senior members of the
Trump administration discussed a military strike on the Houthis in Yemen
on an unsecure commercial messaging app and that they included him on
the chat.</p>

I used to treat email as a communication tool for the various
communities I belonged to. But many of those communications take place
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Email still plays plenty of roles, but heavy social and interaction ones
is not the bulk of it. It seems dominated by todo-like tasks.
</p>
<p>
It doesn’t seem like we have upgraded our clients to this new reality.
