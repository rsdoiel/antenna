<p>
The Tesla Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) lawsuit floodgates are
open. We are now starting to see trials and settlements arising from
crashes that occurred in 2018-2019 as they work through the legal
process.
</p>
<p>
Crashes involving Tesla’s ADAS systems have increased significantly
since then, and we expect legal actions to escalate following the
groundbreaking defeat of Tesla’s primary defense in a trial in Florida.
</p>
<p>
The lawyer who beat Tesla in this case is already going for a Round 2.

they’re actually kinda compact-sized, at least for full-suspension

rides.

BRIGHT</a>, a statewide initiative to deliver affordable solar, kicked
off its “No-Cost Solar Plan” in Atlanta yesterday, giving qualified
homeowners a shot at roughly 400 fully prepaid rooftop-solar systems
with zero upfront or maintenance costs. However, Georgia Bright’s
No-Cost Solar Plan may lose its $156 million in grant money if the EPA
steals back the Solar for All program’s entire $7 billion, which funded
it.

Last week, the US Environmental Protection Agency proposed a plan to
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/07/29/epas-chief-saboteur-lee-zeldin-announces-plan-to-delete-climate-science/">delete
its scientific finding</a> recognizing that greenhouse gases are harmful
to human health, with the goal of making cars less efficient and more
costly to fuel. That plan is now up for public comment.

<p>
A couple years ago, my wife started a new job as an elementary school
principal. It was an exciting milestone, but it also came with a
stressful commute. The school isn’t far – just a few kilometers across
the city – but during rush hour, taking the bus often meant sitting in
gridlock for 45 minutes. Not exactly the best way to start or end a
workday.
</p>
<p>
So we got her an electric bike.
