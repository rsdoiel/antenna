Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0746 AM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...AND OVER PORTIONS OF NORTH DAKOTA INTO
NORTHERN MINNESOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms may pose some risk for
severe winds and hail across parts of the southern Plains, and
separately from North Dakota into northern Minnesota, mainly this
afternoon and evening.

...Southern Plains...
Convection has generally weakened this morning across eastern KS,
with a outflow reinforced front advancing southward across the
southern High Plains. This boundary is forecast to stall through the
morning and early afternoon, and it will likely serve as a focus for
renewed thunderstorm development later today. The southern extent of
upper troughing that exists over much of the Plains is forecast to
advance eastward across the southern High Plains this afternoon.
Initial development over the higher terrain of north-central into
northeast NM should occur in a modest low-level upslope flow regime,
with steep lapse rates aloft contributing to moderate instability.
Weak low-level winds will gradually veer to west-northwesterly and
modestly strengthen with height through mid/upper levels, supporting
modest deep-layer shear and some updraft organization.

Isolated severe hail may occur with initially more cellular
development across the southern High Plains, before some clustering
potentially occurs late this afternoon/evening farther east into the
TX Panhandle and northwest TX with more of a wind threat. While
deep-layer shear will likely remain weak farther east across OK, the
front/outflow boundary should aid in at least scattered
thunderstorms developing with moderate to locally strong instability
amid ample daytime heating. Isolated damaging winds via strong
downbursts and marginally severe hail appear possible with the
stronger cores given seasonably cool temperatures aloft (around -10C
at 500 mb with the 12Z OUN observed sounding), and the Marginal Risk
has been expanded eastward for this possibility.

...North Dakota into Northern Minnesota...
Within upper troughing already established over the northern/central
Plains and central Canada, a mid-level shortwave trough and related
surface cold front are forecast to move east-southeastward over ND
and northern MN through the period. Modest low-level moisture
characterized by mid 50s to perhaps low 60s surface dewpoints should
be present ahead of the front across these areas. Diurnal heating
and modestly steepened lapse rates aloft should aid in the
development of weak instability this afternoon. Thunderstorms should
gradually increase in coverage along/ahead of the front this
afternoon/evening as they spread eastward over parts of ND into
northern MN. The stronger cells may produce marginally severe hail,
with sufficient deep-layer shear present for some convective
organization. With time, some clustering/upscale growth along the
front appears probable, with isolated strong to severe gusts
possible. The lack of stronger instability should tend to temper the
overall severe threat.

...Missouri/Iowa...
An MCV generated by overnight/early morning convection across the
southern/central Plains should develop northeastward into parts of
northern MO and IA by this afternoon. It remains unclear whether
sufficient instability to support robust thunderstorms will be able
to develop today ahead of this feature given ongoing convection and
cloud debris. Regardless, some enhancement to the low/mid-level flow
and related deep-layer shear could support updraft organization if
surface-based thunderstorms can develop. Given the continued
uncertainty regarding this potential, have held off on inclusion of
low severe probabilities across this region with this update.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0352 AM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Valid 141200Z - 191200Z

...DISCUSSION...
On Thursday/D4, a shortwave trough is forecast to move from MT into
the northern Plains, with primary upper low well to the north. A
surface trough and cold front should push eastward across the
Dakotas as well, and extend roughly from MN into NE by Friday/D5
morning. Model spread is high regarding the amount of moisture
return and instability, with some models likely over-estimating real
instability. In any case, storms appear most likely from ND into
northern MN, beneath 50+ kt midlevel westerlies. As such, a 15%
severe area has been introduced.

This wave will progress east/northeastward on Friday/D5, with a
front trailing southwestward perhaps from Lake Superior across WI/MN
and toward NE. A moist and unstable air mass will remain near and
south of any such boundary, but the position of said boundary may
depend on storms from the previous night, or possibly a continuation
of such storms. Predictability is therefore low on Friday/D5.

Beyond this time frame, it appears the storm track will shift
northward into Canada, with upper ridging over much of the CONUS.

## Hurricane Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 29

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  29
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 10 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Henriette had degraded earlier this 
evening, perhaps due to what appeared to be an eye wall replacement 
cycle, while the cyclone was also passing over a tongue of slightly 
cooler sea surface temperatures around 25.5C.  Recent satellite 
images however depict the eye becoming better defined and surrounded 
by cooling cloud tops.  The most recent subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimates were 4.0/65 kt from PHFO and SAB, and 4.5/77 kt 
from JTWC.  Meanwhile, the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have 
ranged between 65 and 76 kt during the past several hours.  Taking a 
blend of these estimates, the initial intensity has been held at 70 
kt for this advisory.
 
Henriette is moving toward the northwest, or 315 degrees, at 15 kt. 
This general motion is expected to continue during the next couple 
of days as the cyclone is steered between a mid-level low to the 
northwest of Hawaii and a building mid-level ridge far to the north 
of the cyclone.  A turn toward the north and a decrease in forward 
speed is expected beyond 60 hours as the increasingly shallow system 
is steered by a low to mid-level ridge to the east.  The official 
track forecast is near the middle of the guidance envelope and is 
very close to the previous advisory.
 
Henriette will remain over sufficiently warm water for some 
intensification during the next day or so, however, vertical wind 
shear is forecast to increase considerably by about 36 hours.  As a 
result, the official forecast calls for some strengthening during 
the next 24 hours, followed by slight weakening between 24 and 36 
hours, and more rapid weakening thereafter.  Henriette is expected 
to weaken into a post-tropical low by 72 hours, with dissipation 
expected by 120 hours.  The intensity forecast is mostly unchanged 
and is slightly higher than the intensity guidance in the near term, 
then close to the middle of the intensity guidance envelope beyond 
36 hours.

## Tropical Depression Ivo Forecast Discussion Number 19

Tropical Depression Ivo Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM PDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Ivo has become devoid of deep convection as it moves over 
increasingly cooler waters and into a drier air mass.  The current 
intensity estimate is 30 kt which could be a bit generous based on 
partial scatterometer overpasses.

The motion continues west-northwestward, or around 295/9 kt.  Ivo 
should remain embedded in low-level easterly flow for the next day 
or two.  The track forecast is similar to that from the previous 
advisory and very close to the latest corrected consensus, HCCA, 
solution.

Since the system is expected to traverse even cooler waters during 
the next 36 hours or so, it is unlikely to regenerate significant 
deep convection.  Thus the cyclone will likely become a 
post-tropical remnant low very soon.  The global models depict 
the system opening up into a trough within 48 hours and this is 
reflected in the official forecast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CDT Mon Aug 11 2025

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
Isolated dry thunderstorms will remain the primary fire weather
concern for Tuesday across the country. Latest forecast guidance
hints that a deeply-mixed, but adequately buoyant, environment will
remain in place across central AZ on the northern fringe of deeper
monsoonal moisture. Forcing for ascent will be fairly weak and
largely driven by orographic ascent along the Mogollon Rim. However,
several deterministic CAM and recent HREF guidance hints at the
potential for at least a few thunderstorms. This thermodynamic
environment has yielded a mixture of wet and dry thunderstorms over
the past 24 hours, so a similar combination appears probable for
Tuesday. Fine fuels largely remain dry across the region, and recent
lightning-caused fires hint that the fuel environment should support
at least some fire starts. 

...Pacific Northwest...
A weak mid-level trough is forecast to move across the Pacific
Northwest on Tuesday. While flow aloft will be fairly modest, the
zonal flow over the Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada will likely
induce a downslope flow regime within an antecedent dry environment
with receptive fuels. Ensemble support was too limited to warrant
additional highlights, but localized elevated fire weather
conditions appear possible across far northwest NV, eastern OR, and
southern WA Tuesday afternoon.

## Hurricane Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 27

Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  27
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sun Aug 10 2025

Henriette has put on quite the show today with a well-defined eye 
emerging during the past few hours along with cooling temperatures 
in the eyewall.  Dvorak intensity estimates were up to 65 kt by 
18Z, and with the further development on satellite since that time, 
the initial wind speed is set to 70 kt for this advisory. 

It remains to be seen how strong Henriette will get with an 
improving environment along its path during the next day or so, 
including decreasing shear, increasing SSTs and cooling upper-level 
temperatures.  Given that this rapid intensification period was not 
well forecast, and a recent closed 37 GHz ring on AMSR2 data, I'm 
inclined to go above the guidance in this situation and show near 
rapid intensification for about 24 h until the environment becomes 
more hostile.  Henriette should lose all deep convection in about 3 
days over cold waters and in very high shear.
 
The storm is moving northwestward at about 15 kt.  A large ridge
over the north-central Pacific should cause a continued fast
northwestward track of Henriette for several days until its slows 
down a bit near dissipation.  The only minor change to the previous 
forecast is a faster forward speed, probably a function of the 
hurricane feeling stronger upper-level southeasterly flow during 
the next couple of days.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 PM PDT Sun Aug 10 2025
 
Even over waters of 23-24 degrees Celsius, Ivo is managing to 
maintain a persistent area of deep convection.  A recent ASCAT pass 
showed maximum winds of 30 kt.  Accounting for the instrument's 
sampling limitations, and combined with satellite estimates still 
running around 35 kt, it is estimated that Ivo is hanging on to 
tropical storm status.  Sea surface temperatures drop by another 2-3 
degrees along Ivo's forecast track, so weakening is expected to 
resume tonight, and simulated satellite images from the GFS and 
ECMWF show that deep convection could finally be gone by Monday 
morning.  Degeneration into a remnant low is forecast by 24 hours, 
followed by dissipation into a trough in 60 hours.
 
Ivo is moving west-northwestward (285 deg) at 10 kt.  This motion 
should continue for the next 12 hours, followed by a slight bend to 
the west in 24 hours as Ivo stays situated to the south of the low- 
to mid-level ridge.  The track models are tightly clustered, and 
the new NHC forecast is mainly an update of the previous 
prediction.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025

Valid 102000Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
central/southern Plains through tonight, with large hail and
damaging winds the main threats.

...20z Update Front Range...
Initial thunderstorms should continue to develop over the higher
terrain of eastern CO and the Front Range as a broad upper trough
shifts eastward and low-level upslope flow continues this afternoon.
1500 J/kg of MLCAPE and westerly flow aloft around 35-45 kt will
support supercells. Steep mid-level lapse rates and cooler mid-level
temperatures will favor an initial risk for hail before upscale
growth results in an MCS tonight. Damaging gusts are possible into
parts of the southern Plains. Have expanded the Slight Risk farther
north/east where development is possible closer to the WY/CO border.


...Mid Mississippi Valley...
Diurnal heating ahead of the weak cold front over the Midwest will
continue to support moderate destabilization this afternoon. Ongoing
thunderstorm clusters should gradually expand eastward as cold pools
deepen. While vertical shear will not be strong, (generally less
than 20 kt) an occasional damaging gust remains possible over parts
of IL, MO and WI. Have expanded the Marginal risk eastward to cover
the low-end risk. Otherwise, see the prior outlook for additional
info.

..Lyons.. 08/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1121 AM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025/

...CO/KS...
Morning water vapor loop shows a vigorous shortwave trough digging
southeastward into central CO.  Large scale forcing for ascent ahead
of this trough will aid in the development of scattered
thunderstorms along the foothills of central CO by early afternoon,
with storms spreading eastward through the afternoon/evening.  Ample
low-level moisture and CAPE are present over eastern CO/western KS
to promote a few intense cells, with favorable westerly flow aloft
for supercell structures. Large hail is the main concern, with an
increasing risk of damaging winds with eastward extent this evening.
 A tornado or two is possible as storms interact with a remnant
outflow boundary that extends across the TX Panhandle and northwest
OK.

...MO/IL/WI...
A corridor of strong heating will encourage scattered thunderstorm
development this afternoon from southern MO into central/northeast
IL.  Weak winds aloft and considerable mid-level moisture will limit
overall downdraft potential.  Nevertheless, gusty/damaging winds
could occur with the strongest cells.

...Southeast AZ...
Similar to yesterday, scattered high-based afternoon/evening
thunderstorm development is expected over southeast AZ in a
hot/unstable environment.  The strongest cells may produce locally
damaging wind gusts.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong thunderstorms may impact parts of the upper Great
Lakes region Tuesday.  While the risk for severe weather still
appears low, locally strong gusts and hail might still be possible.

...Discussion...
An initially prominent mid-level high centered offshore of the
Pacific Northwest is forecast to become suppressed
west-southwestward across the northern mid-latitude eastern Pacific
during this period, as a consolidating short wave trough digs near
the Canadian Rockies.  As downstream flow trends more zonal, it
appears that a pair of short wave perturbations will consolidate
into a larger-scale short wave trough across northern Ontario into
Quebec by late Tuesday night.  This evolution may include a lead
perturbation continuing to dig across parts of the upper Midwest and
adjacent Great Lakes region, before pivoting east/northeast of the
Lake Huron/Georgian Bay vicinity, in advance of a trailing impulse
digging south of Hudson Bay.  More uncertain, due to greater model
spread, the lead short wave may be preceded across the Lower
Michigan vicinity by an increasingly sheared, convectively generated
perturbation emerging from the central Great Plains.

The evolution of this regime is forecast to include an initial
intrusion of somewhat cooler/drier air, which may maintain identity
while advancing across the Great Lakes region, Midwest and lower
Missouri Valley, before being overtaken by a more substantive
reinforcing cool intrusion across the Great Lakes by late Tuesday
night.  Both fronts will be preceded by the increasingly diffuse
remnants of a slow moving or stalled surface frontal zone extending
from the lower Great Lakes into the southern Great Plains, and
boundary layer moistening/destabilization ahead of the lead front
advancing across Upper Michigan and Wisconsin by late Tuesday
afternoon remains a bit unclear. 

Barring complications from lingering convective cloud
cover/precipitation associated with the possible MCV emerging from
the Great Plains, it might not be out of the question that the
environment in a corridor along/ahead of the front could become
supportive of organized thunderstorms with potential to produce
strong wind gusts and hail.  Depending on the strength of the MCV,
which remains unclear due to model spread, wind fields may
strengthen sufficiently to support at least some risk for organized
strong/severe thunderstorm development across Lower Michigan, where
stronger pre-frontal destabilization appears most probable.

If/when these uncertainties become better resolved, it is possible
that severe probabilities in excess of 5 percent, or higher, will be
needed across parts of the Great Lakes region in later outlooks for
this period.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1218 PM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE MONDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING ACROSS  PARTS OF EASTERN NORTH
DAKOTA...NORTHWESTERN MINNESOTA...EAST CENTRAL NEW MEXICO AND
NORTHWESTERN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms accompanied by at least some risk for severe
wind and hail may impact parts of eastern New Mexico into the Texas
South Plains, as well as  parts of eastern North Dakota into
northwestern Minnesota, late Monday afternoon and evening.

...Discussion...
While the westerlies generally remain confined to the higher
latitudes, one significant embedded short wave trough is forecast to
continue digging southeast of the Canadian Prairies through the
international border vicinity, to the west of the Great Lakes,
during this period.  It appears that this will be accompanied by one
initial surge of cooler/drier boundary layer air across much of the
Dakotas and portions of the Upper Midwest/adjacent Great Lakes
region by late Monday night.

Otherwise, weak mid-level troughing likely will linger across much
of the remainder of the interior U.S., to the east of the Rockies,
between large-scale mean ridging centered offshore of both the
Pacific and Atlantic coasts.  An associated weak surface frontal
zone, still reinforced by convective outflow in some locations, is
likely to linger across the Great Lakes through lower Missouri
Valley and Texas South Plains into early Monday, before generally
continuing to weaken through the period.  

Seasonably high boundary-layer moisture content probably will be
maintained ahead of the stalled/slow moving remnant front, across
much of the Southwest, as well as in a corridor along and to the
north it.  Some of this moisture across the lower/middle Missouri
Valley may begin to advect northward ahead of the lead reinforcing
cool intrusion late Monday into Monday night.

...Southern Great Plains into Great Lakes...
The seasonably high boundary-layer moisture content, along/just
north of the weakening front, may provide support for the
development of moderate to locally higher CAPE with insolation
Monday.  As this occurs, it appears that a number of convectively
generated or augmented perturbations within the generally weak
southwesterly deep-layer mean flow could contribute to scattered
thunderstorm development during and after peak heating. Some of this
could pose a risk for localized potentially damaging wind gusts, but
the coverage of any such activity still seems likely to remain
rather sparse in nature.

One possible exception may develop along a modifying segment of the
boundary across parts of east central New Mexico into the Texas
South Plains by late Monday afternoon or evening, beneath steeper
mid-level lapse rates associated with the remnants of a plume of
warm elevated mixed-layer air.  There appears a general consensus
within the various model output that a digging short wave impulse,
within a weak northwesterly mid-level regime, may provide support
for a relatively notable upscale growing/southeastward propagating
thunderstorm cluster.

Farther northeast, the NAM, perhaps more so than other model output,
suggests that a notable MCV may emerge from Sunday night convection
over the central Great Plains, before slowly migrating across the
lower Missouri Valley toward the Great Lakes Monday through Monday
night.  It is possible that a perturbation of the strength suggested
by the NAM could, at some point, support another notable evolving
cluster with potential to produce strong wind gusts.  At this point,
however, the potential for this still seems low, with too much
uncertainty to introduce 5 percent probabilities without unduly
large false alarm area.

...Northern Great Plains...
A moistening boundary-layer, aided by evapotranspiration and perhaps
the onset of better low-level moisture return on strengthening
southerly low-level flow, may contribute to moderate CAPE within a
corridor of stronger pre-frontal surface heating by late afternoon. 
Coupled with strengthening deep-layer mean wind fields and shear,
downstream of a digging 50+ kt 500 mb jet, it appears that the
environment may become conducive to vigorous convective development
capable of producing small to marginally severe hail and strong
surface gusts.  Potential for gusts approaching or exceeding severe
limits appears highest during the late afternoon and early evening
across parts of eastern North Dakota into northwestern Minnesota,
where warm, unsaturated low-level thermodynamic profiles with steep
lapse rates will aid downward momentum transfer via enhanced melting
and evaporative cooling in downdrafts.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 AM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

Minor adjustments were made to the Isolated Dry Thunderstorm chances
across Arizona in alignment with recent trends in hi-res guidance.
Otherwise, the Elevated area remains unchanged. See previous
discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 08/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0103 AM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will continue for today across parts of the
Four Corners/Southwest region. Early-morning water-vapor imagery
depicts a pronounced mid-level perturbation traversing UT/WY as of
06 UTC. This feature is expected to reach AZ/NM by peak heating this
afternoon, which will induce west/northwesterly mid-level flow
across the greater Four Corners region. Although low-level pressure
gradient winds will likely remain somewhat modest (generally around
15 mph), deep mixing will promote downward mixing of 20-30 mph gusts
across far southern UT into northern AZ and northwest NM. Dry
conditions will persist and support another day of RH minimums in
the single digits and elevated fire weather conditions. More
aggressive solutions, such as the HRRR and RAP that have a tendency
to over-mix, hint that elevated conditions may extend as far north
as eastern UT/western CO, but general ensemble consensus is meager.
Therefore opted to maintain highlights mainly over AZ/NM where
confidence in sustained elevated conditions is higher. 

In addition to supporting elevated fire weather conditions, the
mid-level perturbation will also promote isolated to scattered
thunderstorm development across the greater Southwest and southern
High Plains region. Convection developing along the Mogollon Rim
will likely develop on the fringe of the deeper monsoonal moisture
where PWATs should remain near 0.75 inches and LCLs will likely
reach 3-4 km. These thermodynamic conditions were observed yesterday
afternoon/evening (e.g. the 00z ABQ sounding) across the region and
yielded isolated dry lightning strikes. As such, a similar risk for
dry lightning should manifest this afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1121 AM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025

Valid 101630Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
TONIGHT OVER PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
central/southern Plains today and tonight, with large hail and
damaging winds the main threats.

...CO/KS...
Morning water vapor loop shows a vigorous shortwave trough digging
southeastward into central CO.  Large scale forcing for ascent ahead
of this trough will aid in the development of scattered
thunderstorms along the foothills of central CO by early afternoon,
with storms spreading eastward through the afternoon/evening.  Ample
low-level moisture and CAPE are present over eastern CO/western KS
to promote a few intense cells, with favorable westerly flow aloft
for supercell structures. Large hail is the main concern, with an
increasing risk of damaging winds with eastward extent this evening.
 A tornado or two is possible as storms interact with a remnant
outflow boundary that extends across the TX Panhandle and northwest
OK.

...MO/IL/WI...
A corridor of strong heating will encourage scattered thunderstorm
development this afternoon from southern MO into central/northeast
IL.  Weak winds aloft and considerable mid-level moisture will limit
overall downdraft potential.  Nevertheless, gusty/damaging winds
could occur with the strongest cells.

...Southeast AZ...
Similar to yesterday, scattered high-based afternoon/evening
thunderstorm development is expected over southeast AZ in a
hot/unstable environment.  The strongest cells may produce locally
damaging wind gusts.

## Tropical Storm Ivo Forecast Discussion Number 15

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Sun Aug 10 2025

Ivo is weakening while it passes over the cooler waters well to the 
west of Baja California Sur, and its associated deep convection 
is gradually decreasing in coverage and intensity.  Data from an 
excellent scatterometer overpass just before 0500 UTC showed that 
the maximum winds have decreased to near 35 kt.  Subjective Dvorak 
analyses from TAFB and SAB, along with objective Dvorak values from 
UW-CIMSS gave a similar intensity estimate, indicating that Ivo is 
now at minimal tropical storm strength.

Center fixes indicate that the cyclone continues to move 
west-northwestward, or at about 285/7 kt.  A low- to mid-level 
ridge is predicted to remain to the north of Ivo during the next 
couple of days.  The system is likely to turn more westward with a 
slight increase in forward speed in a day or so as the increasingly 
shallow circulation becomes steered by the low-level easterlies.  
The official forecast track is very similar to the one from the 
previous advisory.

Ivo is moving over cooler waters with gradually decreasing 
environmental moisture.  Therefore weakening should continue, and 
the system will likely degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low 
in 24 hours or so.  The intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous NHC forecast and near the high end of the model guidance.

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 25

WTPA43 PHFO 100834

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  25
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows that Henriette retains a well-organized 
low-level structure, with a curved band wrapping around the west 
side of the circulation. However, convection within the band has 
struggled to persist due to surrounding dry mid- to upper-level air. 
Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from SAB, JTWC, and 
HFO, along with objective estimates from UW-CIMSS, support holding 
the initial intensity at 35 kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is toward the northwest at 13 kt, steered by a 
subtropical ridge to the northeast and an amplifying mid-latitude 
trough to the northwest. Henriette’s forward speed is expected to 
increase through 36 hours, level off near 60 hours, and then slow 
through 96 hours as the steering flow weakens. This motion will keep 
Henriette well northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. Guidance indicates 
the sharp upper trough will cut off into an upper low on Monday and 
retrograde westward, a pattern that should maintain Henriette’s 
northwestward motion. The track forecast is very similar to the 
previous one but is slightly left of the earlier forecast from days 
3 to 4, and lies near the middle of the tightly clustered consensus 
aids.

Sea-surface temperatures along Henriette’s forecast track should 
gradually warm from near 25 degrees C to around 26–27 degrees C 
through about 60 h. Despite surrounding dry mid- to upper-level air, 
a combination of warmer waters and increasing upper-level divergence 
associated with an upper trough to the northwest should enhance 
outflow and support gradual strengthening. The NHC forecast 
continues to show a peak near 55 kt in the 36–48 h period, nearly 
identical to the previous forecast and within the middle to upper 
end of the guidance envelope. Thereafter, cooler waters, increasing 
shear, and diminishing upper-level outflow should result in steady 
weakening, with Henriette expected to become a post-tropical remnant 
low by 96 h and dissipate by 120 h as it is absorbed into the 
mid-latitude flow.
