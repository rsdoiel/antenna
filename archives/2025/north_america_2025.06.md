## White South Africans gather in support of Trump, his claims they are victims of racism

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — Some white South Africans showed support for President Donald Trump on Saturday and gathered at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria to claim they are victims of racism by their own government.


Hundreds of protesters held placards that read "Thank God for President Trump" and displayed other messages criticizing what they see as racist laws instituted by the South African government that discriminate against the white minority.


Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa's Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate private land. 


The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race and says Trump's claims over the country and the law have been full of misinformation and distortions. 


Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners — which the order referred to as "racially disfavored landowners" — when no land has been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. They are only one part of South Africa's white minority. 


In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were dispossessed of property under the apartheid system of white minority rule and hundreds of years of colonialism before that. 


"The people of this country know the pain of forced removals," Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public good. 


The Trump administration's criticism and punishment of South Africa has elevated a long-standing dilemma in the country over moves to address the wrongs of centuries of white minority rule that oppressed the Black majority. 


According to the government, the land law aims to fairly address the inequality that the majority of farmland in South Africa is owned by whites, even though they make up just 7% of the country's population. 


White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white people.


Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk — who was raised in South Africa — has also criticized South Africa’s government and claimed it is anti-white for years, although some have questioned his motivations. He has recently failed to get a license for his Starlink satellite internet service in South Africa because it doesn’t meet the country’s affirmative action criteria.


While race has long framed South African politics, the country has been largely successful in reconciling its racially diverse people in the years after apartheid. The current government is made up of a coalition of 10 Black-led and white-led political parties that are working together.

## Breakfast is booming at US restaurants. Is it also contributing to high egg prices?

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

It's a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos rancheros may be part of the problem.


Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another Broken Egg Café celebrated its 100th restaurant last year.


Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks, which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12 separate items containing eggs. Wendy's reintroduced breakfast in 2020 and offers 10 items with eggs.


Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019.


In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs. But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to slaughter nearly 159 million chickens, turkeys and other birds — including nearly 47 million since the start of December — is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen.


The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.


But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals, 2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024.




Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus include eggs.


Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he said.


The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home use but restaurants needed fewer of them because many of them had to close for a time, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for animal proteins at CoBank.


U.S. egg consumption declined for more than five decades before reaching a low of 247 per person in 2008, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. As nutritional research and marketing established eggs as an inexpensive protein source instead of heart-clogging cholesterol bombs, per capita consumption of egg products grew to the equivalent of 292 fresh eggs in 2019, the data shows.


"Consumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you're making something with eggs, you know it's fresh," Earnest said.


Before the pandemic reduced demand and bird flu outbreaks impacted supplies, the USDA had forecast that Americans would continue eating more eggs. By 2023, the most recent year for which annual data is available, they were down to 249 eggs per person.


Other trends have impacted the economics of eggs. To address animal rights concerns, McDonald's and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments.


"It makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago," Earnest said.


The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door.


Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association.


First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical for the chain's brand and are found in the majority of its offerings, whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and isn't charging extra for them.


First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.


Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.


"Eggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of American diets," Richardson said.

## US man sues travel company after hippo kills wife on Zambia trip

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides.


Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich, Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit's allegations.


The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides — including at least one armed with a rifle — walked away without helping the couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died shortly after, the lawsuit says.


"We're doing this because this should never have happened," said Paul Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law partner, Nicole Coates. "There are basic safety standards that businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences here were absolutely devastating."


Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders' death and keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving interviews.


The Manderses, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children and a granddaughter.


The company's lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or reckless in connection with Lisa Manders' death. He said African Portfolio only arranged the couple's lodging and the owners of the lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides.


"It's a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and is injured or killed. It's awful," Gould said. "I think it's important to understand what African Portfolio's role in this is. It's a tour operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces."




He added, "My client didn't conduct the safari. It arranged it. It booked all the components."


Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa, because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manderses signed for the trip.


In a statement, African Portfolio did not directly address the lawsuit. It said Chiawa arranged the walking safari and guests were accompanied by an experienced and highly trained guide, a ranger and an armed National Park scout. It said Chiawa told authorities that safety measures were implemented before the attack and "repeated warnings" were issued to guests to return to the safety of the vehicle "during the incident."


Asked whether the guests were warned about the hippo before the attack, African Portfolio said in an email only that "the statement is an accurate reflection of the events as we understand them." Gould declined to comment.


The company also said its founder flew to Zambia immediately after the attack and joined Chiawa's owner in ensuring that "everything possible was being done to support the family and all those involved. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family, and everyone else involved in this tragic incident."


The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are "inherently dangerous activities" because of the unpredictability and sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent, qualified and trained to keep people safe.


The suit alleges that African Portfolio "encouraged and/or permitted" the Manderses to be exposed to an "avoidable and highly dangerous encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness." It also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe experience.


African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the Manderses before and during the attack, the suit alleges.


Hippos are the world's second-largest land mammals after elephants, measuring about 3.5 meters long and about 1.5 meters tall, according to International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs about 3,200 kilograms.


Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500.


Lisa Manders suffered "significant premorbid fear and emotional pain, suffering and mental anguish" before her death, the suit says. Craig Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily routines, it says.


The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and recklessness.


"He's suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on him and his life," Slager said. "And he also has a claim for having witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is unthinkable. It's unimaginable."

## Photos lost in US disasters find way home with help from people who care

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Hollowed-out homes. Cars entombed by mud. Unpeopled roads. Belongings reduced to dirt and debris. 


It all took a toll on Taylor Schenker. 


After Hurricane Helene last September, Schenker was upset by the deluge of images of Asheville, North Carolina. "This storm has taken so much," she said, "and it's so jarring to see the photos of the horrible devastation."


So less than a week after the storm, she set out to do something about the wide-scale loss. 


While helping a friend search for belongings cast downriver, she stumbled on a handful of photos of strangers — mud-caked, curled up in tree branches and stuck under river rocks. The images captured family reunions, newborn babies, weddings, birthday parties, beloved pets and school portraits. 


"These tiny photos had been through so much and miraculously had washed up and were in decent enough condition that you could see what they were," said Schenker, 27. "It stuck with me." 


To reclaim the search phrase "photos from Helene," she created an Instagram for "something positive, which is reuniting people with their memories." She set up a post-office box, linked up with a volunteer search and rescue crew, and ultimately uncovered more than 500 photos — or what she calls "little needles in a haystack." 


When Schenker made her first match, she got chills. 


Then, sitting in her car, she cried. 




Photos found amid muck 


We hold onto photos to keep memories alive — of people, places and moments that might otherwise fade. Or sometimes are ripped away abruptly. 


Schenker has since returned more than 70 such images. A stack of them were hand-delivered to Mary Moss, whose car was destroyed by an uprooted tree as she and her husband evacuated the Asheville home where they had lived for almost 40 years. 


"It was really kind of overwhelming at first when she handed me those pictures. I just couldn't even speak," Moss said. "You don't expect something as fragile as photos to be retrieved." 


Months later, they've received some FEMA assistance and found a temporary home, which they're gradually furnishing with church donations. But some things are irreplaceable. 


"This is not really about losing the home and all the material stuff in there. But what's been devastating is that that was everything we had of Tommy," she said of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic disorder. "It's those memories and the little things, the photos, that you can't replace." 


As Schenker later understood it, "When they lost their home, they lost virtually all proof that this child existed." 


"It is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people's lives," she said. "They've literally lost everything and they can't ever recreate those childhood photos." 




In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Moss family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old dressed like an angel for a Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in yet another, he's playing at daycare alongside his younger brother Dallas. 


"It is just breathtaking," Moss said. "This is one thing that the river didn't get to take — or didn't get to keep." 


Smoke, water, ash, soot


More than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away, in the Altadena foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them with their owners. 


After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. "Someone has to do this ASAP," she remembers thinking to herself. "And I realized it had to be me — because nobody else was doing it." 


Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the deterioration process, he freezes such prints — and advised to not wipe off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, "driving particles deeper into the material." Some photos are so brittle, too, that when touched they may disintegrate. 




In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials, whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot. 


Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly set out to salvage photos — finding them alongside pages from yearbooks, sheet music, and children's art in nearby parks, neighbors' front yards and a golf course. 


"The wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in with precious mementos everywhere you look," she said. "It's just absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a unit." 


Finding the photographed people


Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground. Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to Schwartz. 


She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival intern at the Corita Art Center — protecting photos in acid-free, glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a temperature-controlled room with good air circulation. 


Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact. 


"It's funny — you formulate these ideas of who the person is," Schwartz said. "She was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really friendly and bubbly and lovely — you could tell that just from her photos." 


Schwartz's house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it — full of burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles — is otherworldly and changed. "It looks like the moon. It looks like another planet. It doesn't look like home." 


Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived. 


"The very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby," said Simpson. The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy, as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. "We were both pretty overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that one." 


Above all, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. "When you're picking up people's heirlooms or family photographs, that can be traumatic — even if they're not yours," he said. 


When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or hurricanes, and are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide range of emotions — from overwhelmed to outraged to numb sometimes all at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities, and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B. 


"Disasters like this really bring out the best in people," Moss said. "You know, I can laugh or I can cry about it — and I choose to laugh about it. Fortunately, we didn't lose the most important thing. That's lives."

## Fistfights, anthem boos in stormy US-Canada ice hockey clash

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

MONTREAL — Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday.


An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded lineups of the North American rivals -- which comes against a backdrop of political tension between the two neighboring countries -- erupted into violence from the opening puck drop at Montreal's Bell Centre.


The U.S. squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a fiercely partisan Canadian crowd.


With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans booed The Star-Spangled Banner before the game, catcalls that have become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods crossing U.S. borders.


Then came three fights in nine seconds.


"I just think it's very indicative of what this means to the players," U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said. "There's two teams out there that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective teams and their countries.


"For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way that it occurred -- I think that's an indication of it. What an incredible hockey game."


Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee in the first moments was not prearranged.


"It wasn't planned," Cooper said. "That wasn't two coaches throwing guys over and saying 'This is happening' -- none of that happened. That was as organic as it gets."


At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as Canada's Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice.


Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and tried to restart the game, only for Canada's Sam Bennett and Brady Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the penalty box.


The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American J.T. Miller and Canada's Colton Parayko began the third and final fight.


'Jacked up'


Asked about U.S. players having agreed on the fight-filled start beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a move.


"These guys care very much about winning," he said. "Brady and Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion -- and they're leaders in so many ways.


"It's just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there's a lot of energy around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play."


Top NHL players from the United States and Canada had not faced off against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the league's best traditionally skipping the world championships and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018 PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.


"It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled in a minute and a half," Cooper said.


The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid's goal 5:31 into the first period.


But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel's goal at 10:15 of the first period and the U.S. went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin's tally at 13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on Guentzel's empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period.

## US, South Korea, Japan reaffirm pledge to seek denuclearization of North Korea

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

MUNICH  — The United States, Japan and South Korea renewed their "resolute" pledge to seek the "complete denuclearization" of North Korea, according to a joint statement from the three allies released Saturday.


The statement came after new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held his first meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Japan's top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.


"The Secretary and Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolute commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs)," it said.


"They expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address together the DPRK's nuclear and missile programs, malicious cyber activities including cryptocurrency thefts, and increasing military cooperation with Russia," it added.


The three sent a "strong warning" that they "will not tolerate any provocations or threats to their homelands," and vowed to maintain and strengthen international sanctions against Pyongyang.


They also said they were committed to "the immediate resolution of the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war as well as the issue of separated families."


Largely cut off from the world diplomatically and economically, and under a bevy of sanctions, North Korea with its ongoing nuclear weapons program has been a major thorn in the side of the United States for years.


President Donald Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim Jong Un during his first term in office, has said he will reach out again to the North Korean leader, calling Kim a "smart guy."


Despite Trump's diplomatic overtures, North Korea said in January that its nuclear program would continue "indefinitely."


Pyongyang also said earlier this month it would not tolerate any "provocation" by the United States after Rubio called it a "rogue state" in a radio interview.


It has also slammed a visit by a U.S. nuclear submarine to a naval base in South Korea this month as a "hostile military act."


A summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi collapsed in 2019 over talks on sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in return.

## US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the federal government. 


On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances in the last week. 


It was unclear if they would be replaced. The U.S. Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday. 


Immigration courts are backlogged with more than 3.7 million cases, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Applicants can wait years for their asylum case to be decided. There is support across the political spectrum for more judges and support staff, though the first Trump administration also pressured some judges to decide cases more quickly. 


The Trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials, including Mary Cheng, the agency's acting director. Sirce Owen, the current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge, has issued a slew of new instructions, many reversing policies of the Biden administration. 


Last month, the Justice Department halted financial support for nongovernmental organizations to provide information and guidance to people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit. 


The firings touch on two top Trump priorities: mass deportations and shrinking the size of the federal government. On Thursday, it ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers. Probationary workers generally have less than a year on the job.

## US East faces flooding as snow forecast for Northeast, cold in Midwest

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — Much of the Eastern U.S. endured a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with snowstorms predicted in the Northeast and heavy winds bringing the threat of tornadoes to the Mississippi Valley.


The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and people were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off the roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to 20.3 centimeters of rain.


Governor Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday.


"We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have flooded in the past," Beshear said on social media.


Photos posted by authorities and users on social media showed cars and buildings underwater in Warren County, Kentucky, and in Buchanan County, Virginia, where the sheriff's office said multiple roads were blocked by mudslides.


The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in floodwaters.


"Stay home if you can," the office said on Facebook.


Flash flooding was possible in the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio valleys, the weather service said. In Tennessee, flash flood warnings were issued for much of the middle of the state through the evening.


The National Weather Service called the expected rain a "major, potentially historic, flash flood event."


Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest accumulations — possibly 30.5 centimeters or more — were expected in upstate New York and portions of northern New England.


"Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch (half a centimeter) are forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages," the weather service warned.




Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters of snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday evening.


Frigid polar vortex


Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe.


In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those living on the streets.


Forecasters reported 2.5 centimeters of snow falling every hour just north of Denver.


The weather service also warned of extreme cold in the Upper Plains over the coming days, with wind chills ranging from minus 34 degree Celsius to as low as minus 51 degrees Celsius in parts of western Montana, North Dakota, northern South Dakota and western Minnesota. People in those areas were urged to stay indoors and make provisions to shelter livestock and other animals.


California struggles with mudslides


Dry weather returned to Southern California after the strongest storm of the year. But the risk of rockslides and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away.


Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several homes with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people.


A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters of snow over 36 hours. Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.

## IRS to lay off thousands of probationary workers in tax season

date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two sources familiar with the agency's plans, and the cuts could happen as soon as next week.


The Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. It is doing it by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection.


It's unclear how many IRS workers will be affected.


Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to almost all federal employees through a "deferred resignation program" to quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.


However, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees.


It is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.


Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency.


Republicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have called for the U.S. to "delete entire agencies" from the federal government as part of his plan to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.


Elected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys general from 14 states challenged the authority of DOGE to access sensitive government data and exercise "virtually unchecked power" in a lawsuit filed Thursday.


The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that delineate the powers of Congress and the president.

## Central African Republic soldiers kidnapped by mercenaries, advocates allege

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

BANGUI, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC — Human rights advocates and politicians in Central African Republic claim soldiers who disappeared after being detained last month were kidnapped by mercenaries backed by Russia. The Kremlin has in recent years deepened ties with the gold- and diamond-rich country's military and government.


Celestin Bakoyo and Elie Ngouengue — two soldiers who led a Wagner Group-aligned militia fighting rebels in the country's southeast — were reportedly detained on January 24 at a police station in the country's capital.


Ernest Mizedio, a politician from the region, told The Associated Press that the two soldiers were among a group arrested earlier by Russian mercenaries tasked with training militia members and incorporating them into the army.


"We searched without success for where they took them," he said, noting that supporters had inquired with both law enforcement and Russian security contractors about their whereabouts. "They said they had nothing to offer us and knew nothing of their situation."


Mizedio, a member of one of Central African Republic's opposition parties, said there had been marches and protests decrying the arrests in the country's southeast.


Neither Wagner nor the military responded to AP's requests for comment on the disappearance. However, a police officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said mercenaries were gradually vying for position and replacing officers on the ground in conflict zones.


Before going missing, the two had come to the capital to open new bank accounts to access their earnings after being integrated into the army. The backlash against their disappearance comes as Russia expands its military and economic presence throughout Africa, using mercenaries to quell rebellion and fight extremists.


Joseph Bindoumi, president of Central African Republic's League for Human Rights, denounced the disappearances, called them kidnappings and said even if the soldiers were accused of crimes, their whereabouts should be known.


"We have the right to know if standard procedures are being followed. We have the right to see people to ensure their well-being and to ensure their parents, advocates and lawyers can visit them," he said.


Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries became active. Amid years of conflict between government forces and predominantly Muslim rebels, citizens and officials credited the Russian mercenaries with fighting back armed groups who tried to overtake Bangui in 2021.


Yet they've been dogged by reports of recklessly disregarding human rights and civilian welfare. A 2023 investigation from the U.S.-based watchdog group The Sentry found that mercenaries train the army on torture tactics and as part of the fight against armed groups opposed to the government had carried out killings, torture and rape.

## US braces for flooding; parts of California face mudslides

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

SIERRA MADRE, CALIFORNIA — Much of the Eastern United States braced for a renewed round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with thunderstorms and melting snow combining to pound the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. The lower Mississippi valley was facing the threat of strong tornadoes. 


Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were under flood warnings, and residents were warned by the National Weather Service to stay off roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up to eight inches of rain. 


"This may be a major, potentially historic, flash flood event," the NWS said. 


Heavy snow, meanwhile, was expected to blanket much of New England and then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible, the NWS said. 


In northern New York, heavy mixed precipitation is expected throughout the weekend. Weather forecasters said residents should expect snow, sleet and ice accumulations of six to 13 inches and wind gusts as high as 72 kilometers per hour (45 miles per hour) late Saturday and Sunday. 


"Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice and strong winds. Travel could be very difficult to nearly impossible, the NWS said. 


California struggles with mudslides 


In Southern California on Friday, a mountain community near the Eaton Fire burn scar dug out of roads submerged in sludge after the strongest storm of the year swept through the area, unleashing debris flows and muddy messes in several neighborhoods recently torched by wildfires. 


Dry weather returned to the region but the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued Friday since dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in scorched areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away. 


Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and damaging several home garages with mud and debris. Bulldozers on Friday were cleaning up the mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people. 


Sierra Madre officials issued evacuation orders for areas affected by the Eaton Fire, warning that fire, police and public works personnel would not enter areas experiencing active mud and debris flows and anyone who remained in a home under evacuation orders would need to shelter in place until areas are deemed safe for city personnel to enter. Residents of the city also had to evacuate during the Eaton Fire, which destroyed 15 homes in the community. 


In Pacific Palisades on Friday, some residents washed their mud-covered driveways and bulldozers worked to clear mud-coated roads not far from where, just weeks ago, officials moved abandoned cars after people fleeing last month's wildfires got stuck in traffic and fled on foot. 


Southern California reported 2.5 to 7 centimeters (1 to 3 inches) of rain in coastal areas and valleys and 7.6 to 15.2 centimeters (3 to 6 inches) across the coastal slopes Thursday, said Mike Wofford, a meteorologist with the weather service. 


The precipitation was badly needed, as much of Southern California remains in extreme or severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. In neighboring Nevada, the weather service said it recorded a measurable amount of rain in Las Vegas, ending a streak of 214 days without precipitation. 


A storm in the Sierra Nevada mountains dumped 1.8 meters (6 feet) of snow over 36 hours. Two ski patrol staff from Mammoth Mountain were caught in an avalanche during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. 


More winter weather descending


Meteorologists warn that the U.S. is about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole into the U.S. and Europe. The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains on Saturday and then stick around all next week. 


In Denver, Colorado, where temperatures are expected to dip as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) over the weekend, the city has extended its cold weather shelters for those living on the streets. The Denver Coliseum — an arena with some 10,000 seats — will be opened Saturday for additional space, while a free bus will loop between the shelters across the city.

## Carafano: 'A free, independent Ukraine is in America's best interest'

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — James Carafano, senior counselor to the president and national security expert at The Heritage Foundation, responsible for its defense and foreign policy team, spoke with VOA's Ukraine Service about the Trump administration's goals and considerations in the negotiation process to achieve peace in Ukraine.


He explained that while not a vital interest, a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself is in America's best interests, and he outlined how to achieve this goal.


Voice of America: How do you and The Heritage Foundation see ending the war in Ukraine, and what is the strategy behind it?




James Carafano, The Heritage Foundation: It is in America's best interest that there be a free and independent Ukraine that can defend itself. And the reason for that is the United States. The United States is a global power with global interests and global responsibilities.


A peaceful Europe, whole, free and at peace, that is a vital American interest. The trans Atlantic community is important to us. And the number one threat, physical threat to that is the destabilizing actions of Russia. And the most concerning and destabilizing action is the security of the Eastern front of NATO and Ukraine, that is free and independent, that can defend itself is an obstacle to the Russians, whether it's in NATO or not.


Now, to be honest, it's not a vital interest in the United States. For the practical matter is, the United Europe can defend itself and the United States can defend Europe if Ukraine's occupied by Russia. Now having said that, are we way better off? I mean, way, way better off with the Russians on the other side of Ukraine? And the answer is "absolutely."


At this point, what is in America's interest is that the war stops and that there is a ceasefire that is both from a strategic perspective to preserve Ukraine, and that we have to be realistic about Ukraine's capacity to recover territory that's been occupied. But also from a humanitarian perspective, and I think this is very deeply reflected in our president. More Ukrainians dying is never going to reconquer all of Ukrainian territory. A war of attrition is never going to create a stronger Ukraine.


I think everybody is focused on what the deal looks like. I think the deals are relevant. Stopping the war is the objective. The real question is, what do we do the day after the war to ensure there's a free and independent Ukraine in the future?


VOA: The defense secretary said we don't want Minsk 3.0. Are we falling into the trap of Munich 2.0, where we appease the dictator, give away territories, embolden the aggressor, and end up in a world war?


Carafano: I don't think that's the peace that the U.S. envisions. So, I'll tell you what appeasement would be. Appeasement would be giving the Russians something at the negotiating table that they didn't win on the battlefield. That's appeasement.


Recognizing that the Russians have territory they have and the inability of the Ukraine [forces] to retake that territory — maybe they trade territory, I don't know — that's called being realistic.


VOA: If Russia is allowed to keep its spoils of war, what message would it send to other would-be aggressors?


Carafano: That Russia has failed. Russia's goal was to conquer and destroy Ukraine. It failed. Russia's goal was to have NATO fall apart. It failed. If Russia is stopped in Ukraine, and look what they have achieved, they've achieved some marginal territorial gains at the cost of destroying the Russian army, crippling the Russian economy, and making themselves a global pariah. If that's a victory, it's a kind of really weird Pyrrhic victory.


VOA: Then, why would [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth articulate these concessions?


Carafano: They're not concessions. They are statements of reality. We all know it's true. If you give Putin something at the negotiation table that he wasn't able to take on the battlefield, that is a concession. So, if for example you said, Ukraine has to give up the sovereignty of its territory even its occupied territory, I would say that's a really bad deal. That's a concession. We have never ever forced any country to actually give up the sovereignty of its territory."


VOA: What about [Ukraine`s membership] in NATO? Here is a counterargument: Why Russia should have a veto power over NATO?


Carafano: First of all, Hegseth has never said Russia should have a veto power over the entry of Ukraine into NATO. Hegseth has said, "This is not going to be part of the negotiation and Ukraine is not going to get into NATO now." That's no different from the Biden policy and that's actually just a reflection of reality. NATO is a consensus organization. Every member has to agree. Every member does not agree. So, we all know, the Russians know, we know, everybody in NATO knows, Ukraine is not going to get NATO membership now."


VOA: What about the future?


Carafano: He didn't say that Ukraine shouldn't join NATO in the future. He just said that NATO membership is not going to be part of the negotiation.


VOA: So, the main issue here is security guarantees.


Carafano: That's also wrong. Somehow that we're going to say something that's going deter Putin in the future. That's nonsense and ridiculous. What's going to deter Putin in the future is, does Ukraine have the capacity to defend itself?


VOA: So how do we deter the Russians?


Carafano: We have a Ukraine as a country that can defend itself and that is free, and its economy grows, and it builds a defense industrial base. And we strengthen NATO because that will equally deter the Russians.


And we do the other things, which by the way Donald Trump is going to do already, whether there's a peace deal or not. Donald Trump is going to put a lot of pressure on the Russians. He's going to lower the price of oil. He's going to increase sanctions. He's going to [do] a lot of things that are going to hamstring the Russian economy. Russia is going to be weaker. He's going to do a lot of things to go after the Iranians. So, the Iranians are going to have a lot less capacity to support the Russians. He's going to do a lot of things to put a lot of pressure on the Chinese.


The Chinese are going to be less able to support the Russians. Donald Trump can do a lot to North Korea.


Regardless of what happens in the actual peace deal in Ukraine, Trump is going to do a lot to the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans and the Iranians that really diminishes their capacity to sustain this war.

## US citizen detained in Russia, accused of drug smuggling

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

MOSCOW — A Moscow court has ordered a U.S. citizen suspected of drug smuggling held in pre-trial detention for 30 days, the Moscow courts press service said Saturday, days after a Moscow-Washington prisoner swap that the White House called a diplomatic thaw and a step toward ending the fighting in Ukraine. 


The U.S. citizen, whom Saturday's statement named as Kalob Wayne Byers, was detained after airport customs officials found cannabis-laced marmalade in his baggage. 


Russian police said the 28-year-old American had attempted to smuggle a "significant amount" of drugs into the country, the Interfax agency reported, citing Russia's Federal Customs Service. The agency said the American was detained at Moscow's Vnukovo airport after flying in from Istanbul on February 7. 


Mash, a Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services, said the U.S. citizen faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. 


There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department. 


The Washington-Moscow prisoner exchange this month saw Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cryptocurrency expert who faced Bitcoin fraud charges in the United States, returned to Russia in exchange for American Marc Fogel, a teacher from Pennsylvania who was detained in 2021 when traveling to Russia to work at a school. 


Fogel had been serving a 14-year sentence for having what his family and supporters said was medically prescribed marijuana. President Joe Biden's administration designated Fogel as wrongfully detained in December. 


President Donald Trump on Wednesday upended three years of U.S. policy toward Ukraine, saying he and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending the conflict following a lengthy direct phone call.

## US counterterror official warns of growing global threat

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A senior U.S. counterterrorism official is cautioning that the threat from global jihadists has expanded significantly, although the resources to counter them have declined.


Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Donald Trump and senior director for counterterrorism, on Feb. 11 told a Washington conference organized by the American Foreign Policy Council that he based the current threat assessment on several factors.


“Number one, jihadist groups are more geographically dispersed than ever before, with networks extending across the Sahel, Central and East Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia,” he said.


“To cite just one example, West African countries like Benin and Togo, that once had little exposure to jihadi threats, are now seeing jihadi Sunni actors in their territory and elsewhere, affecting their national sovereignty.”


Benin and Togo have reported attacks by al-Qaida, an expansion of the violence the terror group is carrying out in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso.


Gorka said militant groups are increasingly capable and using new forms of technology to execute their deadly missions.


Gorka said that militants “remain highly adaptive entities.”


“If you look at their use of social media, especially encrypted apps to communicate, these individuals have acclimatized to the new technological environment,” he said.


One of Trump’s main campaign promises in last year’s election was to tighten security along the U.S. border and deport migrants without legal status. He signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the border. Gorka argued that border vulnerabilities give militants an advantage.


“The global jihadi actors are poised to capitalize on global security vulnerabilities, especially the fact that, for four years, we have had no southern border,” Gorka said.


Former President Joe Biden defended his immigration policies during the 2024 presidential election campaign and blamed the Republicans for walking back on a bipartisan immigration bill. Biden said Trump was involved in sinking the bill.


The Middle East


Gorka said militant groups in the Middle East, including Hezbollah and Hamas, which the United States, Britain and other Western nations have designated as terrorist groups, have been severely marginalized.


“Let's just be blunt — since the heinous, tragic massacre of more Jews than have ever been killed since the end of the Shoah [Holocaust] in 1945, since Oct. 7, our friends in Israel have literally redrawn the map of the region,” he said.


The war in Gaza was triggered by the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.


“As a result, groups like Hezbollah and Hamas have been radically degraded,” Gorka said. This has paved the way for what? The collapse of the [Bashar al-] Assad regime in Syria, which together represent devastating blows to the greatest global sponsor of terrorism as a nation-state — Iran's capability to hurt our interests and the interests of our friends and partners.”


US airstrikes in Somalia


Gorka also gave more details about the airstrikes on Feb. 1 that targeted Islamic State group militants in Somalia’s northeastern region of Puntland.


The strikes were carried out by the U.S. Africa Command and authorized by Trump and coordinated with Somalia.


“We told the president, ‘There is a cave complex in northern Somalia full of ISIS,” he said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. “We have been surveilling it for years, but the last administration refused to take action.”


According to the Africa Command, 14 militants were killed, including Ahmed Maeleninine, who was described as a "recruiter, financier and external operations leader responsible for the deployment of jihadists into the United States and across Europe."


Somali officials said he is from Oman, although the U.S. has not commented on his nationality.


“The person you saw in the footage is not just a foot soldier,” Gorka said as video of the airstrike was played. “He is a recruiter, trainer and financier for ISIS, one of the guys who is hard to replace. We had been surveilling him for months.”


The strikes were carried out by fighter jets launched from the USS Harry S. Truman, which was in the Red Sea at the time.


Trump confirmed ordering a precision military airstrikes on the same day.




Somali forces in Puntland this week reported success against the militants. Scores were killed after Puntland forces repelled a complex attack from the militants in the early hours of Feb. 11.


The U.S. has been training elite Somali forces known as Danab, which means “lightning.” So far, there has been no publicly known change of US security support to Somalia.

## Stars galore celebrate 'Saturday Night Live' in concert

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — By the time Cher sang “If I Could Turn Back Time,” it seemed as if time had indeed been turned back and every single “Saturday Night Live” musical guest of 50 years had magically found their way to Radio City Music Hall.


Of course, it was only a smattering. But “SNL50: The Homecoming Concert” boasted an epic lineup. It was an evening of memorable solo performances and often fascinating, one-time-only collaborations.


The concert, hosted by Jimmy Fallon, was only one element of what has become an enormous celebration of the show’s 50 years in existence, leading up to Sunday’s “SNL50: The Anniversary Special," live from Studio 8H.


But Friday night was all about music.


 




Return of the 1990s


If a decade can win the night, let’s hear it for the 1990s. A classic performance from that decade was most likely to get the Radio City audience on its feet, singing along and pulling out their phones to record.


The Backstreet Boys proved irresistible when they broke into “I Want it That Way.” Snoop Dogg may have sung “Gin and Juice,” but he was trailed by enough smoke to give nearby audience members a contact high.


Wearing a gigantic coat befitting a winter night, Lauryn Hill commanded the stage with Wyclef Jean, and the crowd melted at the first notes of “Killing Me Softly.”


Some comics can do music


Naturally, some former “SNL” cast members reprised old characters, with varying levels of success.


The Culps, the stuffy music teachers played by Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer, hit harder and funnier than they ever did on the show. Their attempts at being current were hilarious and they even worked in a few verses of “Not Like Us,” with a plea for harmony between Kendrick Lamar and Drake.


Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell’s “Lazy Sunday” was welcome, but too short. Lady Gaga was a good sport, replacing Justin Timberlake to sing about a Christmas gift whose title can't be repeated here. But Bill Murray’s lounge singer "foursome” routine with Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph and Cecily Strong fell a bit flat.


 




They love Michaels


“SNL” creator Lorne Michaels didn’t perform, but he was referred to all night long.


“I love you, Lorne Michaels,” declared Miley Cyrus, dedicating her hit song “Flowers” to the show's founder.


Raitt, finishing “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” thanked Michaels for having her on the show so many times.


“Let’s give it up for Lorne,” said former cast member Adam Sandler, introducing a collaboration between Post Malone and Nirvana. “We love you buddy.”


And Marcus Mumford, lead singer of the British folk band Mumford & Sons, said he was there to represent Michaels' admirers from across the pond.


Creative collaborations


The night featured fascinating collaborations that brought together musicians of all kinds.


Cyrus teamed with Brittany Howard to sing Queen’s “Crazy Little Thing Called Love.”


Arcade Fire joined with David Byrne, St. Vincent and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to perform David Bowie’s “Heroes.” Byrne later also collaborated with Robyn, in matching khaki suits, for “Dancing on My Own” and “This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody).”


And for Raitt's second song, she sat down with Chris Martin, the Coldplay frontman becoming her pianist for “I Can’t Make You Love Me.”


In another collab of sorts, the B-52s were joined on “Love Shack” by former and current SNL cast members Fred Armisen, Bowen Yang and Sarah Sherman, singing the “bang bang” lyrics.


Lady Gaga collaborated with herself, singing both parts of “Shallow” and bringing down the house.


 




Most valuable player


Questlove is more associated with the “Tonight” show, but he is proving to be the MVP of these “Saturday Night Live” anniversary festivities.


Not only did the drummer produce the splendid documentary on the “SNL” musical legacy, but he effortlessly kept the beat with The Roots, his legendary hip-hop group and “Tonight” show house band, as they covered every style imaginable, from Snoop to Eddie Vedder to Brandi Carlile. Byrne bowed in appreciation.


A second Nirvana reunion


For the second time in as many weeks, the surviving members of Nirvana reunited.


Rather than the quartet of women who fronted the band for the Fire Aid concert, Malone took Kurt Cobain’s place Friday.


Their version of “Smells Like Teen Spirit” was fierce, a reminder of why the song packed such a wallop when it was first heard.

## US defense secretary's Europe debut irks allies, wins Trump's nod

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's attention-grabbing overseas debut may have irritated some key Republicans and alienated allies in Europe, where his statements on Ukraine and NATO went down like a lead balloon.


But his forceful comments gained him a nod from one key listener: U.S. President Donald Trump.


And Hegseth — who on Saturday wraps up a weeklong trip to Belgium, Germany and Poland — delivered a message at the heart of Trump's “America First” agenda.


Speaking at the NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday, Hegseth said that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders was unrealistic, and that the Trump administration does not see NATO membership for Kyiv as part of a solution to the war triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion.


Trump broadly backed Hegseth's remarks on Thursday on NATO membership, saying, "I think probably that's true," because, he said, Putin would not allow Ukraine to join the military alliance.


"I thought his comments were good yesterday, and they're probably good today," Trump said.


Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican who leads the Pentagon's main oversight committee in the Senate, had championed Hegseth's nomination throughout a bruising confirmation review in which Democrats united against the nominee and three Republicans joined them, as questions were raised about Hegseth's qualifications, temperament and views about women in combat.


Asked whether he spent a lot of political capital getting Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News personality, confirmed, Wicker said: "I surely did, yes."




Republican Congressman Mike Turner said issues like the future of NATO membership for Ukraine should not be taken off the table.


"We don't need members of the Cabinet, President Trump's Cabinet, to be defining those in the public," Turner said Friday on CNN.


Republican Congressman Don Bacon responded to Hegseth's comments by saying that there should be moral clarity on who started the war.


"There are consequences of rewarding the invader even if its leader foolishly led over 700,000 of its citizens to slaughter," Bacon said on social media platform X.


Uncle Sam or Uncle Sucker?


Trump has played down any tensions. On Friday, he said he had not seen Wicker's comments but would reach out to him and Hegseth.


"Roger's a very good friend of mine, and Pete is obviously, he's been doing a great job," Trump said.


Hegseth, in what some analysts saw as walking back his remarks, clarified on Thursday that Trump was the one who would ultimately decide what was on or off the table in the Ukraine talks.


Calling Trump the world's best negotiator, Hegseth said it would not be appropriate for him to "declare what President Trump will do or won't do, what will be in or what will be out."


He also delivered a message that resonates with Trump and his “America First” agenda: Europe has been taking advantage of the United States.


Hegseth spoke about Europe's reliance on costly U.S. military deployments for its defense. Trump has criticized Europe over what he sees as its unfair tariffs against American goods.


The United States and European Union have the world's largest commercial relationship, trading $1.55 trillion of goods and services in 2023.


Speaking to reporters at NATO headquarters, Hegseth said: "Make no mistake: President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into 'Uncle Sucker.'"


In Trump's first term, NATO was seen as a red line for his Pentagon chiefs. Jim Mattis, his first defense secretary, resigned in part because of Trump's skepticism toward NATO.


America's European allies were critical of Hegseth.


"I think that was clumsy. I think that was a mistake," German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said, also criticizing Trump.


European foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas went further. "It is appeasement. It has never worked," she said.

## US Justice Department asks court to dismiss charges against NYC mayor

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The U.S. Justice Department asked a court Friday to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, with a top official from Washington intervening after federal prosecutors in Manhattan rebuffed his demands to drop the case and some quit in protest.


Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, the department’s second-in-command, and lawyers from the public integrity section and criminal division filed paperwork asking to end the case. They contend that it was marred by appearances of impropriety and that letting it continue would interfere with the mayor’s reelection bid.


A judge must still approve the request.


The filing came hours after Bove convened a call with the prosecutors in the Justice Department’s public integrity section — which handles corruption cases — and gave them an hour to pick two people to sign onto the motion to dismiss, saying those who did so could be promoted, according to a person familiar with the matter.


After prosecutors got off the call with Bove, the consensus among the group was that they would all resign. But a veteran prosecutor stepped up out of concern for the jobs of the younger people in the unit, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the private meeting.


The three-page dismissal motion bore Bove's signature and the names of Edward Sullivan, the public integrity section’s senior litigation counsel, and Antoinette Bacon, a supervisory official in the department’s criminal division. No one from the federal prosecutor’s office in Manhattan, which brought the Adams case, signed the document.




The move came five days into a showdown between Justice Department leadership in Washington and its Manhattan office, which has long prided itself on its independence as it has taken on Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international terrorism. At least seven prosecutors in Manhattan and Washington quit rather than carry out Bove’s directive to halt the case, including interim Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon and the acting chief of the public integrity section in Washington.


The Justice Department said in its motion to Judge Dale E. Ho that it was seeking to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later. Ho had yet to act on the request as of Friday evening.


“I imagine the judge is going to want to explore what his role is under the rules,” said Joshua Naftalis, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor who is not involved in Adams’ case. “I would expect the court to either ask the parties to come in person to court or to file papers, or both.”


Bove said earlier this week that U.S. President Donald Trump’s permanent, appointed Manhattan U.S. attorney, who has yet to be confirmed by the Senate, can decide whether to refile the charges after the November election.


Adams faces a Democratic primary in June, with several challengers lined up. His trial had been on track to be held in the spring. Bove said that continuing the prosecution would interfere with Adams’ ability to govern, posing “unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies," the dismissal motion said.


Among other things, it said, the case caused Adams to be denied access to sensitive information necessary to help protect the city.


Adams pleaded not guilty in September to charges he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor. Although critical in the past, Adams has bonded at times with Trump recently and visited him at his Florida golf club last month.


The president has criticized the case against Adams and said he was open to giving the mayor, who was a registered Republican in the 1990s, a pardon.


Bove sent a memo Monday directing Sassoon, a Republican, to drop the case. He argued the mayor was needed in Trump’s immigration crackdown and echoed Adams’ claims that the case was retaliation for his criticism of Biden administration immigration policies.


Instead of complying, Sassoon resigned Thursday, along with five high-ranking Justice Department officials in Washington. A day earlier, she sent a letter to Trump’s new attorney general, Pam Bondi, asking her to meet and reconsider the directive to drop the case.




Sassoon suggested in her letter that Ho “appears likely to conduct a searching inquiry" as to why the case should be dismissed. She noted that in at least one instance, a judge has rejected such a request as contrary to the public interest.


“A rigorous inquiry here would be consistent with precedent and practice in this and other districts," she wrote.


Seven former Manhattan U.S. attorneys, including James Comey, Geoffrey S. Berman and Mary Jo White, issued a statement lauding Sassoon’s “commitment to integrity and the rule of law."


On Friday, Hagan Scotten, an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan who worked for Sassoon and had a leading role in Adams' case, became the seventh prosecutor to resign — and blasted Bove in the process. Scotten wrote in a resignation letter to Bove that it would take a “fool” or a “coward” to meet his demand to drop the charges, "But it was never going to be me.” He told Bove he was “entirely in agreement” with Sassoon’s decision.


Scotten and other Adams case prosecutors were suspended with pay on Thursday by Bove, who launched a probe of the prosecutors that he said would determine whether they kept their jobs.


Scotten is an Army veteran who earned two Bronze medals serving in Iraq as a Special Forces troop commander. He graduated from Harvard Law School at the top of his class in 2010 and clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts.


In her letter to Bondi, Sassoon accused Adams’ lawyers of offering what amounted to a “quid pro quo” — his help on immigration in exchange for dropping the case — when they met with Justice Department officials in Washington last month. Adams' lawyer Alex Spiro said Thursday that the allegation of a quid pro quo was a “total lie."


“We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did," Spiro said in an email to reporters.




On Friday, Adams added: “I never offered — nor did anyone offer on my behalf — any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never.”


Scotten seconded Sassoon’s objections in his letter, writing: “No system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives."


The prosecutor, who appeared in court for various hearings in the case, said he was following “a tradition in public service of resigning in a last-ditch effort to head off a serious mistake." He said he could see how a president such as Trump, with a background in business and politics, “might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good, if distasteful, deal.” But he said any prosecutor “would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using the prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials, in this way.”

## No need for one country to control chip industry, Taiwan official says

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI, TAIWAN — There is no need for one country to control the semiconductor industry, which is complex and needs a division of labor, Taiwan's top technology official said on Saturday after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the island's chip dominance.


Trump repeated claims on Thursday that Taiwan had taken the industry and he wanted it back in the United States, saying he aimed to restore U.S. chip manufacturing.


Wu Cheng-wen, head of Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council, did not name Trump in a Facebook post but referred to Taiwan President Lai Ching-te's comments on Friday that the island would be a reliable partner in the democratic supply chain of the global semiconductor industry.


Wu wrote that Taiwan has in recent years often been asked how its semiconductor industry had become an internationally acclaimed benchmark.


"How did we achieve this? Obviously, we did not gain this for no reason from other countries," he said, recounting how the government developed the sector from the 1970s, including helping found TSMC, now the world's largest contract chipmaker, in 1987.


"This shows that Taiwan has invested half a century of hard work to achieve today's success, and it certainly wasn't something taken easily from other countries."


Each country has its own specialty for chips, from Japan making chemicals and equipment to the United States, which is "second to none" on the design and application of innovative systems, Wu said.


"The semiconductor industry is highly complex and requires precise specialization and division of labor. Given that each country has its own unique industrial strengths, there is no need for a single nation to fully control or monopolize all technologies globally."


Taiwan is willing to be used as a base to assist "friendly democratic countries" in playing their appropriate roles in the semiconductor supply chain, Wu said.

## Ukraine would have ‘low chance to survive’ without US support, Zelenskyy says

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

Ukraine would have a "very, very difficult" time surviving without U.S. military support to fend off Russia’s invasion, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a interview broadcast the night before he is scheduled to address the Munich Security Conference.


"Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, you know in all the difficult situations, you have a chance," he told NBC News. "But we will have low chance -- low chance to survive without support of the United States."


Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine has increased its war production but not enough to make up for what it would lose if it did not have U.S. backing.


Zelenskyy on Feb. 14 took part in a day of meetings and news briefings at the Munich Security Conference as efforts to seek a resolution to the war ramp up. The Ukrainian president is scheduled to deliver a speech on diplomacy and prospects for Ukraine's future at the conference on Feb. 15.


He will take the spotlight after meeting with top U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, who stressed the need for a "durable, lasting peace" in Ukraine in his speech to the conference on Feb. 14. Zelenskyy told Vance that Ukraine wants "security guarantees" from Washington before any negotiations with Russia on ending almost three years of war.


Zelenskyy said in the interview that he doesn’t want to think about Ukraine not being a strategic partner of the United States because it would damage Ukrainian morale, but added, "We have to think about it."


The United States has sent mixed signals on its strategy, sparking worry in Kyiv that Ukraine could be forced into a bad deal that leaves Putin emboldened.


U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO defense ministers earlier this week that it's "unrealistic" to expect Ukraine's borders to return to their pre-2014 positions and said NATO membership is not seen by the White House as part of the solution to the conflict.


Ukraine demands Russia withdraw from captured territory and says it must receive NATO membership or equivalent security guarantees to prevent Moscow from attacking again.


Speaking in Warsaw on Feb. 14, he again warned that America's European NATO partners would have to do far more for their own defense and to secure a future Ukraine peace.


Hegseth also argued that you "don't have to trust" President Vladimir Putin to negotiate with Russia.


Two days earlier U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a "lengthy and highly productive" phone call with Putin and said they agreed that their teams should begin negotiations immediately.


Zelenskyy responded by saying he wouldn't accept any deals made without Ukraine's involvement.


Asked in the interview if he believed that Ukraine would be vulnerable in another few years if a cease-fire were reached, Zelenskyy said: "Yes, I think this can be."


He said Putin wanted to come to the negotiating table not to end the war but to get a cease-fire deal to lift some sanctions on Russia and allow Moscow's military to regroup.


"This is really what he wants. He wants pause, prepare, train, take off some sanctions, because of ceasefire," Zelenskyy said.


Vance, who is representing Trump at the high-profile gathering of world leaders and foreign policy experts, said the United States wants "the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple years down the road."


There have been a number of "good conversations" with Ukraine, and more would follow "in the days, weeks and months to come," Vance said.


Zelenskyy agreed, calling the meeting with Vance "a good conversation" and said Kyiv wants to work toward ending Russia's war in Ukraine, but added that "we need real security guarantees."


Some information for this report came from NBC News.

## Why is Trump pausing US anti-bribery law?

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

washington — U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order this week pausing almost all enforcement of a decades-old U.S. anti-bribery law.


The law, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, makes it illegal for both U.S. firms and foreign companies with a U.S. connection to bribe foreign officials.


Transparency advocates have credited the U.S. Justice Department's vigorous enforcement of the law over the past two decades with curbing foreign corruption. Critics, including business leaders, however, have long complained that the law puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage in international markets where certain business practices are common.


Trump, a longtime critic of the FCPA, voiced those concerns during the Oval Office signing ceremony on Monday.


"It sounds good on paper, but in practicality it's a disaster," Trump said. "It means that if an American goes to a foreign country and starts doing business there legally, legitimately or otherwise, it's almost a guaranteed investigation, indictment, and nobody wants to do business with the Americans because of it."


Here is a breakdown of the law and the implications of the executive order for foreign bribery and U.S. business.


What is the FCPA?


The FCPA is a U.S. law that prohibits companies from providing cash payments or valuable gifts to foreign officials for business advantages. While the law exempts certain "facilitation payments," it prohibits the use of third parties to make bribes.


The FCPA was enacted in 1977 following post-Watergate investigations that revealed widespread foreign bribery by U.S.-based multinational corporations. Congress, concerned about the impact on U.S. foreign policy and international standing, responded by criminalizing such practices, imposing prison terms and substantial penalties on violators.


Though initially focused on American companies, the law's jurisdiction has expanded substantially. It now extends to any foreign business or individual with connections to the U.S. This broad reach enables prosecutors to pursue cases against foreign firms — for example, a Dutch company with a subsidiary based in Ohio accused of paying off Chinese officials through another subsidiary in Thailand.


The law has had a significant impact on the development of anti-corruption laws around the world. In 1997, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development used the FCPA as a model for its Anti-Bribery Convention, which now has 46 member countries.


While enforcement of FCPA was negligible in the decades following its enactment, the early 2000s marked a significant shift. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the two agencies responsible for enforcing FCPA’s provisions, ramped up enforcement, driven in part by emerging business scandals and new congressional requirements for corporate governance and financial reporting.


How has the law been used in recent years?


In recent years, U.S. foreign bribery law enforcement has been robust, with the Justice Department and the SEC opening nearly 174 investigations between 2018 and 2021. Last year, the Justice Department alone filed 17 enforcement actions under the law.


Latin America has emerged as a particular hot spot for U.S. investigators in recent years.


In 2016, two Brazilian companies agreed to pay a combined $3.5 billion after pleading guilty in a sprawling international foreign bribery case. U.S. authorities investigated the case in part because the illicit payments were made through U.S. bank accounts. 




In 2020, Airbus SE, the European aircraft maker, agreed to pay nearly $4 billion to resolve foreign bribery charges brought in the U.S., Britain and France. Airbus admitted using intermediaries to bribe government officials and airline executives to win lucrative contracts in China and other countries. 


In January 2024, SAP SE, a German software company with offices in the U.S., agreed to pay $220 million to resolve investigations into bribery payments to South African and Indonesia officials.


In December, AAR Corp., an Illinois-based aviation services company, agreed to pay more than $55 million to resolve investigations into bribery payments to government officials in Nepal and South Africa.


Several cases have involved India. In November, prosecutors charged three former employees of a Canadian institutional investor in connection with a bribery scheme involving Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and two other executives.


Why is Trump pausing FCPA enforcement?


Trump, a real estate tycoon-turned-president, has been a vocal critic of the law since well before his first term. In 2012, he called it a "horrible" and "ridiculous" statute that impeded U.S. companies’ ability to do business abroad.


Despite his criticism, FCPA enforcement actually surged during his first term in office, with 2000 marking a record-breaking year, according to the Morrison Foerster law firm.


The executive order frames the pause in enforcement as part of the president's broader agenda to "advance American economic and national security by eliminating excessive barriers to American commerce abroad."


The order says the FCPA's scope has been "stretched beyond proper bounds and abused in a manner that harms the interests of the United States." A White House fact sheet on the order released Monday says the "overenforcement" of the law harms U.S. companies and "infringes on the President's Article II authority to conduct foreign affairs."


This concern about aggressive enforcement isn't new, said Mike Koehler, a law professor and leading authority on the FCPA, who noted that both Republicans and Democrats have raised similar issues over the past two decades.


"There has been a focus on the quantity of enforcement actions compared to the quality of those enforcement actions," Koehler told VOA. "Enforcement has in many cases has gone so far off the rails that this law is being enforced in ways that do put companies at a competitive disadvantage."


Transparency advocates, however, warn that suspending enforcement could deal a significant blow to global anti-bribery efforts.


"This pause will work to the advantage of unscrupulous business actors around the world who until now feared U.S. criminal pursuits," Transparency International said in a statement calling on other OECD Anti-Bribery Convention members to increase their enforcement following the U.S. shift in policy.


What are the implications for investigating foreign bribery?


The executive order imposes a six-month freeze on foreign bribery investigations by the Justice Department. Almost all FCPA cases will be suspended while Attorney General Pam Bondi conducts a review and revises enforcement guidelines. The executive order gives Bondi discretion to extend the pause for an additional six months.


Bondi, however, has directed federal prosecutors to prioritize FCPA cases involving cartels and transnational criminal organizations.


And corporate lawyers were quick to caution clients that the executive order doesn't give them free rein.


"Bribery is still illegal," attorneys at the Arnold & Porter law firm wrote in an analysis of the executive order. "The FCPA remains on the books; Congress has not repealed it. And many other state, federal and foreign laws still prohibit bribery."

## Goodyear Blimp at 100: 'Floating piece of Americana' still thrives

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA — Flying a few hundred feet above the streets and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd.  


Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie.  


For some, it's nostalgic. For others, it's a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon. 


At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday — roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually — to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour.  


Even though remote camera technologies — drones, mostly — are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. 


At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2½-mile super speedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event.  


"It's great to show the pack racing," Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday's race. 




 The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform.  


It's been at every Daytona 500 since 1962. During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.  


Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn't much different than traveling on a small plane.  


The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph — well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track. 


"It's an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana," blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. "There's nothing like it in the world."


 




The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear.  


Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp's street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled "It Was A Good Day."  


But not just anyone can climb aboard.  


Rides are invitation only, even though phones at blimp headquarters — the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio — ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride.  


As part of the blimp's 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride.  


The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear's airship hangars. It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt. The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean.  


The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps. 


Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania.  


But will the blimp survive another 100 years? Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers.  


But given the blimp's longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come.


"Despite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp," Kervern said. "It's just an iconic symbol for our nation."

## With doors closed to the US, asylum-seekers turn a new life in Mexico

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

MEXICO CITY — When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico as she fled Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the United States.


But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month, the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans.


She decided she would seek protection in Mexico.


"Like almost all Cubans, our objective was to go to the United States," she said. "It wasn't in our plans to stay, but now we have to face reality."


Amid a clampdown on asylum under Trump and tightening restrictions in recent years under the Biden administration, Delgado is among a growing number of migrants from across the world to ditch — or at least pause — their ambitions of reaching the U.S., and focus instead on building a life in Mexico.


Migrants trying to apply for asylum in Mexico in January more than tripled compared to the monthly average from the previous year, according to an international official with knowledge of the numbers who was not authorized to discuss them publicly. Mexico's refugee agency has not yet published figures for January.


"All of these policies Trump is pushing are leading more people to seek international protection in Mexico," said Andrés Ramírez, former director of the Mexican Commission for Refugee Aid, which processes asylum cases.


Delgado was among hundreds of migrants from Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti, Afghanistan and other countries gathering outside the refugee agency in Mexico City after Trump unleashed executive orders last month meant to slash access to asylum and militarize the border.


The Associated Press spoke to around a half-dozen people who had asylum appointments in the U.S. through the Biden-era app, CBP One, that Trump canceled on Inauguration Day. They were left stranded on the Mexican side of the border, their dreams of a legal pathway into the U.S. snuffed.


Many more said they now intended to seek asylum in Mexico, citing increasingly harsh restrictions in recent years in the U.S. or what they said was anti-immigrant sentiment there.


"Now, it's the Mexican dream," said a Mexican man helping Haitian friends try to get an appointment this month to apply for asylum in Mexico following the Trump executive orders.




Delgado, her partner and many others had put their hopes on pathways opened by the Biden administration to legally seek asylum in the U.S. They said they had no intention of hiring a smuggler to enter the U.S. illegally.


They said the risks of returning to Cuba were too great following a government clampdown on protests in recent years.


"Crossing illegally isn't an option for us. We'd rather stay here" in Mexico, Delgado said, adding that if they crossed illegally into the U.S. and were caught "they'll deport us and they'll send us back to Cuba."


Delgado, who is an architect, and her partner, a doctor, aren't able to work in their fields in Mexico because their training in Cuba is not recognized there, she said. So for now she's washing dishes in a market.


Mexico has long opened its doors to refugees and exiles, but asylum applications have soared in recent years, growing from 1,295 in 2013 to a record 140,982 in 2023.


That number dipped to 78,975 in 2024, as the CBP One app allowed migrants in southern Mexico to apply for appointments for entry into the U.S. before heading to the northern border.


The rise in petitions for asylum in Mexico may not result in an immediate uptick in refugees there as only a couple hundred applications can be processed each day, fueling criticism about Mexico's capacity to take on the burgeoning asylum demand.


Amid criticisms over the backlog, President Claudia Sheinbaum has sharply boosted funding for Mexican agencies handling migration and asylum.


Venezuelan asylum-seeker Harry Luzardo, 37, said life in Mexico is an improvement after scrambling for years to scrape by in Ecuador and Chile.


Ecuador, Chile, Peru and Colombia were once the epicenter of the exodus of 8 million people from Venezuela, fleeing spiraling economic and political crises.


But with little international aid and an array of their own economic and security crises, Chile was among countries that began closing their doors to migrants.


"In Chile, you don't receive any kind of support," Luzardo said, waiting patiently in line earlier this month to make an asylum petition request in Mexico City. "In Chile, there's nothing for migrants."


Luzardo left Venezuela four years ago, but unable to get legal status to stay and work in Chile, he decided he'd try his luck at reuniting with family in the U.S.


Now, with that door closed, Mexico is his plan B.


"For now, I feel good here," he said. Still, he conceded, he'd rather be in the U.S.

## Southern California slammed with debris flows, mudslides

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

After days of heavy rain, the strongest storm of the year brought dangerous debris flows and rock- and mudslides across Southern California on Friday, including in several areas that last month were ablaze with devastating fires.


Some areas in the region received as much as 12 centimeters of rain this week, the National Weather Service said.


"There are plenty of reports of debris flow," meteorologist Scott Kleebauer of the weather service said Friday.


The scorched earth left behind by the fires is now particularly vulnerable to the water-fueled rock- and mudslides, as the vegetation that once anchored the soil was burned away.


While this week’s rain is beginning to ease, that does not mean the slides will stop. The drenched soil can continue to move even after the rain subsides.


Parts of the iconic Pacific Coast Highway were shut down Thursday because of flooding and mudslides.


In Pacific Palisades, a highway intersection was under a meter of sludge.


Photographs posted on social media showed parked cars in Pacific Palisades covered in mud up to their windows. Bulldozers have been assigned to the area to clean up the muck.


In one harrowing experience Thursday, a member of the Los Angeles Fire Department was driving along the Pacific Coast Highway when a debris flow swept his vehicle into the ocean. Erik Scott, a spokesperson for the fire department, said the driver was able to get out of his vehicle and reportedly suffered only minor injuries.


In Sierra Madre, a city of 10,000 that was the site of last month’s Eaton Fire, a boulder-strewn mudslide damaged several homes.


“It happened very quickly but it was very loud, and you could even hear the ground or feel the ground shaking,” Bull Duvall, who has lived in Sierra Madre for 28 years, told The Associated Press. City officials issued an evacuation order warning residents that emergency responders would not enter locations with active mud and debris flows.


The National Weather Service confirmed Friday that a weak tornado hit a mobile home community Thursday in Oxnard, California. There were no reports of deaths or injuries at Country Club Mobile Estates, but property damage included ripped roofs and downed power lines.


The rain was badly needed in the region, much of which is still suffering from drought.


In nearby Nevada, Las Vegas was glad to see rain Thursday, after enduring more than 200 days without precipitation. A National Weather Service Las Vegas post said, “Las Vegas has officially measured 0.01 inch of rainfall this morning, effectively ending our dry streak of 214 days without measurable rain.”

## US deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

PANAMA CITY, PANAMA — Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from other nations as the Trump administration takes Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the Central American nation's president said Thursday. 


"Yesterday a flight from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse nationalities of the world," President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday in his weekly press briefing. He said there were migrants from China, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries, aboard. 


The president said it was the first of three planned flights that were expected to total about 360 people. "It's not something massive," he said. 


The migrants were expected to be moved to a shelter in Panama's Darien region before being returned to their countries, Mulino said. 


Asked later Thursday why Panama was acting as a stopover for these deportations, Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Ruiz Hernandez said that it was something the U.S. government had requested. He also said the U.S. government was paying for the repatriations through U.N. immigration agencies. 


The migrants who arrived Wednesday had been detained after crossing the U.S. border and did not have criminal records, he said. 


Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in Panama. While U.S. President Donald Trump's demands to retake control of the Panama Canal dominated the visit, Mulino also discussed Panama's efforts to slow migration through the Darien Gap and he offered Panama as a bridge to send U.S. deportees back to their countries. 


Rubio secured agreements on the trip with Guatemala and El Salvador as well, to accept migrants from other nations in what was seen as the laying groundwork for expanding U.S. capacity to speedily deport migrants. 


Migration through the Darien Gap connecting Panama and Colombia was down about 90% in January compared to the same month a year earlier. 


Since Mulino entered office last year, Panama has made dozens of deportation flights, most funded by the U.S. government. 


Ruiz said Thursday that Panama "has been completely willing to participate and cooperate in this request they have made of us."

## A gulf between the White House and the press

## Ukraine, US weigh critical minerals agreement

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

Ukraine’s vast reserves of critical minerals give it the potential to be a strategic supplier for the West. President Donald Trump is considering a deal that would continue U.S. support for Ukraine in the war against Russia in exchange for access to its minerals. That proposed agreement is set for discussion at the Munich Security Conference. Myroslava Gongadze has the story from Warsaw, with reporting from Anna Chernikova in Kyiv.

## Helicopter crew might not have heard tower's instructions before crash, say investigators

date: 2025-02-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The crew of the Army helicopter that collided in midair with an American Airlines jet near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and also may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers to move behind the plane, investigators said Friday.


National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters that the recording from the Black Hawk helicopter cockpit suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew without an understanding of how it should shift position just before the January 29 crash, in which all 67 aboard the two aircraft were killed.


"That transmission was interrupted — it was stepped on," she said, leaving them unable to hear the words "pass behind the" because the helicopter's microphone key was pressed at the same moment.


The helicopter pilots also may have missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was shifting to a different runway, she said.


Homendy said the helicopter was on a check flight that night where the pilot was undergoing an annual test and a test on using night vision goggles. Investigators believe the crew was wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight.


It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report on the collision, and Homendy warned reporters that many issues were still being investigated.


"We're only a couple weeks out" from the crash, she said. "We have a lot of work to do."


The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.


William Waldock, professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said stepped-on transmissions — where a pressed microphone key blocks incoming communication — is a well-known problem in aviation.


"It's an old story and it's one of the problems oftentimes with radio communications," he said.


The collision likely occurred at an altitude of about 325 feet, investigators have said, which would put the Black Hawk above its 200-foot limit for that location.


Cockpit conversations a few minutes before the crash indicated conflicting altitude data, Homendy said, with the helicopter's pilot calling out that they were then at 300 feet, but the instructor pilot saying it was 400 feet, Homendy said.


"We are looking at the possibility there may be bad data," she said.


That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters – one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter's black box captures its radio altitude.


The radio altitude at the time of the impact put the Black Hawk at 278 feet, Homendy said.


"But I want to caution, that does not mean that's what the Black Hawk crew was seeing on the barometric altimeters in the cockpit," she said.


Waldock said the helicopter pilots, with their night vision goggles interfering with their peripheral vision, may have wrongly focused on a plane that took off just before the collision.


"If they did indeed lock onto that departing airplane and assume that's the traffic they were supposed to be avoiding, they didn't see the other airplane coming," he said.


The Army has said the Black Hawk crew was highly experienced and accustomed to the crowded skies around the nation's capital.

## New York City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail

date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal immigration officials to operate at the city's Rikers Island jail following a meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump's border czar.


Adams said he will issue an executive order reestablishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the nation's largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under prior administrations.


The Democrat said ICE agents would be focused on assisting the corrections department's intelligence bureau in criminal investigations, particularly those focused on violent criminals and gangs.


"As I have always said, immigrants have been crucial in building our city and will continue to be key to our future success, but we must fix our long-broken immigration system," Adams said in a statement. "That is why I have been clear that I want to work with the new federal administration, not war with them, to find common ground and make better the lives of New Yorkers."


Opponents dismissed the move as a "needless concession" and "legally dubious."


"ICE's presence on Rikers serves no legitimate purpose and opens the door to unlawful collusion between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials in violation of our city's well-established sanctuary protections," Zach Ahmad, senior policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said.


Trump's border czar, Thomas Homan, argued that having an ICE presence at local jails is crucial to removing violent criminals who have entered the country illegally.


"For the naysayers, the city council who wants nothing to do with ICE, they need to understand: If we arrest the bad guy at Rikers Island, then the alien's safe, the officer's safe, the community's safe," he said in an interview with NewsMax after the meeting.


Troubled relationship


Homan met with Adams at a federal office building in Manhattan as the Republican administration pushes for more help detaining and deporting people accused of crimes.


ICE has long had a contentious relationship with New York, which has rules and laws limiting police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.


Immigration officials, for example, aren't able to request that city jails hold people wanted for civil immigration law violations past when they would ordinarily be released from custody, under city policy.


New York City also has passed measures that curtail ICE's access to public schools and other city properties.


Adams, who faces a Democratic primary in June, has said he favors loosening these so-called sanctuary policies, but he doesn't have the broad power to do so as mayor.


Adams said he talked with Homan about ways to embed more New York police detectives into federal task forces focused on violent gangs and criminal activity, as well as allowing ICE agents to participate in regular meetings with law enforcement agencies in the city.


"We walked away with some real tangible things we can do together, and I'm looking forward to aligning with him and other federal partners to remove dangerous people from our streets," he said in a radio show interview after the meeting.


Mayor under pressure


The Democrat is under unique pressure to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.


On Monday, the U.S. Justice Department ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan to dismiss corruption charges against Adams so he could focus on assisting the president's immigration agenda.


As of Thursday, the criminal charges remained in place. If the case is ultimately dropped, the Justice Department says it will conduct a review after the November mayoral election to assess whether it should be reinstated.


Immigration advocates worry Adams might feel pressure from the Trump administration to disregard or rescind some of the city's sanctuary protections, which come from a patchwork of state and city laws and mayoral executive orders, some stretching back decades.


Adams has already ordered city officials to lawfully cooperate with Trump's agenda around immigration and other issues, though the administration's instructions have sparked confusion among some city workers and contractors.


Adams confirmed later that he also discussed with Homan restoring more than $80 million meant to defray the city's costs for sheltering homeless migrants that the Federal Emergency Management Agency unexpectedly clawed back Wednesday.


"I'm not happy about losing $80 million, and we had a conversation on that," he said during a local television interview.


The Adams administration has leased several hotels and vacant buildings and repurposed them as migrant shelters as the city has tried to house an estimated 230,000 people who have arrived from the U.S. southern border in recent years.


Adams reflects on challenges


In a local radio interview after the meeting, Adams also reflected on the week's turn of events with a mix of relief and defiance.


"I did nothing wrong. No American should endure what I had to endure," he said on WABC, referring to the "humiliation and embarrassment" of the monthslong federal corruption probe.


As he gears up for a bruising primary fight, Adams said he wants New Yorkers to see his resiliency.


"We've all gone through some hard times," he said. "No matter what you're going through, have faith in yourself, faith in God, faith in your family, faith in your country, and you will navigate through it."

## HHS to lose thousands of workers under probationary job cuts

date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday under the Trump administration’s move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting.


In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some probationary staff with specialized skills might be spared. Probationary staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon, according to audio shared with The Associated Press.


Among those being cut are nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — roughly one-tenth of the agency's workforce.


The Atlanta-based agency's leadership was notified of the decision Friday morning. The verbal notice came from HHS officials in a meeting with CDC leaders, according to a federal official who was at the meeting. The official was not authorized to discuss it and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.


Some portion of the affected employees are supposed to receive four weeks paid administrative leave, according to the federal official and the recording.




HHS officials did not answer questions about the specifics of the layoffs. In an emailed statement, Andrew Nixon, the department's director of communications, wrote: “HHS is following the Administration’s guidance and taking action to support the President’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard."


HHS employs more than 80,000 people and runs 13 supporting agencies. Besides the CDC, they include the NIH and the Food and Drug Administration. The department also provides health coverage for nearly half the country through Medicare and Medicaid.


Its staff includes scientists, researchers, doctors and other officials. It oversees research of vaccines, diseases and cures. It regulates the medications found in medicine cabinets and inspects the foods that end up in cupboards.


With a $9.2 billion core budget, the CDC is charged with protecting Americans from outbreaks and other public health threats. Before the cuts, the agency had about 13,000 employees, including more than 2,000 staffers working in other countries.


Historically CDC has been seen as a global leader on disease control and a reliable source of health information, boasting some of the top experts in the world. The staff is heavy with scientists — 60% have master’s degrees or doctorates.


Those being fired included all first-year officers — about 50 in total — in the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service, according to two agency employees who communicated with some of the affected staffers. The two spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.


The EIS, as it is known, was established in 1951 to recruit young doctors and researchers to join the agency for two-year stints as disease investigators. The laid-off first-year officers represent a little less than half the service's current staff.


EIS officers often are sent to different states and countries to become primary investigators of outbreaks and emerging health dangers. Many EIS graduates have gone on to leadership jobs at the CDC and at other public health organizations.


It’s not only new employees who are subject to probation. Probationary periods also are applied to veteran staffers who, for example, were recently promoted to a new job in management.


The layoffs are part of a broad effort by President Donald Trump and billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk to reduce the number of workers across the entire federal government. The job cuts also came one day after Robert F. Kennedy was sworn in to oversee HHS.


Dr. Joshua Barocas, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said many of the probationary-status CDC employees are filling vital roles.


“It’s essentially assuming that they are not in a job that is crucial for the success of keeping everyone safe — just because they’ve been there for less than a year or less than six months,” said Barocas, speaking Friday morning during an Infectious Diseases Society of America call with reporters.


In a Thursday interview on Fox News, Kennedy was asked if half the HHS staff would be losing their jobs.


“I don’t know anything about 50% of people being cut,” Kennedy said. “I would be surprised if there were 50% cuts.”


He added: “If you’ve been involved in good science, you have nothing to worry about. If you care about public health, you have nothing to worry about. If you’re in there working for the pharmaceutical industry, I’d say you should move out and work for the pharmaceutical industry.”

## Up to 2,000 workers laid off at US Department of Energy, sources say

date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has laid off about 1,200 to 2,000 workers at the Department of Energy, including employees at a power grid office, the nuclear security administration and the loans office, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.


Democratic lawmakers also said the layoffs include workers at national labs, hydroelectric plants and Cold War legacy nuclear sites that pose safety risks. The DOE has about 14,000 federal employees and 95,000 contractors.


The layoffs of probationary workers come after three people representing billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at the agency last week.


Some 325 workers have been let go from the department's National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the U.S. nuclear weapons fleet and works to secure radiological materials around the world, two of the sources said.


But those layoffs at NNSA have been "partly rescinded" to retain essential nuclear security workers, one of the sources said. It was unclear how many of the 325 firings were rescinded.


The DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


"It's been chaotic for the staff," one source at NNSA said. "We just want to focus on national security stuff, and this has distracted us from our work."


The losses at the NNSA occur at a time when nuclear power plants have been at risk in Russia's war on Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, the largest in Europe.


The NNSA is still working to secure radiological materials in the region, one source said.


'Not … in the public interest' 


A copy of a letter seen by Reuters and sent to some DOE employees says: "DOE finds that your further employment would not be in the public interest. For this reason, you are being removed from your position with DOE and the federal civil service effective today."


The department withdrew laid off workers' access to government-issued laptops and phones just after midnight Eastern Standard Time on Friday, which left many with no way to receive the notifications and no knowledge they had been fired, one source said.


Some 45 workers were let go from the Loan Programs Office, which has hundreds of billions of dollars in loan authority for clean energy, nuclear and clean vehicle projects, one source said. Another seven laid off in the Office of General Counsel had been supporting work in clean energy demonstration projects.


In addition, 18 of 148 people were let go at the Grid Deployment Office, which seeks to modernize the power grid, making it resilient to extreme weather and able to transmit power from clean energy and fossil fuel-fired power plants.


In Washington state, at least a dozen workers at the Hanford nuclear site — a 1940s site for plutonium and uranium production for atomic bombs, now decommissioned but highly contaminated — were laid off, including safety engineers who clean up and monitor the site, according to Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington.


"These reckless firings will slow down critical cleanup work and make workers less safe. Trying to run Hanford with a skeleton crew is a recipe for disaster that could have irreversible impacts," she said. "These layoffs will hurt companies, workers and their families across Eastern Washington."


Murray said there were layoffs at other DOE-run facilities in the Pacific Northwest, including the Bonneville Power Administration hydroelectric facility and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which carries out research on everything from nuclear energy to battery storage.


Murray's office reported layoffs of more than 600 electricians, scientists and cybersecurity experts at BPA.

## At Munich conference, Vance warns European allies of ‘threat from within’

date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Vice President JD Vance warned European allies attending the security conference in Munich, Germany, against “the threat from within,” arguing that European governments are exercising extreme censorship and have failed to adequately get a handle on “out-of-control migration.”


“The threat that I worry the most about vis a vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor,” he said Friday. “What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.”


Vance denounced Romania, a NATO ally, for its recent cancellation of presidential election results over evidence of Russian disinformation.


“If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn’t very strong to begin with,” he said. “I’d ask my European friends to have some perspective.”


He also appeared to voice support for right-wing anti-immigration parties that have been banned from joining governments in Europe, including the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party.


“Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for firewalls,” he said, referring to Berlin’s “firewall” effort against extremism in a country still haunted by the role of the Nazi party in the past.


Vance met with AfD leader Alice Weidel on Friday, according to an official in the vice president’s office.




Vance said of all the pressing challenges facing Europe and the U.S. “there is nothing more pressing than migration.”


He blamed the “series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent and others across the world,” and he highlighted the Thursday attack in Munich where an Afghan national drove a car into a crowd, injuring at least 30 people.




The remarks came as a surprise to the audience of leaders and top officials who were expecting Vance to focus on Ukraine and Russia. The vice president only made a passing remark on the issue.


The Trump administration is “very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine,” Vance said. “And we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense.”


Following Vance’s speech, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius rejected Vance’s characterization of European policies.


“If I understand him correctly, he is comparing conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regions ... that is not acceptable.”




Vance’s remarks are “an effort to flip the script,” on Europe’s concerns about American democracy, said Kristine Berzina, managing director of GMF Geostrategy North.


“There was shockingly no mention of NATO, no discussion of Ukraine. Instead, it was the presentation of a right-wing vision of democracy days before the German election,” she told VOA.


In his meeting with Vance on the sidelines of the conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more discussion is needed “to prepare the plan [on] how to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and finish the war.”




“Really, we want peace very much, but we need real security guarantees,” he said.


Speaking to reporters upon his arrival in Munich, Zelenskyy said his priority is to speak with U.S. and European officials before engaging with the Russians. Moscow has said it is not sending a delegation to the conference.


Ukraine said its delegation will present its position on ending the war. Zelenskyy said that if Trump could bring him and Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer to swap Ukrainian-occupied territory in Russia for Russian-held land in Ukraine.


Peace talks with Russia 


Speaking to reporters from the White House on Friday, President Donald Trump said Vance’s speech was “very brilliant,” and warned Europe “to be careful.”


On Wednesday he spoke with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine, which will mark its three-year anniversary on Feb. 24. Trump said he and the Russian president have “agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately” to end the war.


Trump told White House reporters Thursday that Kyiv’s NATO membership bid is “impractical” and its desire to win back Russian-occupied territories “illusionary.”


His comments mirror remarks made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who said Wednesday at NATO headquarters that it was unrealistic for Ukraine to join NATO — something Zelenskyy argues is central to protecting Ukraine in the long-term, but that Putin has long opposed. Hegseth also called Ukraine's desire to regain territory that it lost to Russia an "unrealistic objective."




Additionally, Trump said it was a mistake to kick Moscow out of the Group of Seven of industrialized democracies, then known as the G8, following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014.


"I'd love to have them back,” Trump said, adding that he and Putin “agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s nations” and added that they would “probably” meet in Saudi Arabia soon.


Russian politicians have welcomed the shift from former President Joe Biden’s policies that aimed to isolate Moscow.


“I am sure that in Kyiv, Brussels, Paris and London they are now reading Trump’s lengthy statement on his conversation with Putin with horror and cannot believe their eyes,” senior Russian lawmaker Alexei Pushkov wrote on his messaging app Friday.


European leaders have said they worry Washington is conceding key agenda items to Putin that would jeopardize Kyiv’s standing toward a potential settlement of the conflict.


"A failed Ukraine would weaken Europe, but it would also weaken the United States,” warned European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke before Vance in Munich.




It is unclear what the Trump administration’s ultimate strategy is to end the war — a promise the president campaigned on. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal published Friday ahead of his Munich speech, Vance said Moscow could face more sanctions and even "military tools" if it refuses to agree to a deal ensuring Ukraine's long-term independence.


Gaza and the fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas also are likely to be a focus in Munich. Trump recently said that Palestinians should leave Gaza and that the U.S. will take over the enclave — a proposition that several governments have condemned.


The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as climate change, energy security and artificial intelligence.

## Taiwan pledges chip talks and investment in bid to ease Trump’s concerns

date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI — Taiwan President Lai Ching-te pledged on Friday to talk with the United States about President Donald Trump’s concerns over the chip industry and to increase U.S. investment and buy more from the country, while also spending more on defense.


Trump spoke critically about Taiwan on Thursday, saying he aimed to restore U.S. manufacturing of semiconductor chips and repeating claims about Taiwan having taken away the industry he wanted back in the United States.


Speaking to reporters after holding a meeting of the National Security Council at the presidential office, Lai said that the global semiconductor supply chain is an ecosystem in which the division of work among various countries is important.


"We of course are aware of President Trump's concerns," Lai said.


"Taiwan's government will communicate and discuss with the semiconductor industry and come up with good strategies. Then we will come up with good proposals and engage in further discussions with the United States," he added.


Democratic countries including the United States should come together to build a global alliance for AI chips and a "democratic supply chain" for advanced chips, Lai said.


"While admittedly we have the advantage in semiconductors, we also see it as Taiwan's responsibility to contribute to the prosperity of the international community."


Taiwan is home to the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, a major supplier to companies including Apple and Nvidia, and a crucial part of the developing AI industry.




TSMC is investing $65 billion in new factories in the U.S. state of Arizona, a project begun in 2020 under Trump's first administration.


TSMC's Taipei-listed shares closed down 2.8% on Friday, underperforming the broader market, which ended off 1.1%.


A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity in order to speak more freely, said if TSMC judged it was feasible to increase its U.S. investment, Taiwan's government would help in talks with the United States.


TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


The official added that communications between Taiwan and U.S. economic, security and defense officials at present was "quite good" and "strong support from the United States can be felt".


US support 


The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but is the democratically governed island's most important international backer and arms supplier.




Trump cheered Taiwan last week after a joint U.S.-Japan statement following Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's visit to Washington called for "maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait" and voiced support for "Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations."


But Taiwan also runs a large trade surplus with the United States, which surged 83% last year, with the island's exports to the U.S. hitting a record $111.4 billion, driven by demand for high-tech products such as semiconductors.


Lai said that the United States is Taiwan's largest foreign investment destination, and that Taiwan is the United States' most reliable trade partner.


Trump has also previously criticized Taiwan, which faces a growing military threat from China, for not spending enough on defense, a criticism he has made of many U.S. allies.


"Taiwan must demonstrate our determination to defend ourselves," Lai said, adding his government is working to propose a special budget this year to boost defense spending from 2.5% of its GDP to 3%.


His government is involved in a standoff with parliament, where opposition parties hold a majority, over cuts to the budget, including defense spending.


"Certainly, more and more friends and allies have expressed concern to us, worried whether Taiwan's determination for its self-defense has weakened," Lai said.

## Russian Vinnik back in Moscow after prisoner swap, news agency says

date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA

Alexander Vinnik, a Russian national convicted of cybercrime and released by U.S. authorities as part of a prisoner swap, arrived in Moscow on Thursday and thanked President Vladimir Putin and others for arranging the exchange, state news agency RIA said.


Vinnik, who pleaded guilty in May 2024 to charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, told RIA in a dispatch issued after midnight that he was at home with his family.


He said he had flown on a U.S. plane that stopped in Poland and not in Turkey as his lawyer had said.


Quoted by RIA, Vinnik thanked Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Russian diplomats and special services, his lawyers "and especially my family."


He added: "What can I say? And I can also thank [U.S. President Donald] Trump. On the whole, without him, things would probably have been difficult."


Leonid Slutsky, head of the foreign affairs committee of Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament, told the Tass news agency that Vinnik's return home was "yet another victory for Russian diplomacy and all services and agencies associated with his liberation."


Unlike previous instances of Russians returning home after a prisoner swap, there was little fanfare around Vinnik's arrival.


Vinnik operated a cryptocurrency exchange, BTC-e, through which he was suspected of funneling $4 billion in proceeds from ransomware attacks, identity theft, drug rings and other criminal activity.


He was freed by the United States from prison in return for Moscow's release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who returned home on Tuesday.

## Trump administration lays off probationary employees, plans 'large-scale' cuts

date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA

washington — The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection — potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.


In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming.


The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly.


It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs throughout the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for "large-scale reductions in force."


Elon Musk, whom Trump has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the country to "delete entire agencies" from the federal government.


"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind," Musk said as he spoke via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. "If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back."


'Vast unraveling'


Paul Light, an expert on the federal government and professor emeritus of public service at New York University, said it seemed like the administration was "inventing new methods for destroying government capacity."


By laying people off, the government will be able to accomplish fewer things.


"It's a vast unraveling of what federal agencies do," he said.


Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, there were 220,000 workers with under a year on the job as of March 2024, the most recent data available.


The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week, and it has included workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education.


At least 39 workers were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.


The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the capital region.


Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, which offered to pay people until September 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program on Wednesday.


However, the number of workers who took the offer was lower than the administration's target, and Trump has made it clear that he would take further steps to lay people off.


Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions in the workforce, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss it.


The National Science Foundation was told to expect a 25% to 50% reduction in force within two months, while the Housing and Urban Development Department was told to plan for a 50% reduction, the person said.


Employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were also bracing Thursday for reductions in their workforce.


The order Trump signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring would be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need the approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.

## Trump takes tit-for-tat trade action with tariffs

date: 2025-02-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday took what could become his most consequential action involving international trade early in his second administration.


Trump, who signed a memorandum calling for reciprocal tariffs, told a group of reporters in the Oval Office that “if you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs.”


The goal is to bring down America’s budget deficit, estimated to be approaching $2 trillion.


The president added that the action “is fair to all. No other country can complain.”


Trump ordered Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer, his picks for commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative, respectively, to lead teams to calculate new import taxes on America’s trading partners. To assess the amounts, they are to take into consideration other countries’ tariff rates, subsidies to industry, value-added taxes — which are common in the European Union — regulations and undervaluing of currencies.


The EU value-added tax is the “poster child” for unfair trade, Peter Navarro, the president’s senior counselor for trade, told reporters on Thursday.


Modi visit


Trump put his signature on the edict just hours before welcoming Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the White House.


India is expected to be one of the countries most affected by the action. India has relatively high tariff and non-tariff barriers on numerous American exports. It has faced pressure from Washington to reduce its 100% tariff on walnuts, the 70% levy on apples and the 60% import tax on dairy products.


Other sectors include smartphones, pork and poultry, and medical devices. India reduced a 100% tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles — an iconic brand deeply embedded in the economy of the Midwestern state of Wisconsin — to 50% in 2018.


The two countries announced on Thursday an energy agreement to make the United States the primary supplier of oil and gas to India.


Trump, alongside Modi, at a Thursday evening news conference said he would pave the way for the United States to sell F-35 Stealth fighter jets to India and the two leaders would work to make tariff cuts in order to reduce America’s nearly $50 billion trade deficit with India.


“Prime Minister Modi and I agreed we would begin negotiations to address the long-standing disparities,” Trump said.


Modi said he and Trump have set a “target of more than doubling our bilateral trade to attain $500 billion by 2030. Our teams will work on concluding very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement.”


In response to a reporter’s question about the reciprocal tariffs, Trump confirmed India would also be targeted.


“Whatever India charges, we’re charging them,” he said.


Some high-ranking government officials in New Delhi have suggested finding a way to appease the U.S. president amid concern that he could negotiate a sweeping trade deal with India’s neighbor and rival, China, according to Aparna Pande, director of the Hudson Institute’s Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia.


If Trump and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, were to forge a sweeping trade pact, “India could face a double challenge — on the trade/economic front and the strategic big picture front,” Pande told VOA on Thursday.


“India is a country that Trump has railed against in the past, although I don't think it's a particular obsession of his in the way that China is, because China is a major strategic competitor to the United States. Or the way Canada and Mexico are, because they are the bordering countries,” according to Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.


Since being sworn into office on Jan. 20 for his second nonconsecutive term as president, Trump has moved quickly on the trade front. He imposed, and then put on hold amid further negotiations, across-the-board 25% tariffs on nearly all products from America’s two continental neighbors, Canada and Mexico.


He placed a flat 10% tariff on all Chinese goods, which prompted Beijing to respond with countertariffs of 10% to 15% on crude oil, liquefied natural gas, farm machinery and some other U.S. products. Economists say the tariffs cover about $450 billion worth of Chinese goods, while the Chinese tariffs hit $15 billion to $20 billion in American products.  


Trump characterized his actions as a way to pressure those three countries into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. He also has blamed Canada and Mexico for being lax in preventing migrants from crossing their borders into the U.S.


Trump earlier this week announced that effective in March, all steel and aluminum imports will be taxed at a minimum of 25%, an action analysts predict could significantly raise sticker prices at automotive dealerships in North America.


'Stagflationary shock'


Analysts say Trump’s tariff actions will hurt the growth of the U.S. economy this year. 


“Tariffs impart a modest stagflationary shock to an economy," according to a report issued Thursday by financial services provider Wells Fargo. “The U.S. economy entered 2025 with a fair amount of momentum, but we look for real GDP growth to downshift a bit over the next few quarters as the price-boosting effects of tariffs erode growth in real income, thereby weighing on growth in real consumer spending.”


Peter Harrell, who was jointly appointed to the White House National Security Council and National Economic Council in the previous administration of President Joe Biden, said Trump “promised us he would be a ‘tariff man’ and he is certainly delivering.”


“I think this is only part of the tariffs we are likely to see or at least threatened” over the coming months, Harrell said Thursday morning on “The Capital Cable,” a livestream program of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ (CSIS) Korea Chair.


These actions or the threat of them give the Trump administration leverage by having “a tariff bazooka ready to fire,” said Harrell, currently a Carnegie nonresident fellow.


On the same livestream, Philip Luck, director of the CSIS economic program, warned that Trump’s “Fortress America” will result in Americans paying “really high costs” due to retaliatory actions by Washington’s trading partners. If the president’s goal is to use such trade actions partly to increase the cash coffers, tariff revenue is approximately 1.5% of government revenue, “so it’s tiny,” Luck said.


The United States is in a dominant position as the largest economy and well-integrated into the global trading system, giving it leverage built up over an 80-year period, but Trump’s actions could squander that goodwill, Luck said.


“We’ve been a reliable partner for a long period of time,” he noted, with the United States traditionally setting tariffs through negotiations involving international groups such as the World Trade Organization. 


“There’s a lot of anxiety, bordering on panic in [South] Korea,” because Trump, immediately in his second term, is using tariffs for noneconomic reasons, said Yeo Han-Koo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics


“U.S. policymakers really need to see the strategic angle” amid the regional competition with China and how they can collaborate with Tokyo and Seoul, suggested Yeo, who as South Korea’s trade minister coinciding with Trump’s first term was at the negotiating table across from American officials.


Shipbuilding, civil nuclear power and biopharmaceuticals are three sectors where the United States, Japan and South Korea could cooperate to help counter Beijing’s rising trade and military influence, Yeo suggested.

## Federal judge pauses Trump order restricting gender-affirming care for trans youth

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

BALTIMORE — A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's recent executive order aimed at restricting gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19.


The judge's ruling came after a lawsuit was filed earlier this month on behalf of families with transgender or nonbinary children who allege their health care has been compromised by the president's order. A national group for family of LGBTQ+ people and a doctors organization are also plaintiffs in the court challenge, one of many lawsuits opposing one of the many executive orders Trump has issued.


Judge Brendan Hurson, who was nominated by former President Joe Biden, granted the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore. The ruling, in effect for 14 days, essentially puts Trump's directive on hold while the case proceeds. The restraining order could also be extended.


Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order directing federally run insurance programs to exclude coverage for gender-affirming care. That includes Medicaid, which covers such services in some states, and TRICARE for military families. Trump's order also called on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice.


The lawsuit includes several accounts from families of appointments being canceled as medical institutions react to the new directive.


Attorneys for the plaintiffs argue Trump's executive order is "unlawful and unconstitutional" because it seeks to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because it violates anti-discrimination laws while infringing on the rights of parents.


Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, the lawsuit also alleges the policy is discriminatory because it allows federal funds to cover the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition.


Some hospitals immediately paused gender-affirming care, including prescriptions for puberty blockers and hormone therapy, while they assess how the order affects them.


Trump's approach on the issue represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people. Trump has used strong language in opposing gender-affirming care, asserting falsely that "medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child's sex."


Major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support access to gender-affirming care.


Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive puberty blockers or hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors.

## Prosecutors quit after being ordered to end case against New York mayor

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan resigned Thursday after refusing a Justice Department order to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Two senior Justice Department officials also quit after the department leadership in Washington moved to seize control of the case.


Danielle Sassoon, a Republican serving as interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced her resignation in an email to her staff. The move was confirmed by a spokesperson for the office. Adams' case has yet to be dropped.


After Sassoon declined to dismiss the case, the department's public integrity section in Washington was asked to take over, according to a person familiar with the matter. Two senior officials who oversee the unit, including the acting chief, resigned in response, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.


The exits came days after a high-ranking Justice Department official directed federal prosecutors in New York to end the case against Adams, a Democrat who was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions and bribes of free or discounted travel from people who wanted to buy his influence. He has pleaded not guilty.


Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said in a memo Monday that the case should be dismissed so Adams could aid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and campaign for reelection free from facing criminal charges. The primary is four months away and Adams has multiple challengers.


Bove had directed that be done as soon as "practicable," but there have been no public statements or actions by the prosecution team. On Wednesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she would "look into" why the case had yet to be dismissed. As of Thursday afternoon, the charges remained in place.


In the email to her staff, Sassoon did not give a reason for her resignation. In the note, the contents of which were obtained by The Associated Press, she said she had just submitted her resignation to Bondi.


"As I told her, it has been my greatest honor to represent the United States and to pursue justice as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York," Sassoon wrote.


The Justice Department did not ask Sassoon to resign, according to a department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.


The department declined public comment on Sassoon's exit. A message seeking comment was left for Adams' attorney, Alex Spiro. A spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


The government's decision to end the Adams case because of political considerations, rather than the strength or weakness of the evidence, alarmed some career prosecutors who said it was a departure from long-standing norms.


The directive from Bove, a former Trump personal lawyer, was all the more remarkable because Bove had been a longtime prosecutor and supervisor in the Southern District and because department leaders are historically reluctant to intervene in cases where charges have been brought — particularly in an office as prestigious as that U.S. attorney's office.


Bove's memo also steered clear of any legal basis for the dismissal despite decades of department tradition dictating that charging decisions are to be guided by facts, evidence and the law.


Sassoon, a former clerk for the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, was not the prosecutor who brought the case against Adams last year. That was then-U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, who stepped down after Trump's election victory in November.


Sassoon had only been tapped to serve as acting U.S. attorney on January 21, the day after Trump took office.


Her role was intended to be temporary. Trump in November nominated Jay Clayton, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to the post, an appointment that must be confirmed by the Senate. That has not happened yet.


The Southern District of New York is among the largest and most prominent prosecutor's offices in the U.S., with a long track record of tackling Wall Street malfeasance, political corruption and international terrorism.


It has a tradition of independence from Washington, something that has earned it the nickname "the sovereign district."


During Trump's first term, the office prosecuted both the president's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and his strategic adviser, Steve Bannon, in separate cases. Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion and campaign finance charges. Trump ended the federal fraud case against Bannon by pardoning him, though nearly identical charges were then brought by state prosecutors.


This is the second Justice Department tussle in five years between Washington and New York officials to result in a dramatic leadership turnover.


In 2020, William Barr, who served as one of Trump's attorneys general during his first term pushed out Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, in a surprise nighttime announcement. Berman initially refused to resign his position, creating a brief standoff with Barr, but did so after an assurance that his investigations into allies of Trump would not be disturbed.


Sassoon joined the U.S. attorney's office in 2016. In 2023 she helped lead the fraud prosecution of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. More recently, she had served as the office's co-chief of criminal appeals.


Adams was indicted in September on charges that while he worked as Brooklyn borough president, he accepted over $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks such as expensive flight upgrades, luxury hotel stays and even a trip to a bathhouse.


The indictment said a Turkish official who helped facilitate the trips then leaned on Adams for favors, including asking him to lobby the Fire Department to let a newly constructed, 36-story diplomatic building open in time for a planned visit by Turkey's president.


Prosecutors said they had proof that Adams personally directed political aides to solicit foreign donations and disguise them to help the campaign qualify for a city program that provides a generous, publicly funded match for small dollar donations. Under federal law, foreign nationals are banned from contributing to U.S. election campaigns.


As recently as Jan. 6, prosecutors had indicated their investigation remained active, writing in court papers that they continued to "uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams."


Bove said in his memo that Justice Department officials in Washington hadn't evaluated the evidence in the case before deciding it should be dropped — at least until after the mayoral election in November.


Federal agents also had been investigating other senior Adams aides. It was unclear what would happen to that side of the probe.

## Trump wants denuclearization talks with Russia and China, hopes for defense spending cuts

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he wants to restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive defense budgets in half.


Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump lamented the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation's nuclear deterrent and said he hopes to gain commitments from the U.S. adversaries to cut their own spending.


“There’s no reason for us to be building brand-new nuclear weapons. We already have so many,” Trump said. “You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”


“We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive," Trump said.


While the U.S. and Russia have held massive stockpiles of weapons since the Cold War, Trump predicted that China would catch up in its capability to exact nuclear devastation “within five or six years.”


He said if the weapons were ever called to use, “that’s going to be probably oblivion.” 


Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once “we straighten it all out" in the Middle East and Ukraine.


“One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi [Jinping] of China, President [Vladimir] Putin of Russia. And I want to say, ‘Let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.”


Trump in his first term tried and failed to bring China into nuclear arms reduction talks when the U.S. and Russia were negotiating an extension of a pact known as New START. Russia suspended its participation in the treaty during the Biden administration, as the U.S. and Russia continued on massive programs to extend the lifespans or replace their Cold War-era nuclear arsenals.

## Pentagon chief calls on NATO partners to increase role in Europe’s defense

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called for NATO’s European members to increase their role in the defense of Europe as the United States focuses on defending the alliance’s Pacific flank.


It is a move that he says will likely require European allies to significantly increase defense spending from 2% of GDP to about 5% of GDP.


"We can talk all we want about values. Values are important, but you can't shoot values, you can't shoot flags, and you can't shoot strong speeches. There is no replacement for hard power," Hegseth told reporters on Thursday at NATO headquarters in Brussels.


Last year, NATO’s European allies collectively spent 2% of their GDP, amounting to about $380 billion, for the first time after setting a 2% defense spending goal in 2014. The U.S. currently spends about 3.5% of its GDP on defense. Canada, the other non-European NATO ally, currently spends about 1.4% of its GDP on defense.




“NATO is a great alliance, the most successful defense alliance in history, but to endure for the future, our partners must do far more for Europe's defense,” Hegseth said. He emphasized that deterrence of Chinese aggression “in the Pacific is one that really can only be led by the United States.”


He said the U.S. does not seek conflict with China, nor does it feel that conflict with China is inevitable, but he contended the administration must work with allies to ensure deterrence in the Indo-Pacific is "hard power deterrence, not just reputational.”


Russia-Ukraine war


On Wednesday, Hegseth said keeping Ukraine’s pre-invasion boundaries is an “unrealistic objective” in its war against Russian aggression, as was the expectation that Ukraine would join NATO. He advocated for a negotiated end to the war with security guarantees backed by European and non-European troops that would not include U.S. forces.




German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Ukraine’s potential membership in NATO and whether it should concede any territory should not be decided before peace talks start, referring to Hegseth’s comments as “concessions” made by the United States.


"Vladimir Putin responds to strength,” Hegseth said on Thursday when asked whether the U.S. was decreasing Ukraine’s leverage.


“No one's going to get everything that they want, understanding who committed the aggression in the first place," he added, referring to Putin.


NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reiterated his support for higher defense spending and appeared to defend Hegseth’s comments on Ukraine not joining the alliance. Rutte said on Thursday that while NATO must “make sure that Vladimir Putin never ever tries again to attack Ukraine,” he said, “it has never been a promise to Ukraine that as part of a peace deal, they would be part of NATO.”


The European Union’s top diplomat warned that any peace deal struck between the United States and Russia — without Ukraine or the EU — will fail.


“Trump says that the killing should stop. Putin can stop the killing by stopping bombing Ukraine. This is doable if there is a will,” said Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. She added that any agreement without Ukraine at the table amounts to appeasement.


Kallas’ comments reflected those of many NATO allies at Thursday’s meeting following U.S. President Donald Trump’s call with Putin and Trump's signaling that talks on Ukraine between the two were imminent.


After Thursday’s NATO ministerial gathering, Hegseth travels to Poland for what the Pentagon said will be talks with leaders about “bilateral defense cooperation, continued deterrence efforts along NATO's eastern flank and Poland's leadership as a model ally in defense investment and burden-sharing in NATO.”

## Number of accused 'high-threat' migrants at Guantanamo Bay rising

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. military is now housing about 68 detainees at its prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as part of an effort to assist the Department of Homeland Security with mass deportations. 


The commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, shared the updated figure with lawmakers Wednesday, but said he could not yet provide details on how much it will cost to house the growing number of individuals. 


Admiral Alvin Holsey said those efforts include both the detention of individuals described by DHS officials as “high-threat criminal aliens” and eventually holding up to 30,000 non-violent migrants slated for deportation. 




“We're doing a phased approach,” Holsey told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, adding that the base has the capacity now to hold about 2,500 non-violent migrants. 


“We’re working with DHS to understand the flow of migrants,” he said. “We’re not going to go to 30,000 unless we know that migrant flow will come. So, we're waiting at this point.” 


U.S. Transportation Command told VOA on Monday that there have been at least five flights of migrants to Guantanamo Bay, each aboard a C-17 or C-130 military cargo plane. 


Most of the flights, according to multiple officials, have carried between 10 and 15 detainees. 




Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the prison facility last Friday and oversaw the transfer of the third flight of detainees to the detention center, has repeatedly described the men as “murderers and vicious gang members” from Venezuela and as “the worst of the worst.” 


In one social media post, Noem said that at least one of the migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay had confessed to murder, while others were wanted for attempted murder, assault, weapons trafficking and impersonation. 


One official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deportation efforts, said that all of the individuals held at Guantanamo Bay have been issued final deportation orders. But DHS has not yet provided charging documents or other details regarding the crimes the detainees are accused of committing.  




On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration rights groups, filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees being held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility have been improperly denied access to lawyers. 


“By hurrying immigrants off to a remote island cut off from lawyers, family, and the rest of the world, the Trump administration is sending its clearest signal yet that the rule of law means nothing to it," according to a statement from ACLU lead attorney Lee Gelernt. 


"It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law governs our nation,” he added. 


According to the ACLU and the other groups, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Eucaris Carolina Gomez Lugo, learned her brother had been sent to Guantanamo Bay only after seeing him in a photo. 


The group also said she was shocked to learn that the government was alleging he was a member of the Tren de Aragua Venezuelan street gang. 


DHS dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations. 


“There is a system for phone utilization to reach lawyers,” said a senior Homeland Security official in a written statement shared with VOA. 


"If the AMERICAN Civil Liberties Union cares more about highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers & vicious gang members than they do about American citizens—they should change their name," the official added, responding to the lawsuit only on the condition of anonymity.

## How new scanners at US-Mexico border detect fentanyl

The Trump administration is seeking Mexico’s assistance in stemming the flow of fentanyl across the border into the U.S. Last year, high-tech scanners were installed at a port of entry in Arizona to detect the illegal drug. VOA Senior Washington Correspondent Carolyn Presutti reports from that port.

## US aircraft carrier collides with merchant ship near Egypt

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman was involved in a collision at sea with a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt, the Navy said Thursday.


The collision occurred late Wednesday while both ships were moving. It did not result in flooding or injuries aboard the carrier, and there was no damage to the ship's propulsion systems, the Navy said in a statement.


None of the crew on the merchant ship, the Besiktas-M, were injured either, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not yet been made public.


The Truman, which is based in Norfolk, Virginia, deployed in September to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It had just completed a port call in Souda Bay, Greece.

## Zelenskyy rejects bilateral US-Russia pact to end Moscow's war against Ukraine

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that his country would not accept any agreement on its fate decided bilaterally by Russia and the United States on how to end Moscow’s three-year war on Ukraine without Kyiv’s involvement.


"We, as an independent country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us," Zelenskyy told reporters as he visited a nuclear plant on his way to the Munich Security Conference, where he plans to meet Friday with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.


U.S. President Donald Trump spoke Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and they agreed that negotiations to end the war should start immediately, with Trump suggesting the two of them might soon hold a summit in Saudi Arabia. Trump later talked with Zelenskyy and informed him of his discussions with Putin.




On Thursday, Zelenskyy said, "Today it's important that everything does not go according to Putin's plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral” with the U.S.


Still, on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said after talking with Trump, “We discussed many nuances, diplomatic, military, economic, and President Trump informed me of what Putin told him. We believe that America’s power is enough to, together with us, together with all partners, pressure Russia and Putin toward peace."




Zelenskyy said he talked with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Thursday, telling him that “no negotiations with Putin can begin without a united position from Ukraine, Europe, and the U.S. I emphasized that Ukraine must negotiate from a position of strength, with strong and reliable security guarantees, and that NATO membership would be the most cost-effective for partners.”


“Another key guarantee is serious investment in Ukraine’s defense industry. I also warned world leaders against trusting Putin’s claims of readiness to end the war,” Zelenskyy said.


Trump said, in all caps on his Truth Social media platform on Thursday, “Great talks with Russia and Ukraine yesterday. Good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war!!!”


Trump’s phone call with Putin came after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told other NATO defense chiefs that Ukraine’s goal of restoring its 2014 borders was unrealistic and that the U.S. does not foresee Ukraine joining NATO, the West’s key military alliance, as part of a negotiated settlement of Russia’s war on Ukraine.




Moscow’s forces now hold about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in 2014.


Zelenskyy said it was important for the United States and Ukraine to draw up a plan to end the war before talking to the Russian side. Ukraine has said it is working on a Zelenskyy-Trump meeting, but nothing firm has been announced.


Zelenskyy said he did not discuss the possibility of NATO membership during his phone call with Trump, although he said he knew that the United States was against the idea. NATO’s 32-nation bloc says it is committed to eventual Ukraine NATO membership but not while the Russia-Ukraine war rages.


Russian officials and state-backed media appeared triumphant after Wednesday’s call between Trump and Putin that lasted more than an hour.


“To us, the position of the current [U.S.] administration is much more appealing,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday.


Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s National Security Council, said in an online statement, “The presidents of Russia and the U.S. have talked at last. This is very important in and of itself.”


Trump in the past has declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war against Russia. On Wednesday, after talking with Putin and Zelenskyy, he said, “I’m backing Ukraine, but I do want security for our money,” with U.S. officials suggesting recently that Ukraine agree to supply the U.S. with rare earth minerals for manufacture of technology products in exchange for continued military support.

## Chinese apps face scrutiny in US but users keep scrolling

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

Seoul — As a high school junior in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, Daneel Kutsenko never gave much thought to China.


Last month, though, as the U.S. government prepared to ban TikTok – citing national security concerns about its Chinese ownership – Kutsenko downloaded RedNote, another Chinese video-sharing app, which he felt gave him a new perspective on China.


“It just seems like people who live their life and have fun,” Kutsenko told VOA of RedNote, which reportedly attracted hundreds of thousands of U.S. users in the leadup to the now-paused TikTok ban.


Kutsenko’s move is part of a larger trend. Even as U.S. policymakers grow louder in their warnings about Chinese-owned apps, they have become a central part of American life.


TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, boasts 170 million U.S. users. China’s AI chatbot DeepSeek surged to the top of Apple’s App Store rankings, including those in the United States, for several days after its release last month.


Another major shift has come in online shopping, where Americans are flocking to digital Chinese marketplaces such as Temu and Shein in search of ultra-low prices on clothes, home goods, and other items.


According to a 2024 survey by Omnisend, an e-commerce marketing company, 70% of Americans shopped on Chinese platforms during the past year, with 20% doing so at least once a week.




Multifaceted threat


U.S. officials warn that Chinese apps pose a broad range of threats – whether to national security, privacy, human rights, or the economy.


TikTok has been the biggest target. Members of Congress attempting to ban the app cited concerns that China’s government could use TikTok as an intelligence-gathering tool or manipulate its algorithms to push narratives favorable to Beijing.


Meanwhile, Chinese commerce apps face scrutiny for their rock-bottom prices, which raise concerns about ethical sourcing and potential links to forced labor, Sari Arho Havrén, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based research organization, said in an email conversation with VOA.


“It raises questions of how sustainably these products are made,” Havrén, who focuses on China’s foreign policy and great power competition, said. Moreover, he said, “the pricing simply kills local manufacturers and businesses.”


Many U.S. policymakers also warn Chinese apps pose greater privacy risks, since Chinese law requires companies to share data with the government on request.


‘Curiosity and defiance’


Still, a growing number of Americans appear unfazed. Many young people in particular seem to shrug off the privacy concerns, arguing that their personal data is already widely exposed.


“They could get all the data they want. And anyway, I’m 16 – what are they going to find? Oh my gosh, he goes to school? There’s not much,” Kutsenko said.




Ivy Yang, an expert on U.S.-China digital interaction, told VOA many young Americans also find it unlikely that they would ever be caught up in a Chinese national security investigation.


“What they’re chasing is a dopamine peak. They’re not thinking about whether or not the dance videos or the cat tax pictures they swipe on RedNote are going to be a national security threat,” Yang, who founded the New York-based consulting company Wavelet Strategy, said.


Yang said the TikTok ban backlash and surge in RedNote downloads may reflect a shift in how young Americans see China – not just as a geopolitical rival, but as a source of apps they use in daily life.




She also attributes their skepticism to a broader cultural mindset – one shaped by a mix of curiosity, defiance, and a growing distrust of institutions, including conventional media.


Jeremy Goldkorn, a longtime analyst of U.S.-China digital trends and an editorial fellow at the online magazine ChinaFile, said growing disillusionment with America’s political turmoil and economic uncertainty has intensified these shifts.


“It makes it much more difficult for, particularly, young people to get worked up about what China’s doing when they feel so horrified about their own country,” Goldkorn said during a recent episode of the Sinica podcast, which focuses on current affairs in China.


Polling reflects this divide. A 2024 Pew survey found 81% of Americans view China unfavorably, but younger adults are less critical – only 27% of those under 30 have strongly negative views, compared to 61% of those 65 and older.


Digital barrier


While Chinese apps are expanding in the United States, in many ways the digital divide remains as impenetrable as ever.


China blocks nearly all major Western platforms and tightly controls its own apps, while the U.S. weighs new restrictions on Chinese tech.


Though President Donald Trump paused the TikTok ban, his administration has signaled broader efforts to curb China’s tech influence.


Trump officials have hinted they could take steps to regulate DeepSeek, the Chinese digital chatbot.


The Trump administration also recently signaled it intends to close a trade loophole that lets Chinese retailers bypass import duties and customs checks.


Broader challenges


Even as Washington debates how to handle the rise of Chinese apps, some analysts say the conversation risks obscuring the deeper issue of the broader role of social media itself.


Rogier Creemers, a specialist in digital governance at Leiden University, told VOA that while Chinese apps may raise valid concerns for Western countries, they are just one part of a larger, unaddressed problem.


“There’s a whole range of social ills that emerge from these social media that I think are far more important than anything the Chinese Communist Party could do,” he said, pointing to issues like digital addiction, declining attention spans, and the way social media amplifies misinformation and political unseriousness.


“And that would apply whether these apps are Chinese-owned or American-owned or Tajikistani-owned, as far as I’m concerned,” he added.


The United States, Creemer said, has taken a more hands-off approach to regulating online platforms, in part due to strong free speech protections and pushback by the tech industry.




Apps or influence?


For millions of Americans, the bigger debates about China and digital influence barely register when they open TikTok.


Kutsenko said neither he nor his friends have strong opinions about U.S.-China tensions. They just wanted an alternative to TikTok – one that felt fun, familiar, and easy to use.


It’s a sign that while policymakers see Chinese apps as part of a growing tech rivalry, for many Americans they’re just another way to scroll, shop, and stay entertained, no matter where they come from.

## US allies seek clarity on Ukraine support at Munich Security Conference

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

LONDON  — Hundreds of world leaders and delegates are set to attend the Munich Security Conference in Germany this weekend, with conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo high on the agenda, alongside simmering tensions in the Indo-Pacific region.


It’s the first major global summit for the new administration in Washington under President Donald Trump and comes amid speculation that his America First agenda could presage significant changes in U.S. foreign policy.


US delegation


The U.S. delegation includes Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.


“We are very happy that we will have a strong representation of both the administration of the new American government there, as well as representation from Congress,” said conference chairman Christoph Heusgen.


“And so, the American point of view will also be presented on stage, as will the European point of view, and that of other regions. And then, and that is what Munich stands for, there will be a dialogue, a discussion about the many issues at hand,” Heusgen told Reuters.


Vance is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Munich.


Ukraine’s war against Russia’s full-scale invasion is about to enter its fourth year. Zelenskyy said this week he shared a “common vision” with the Trump administration.


“Of course, there may be different opinions, but a common vision of the main things — of how to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and how to give guarantees of security to Ukraine and Ukrainians,” Zelenskyy told reporters on Monday.


'Unrealistic'


However, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that American troops would not be deployed to Ukraine following any ceasefire deal with Russia and ruled out NATO membership for Kyiv. He also described Ukraine’s hopes to return to its pre-2014 borders with Russia as unrealistic.




“European allies must lead from the front,” Hegseth told reporters in Brussels following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.


President Trump has made clear he wants a quick end to the war but it’s not clear how that might be achieved. Trump announced Wednesday he and Putin agreed in a phone call to “immediately” begin negotiations with Ukraine to bring an end to the nearly three-year-conflict.


NATO allies


Nevertheless, U.S. allies sense a change in tone from the president since his inauguration last month, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based research group.


“Though Trump has said a lot of things to worry a lot of people on tariffs, on trade, on Gaza and so on, he hasn't yet said anything particularly crazy from a European point of view about Ukraine or NATO. He hasn't repeated his threat to pull out of NATO. He said the Europeans should spend more [on defense] but most of us agree with him on that. He hasn't said he's going to cut off all aid for Ukraine,” Grant told VOA.


“One of the issues that will come up in Munich is to what extent the Europeans should help to keep the peace if there is a ceasefire in Ukraine. And certainly, President [Emmanuel] Macron of France, and to some degree the British, and possibly Friedrich Merz who may well be the next German chancellor, are all in favor of sending troops to keep the peace in Ukraine, if there's a peace to be kept,” Grant added.


Ukrainian hopes


On the streets of Kyiv, some Ukrainians expressed hope that the Munich conference will strengthen Ukrainian ties with the Trump administration.


“We hope that this personal meeting between President Zelenskyy and Vice President Vance will give an opportunity to convey the real situation of what is happening today in the Russian-Ukrainian war,” sociologist Asked Ashurbekov told The Associated Press.


Ukrainian journalist Borden Semeniuk was less optimistic.


“The country has been living in expectation for three years, and because of this, belief in this expectation has decreased. ... I would like to see some relief from the situation. But it is impossible to live in the hope that it will 100 percent happen at this meeting,” Semeniuk told AP.


Russia and Iran have not been invited to Munich. Last year, the conference organizers said their governments had not shown a serious interest in negotiations.


China


The official report of the Munich Security Conference cites the “multipolarization of the international order” — a theme welcomed by China, which is sending a large delegation to the summit.


“The report shows that the international community's acceptance of a multipolar world is on the rise. … China has always called for an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization,” Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Beijing on Tuesday.


Earlier this week, the U.S Navy sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait, prompting an angry response from Beijing.


China has ramped up military activity around Taiwan in recent months. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that someday will be reunified with the mainland, while Taipei considers the island a sovereign state.


Secretary of State Rubio is due to hold a trilateral meeting with allies Japan and South Korea while in Munich.


Gaza


Conflict in the Middle East will also top the agenda at the Munich conference, amid fears that the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is at risk.


President Trump’s repeated suggestion that Palestinians should leave Gaza will overshadow the conference, said analyst Charles Grant.


“I don't see it happening because you can't just eliminate 2 million people and put them nowhere at all,” Grant said.


“But I think most European governments are hoping that Trump will just push this for a while, and he'll get bored of it and talk about something else – and hope he will kind of move on and forget it. But so long as he does talk about it, it's very disruptive and creates a lot of ill-feeling between European and many other governments, and the U.S.,” Grant told VOA.


The conference will also host sessions on the conflicts in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Climate change, energy security and artificial intelligence also feature on a packed agenda across the three-day conference.

## Modi, Trump to meet with focus on trade, immigration, strategic ties

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

NEW DELHI — U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks Thursday at the White House.


Officials in New Delhi expressed optimism Modi’s visit will herald a renewed and substantive partnership. However, analysts said there will be contentious issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among Trump’s top priorities. 


Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his taking office, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri – the ministry’s top civil servant — said India-U.S. ties are solid and that “this has been one of our strongest international partnerships.” 


Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named India among countries that are “very big tariff abusers.” In a phone conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship. 


Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, repeated such concerns on Monday. "India has enormously high" tariffs that lock out imports, he said in an interview with CNBC. 


New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S., announced earlier this month that it would lower import duties on some items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles and cars. 


It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods gain Indian market access and boost energy imports from the U.S., analysts say. 


“New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,” said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. “India also bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that will benefit both.” 


For India, the stakes are high -- the United States is its largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion, with an Indian surplus of about $32 billion in 2023. 


India has not been affected so far by Trump’s tariff impositions – the latest 25% tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports will have an only marginal affect on India, as New Delhi is a small exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials. 


Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and technology.  In the recent phone conversation with Modi, Trump had called on Modi to increase procurement of U.S.-made security equipment 


India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has been purchasing more arms from countries such as France, Israel and the United States.  


“The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India [security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,” according to Rahul Bedi, a defense analyst in New Delhi. “There is likely to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.”   


Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by opposition parties.   


Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better treatment during future deportations. 


At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields, such as technology.   


“People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our deepening ties with the United States,” Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns about the transport and treatment of the deportees. 


In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their collaboration in Trump’s first term.  


Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts say the two countries have convergence on geostrategic issues. 


“It was President Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad, which was in a dormant state for about 10 years, and he was solely responsible for reviving it,” said Mahapatra. “This is an area where both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace, stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific region.”

## US judge allows Trump to proceed with federal worker deferred retirement

BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS — A federal judge on Wednesday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to carry out its federal worker deferred retirement program as the president moves to overhaul and downsize the U.S. government, handing a setback to unions trying to stop the plan.


The decision could clear the way for the Republican president's administration to swiftly try to wrap up the program, though the unions could ask another court to halt the program.


U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston dissolved an earlier order he issued that had paused the program at the urging of unions representing more than 800,000 federal employees.


O'Toole concluded that the unions lacked legal standing to challenge the rule.


The American Federation of Government Employees and other unions have called the administration's deferred resignation offer to more than 2 million federal civilian employees unlawful.


"The unions do not have the required direct stake in the Fork directive, but are challenging a policy that affects others, specifically executive branch employees," wrote O'Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton. "This is not sufficient."


The Office of Personnel Management, which announced the program in a January 28 email titled "Fork in the Road," on Monday told employees it intends to close the program to new entrants as soon as legally permissible.


As of Friday, about 65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts, according to a White House official, as the Trump administration ramps up plans to engage in wide-ranging job cuts throughout the government.


The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) National President Everett Kelley called the ruling a setback.


"Importantly, this decision did not address the underlying lawfulness of the program," he said in a statement.


The unions that had filed the lawsuit argued that the plan announced in January was unlawful and that OPM lacked authority to implement the program.


Trump, who began his second term as president on January 20, has appointed Elon Musk a "special government employee" to oversee a sweeping effort called the Department of Government Efficiency with the stated aim of reducing federal spending and reshaping the United States' 2.2 million-strong federal workforce, potentially purging thousands of workers.


He also signed an executive order on Tuesday to expand Musk's influence and continue downsizing the federal workforce.


Democrats and other critics have accused Musk, who heads electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX, of improperly taking over the federal government. Some federal workers have held protests against Musk's actions.


In an email that was sent last month to nearly all federal employees, OPM said employees could choose to resign now and retain all pay and benefits until September 30.


The email said employees could remain on the payroll without having to work in person and possibly having their duties reduced or eliminated in the meantime. Interested employees needed only to reply with the word "resign" to take part.


The email's title and contents mirrored a message that Musk, the world's richest man, sent to Twitter employees after he acquired the social media platform, now called X, in 2022.


As the deadline approached, the Trump administration had repeated its warning that most federal agencies are likely to be downsized, a message seen by workers as pressure to accept the buyout offer.


The unions in their lawsuit argued that OPM's buyout directive was "stunningly arbitrary" and violated the Antideficiency Act, a federal law that bars agencies from spending more money than Congress appropriated.


By encouraging employees to broadly quit without regard to their agency, job duties or institutional memory, OPM is ignoring the adverse consequences resignations could have on the government's ability to function, the unions said.


At the request of the unions, O'Toole last week delayed an initial February 6 deadline for employees to resign to Monday. On that day, he put it on hold pending a further order of the court while he considered the case.


The unions asked that the deadline be put fully on hold to give them time to seek further relief through the courts and ensure that their members can make informed decisions.

## Trump orders revamp of US diplomatic corps to ensure it follows his agenda

date: 2025-02-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued an executive order directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revamp the Foreign Service to ensure "faithful and effective implementation" of Trump's foreign policy agenda. 


The order, which follows upheaval at the U.S. Agency for International Development, comes as Trump institutes changes to ensure U.S. foreign policy is aligned with his "America First" agenda. He has also repeatedly pledged to "clean out the deep state" by firing bureaucrats that he deems disloyal. 


The order also says failure to implement the president's agenda is grounds for professional discipline, which may result in the termination of personnel. 


"The Secretary must maintain an exceptional workforce of patriots to implement this policy effectively," the order read. 


"The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, reform the Foreign Service and the administration of foreign relations to ensure faithful and effective implementation of the President’s foreign policy agenda." 


The executive order says the secretary of state will implement reforms in recruiting, performance, evaluation and retention standards to "ensure a workforce that is committed to faithful implementation of the President’s foreign policy." 


It also said the secretary can revamp the programs of the Foreign Service Institute and revise or replace the Foreign Affairs Manual. 


Just hours after taking office on Jan. 20, Trump ordered a freeze of most U.S. foreign aid to ensure it was aligned with his "America First" policies. 


Following the order, USAID staff were put on leave and told not to report to work at the agency's headquarters, where signs were covered in tape or removed. The USAID website stopped working, and Rubio was named acting administrator.

## Lawsuit by US rights group seeks access to migrants sent to Guantanamo Bay

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

washington — The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on Wednesday seeking access to dozens of migrants flown to a U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, saying they were being denied the right to an attorney. 


ACLU filed the complaint on behalf of families of detainees, who say the detainees themselves cannot sue because they are being held without the ability to communicate with the outside world. The suit seeks immediate phone and video access to detainees, as well as in-person visitation. 


President Donald Trump, a Republican, kicked off a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office on Jan. 20, including the transfer of dozens of migrants to a detention site on Guantanamo Bay, which is best known for the separate high-security U.S. prison used for suspected foreign terrorists. 


The lawsuit follows a letter sent by ACLU and other civil and immigrant rights groups to top Trump officials last week, demanding a way to speak to detainees. 


“Shipping immigrants off to Guantanamo without access to lawyers or the outside world cannot be reconciled with our country’s laws or principles," said Lee Gelernt, ACLU lawyer and lead counsel on the case. "It will now be up to the courts to reaffirm that the rule of law governs our nation." 


The lawsuit cites the cases of three Venezuelan men believed to be detained at Guantanamo. 


Angela Carolina Sequera, one of the plaintiffs, said she was in almost daily contact with her son while he was in a Texas immigration detention center and last spoke to him on Saturday, the complaint stated. On Sunday, she received a call from the detention center saying her son would be sent to Guantanamo. 


"Ms. Sequera has made numerous calls to try to locate her son and speak to him, to no avail," the complaint said. "She is distraught over the lack of information, and she desires that her son be provided with the ability to communicate with legal counsel regarding his detention at Guantanamo." 


The plaintiffs also include four nonprofit legal service providers who said they were unable to represent migrants shuttled to the naval base. The providers have clients in Texas and Florida.


The Trump administration has provided few specifics about the detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay but said the first flight carried alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.  


Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said there is a system at the Guantanamo detention site for migrants to phone lawyers. She questioned the ACLU raising concerns about “highly dangerous criminal aliens including murderers and vicious gang members” rather than U.S. citizens.  


Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited the base on Friday, said in a social media post that some of the detainees had allegedly been charged or convicted of homicide, robbery and other crimes.  


The ACLU lawsuit said the U.S. had never before moved migrants held on civil immigration charges from the U.S. to the Guantanamo Bay base and now held them "incommunicado, without access to attorneys, family or the outside world." 


The complaint said that despite significant public concern, the Trump administration had offered no explanation of its legal authority to move the detainees.

## Trump pushes for lower interest rates alongside reciprocal tariffs

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — As his trade advisers finalized plans to enact reciprocal measures on every country that charges duties on U.S. imports, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday he will push for lower interest rates alongside his tariff policies.


“Interest Rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!! Lets Rock and Roll, America!!!” Trump said on social media Wednesday morning.


To maintain the Federal Reserves’ autonomy from politics, U.S. presidents traditionally avoid even the appearance of meddling in monetary policy and the nation’s interest rates, which is the purview of the central bank.


Trump, however, has not shied from the practice. In a videoconference address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Trump said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”


“I know interest rates much better than they do,” he said of Fed officials. He has ramped up his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he appointed in 2017 for a term that ends in 2026.


Trump’s push to lower interest rates is intended to go hand in hand with punitive measures on trading partners.


The president said Wednesday afternoon that he would approve reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday or Thursday.


“We're going to be doing reciprocal tariffs,” he said. “Very simply, if they charge us, we charge them.”


Reciprocal tariffs are “absolutely a high priority for the president,” White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told reporters Wednesday, promising “a lot more action on it today.”


Hassett said the White House has begun negotiations with other countries early to lay the groundwork for imposing such tariffs, although he acknowledged the details about which sectors or how they will be implemented is a “work in progress.”


Under World Trade Organization rules, member countries have the right to impose tariffs on imports. Countries negotiate those rates at the WTO to determine the maximum tariff rate a member country can impose on imports from other member countries.


Inflation, looming trade war


U.S. inflation rose to 3% in January, according to government data released Wednesday. Last month, the annual pace was 2.9%.




Trump campaigned on lowering high consumer prices he blamed on his predecessor, Joe Biden. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt again attributed the increase to the previous administration.


"This is an indictment on the Biden administration's mismanagement of the inflation crisis and their lack of transparency," she said during her briefing Wednesday.


Trump wants to lower interest rates and inflation, she said. "He believes that the whole of government economic approach that this administration is taking will result in lower inflation."


However, some economists warn that combining high tariffs and low interest rates will have the opposite effect.


Trump's plan reflects a “misunderstanding of how the economy works,” said Joseph Gagnon, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.


“Tariffs raise prices directly, that is inflationary, but also cutting interest rates is inflationary if you do it excessively,” he told VOA. “Especially with today's data, cutting interest rates would not be a good idea.”


During testimony Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, Powell said the Fed was in no rush to cut interest rates because the economy had stabilized. He noted that inflation, while still above the Fed’s 2% target, was at 2.6% last year, and he said the labor market was cooling without plummeting, with the unemployment rate at 4%.


Gagnon also warned of a looming trade war. Trump already had announced Monday his decision to impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports beginning March 12.


The duties will hit top U.S. steel supplier Canada, followed by Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Germany. Additionally, Canada is the leader in aluminum exports to the American market.




European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen vowed on Tuesday the move “will not go unanswered,” saying it will trigger tough countermeasures from the 27-nation bloc, potentially targeting iconic American industries such as bourbon, jeans and motorcycles. EU trade ministers are meeting Wednesday to determine their next moves.


China, Mexico and Canada


Last week, Trump imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, which the White House said was aimed at halting the flow of fentanyl opioids and their precursor chemicals.


On Monday China began slapping retaliatory actions on some American goods, including 15% duties on coal and natural gas imports and 10% on petroleum, agricultural equipment, high-emission vehicles and pickup trucks. The country also immediately implemented restrictions on the export of certain critical minerals, and it launched an antitrust investigation into American tech giant Google.


Trump delayed enacting a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada for a month — until March 4 — to allow negotiations over his demands for the U.S. neighbors to secure their borders and stop the flow of the illegal drug fentanyl.


The duties could affect about $1.323 trillion in trade imports that come from China, Mexico and Canada, according to U.S. government data. This accounts for 43% of U.S. imports and 5% of the $27 trillion U.S. gross domestic product.


If enacted, the new import taxes on Canada, Mexico and China will increase the average tariff rate from its current level of 3% to 10.7% based on contemporary trade patterns, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at financial advisory firm RSM.


“Should the trade skirmishes escalate to include the European Union and turn into an all-out trade war, expect U.S. economic growth to ease back to 2% as the tariffs drag down growth and employment, stoke inflation and widen the current account deficit, all amid higher interest rates,” he wrote on RSM’s Real Economy Blog.

## Federal appeals court upholds singer R. Kelly's convictions, 30-year prison term

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — R. Kelly's racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the American singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women. 


The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March. 


The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking. 


Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling "unprecedented," saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law "to situations absurdly remote" from the statute's intent. 


Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago. 


The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings, and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper. 


"Enabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp," the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls. 


"Evidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually," the three-judge panel said. 


The appeals court said it was "neither arbitrary nor irrational" that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify. 


"None of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts," the appeals court said. 


The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, "were properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims." 


Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's "excellent opinion," but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available. 


"This was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony," Bonjean said. 


Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit I Believe I Can Fly and the cult classic Trapped in the Closet, a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue. 


Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex. 


Widespread outrage over Kelly's sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary Surviving R. Kelly.

## Trump launches diplomatic blitz to end war in Ukraine

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday set in motion a diplomatic charge aimed at ending the nearly 3-year-old war in Ukraine and laid down what appears to be his condition for continued U.S. support.


"I'm backing Ukraine, but I do want security for our money," he said in the Oval Office, when asked by reporters about his stance on the conflict sparked by the 2022 Russian invasion.


Trump said he told former President Joe Biden on Biden's support for Kyiv, "'You ought to be asking for a loan or a security, like their oil and gas or something, for the money.'"




U.S. lawmakers have approved nearly $183 billion in military and non-military support for Ukraine since 2022, according to an oversight report delivered to Congress on Wednesday, which also said that just under $40 billion remains available.


This followed a whirlwind day of developments between Washington and Moscow.


President welcomes teacher home


The events kicked off Tuesday night, when the president welcomed American teacher Marc Fogel into the White House after his release from Russian custody.


Before noon Wednesday, Trump announced that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed, by phone, to "immediately" begin negotiations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to bring an end to the conflict.


Around midday, Trump dispatched Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to a Friday meeting in Munich with Zelenskyy.


And then, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office as the skies turned gray over snowy Washington, he teased to a future summit with Putin in Saudi Arabia "in the not-too-distant future."


Zelenskyy conversation went 'very well'


Earlier in the day, Trump said in a social media statement read aloud by press secretary Karoline Leavitt that the conversation with Zelenskyy went "very well."


Likewise, of the meeting in Munich, he said, "I am hopeful that the results of that meeting will be positive."


Zelenskyy confirmed that the two men spoke Wednesday. In a video released by the Ukrainian presidency, he described their conversation as long.


"We discussed many nuances, diplomatic, military, economic, and President Trump informed me of what Putin told him," he said. "We believe that America's power is enough to, together with us, together with all partners, pressure Russia and Putin toward peace."


Earlier Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, in Germany for a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, ruled out a key demand by Ukraine: eventual membership in NATO.


"The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement," Hegseth said.


When asked about Hegseth's statement, Trump said NATO membership for Ukraine was "not practical."


'Great friendship' 


A top Trump envoy on Wednesday credited Trump's "great friendship" with Putin and with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as key in freeing Fogel from Russian custody late Tuesday. Fogel had been detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country.


"I think that getting Marc Fogel out was critical, and the Russians were very, very helpful in that effort and very accommodating," said Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Mideast, speaking to reporters at the White House. "And I think that's maybe a sign about how that working relationship between President Trump and President Putin will be in the future and what that may portend for the world at large for conflict and so forth."


"I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now," Fogel said as he stood next to Trump at the White House late Tuesday.


Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond calling it "very fair, very reasonable."


The White House on Wednesday said the U.S. would, in turn, release Russian cryptocurrency kingpin Alexander Vinnik.


On Wednesday, Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov directly linked Fogel's exchange to the larger picture.


"In Washington, Fogel's return is considered an important step in the Ukrainian crisis," he said.


And he said such negotiations between Washington and Moscow build mutual trust, which he said "is now at its lowest point."


The White House also announced the release of three prisoners held by Kremlin ally Belarus. Among them, Andrey Kuznechyk, a veteran journalist with U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Belarus service.


"This is a joyous day for Andrey, his wife, and their two young children. After more than three years apart, this family is together again thanks to President Trump," RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said in a statement.


Capus added, "We remain hopeful that our journalist Ihar Losik will also be released and look to the Trump administration for its continued leadership and guidance."

## LEGAL UPDATE: Shock and Awe vs. Trump

## New US intelligence chief promises to deliver for Trump

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump’s effort to overhaul the country’s intelligence apparatus appears set to move forward, with lawmakers confirming Tulsi Gabbard as the nation’s next director of national intelligence.


The Senate voted 52-48 in favor of Gabbard on Wednesday, narrowly rejecting concerns about her experience and past statements on leaks of classified intelligence and other matters.


Following the vote, Gabbard told Trump she would "help fulfill that mandate that the American people delivered to you very clearly in this election."


"The American people have very little trust in the intelligence community, largely because they've seen the weaponization and politicization of an entity that is supposed to be purely focused on ensuring our national security," she said moments after being sworn in during a ceremony at the White House's Oval Office.


"It is truly humbling to be in this position to serve in your administration, help to rebuild that trust and ultimately to keep the American people safe," Gabbard said, praising the president for "ensuring that war is the last resort, not the first."


Gabbard got support from every Republican senator except for former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who joined Democrats in opposing her confirmation.


Last-minute pleas by Senate Democrats to their Republican colleagues to reject Gabbard's nomination, however, had no impact.




“We simply cannot, in good conscience, trust our most classified secrets to someone who echoes Russian propaganda and falls for conspiracy theories,” said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, addressing lawmakers before Wednesday’s vote.


Schumer also alleged that most Republicans secretly agree.


“If we had a secret ballot, Gabbard might get 10 votes,” he said. “People know. That's why they raise so many questions. But Donald Trump and Elon Musk evidently threaten them, and they're changing their view.”


Trump selected Gabbard in November, praising her “fearless spirit.”




But the former Democratic representative from the state of Hawaii and one-time Democratic presidential candidate faced criticism from Democrats and some Republicans. Gabbard’s nomination to serve as director of national intelligence advanced to the full Senate by a 9-8 party-line vote in the Senate Intelligence Committee.


"It's fair to say Ms. Gabbard's nomination has generated a bit more interest and attention than do most nominees before this committee," Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, a Republican, acknowledged during Gabbard’s confirmation hearing late last month.


During the hearing, Gabbard was questioned repeatedly by Republicans and Democrats about Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor accused of leaking thousands of classified documents before ultimately fleeing to Russia, and specifically about legislation she introduced to pardon him.




Each time they asked whether she considered Snowden a traitor, Gabbard declined to answer.


"Senator, my heart is with my commitment to our Constitution and our nation's security," Gabbard said during once exchange with Republican Senator James Lankford.


Senators also questioned Gabbard about a 2017 trip to Syria, during which she met with then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, despite allegations he had used chemical weapons against civilians, and about her comments about Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.


"I continue to have significant concerns about your judgment and your qualifications," said Warner, a Democrat. "Repeatedly, you have excused our adversaries' worst actions, [and] instead often blame them on the United States.”


Gabbard, however, managed to find common ground with the committee’s Republican senators, winning over Susan Collins and Todd Young.




Young also shared a letter from Gabbard in which she pledged to hold U.S. intelligence employees and contractors accountable for intelligence leaks and to “not advocate for any protections which should only be extended to lawful and legitimate whistleblowers.”


Gabbard further promised to not make any recommendation “regarding the legal standing of Edward Snowden” to the U.S. attorney general or to Trump.


And she pledged to support the use of warrantless surveillance capabilities despite her opposition to the program while she was a lawmaker.

## US defense chief: Return to Ukraine's 2014 borders 'unrealistic'

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told NATO military allies on Wednesday that Ukraine’s hoped-for return to its 2014 borders is an “unrealistic objective,” and that the United States does not believe that Kyiv membership in NATO is a “realistic outcome” of a negotiated end to Russia’s three-year war on Ukraine.


Speaking in Brussels at NATO headquarters, Hegseth told his fellow defense chiefs, "We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.”


No peace talks have been scheduled, but Hegseth said any durable conclusion to the war must include "robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again."


"The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,” he said, which would invoke the military alliance’s mutual defense provision among NATO’s 32 member nations that requires each of them to help defend each other when they are attacked.  


Kyiv has long sought NATO membership, and the alliance’s other member nations have said they are committed to it, but not while the war rages on.  


Instead, Hegseth said security guarantees for Ukraine should be backed by "capable European and non-European troops."


"If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission, and they should not be covered under Article 5," he said, referring to the alliance's mutual defense clause.


Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, supported pro-Russian separatists fighting against Kyiv’s forces in eastern Ukraine in the ensuing years and then launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. It now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s pre-2014 territory.


Before taking office to begin his second term in the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict even before being inaugurated. More recently, his aides say he hopes for a peace pact in the first 100 days of his new term, roughly by the end of April.


Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. was Ukraine’s biggest military benefactor. Trump has often voiced skepticism of continued U.S. support, refusing to say at a political debate last year that he wanted Ukraine to win the war.


Now Trump appears intent on getting Europe to assume most of the financial and military responsibilities for the defense of Ukraine. He also has suggested that going forward, Ukraine should pay for continued U.S. support by giving the United States access to its rare earth minerals needed to produce technology products.


"Members of this [Ukraine] contact group must meet the moment," Hegseth said to the assembled group of about 50 member countries that have provided $126 billion worth of weapons and military assistance to Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion.


"We hear you," British Defense Secretary John Healey said in response to Hegseth's opening remarks.  


Hegseth said that NATO members must increase their defense spending to 5% of their national economies, a figure that no NATO country currently allocates.


The U.S. is at 3.4%, with Poland the highest NATO country at 4.12%. The current NATO defense spending goal is 2% of each country’s national economy, a figure that 23 of the 32 countries meet, up from six in 2021 after Trump chided other NATO countries about the issue during his first presidential term.


Hegseth would not commit the U.S. to the 5% figure, saying it was up to Trump.


"We live in fiscally constrained times," Hegseth said, and need to be responsible with taxpayer money.


But the U.S. defense leader said, "The United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship [among NATO members] which encourages dependence [on the U.S.]; rather our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security.”


NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, June 24-26.

## Rubio heads to Munich amid diplomatic push for Ukraine peace deal

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to depart Thursday for Munich and later this week will visit the Middle East amid an intensive diplomatic push to end Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, as well as efforts to follow up on U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for the post-war Gaza Strip. 


Preparations are also underway for Rubio to hold talks with his counterparts from Japan and South Korea on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to people familiar with the plan who spoke with VOA on condition of anonymity. 


If the meeting takes place as expected, it would be the first U.S.-Japan-South Korea foreign ministerial trilateral under the Trump administration. 


Ukraine 


As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches its third year, the U.S. is pursuing multiple diplomatic avenues to secure a peace deal. 


Although not directly linked to efforts to secure a peace deal, U.S. officials have described Russia’s Tuesday release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel as “a show of good faith from the Russians” and “a sign that we are moving in the right direction to end” the brutal war in Ukraine. 




Rubio has said that the U.S. will reaffirm its determination to end the war during meetings at the Munich Security Conference, a high-profile international security forum running from Feb. 14 to 16.   


U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are set to hold in-person talks in Munich. U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg and Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, will also attend the conference. 


Ukraine has said that its delegation will present its position on ending the war and outline its vision for achieving a lasting peace. Meanwhile, negotiations are in progress as Ukraine seeks security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe. 




Ukraine is willing to offer U.S. companies lucrative reconstruction contracts, Zelenskyy told The Guardian newspaper in an interview this week. He also said that if Trump manages to bring him and Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, he would offer a land swap: Ukrainian-occupied territory in Kursk in exchange for Russian-held land in Ukraine. 


Rare earth minerals 


Trump has expressed interest in making continued military aid conditional on access to Ukraine's raw materials. 


Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent visited Kyiv on Wednesday for talks on energy and rare earth minerals. He is the first cabinet-level official in the Trump administration to visit the country. 


More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare earths, nickel and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium and titanium. 


Russia has gained control over a significant portion of Ukraine's identified mineral resources in the territories it occupies. If Russia permanently seizes that land, Ukraine will lose access to those minerals and other reserves, which would be a blow to both European and U.S. security. 


First US-Japan-ROK trilateral 


Rubio’s expected talks with both Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul in Munich would take place amid concerns over North Korea’s military ties with Russia, China’s support for Russia’s defense industry, and security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. 


On Jan. 21, Rubio met with Iwaya in Washington to discuss strengthening U.S.-Japan cooperation against global security threats, including what officials describe as “China’s destabilizing actions” in the Indo-Pacific. The following day, he spoke with Cho by phone, where both emphasized the need to further trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Japan and South Korea. 




“We need to do more and strengthen relationships with our friends around the world,” said Republican Congressman Rob Wittman of Virginia during a discussion hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, on Tuesday.   


“We should be concerned about China's growing relationships with countries like Russia,” he added. Wittman serves as the vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. 


He described the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea as “transactional,” adding that Moscow’s technology transfers to Pyongyang are not out of the “goodness of the heart.” 


The U.S.-Japan-ROK trilateral framework was established under former president Joe Biden’s administration.  


Experts, including former senior State Department official Rick Waters, note that such trilateral cooperation has become increasingly institutionalized, making it “hard to reverse” — even amid South Korea’s political turmoil following President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment over his brief martial law attempt last December. 


“I’d be very surprised if, in four years, we would see anything other than further consolidation” of existing U.S. alliance frameworks in the Indo-Pacific,” Waters said Tuesday at the CSIS event. 


Middle East 


Rubio will travel to the Middle East after holding talks with his counterparts in Munich. 


On Tuesday, he spoke with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ahead of his visit to Abu Dhabi, the country’s capital, next week. 


They “discussed the ceasefire agreement in Gaza and the importance of ensuring that Hamas releases all hostages, including American citizens,” according to the State Department. 


Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the two also “highlighted the imperative of ensuring that Hamas can never rule Gaza or threaten Israel again” during the call. 


Trump said this week the Hamas militant group must release all hostages held in Gaza by midday Saturday, or he will propose canceling the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. 


Rubio is scheduled to travel to Munich, Jerusalem, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi from Feb. 13-18.

## White House blocks AP reporter from Oval Office event over ‘Gulf of America’ policy

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from an event in the Oval Office on Tuesday because the news agency has not altered its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered renamed to the Gulf of America, the news agency said.


Julie Pace, the AP’s executive editor, said the White House informed the nonprofit news agency that the AP would be blocked from the Oval Office event if the outlet did not align its editorial standards with Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.


An AP reporter attempted to enter the White House event on Tuesday afternoon but was turned away. Later Tuesday night, a second AP reporter was barred from an event in the White House Diplomatic Room.


“As a global news organization, The Associated Press informs billions of people around the world every day with factual, nonpartisan journalism,” Pace said in a statement.


“It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,” Pace said. “Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.”


The White House Correspondents’ Association, or WHCA, also condemned the decision as “unacceptable.”


“The White House cannot dictate how news organizations report the news,” WHCA President Eugene Daniels said in a statement.


The White House did not immediately reply to a VOA request for comment in response to the AP and WHCA statements.


Shortly after being inaugurated, Trump signed an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali, the highest peak in North America. According to his order, the Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali would revert to Mount McKinley — its name before President Barack Obama changed it in 2015.


A few days later, the AP announced that the news agency would continue referring to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico while acknowledging the new name Trump had picked. The AP said it made that decision because the gulf has carried the Gulf of Mexico name for more than 400 years and that other countries and international bodies do not need to recognize the name change.


However, since the area of the Alaskan mountain lies entirely in the United States and Trump has authority to change the name, the AP said it will use the name Mount McKinley.


Thousands of journalists and writers around the world follow the AP’s style.


Voice of America typically follows the AP’s style, but VOA’s standards editor announced in late January that the congressionally funded but editorially independent news outlet would begin referring to the body of water as the Gulf of America, in addition to referring to the mountain as Mount McKinley.

## Cost of groceries, gas goes up as US inflation worsens

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. inflation accelerated last month as the cost of groceries, gas and used cars rose, a disappointment for families and businesses struggling with higher costs and likely underscoring the Federal Reserve's resolve to delay any further interest rate cuts.


The consumer price index increased 3% in January from a year ago, Wednesday's report from the Labor Department showed, up from 2.9% the previous month. It has increased from a 3½-year low of 2.4% in September.


The figures show that inflation has remained stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target for roughly the past six months, after it fell steadily for about a year and a half. Elevated prices created a major political problem for former President Joe Biden. President Donald Trump pledged to reduce prices in last year's campaign, although most economists worry that his many proposed tariffs could at least temporarily increase costs.


The unexpected boost in inflation could dampen some of the business enthusiasm that arose after Trump's election on promises to reduce regulation and cut taxes. Dow futures tumbled 400 points, and all major markets are likely to sell off at the opening bell. Bond yields rose, a sign traders expect inflation and interest rates to remain high.


Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core consumer prices rose 3.3% in January compared with a year ago, up from 3.2% in December. Economists closely watch core prices because they can provide a better read of inflation's future.


Month-to-month inflation


Inflation also worsened monthly, with prices jumping 0.5% in January from December, the largest increase since August 2023. Core prices climbed 0.4% last month, the most since March 2024.


Grocery prices climbed 0.5% just in January, pushed higher by a 15.2% surge in egg prices, the biggest monthly increase since June of 2015. Egg prices have soared 53% compared with a year ago.


An avian flu epidemic has forced many egg producers to cull millions of birds from their flocks. Some stores have imposed limits on egg purchases, and some restaurants have placed surcharges on egg dishes.




The cost of car insurance continues to rise and picked up 2% just from December to January. Hotel prices rose 1.4% last month, while the cost of a gallon of gas moved up 1.8%.


Inflation often jumps in January as many companies raise their prices at the beginning of the year, although the government's seasonal adjustment process is supposed to filter out those effects.


Later Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before the House Financial Services Committee, where he will likely be asked about inflation and the Fed's response to it. The Fed raised its benchmark rate in 2022 and 2023 to a two-decade high of 5.3% to combat inflation. With inflation down significantly from its 9.1% peak in June 2022, it cut its rate to about 4.3% in its final three meetings last year.


Interest rates and tariffs


Early Wednesday, Trump said on social media that interest rates should be lowered, "something which would go hand in hand with upcoming Tariffs!!!" Yet the tick up in consumer prices makes it less likely the Fed will cut rates anytime soon.




Fed officials are mostly confident that inflation over time will head lower, but they want to see further evidence that it is declining before cutting their key rate any further. The Fed's rate typically influences other borrowing costs for things such as mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.


Inflation's recent uptick is a major reason the Federal Reserve has paused its interest rate cuts, after implementing three of them last year. "We do not need to be in a hurry" to implement further reductions, Powell said Tuesday in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.


The Trump administration's tariff policy could lift prices in the coming months. Trump on Monday imposed 25% taxes on steel and aluminum imports and has pledged to impose more tariffs. Economists at Goldman Sachs forecast that yearly core inflation would fall almost a full percentage point, to 2.3%, by the end of this year, absent any import duties. But they expect tariffs will raise end-of-year inflation to 2.8%.


On Tuesday, Powell acknowledged that higher tariffs could lift inflation and limit the central bank's ability to cut rates, calling it "a possible outcome."


But he emphasized that it would depend on how many imports are hit with tariffs and for how long.


"In some cases, it doesn't reach the consumer much, and in some cases it does," Powell said. "And it really does depend on facts that we haven't seen yet."

## Paul McCartney rocks the Bowery - Inside his surprise NYC concert

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

New York — Paul McCartney’s previous New York-area performance took place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575.


It was probably less than that since McCartney’s sound board and gear — too much to fit backstage — occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage.


Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening.


“So, here we are,” McCartney said, grinning. “Some little gig. New York. Why not?”


Later, before launching into “Let Me Roll It,” he added: “I can’t quite believe we’re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.”


It was not McCartney’s first impromptu concert. The Beatles famously performed in 1969 atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London. Since then, he’s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York.


In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles’ famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his “Egyptian Station.”




With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes.


For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery.


Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. “I thought: I can do this,” Jaffe said before the show. “I put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.”


Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: “I don’t actually believe it.”


Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom.


“We just got lucky,” Sokoloff said. “I’m always learning about these things the day after.”


McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: “You don’t need to rehearse!”


If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn’t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with “A Hard Day’s Night” and also performed “Got To Get You Into My Life,” “Maybe I’m Amazed,” “Lady Madonna,” “Jet,” “Get Back,” “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,” “Let it Be” and “Hey Jude.”


“Blackbird” was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States.


“We were just kids,” McCartney said. “I’ve got grandchildren older than that now.”


In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” “From Me to You.”


“It had everything to do with the fans, really,” McCartney said.


Before playing the Wings song “Mrs. Vanderbilt,” McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. “Let’s hope it gets back to that soon,” he said.


Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. “That was a Beatles scream.” Then he asked for more, saying, “OK, let’s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.” All in attendance obliged.


McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, “Now and Then,” a ballad penned by Lennon in the late ’70s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson’s 2021 documentary, “The Beatles: Get Back.” The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York.


“Let’s hear it for John,” he said.


McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming “Saturday Night Live” 50th anniversary festivities. He’s to be a guest on the star-studded television special Sunday.


It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has said he’s hoping to finish a new album this year.


For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member asked McCartney if it could go all night. “Some of us need to get some sleep, you know,” he replied.

## Snow and freezing rain pummel the mid-Atlantic while California prepares for likely flooding

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

Snow, sleet and freezing rain were expected to continue pummeling the central Appalachians and mid-Atlantic states Wednesday, while California readied for a storm that could flood areas ravaged by the recent wildfires. 


Especially heavy snowfall — up to nearly 25 centimeters — was expected in parts of Virginia and West Virginia, according to the National Weather Service. Ice accumulations could reach more than 8.4 millimeters in Stanleytown, Virginia, and 6.3 millimeters in Glendale Springs, North Carolina. 


In California, an atmospheric river — a long band of water vapor that can transport moisture from the tropics to more northern areas — was expected to move in late Wednesday, likely flooding urban areas across central and Southern California, according to the weather service. 




The snowstorm that blew into the mid-Atlantic states on Tuesday caused accidents on icy roads and prompted school closures. By Tuesday night, nearly 12,000 people in Virginia had lost power, according to PowerOutage.us. 


“Stay home and off the roads tonight, Virginia,” the Virginia Department of Transportation posted on social media Tuesday night, alongside a meme of Dorothy from “The Wizard of Oz” saying, “There’s no place like home." 




In parts of Baltimore and Washington, 2.5 centimeters of snow was falling each hour, according to the weather service. All Washington public schools were closed Wednesday due to the weather. 


Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said Tuesday it had 5,400 workers dedicated to restoring power. 


About 65 Virginia National Guard soldiers were at facilities along the Interstate 95 and state Route 29 corridors and in southwest Virginia to support the storm response, guard officials said. Another 20 soldiers and members of the Virginia Defense Force were in support roles. 


Winter storm warnings extended from northwest North Carolina to southern New Jersey, and the snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all rain by Wednesday afternoon as temperatures climb. 


Meanwhile a separate storm system was expected to dump heavy snow on an area stretching from Kansas to the Great Lakes starting Tuesday night, the weather service said. The Kansas Legislature canceled Wednesday meetings because of the weather, and Gov. Laura Kelly closed state offices in the capital, Topeka. 


Hundreds of accidents 


In Virginia, where Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency and schools and government offices were closed Tuesday, state police reported 700 accidents and dozens of injuries Tuesday. Matt Demlein, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, said they can't say definitively that all were weather related. 


In southern West Virginia, multiple crashes temporarily shut down several major highways Tuesday. Smith’s Towing and Truck Repair responded to at least 15 calls, mostly from tractor-trailer drivers who got stuck on Interstate 64 in Greenbrier County near the Virginia border, dispatcher Kelly Pickles said. 


“Basically, they just get sucked over into the median or they go off of the interstate just a little bit on the right-hand side,” she said. “And they just don’t have enough power in their vehicles to get back onto the road, due to the icy conditions.” 


‘Skating rinks instead of roads’ 


Paige Williams, who owns Downtown Books in Lexington, Virginia, closed her store Tuesday because of the weather. She hoped to reopen Wednesday, noting that Lexington and surrounding Rockbridge County are dependable when it comes to clearing the roads. 


But with temperatures on either side of freezing Tuesday night and Wednesday, the rain that is supposed to follow could make the roads better or worse. 


“It’s just going to depend on where those temperatures go,” Williams said. “Rain can clear things off. And rain can also freeze. And then you have a lot of skating rinks instead of roads.” 


Bitter cold temperatures 


An Arctic air mass stretched from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes. 


The temperature bottomed out Tuesday morning at minus 35 Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died from cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. 


Advocates for homeless people in the city of about 35,000 were out on the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear to anyone who needed them, according to Erickson. 


“When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,” Erickson said. 


In Oregon’s Multnomah County, officials extended a state of emergency through at least Thursday. Five emergency shelters were set to open Tuesday night through Wednesday afternoon. Midweek wind chill readings could dip to minus 12 Celsius in Portland, the weather service said.

## US teacher returns home after being freed by Russia

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed American teacher Marc Fogel to the White House late Tuesday after Fogel was freed from Russia where he had been detained since August 2021 for bringing medically prescribed marijuana into the country.


“I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,” Fogel said as he stood next to Trump.


Fogel praised the president, U.S. diplomats and lawmakers for working to secure his release.


“I am in awe of what they all did,” Fogel said.


Trump said he appreciated what Russia did in letting Fogel go home but declined to specify the details of any agreement with Russia beyond calling it “very fair” and very reasonable.”


Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that the United States was releasing a Russian citizen from a U.S. prison as part of the deal and that their identity would be made public once they arrived back in Russia. 


Trump also said another hostage release would be announced Wednesday.


Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, said earlier Tuesday the United States and Russia “negotiated an exchange” to free Fogel but gave no details about what the U.S. side of the bargain entailed. In such deals in recent years, the U.S. has often released Russian prisoners that Moscow wanted in exchange.


Instead, Waltz cast the deal for Fogel’s release in broader geopolitical terms, saying it was “a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,” an invasion Russia launched against its neighbor in February 2022, with hundreds of thousands killed or wounded on both sides.


Trump had vowed to broker an end to Russia’s war on Ukraine before taking office Jan. 20, but his aides more recently have said he hopes to do it within the first 100 days of his new administration, roughly by the end of April.


“Since President Trump’s swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States,” Waltz said. The recent release of six Americans held in Venezuela and Fogel’s freeing are the only publicly known instances.


Fogel had been traveling with a small amount of medically prescribed marijuana to treat back pain. Once convicted by a Russian court, he began serving his 14-year sentence in June 2022, with the outgoing administration of former President Joe Biden late last year classifying him as wrongfully detained.

## US, Japan aligned in 'peace through strength' to counter China

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — After the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week, the two nations voiced alignment on Trump's "peace through strength" approach toward countering China in the Indo-Pacific region, analysts said.


"The prime minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security — and I also say – peace through strength all over the Indo-Pacific," said Trump, at a press conference after his meeting Friday with Ishiba in Washington.


"We agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese economic aggression, which is quite aggressive," Trump said.


Ishiba said: "Further strengthening the strong and unwavering Japan-U.S. alliance to achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific" is key "to advance the national interests of both of our countries in synergy and to realize peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific."


Analysts say the first official meeting between Trump and Ishiba succeeded in striking agreements on what both leaders consider crucial: combating China's aggression and strengthening their national interests.


Security commitment


Ishiba continued to forge close ties with the U.S. to maintain multilateral alliance security cooperation close to home in the Indo-Pacific, while Trump secured Japanese investments and purchases.


Taken together, analysts say, Ishiba is aligned with Trump's vision of making the U.S. strong at home in his "America First" approach as a prerequisite for maintaining peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific, a region crucial to Japan's defense.




"The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué went a long way to reaffirm Trump's peace through strength approach to the Indo-Pacific," said Kenneth Weinstein, the Japan chair at Hudson Institute.


"The U.S.-Japan leaders' communiqué, which President Trump signed off on, highlighted the importance of multilateral networks in the Indo-Pacific," Weinstein told VOA on Sunday.


"The two leaders intend to advance multilayered and aligned cooperation" with the Quad security dialogue and three separate trilateral ties with South Korea, Australia and the Philippines "to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific," Trump and Ishiba said in a joint statement.


There were concerns by some that Trump would not support alliance security formations aimed at maintaining peace and security in the region.


"A big concern on the part of the Japanese" was whether the Biden administration's emphasis "on the centrality of alliance" or the "so-called multilayered structures" or "mini laterals" would continue, said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford University.


Sneider told VOA on Monday, "It was reassuring for the Japanese and for those in the U.S. who are worried whether those types of policies would have continuity that there was at least a written affirmation of those things in the joint statement."


In their joint statement, Trump and Ishiba also expressed "strong opposition" to China's attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea and its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea.


They also expressed support for Taiwan's "meaningful participation in international organizations" and opposed China's efforts to disturb stability across the Taiwan Strait.


At a press briefing held in Beijing on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun, said, "The part of the U.S.-Japan joint statement on China constitutes open interference in China's domestic affairs and an attack and smear against China, which is also aimed at scaremongering in the region."


Increased investment


Trump announced at the press conference that Japan will invest $1 trillion in the U.S., participate in the Alaska LNG project, and invest in, rather than buy, U.S. Steel.




In one of the first executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 20, he made Alaskan natural resources open to development and production and its liquefied natural gas available for sale to U.S. allied nations within the Pacific region.


Ishiba said, "An unprecedented investment" from Japan to the U.S. and the Japanese investments in U.S. Steel are "mutually beneficial" and "contribute not only to the United States and Japan but also to the whole world."  


Weinstein, at Hudson, said, "The announcement of a trillion dollars in foreign investment in the U.S. was the landmark moment, as was the announcement of the investments in the LNG sector" and "the pending U.S. Steel investment."


"Ishiba is supporting what is in Japan's best interest: an alliance with minimal distance between the U.S. and Japan," he said. "So he understands he needs to back the America First approach to continue alignment with the Trump administration. A strong America is the best guarantee for global peace and stability."


In explaining what foreign policy would look like under the Trump administration, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during his confirmation hearing in January, emphasized "a foreign policy centered on our national interest" and making the U.S. strong first at home as the prerequisite for maintaining peace and security around the world.


"Ishiba respects Trump's America First" policy, but he is also a "Japan first" prime minister, said Yuki Tatsumi, director of the Japan Program at the Stimson Center.


She told VOA on Friday that "both leaders gained. Trump got a commitment of increased investment by Japan in the U.S., while Ishiba gained Trump's articulation of the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japanese territory, including the Senkaku Islands, and the joint statement in which U.S.-Japan support for Taiwan was articulated."


In the joint statement, Ishiba and Trump underscored the United States' "unwavering commitment" to defending Japan using its full range of capabilities, including nuclear capabilities. The two also "reiterated their strong opposition to any action that seeks to undermine Japan's long and peaceful administration of the Senkaku Islands."


There is "continuity" from the Biden administration to the Trump administration, Tatsumi said, and that is to make U.S.-Japan ties "the hub of alliance cooperation and partnership across the Indo-Pacific."

## Giant schnauzer named Monty wins top prize at Westminster Kennel Club

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A giant schnauzer named Monty won the top prize at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show Tuesday night.


Monty bested six other finalists to take best in show at Madison Square Garden. The award is considered the most prestigious prize in the U.S. dog show world.


Each dog is judged according to how closely it matches the ideal for its breed.


Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash prize.


Other finalists included a bichon frisé called Neal, a Skye terrier named Archer, a whippet and repeat runner-up known as Bourbon, a shih tzu called Comet who's been a finalist before, a German shepherd named Mercedes, who came in second last year, and an English springer spaniel called Freddie.


Monty made the finals for a third year in a row and won the huge American Kennel Club's big show in December.


A Westminster win is considered the most prestigious award in the U.S. dog show world. Each dog is judged according to how closely it matches the ideal for its breed.


Winners get a trophy, ribbons and bragging rights, but no cash prize.


Every dog at Westminster is a titled champion, but they also are household pets. Some also do therapy work, search-and-rescue or other canine jobs.


"A good German shepherd is an all-purpose dog," said co-breeder and co-owner Sheree Moses Combs of Wardensville, West Virginia. Some of her pups have become service dogs for wounded veterans, she said.


"Dog shows are fun, but that is what our breed is all about," she said.


Big dogs had their day at Westminster on Tuesday, when "working" breeds had their turns in the ring. First-round competitor Brina, for instance, is a 71.6 kilogram Neapolitan mastiff.


"I've been struck by this breed since I was 12. ... They're so unique," owner Yves Belmont, Ph.D., said as Brina napped in her crate, equipped with a 7.5-liter water bucket.


With their size, jowly heads and guard-dog history, the breed was developed to be imposing. But Belmont, who currently has several of them at his family's Atlanta-area home, said he also is impressed by their intelligence.


A trip to Westminster is a reminder of dogs' variety, even just among purebreds. The same day Brina competed, Tyra the miniature bull terrier also strutted her stuff. Formally called GCH CH Rnr's Top Model, she's named after fashion model Tyra Banks.


The hardy terrier breed is "a big dog in a small package, but they always keep you smiling," said owner and co-breeder Jessica Harrison of Austin, Texas. Asked where the 2-year-old Tyra falls on the mischief meter, Harrison smiled, "like a nine, for sure."


"You can't be upset with them because they're just so cute," she said as Tyra rolled on her back to get a belly rub from a passerby at the Javits Center, the convention venue that hosted the first-round judging of each breed.


Regardless which dog gets the trophy at Westminster, others also have scored points with the crowd.


During two nights of semifinals, spectators shouted out breeds and names of canine competitors as if they played for one of the pro teams that call the Garden home, the NBA's New York Knicks and NHL's New York Rangers.


"Love you, Lumpy!" someone yelled to a Pekingese named Lumpy, who earned laughs for his ambling gait.


The arena erupted with cheers for a golden retriever named Tuffy, a representative of a popular breed that has never won. Calaco, a Xoloitzcuintli, got huge applause for a confident performance that also earned him some recognition from the judge. Xoloitzcuintlis, are hairless dogs with deep roots in Mexico.


A Doberman pinscher called Penny got whoops of approval from spectators, too. Despite her dignified, focused appearance, Penny can be "a mush," breeder and co-owner Theresa Connors-Chan of Ontario, Canada, said earlier in the day.


Westminster also featured agility and obedience championships, held Saturday. The agility prize went to a border collie named Vanish, and an Australian shepherd called Willie triumphed in obedience.

## White House fires USAID inspector general after funding oversight warning, officials say

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The White House fired the inspector general for the U.S. Agency for International Development on Tuesday, several U.S. officials said. The dismissal comes a day after his office warned that the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID had made it all but impossible to monitor $8.2 billion in unspent humanitarian funds. 


The White House gave no reason for the firing of Inspector General Paul Martin, one of the officials said. The dismissal was first reported by CNN. The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. 


Inspectors general are typically independently funded watchdogs tasked with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse at government agencies. The Trump administration earlier purged more than a dozen inspectors general. 


On Monday, Martin's office issued a flash report warning that the Trump administration's funding freeze and staff actions within USAID had left oversight of the humanitarian aid "largely nonoperational." 


That includes the agency's greatly reduced ability to ensure none of the $8.2 billion in unspent unhumanitarian funds falls into the hands of violent extremist groups or goes astray in conflict zones, the watchdog said. 


Multiparty lawsuit 


Separately, a lawsuit filed Tuesday alleged that the Trump administration's fast-paced dismantling of USAID is stiffing American businesses on hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills for work that has already been done. 


The administration's abrupt freeze on foreign aid also is forcing mass layoffs by U.S. suppliers and contractors for USAID, including 750 furloughs at one company, Washington-based Chemonics International, the lawsuit says. 


"One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order," the U.S. businesses and organizations said. 


An organization representing 170 small U.S. businesses, major suppliers, an American Jewish group aiding displaced people abroad, the American Bar Association and others joined the court challenge. 


It was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington against President Donald Trump; Secretary of State Marco Rubio; acting USAID Deputy Administrator Peter Marocco, a Trump appointee who has been a central figure in hollowing out the agency; and Russell Vought, Trump's head of the Office of Management and Budget. 


Marocco defended the funding cutoff and push to put all but a fraction of USAID staff on leave in an affidavit filed late Monday in the lawsuit brought by the workers' groups. 


"Insubordination" and "noncompliance" by USAID staffers made it necessary to stop funding and operations by the agency to allow the administration to carry out a program-by-program review to decide which U.S. aid programs could resume overseas, Marocco wrote. 


It is at least the third lawsuit over the administration's rapid unraveling of the U.S. aid and development agency and its programs worldwide. Trump and ally Elon Musk have targeted USAID in particular, saying its work is out of line with Trump's agenda. 


Marocco, Musk and Rubio have overseen an across-the-board freeze on foreign assistance and an agency shutdown under a January 20 executive order by Trump. A lawsuit brought by federal employees associations has temporarily blocked the administration from pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job. The funding freeze and other measures have persisted, including the agency losing the lease on its Washington headquarters. 


Interceding for farmers 


The new administration terminated contracts without the required 30-day notice and without back payments for work that was already done, according to a U.S. official, a businessperson with a USAID contract and an email seen by The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal by the Trump administration. 


For Chemonics, one of the larger of the USAID partners, the funding freeze has meant $103 million in unpaid invoices and almost $500 million in USAID-ordered medication, food and other goods stalled in the supply chain or ports, the lawsuit says. 


For the health commodities alone, not delivering them "on time could potentially lead to as many as 566,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and unmet reproductive health needs, including 215,000 pediatric deaths," the lawsuit says. 


Meanwhile, seven Republican lawmakers from farm states introduced legislation to safeguard a long-running $1.8 billion food-aid program run by the aid agency, by moving the Food for Peace program under the Department of Agriculture. 


Farmers, a politically important bloc for the Trump administration, have been affected by the administration's funding freeze as well. Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran, who announced the legislation, over the weekend thanked Rubio for interceding to allow delivery of $560 million in U.S.-grown commodities intended for hunger programs worldwide but stuck in ports because of the administration's abrupt cutoff of foreign assistance spending.

## New York health department confirms first case of new mpox strain

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

The New York State Department of Health on Tuesday confirmed its first case of the new mpox strain, adding to the global concerns over the spread of the little-known variant.


According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were three confirmed cases in the country — in California, Georgia and New Hampshire — caused by the clade Ib strain. The agency said the three cases were not linked.


The World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years in August, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighboring countries.


The New York State Department of Health declined to provide further information on the case.

## DOGE cuts $900M from agency tracking US students' progress

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A federal research agency that tracks the progress of America's students is to lose $900 million in funding after Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency found no need for much of its work. 


It's unclear to what degree the Education Department's Institute of Education Sciences will continue to exist after Musk's team slashed scores of contracts. Industry groups said at least 169 contracts were suddenly terminated Monday, accounting for much of the institute's work. 


The Education Department did not immediately share details on the cuts. Madison Biedermann, an agency spokesperson, said the action will not affect the institute's primary work, including the NAEP assessment, known as the nation's report card, and the College Scorecard, a database of university costs and outcomes. 


Musk's grip on the Education Department was dealt a setback Tuesday when the agency temporarily blocked DOGE workers from more than a dozen internal systems containing sensitive information. As part of a lawsuit challenging its access, the department agreed to block Musk's team until at least Monday while a judge weighs a broader pause. 


Advocates sound alarm


The cuts to the institute raised alarm among advocates who said it could hurt the accountability of America's education system, leaving the nation in the dark on schools' effectiveness. Historically, achievement gaps have shown low-income students and students of color falling behind their peers. 


The cuts are counterproductive and destructive, said Rachel Dinkes, president and CEO of the Knowledge Alliance, a coalition of education research firms. "Cutting out at the knees the one independent agency that helps improve student outcomes is ridiculous," Dinkes said. 


Biedermann declined to share the names of vendors whose contracts were cut. 


Cuts under contract clause 


The Institute of Education Sciences is a central source of information on the health of America's education system. Across the country, it tracks student progress over time and across demographics. It evaluates the effectiveness of federal programs, and colleges and schools rely on its research to improve student outcomes. 


The cuts appear to have been carried out under a clause allowing IES to end contracts at any time "for the government's convenience," according to notices obtained by The Associated Press. 


Among the projects being cut is a study exploring how to accelerate math learning for students in fourth and fifth grade, according to a document obtained by the AP. Known as ReSolve, the project was being led by research group MDRC. 


Last month, IES released the latest NAEP results, revealing that America's children have continued to lose ground on reading skills and made little improvement in math in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 


Activate Research, a small business, lost four contracts and plans to lay off at least 20 of its 28 workers. The company was hired to ensure accuracy and objectivity in reports. When founder Dinah Sparks announced the company was winding down Tuesday, she had a message for her team: "We are not waste," she said. "We did valuable work for the U.S. taxpayer." 


Another small business lost multiple contracts after being hired to collect basic information on the nation's schools. The company started laying off workers this week, according to an employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. 


Congress gave the institute about $800 million last year, roughly 1% of the Education Department's annual budget. 


Associations call to reinstate contracts 


Two prominent research associations jointly called for the contracts to be reinstated, saying much of IES' work is mandated by Congress and relies on contracts to support its limited staff. The groups said 169 contracts had been cut, curbing the institute's ability to report data on school finances and student outcomes. 


The institute oversees a wide range of work, including the administration of the NAEP exam and U.S. participation in PISA, an assessment that compares academic progress across nations. It's also a major funder of education research and keeps a database of research that has shown results in improving education. 


IES shines a light on inequity, and its work is "more than just numbers and statistics," said the Education Trust, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. "Without it, we are left in the dark, unable to see where educational gaps exist or how to close them," the group said in a statement. 


Mark Schneider, a former IES commissioner appointed by President Donald Trump in 2018, said the cuts give the new administration a chance to rethink programs that have changed little in decades.  


"The question is not what happened on Monday; it's what happens next," Schneider said. "If we just swing this sledgehammer, break all this stuff and say, 'OK, done,' then we've wasted an opportunity to fix things." 


Democratic Senator Patty Murray, a former teacher and member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said she will be "sounding the alarm" to fight the cuts. 


Trump has promised to abolish the Education Department and turn its power over to states and schools. The White House is considering an order that would direct Trump's education chief to dismantle the agency as far as possible while calling on Congress to fully shut it down. 


It's unclear how far Trump could act on his own to slash the department's spending, much of which is ordered by Congress.

## First US Navy ships sail through Taiwan Strait since Trump inauguration

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING/TEIPEI — Two U.S. Navy ships sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait this week in the first such mission since President Donald Trump took office last month, drawing an angry reaction from China, which said the mission increased security risks.


The U.S. Navy, occasionally accompanied by ships from allied countries, transits the strait about once a month. China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, says the strategic waterway belongs to it.


The U.S. Navy said the vessels were the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Ralph Johnson and Pathfinder-class survey ship, USNS Bowditch. The ships carried out a north-to-south transit Feb. 10-12, it said.


"The transit occurred through a corridor in the Taiwan Strait that is beyond any coastal state's territorial seas," said Navy Commander Matthew Comer, a spokesperson at the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command. "Within this corridor all nations enjoy high-seas freedom of navigation, overflight, and other internationally lawful uses of the sea related to these freedoms."


China's military said that Chinese forces had been dispatched to keep watch.


"The U.S. action sends the wrong signals and increases security risks," the Eastern Theatre Command of the People's Liberation Army said in a statement early Wednesday.


China considers Taiwan its most important diplomatic issue and it is regularly a stumbling block in Sino-U.S. relations.


China this week complained to Japan over "negative" references to China in a statement issued after a meeting between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.


That statement called for "maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait," and voiced support for "Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations."


Asked in Beijing on Wednesday about the U.S. warships, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said that Taiwan was a "core interest" for the country and that the United States should act with caution.


"We are resolutely opposed to this and will never allow any outside interference, and have the firm will, full confidence and capability to uphold the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity," she said.


Taiwan's defense ministry said its forces had also kept watch but noted the "situation was as normal."


China's military operates daily in the strait as part of what Taiwan's government views as part of Beijing's pressure campaign.


On Wednesday, Taiwan's defense ministry said that it had detected 30 Chinese military aircraft and seven navy ships operating around the island in the previous 24 hour period.


"I really don't need to explain further who is the so-called troublemaker around the Taiwan Strait. All other countries in the neighborhood have a deep appreciation of this," ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang told reporters in Taipei.


Chinese state television said on Wednesday that since Lunar New Year's Eve on January 28, the Eastern Theatre Command had repeatedly dispatched sea and air forces to carry out "combat readiness" patrols and training missions around Taiwan.


China’s operations aim to "guard the joy and peace of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait," the report said.


The last publicly acknowledged U.S. Navy mission in the strait was in late November, when a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft flew over the waterway.


The last time a U.S. Navy ship was confirmed to have sailed through the strait was in October, a joint mission with a Canadian warship.


Taiwan President Lai Ching-te rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

## Appeals court rejects push to reinstate spending freezes on grants, loans

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a Trump administration push to reinstate a sweeping pause on federal funding, a decision that comes after a judge found the administration had not fully obeyed an earlier order.


The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned back the emergency appeal, though it said it expected the lower court judge to act quickly to clarify.


The Justice Department had asked the appeals court to let it implement sweeping pauses on federal grants and loans, calling the lower court order to keep promised money flowing "intolerable judicial overreach."


That ruling came from U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island, the first judge to find that the administration had disobeyed a court order.


He is presiding over a lawsuit from nearly two dozen Democratic states filed after the administration issued a boundary-pushing memo purporting to halt all federals grants and loans, worth trillions of dollars. The plan sparked chaos around the country.


The administration has since rescinded that memo, but McConnell found Monday that not all federal grants and loans had been restored.


Money for things like early childhood education, pollution reduction and HIV prevention research has remained tied up even after his Jan. 31 order halting the spending freeze plan, the states said.


McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ordered the Trump administration to "immediately take every step necessary" to unfreeze all federal grants and loans.


He also said his order blocked the administration from cutting billions of dollars in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health, a move announced last week.


The Justice Department said McConnell's order prevents the executive branch from exercising its lawful authority, including over discretionary spending or fraud.


"A single district court judge has attempted to wrest from the President the power to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.' This state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist for one more day," government attorneys wrote in their appeal.


The states, meanwhile, argued that the president can't block money that Congress has approved, and the still-frozen grants and loans are causing serious problems for their residents. They urged the appeals court to keep allowing the case to play out in front of McConnell.


The court battle is unfolding as a string of court losses is increasingly frustrating top administration officials by slowing President Donald Trump's wide-ranging agenda .


Judges have also blocked, at least temporarily, Trump's push to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S., access to Treasury Department records by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and a mass deferred resignation plan for federal workers.


The Republican administration previously said the sweeping funding pause would bring federal spending in line with the president's priorities, including increasing fossil fuel production, removing protections for transgender people and ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.


A different federal judge in Washington has also issued a temporary restraining order against the funding freeze plan and since expressed concern that some nonprofit groups weren't getting their funding.

## Vance stakes claim to US leadership in AI

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance on Tuesday vowed that the United States would maintain its leadership position in the development of advanced artificial intelligence and warned leaders of other countries not to adopt regulatory standards that might "kill" the new technology "just as it's taking off." 


"The United States of America is the leader in AI, and our administration plans to keep it that way," Vance told an audience of world leaders at an AI summit in Paris. He said the administration of President Donald Trump "will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the U.S. with American-designed and manufactured chips." 


Vance said that the U.S. is open to collaboration with its allies. "But," he said, "to create that kind of trust, we need international regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than strangles it, and we need our European friends in particular to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation." 


Regulations criticized 


The vice president criticized the European Union's regulatory structure, in particular the privacy-focused General Data Protection Regulation and the misinformation-focused Digital Services Act, and he said the Trump administration will not accept foreign governments "tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints." 


Vance also appeared to criticize the effort in Europe to replace power generated by burning fossil fuels with more sustainable sources, saying that countries are "chasing reliable power out of their nations" at a time when AI systems demand ever-greater access to electricity. 


"The AI future is not going to be won by handwringing about safety," Vance said. "It will be won by building — from reliable power plants to the manufacturing facilities that can produce the chips of the future." 


While dozens of countries in attendance at the summit signed a joint declaration on "building trustworthy data governance frameworks to encourage development of innovative and privacy-protective AI," the U.S. and U.K. did not. 


More calls for reduced regulation 


Although not as dismissive of regulations and safety concerns as Vice President Vance, other leaders at the summit appeared to agree that the regulatory burden on companies in the AI field should be lightened. 


French President Emmanuel Macron, the summit's host, said that while safety concerns are important, Europe also needs to make it easier for AI firms there to move quickly and innovate at the same pace as other countries. 


"At the national and European scale, it is very clear that we have to resynchronize with the rest of the world," Macron said. 


European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen defended the bloc's privacy regulations and other standards, pointing out that they are meant to help businesses by creating rules that apply uniformly across all 27 member countries. 


"At the same time, I know that we have to make it easier, and we have to cut red tape — and we will," von der Leyen said. 


Veiled China comments 


Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, who also attended the summit, said Beijing is prepared to work with other countries to develop AI technology, and it is willing to share its discoveries in the field with the aim of creating "a community with a shared future for mankind." 


In his remarks on Tuesday, Vance did not mention China by name but appeared to warn other nations against engaging in the kind of collaboration that Zhang described. 


Vance spoke of "hostile foreign adversaries" that "have weaponized AI software to rewrite history, surveil users and censor speech" and authoritarian regimes that have "stolen and used AI to strengthen their military intelligence and surveillance capabilities to capture foreign data and create propaganda to undermine other nations national security." 


Partnering with authoritarian regimes, Vance said, "means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure." 


The remarks came at a time when the U.S. is taking wide-ranging action to prevent China from gaining access to the most cutting-edge AI technologies. Recent news reports revealing that a seemingly innovative Chinese AI chatbot known as DeepSeek has been collecting user data and storing it on insecure servers in China has led several nations to restrict access to the service. 


On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Gou Jiakun said in a press conference: "We take the safety and security of AI seriously, and support entrepreneurial innovation by Chinese companies, thus contributing China's part to global AI development." 


"We have helped developing countries enhance capacity building, advocating that AI technologies should be open-sourced and there should be greater accessibility to AI services so that the benefits of AI can be shared by all countries. That said, we are against drawing lines along ideological difference, overstretching the concept of national security, or politicizing trade and tech issues," Gou said.  


Tech researchers concerned 


Vance's remarks about excessive AI safety concerns were in sync with actions taken so far by the Trump administration. On the day he took office, President Trump rescinded an executive order signed by his predecessor entitled, "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence." 


Following Vance's remarks Tuesday, U.S.-based artificial intelligence researchers warned that a world in which the U.S. declines to require companies to adopt AI safety precautions could make collaboration with colleagues in countries with stronger protections difficult. 


"In order to build effective AI, you have to source data globally, so you have more accurate, complete and representative data sets," Susan Ariel Aaronson told VOA. She is a professor at George Washington University and co-leader of the National Science Foundation's Trustworthy AI Institute for Law and Society. 


"Many AI researchers believe we're running out of data," Aaronson said. "The future for these firms, the future [for these] markets are overseas, and so we need rules to govern how we interact with policymakers and users in those markets."  


Mona Sloane, a professor at the University of Virginia who leads an AI research lab, told VOA that maintaining access to those data sets is a prevailing concern. 


"If you talk to people in the research community in the United States, those folks are acutely worried about access to data sets, about collaborating [internationally] on AI questions, or using AI in their research," she said. 


"There will be very severe implications for research in the United States on AI — but also with AI — by getting cut off from these international conversations," Sloane said.

## Trump pauses enforcement, orders review of foreign corruption act

date: 2025-02-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has ordered a pause and review of a law that has defined the activities of U.S. business overseas for nearly five decades, claiming that the strict prohibitions against bribing foreign officials strangle American competitiveness in a tough global market.  


"It's going to mean a lot more business for America," Trump said as he signed the order on Monday for the Department of Justice to pause ongoing investigations and review the 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for the next six months.  


The order argues that "overexpansive and unpredictable FCPA enforcement against American citizens and businesses — by our own Government — for routine business practices in other nations not only wastes limited prosecutorial resources that could be dedicated to preserving American freedoms, but actively harms American economic competitiveness and, therefore, national security." 


But the latest annual review of the law's enforcement by Stanford Law School says the number of enforcement actions in 2024 were "well below the ten-year average of 36," with 26 cases that year filed by the two entities responsible for enforcement — the DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  


"This decline suggests that each bribery scheme yielded more unique actions against a corporation and its subsidiaries, employees, and agents, but that fewer separate schemes were targeted for enforcement in 2024," the report concluded.  


The president's order garnered criticism from anti-corruption advocates.  


"The world must not default to where bribery and corruption are the norm," Gary Kalman, executive director of Transparency International U.S., said in a statement to VOA. "A race to the bottom harms both the citizens in the country and the businesses involved in corrupt transactions. Those who do choose to flout the law often face multiple bribery demands that delay or prevent these businesses from obtaining the licenses and permits they need to enter overseas markets. In the end, bribery is a lose-lose proposition." 


Bribery is still illegal  


Private legal experts rushed Tuesday to clarify the order's scope and significance.  


"Bribery is still Illegal," according to the headline of the analysis issued Tuesday morning by Washington-based multinational law firm Arnold & Porter. 


The eight lawyer-authors go on to say in their analysis that not only does bribery remain illegal under the law, which has not been repealed by Congress, but also under various state, federal and foreign laws. They also note that other countries have boosted their enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  


"For now, we recommend that companies wait and see what will happen, and meanwhile continue to focus on compliance," the lawyers concluded.  


Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, a constitutional lawyer, said Tuesday that the new order "puts America on the side of 'routine' corrupt business practices all over the world." The order, he said, gives corporations "free rein to pay bribes, kickbacks, and financial tribute to corrupt foreign officials." 


His statement also took aim at Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman whose closeness to Trump has put him at the head of efforts to radically reshape the U.S. government and target waste, fraud and corruption through his Department of Government Efficiency.  


"The Trump-Musk Administration is making bribery and corruption perfectly legal again," Raskin wrote in a statement. "The prices of eggs and other groceries, housing and rent and electricity continue to soar, but it just became a lot cheaper to engage in political corruption."  


Musk and his companies have tangled publicly with the SEC and the Department of Commerce, but neither his name nor those of any of the businesses he is associated with appears on either's complete list of FCPA enforcement actions.

## What we can learn from a past tariff tiff

date: 2025-02-12, from: Market Place, Make me Smart

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If President Donald Trump goes through with his plan to levy sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, it wouldn&#8217;t be the first time the U.S. has done such a thing. Ever heard of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930? Anyone? Those tariffs are widely credited with sinking the United States deeper into the Great Depression. And although global trade looks different nowadays, they can teach us a lot about how Trump&#8217;s protectionist approach to global trade could play out. On the show today, Inu Manak, a fellow for trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, explains how the Smoot-Hawley tariff debacle can shed light on the current moment, why the president has the power to wield tariffs in the first place, and how punishing trading partners could leave the U.S. economy at a disadvantage. Plus, what this fight has to do with the 1980s film &#8220;Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off&#8221; and Roomba vacuum cleaners!</p>

## Trump signs executive order to continue downsizing federal workforce

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — President Donald Trump made a rare appearance with Elon Musk, his most powerful adviser, in the Oval Office on Tuesday before signing an executive order to continue downsizing the federal workforce.


The Associated Press reviewed a White House fact sheet on the order, which is intended to advance Musk's work slashing spending with his Department of Government Efficiency.


Musk said there are some good people in the federal bureaucracy, but they need to be accountable and called it an "unelected" fourth branch.


"The people voted for major government reform, and that's what the people are going to get," he said. "That's what democracy is all about."


It was Musk's first time taking questions from reporters since he joined the Trump administration as a special government employee with sprawling influence over federal agencies. He's also the world's richest person and the owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.


Despite concerns that he's amassing unaccountable power with little transparency, Musk described himself as an open book. He joked that the scrutiny was like a "daily proctology exam."


The White House fact sheet said that "agencies will undertake plans for large-scale reductions in force and determine which agency components (or agencies themselves) may be eliminated or combined because their functions aren't required by law."


It also said that agencies should "hire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart from federal service." There are plans for exceptions when it comes to immigration, law enforcement and public safety.


Trump and Musk are pushing federal workers to resign in return for financial incentives, although their plan is currently on hold while a judge reviews its legality. The deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, would allow employees to quit and still get paid until Sept. 30. Administration officials said more than 65,000 workers have taken the offer.


Hundreds of people gathered for a rally Tuesday across the street from the U.S. Capitol in support of federal workers.


Janet Connelly, a graphic designer with the Department of Energy, said she's fed up with emails from the Office of Personnel Management encouraging people to take the deferred resignation program.


She tried to use her spam settings to filter out the emails but to no avail. Connelly said she has no plans to take the offer.


"From the get-go, I didn't trust it," she said.


Connelly said she thinks of her work as trying to do an important service for the American public.


"It's too easy to vilify us," she said.


Others have said fear and uncertainty have swept through the federal workforce.


"They're worried about their jobs. They're worried about their families. They're also worried about their work and the communities they serve," said Helen Bottcher, a former Environmental Protection Agency employee and current union leader in Seattle.


Bottcher participated in a press conference hosted by Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington.


Murray said workers "deserve better than to be threatened, intimidated and pushed out the door by Elon Musk and Donald Trump." She also said that "we actually need these people to stay in their jobs or things are going to start breaking."

## US withdrawal from UN human rights body draws mixed reactions

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Human rights experts in Washington are divided over whether the U.S. withdrawal from a United Nations body on human rights will hurt North Korea’s already poor human rights situation.


Last Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order pulling the U.S. out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, or UNHRC, reintroducing the stance he held during his previous term.




The executive order said that the UNHRC has “protected human rights abusers by allowing them to use the organization to shield themselves from scrutiny,” adding that the council deserves “renewed scrutiny.”


The decision was announced ahead of Trump’s recent meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited Washington for the first time since Trump’s second inauguration.




Since his first term, President Trump has been disapproving of the activities of the U.N. human rights body. In June 2018, the Trump administration criticized the UNHRC for its “bias against Israel,” stressing the council that year passed resolutions against Israel more than those passed against North Korea, Iran and Syria combined.


Negative impact


Robert King, who served as the U.S. special envoy for North Korea’s human rights under the Obama administration, said that the U.S. decision to withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council could negatively undermine international efforts to improve human rights conditions in the North.


“It will have a negative impact. The U.N. Human Rights Council has been a very effective body in terms of calling attention to North Korea’s serious human rights abuses,” King told VOA Korean on the phone last week. “And the fact that the United States will not be an active participant is again a very unfortunate situation.”


Roberta Cohen, former deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights, said leaving the UNHRC is “a short-sighted decision."


Cohen, who also served as senior adviser to the U.S. Delegation to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and the General Assembly, said it is important that the U.S. be seated at the council with a vote and be active in mobilizing support for any new initiatives.


“If the reforms are needed and they are, the U.S. should be involved heavily,” Cohen told VOA Korean by phone last week. “Walking away cedes the floor to your opponents.”


Cohen highlighted that the council was where the Commission of Inquiry on the Human Rights in North Korea, or COI, was conceived. The COI is widely considered to be the first systematic and thorough documentation of Pyongyang’s violations of human rights.


She added that an update of the COI is to be presented in September for the first time in more than a decade, saying that Washington needs to be part of the process when the report is introduced.


However, others question the role of the Human Rights Council in making a real impact on improving North Korea's human rights conditions.


“The Human Rights Council has become a very tragic farce. It was supposed to promote and protect human rights around the world but instead it coddles dictatorships and gives them legitimacy by including them as members of the council,” said Suzanne Scholte, president of the Defense Forum Foundation and a longtime North Korea human rights activist. “We're not addressing the horrific things that are happening to the North Korean refugees in China that are being shot and executed when they’re returned.”


‘Illegitimate’ members


Human rights experts have long criticized Beijing for failing to afford protection to North Korean refugees and forcefully repatriating them to North Korea.




David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy in Washington, said North Korean human rights issues need to be separated from how Trump wants to deal with the United Nations.


“This is about the Trump administration’s views toward U.N. organizations and how they are being misused by countries such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea,” Maxwell told VOA Korean on Monday via email. “When these organizations are coerced by members of the so-called axis of upheaval, they are not able to support the people who are suffering true human rights abuses.”


Meanwhile, Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow and the SK-Korea Foundation chair at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies in Washington, said the U.S. has other tools to address the North Korean human rights issue.


“Pulling out of the UNHRC won’t make much of a difference practically speaking,” Yeo told VOA Korean via email last week. “The U.S. has other means and platforms to raise North Korean human rights objections, including its own State Department human rights reports.”


The U.S. rejoined the UNHRC shortly after the inauguration of Joe Biden as president in 2021, but the Biden administration decided not to seek a second term as a board member of the council when the three-year membership was to expire at the end of 2024.


The move was made amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, which launched a surprise attack on the former a year prior. The State Department explained at the time that the U.S. decided not to pursue a second term at the council “because we are engaged with our allies about the best way to move forward.”


Every March or April, the State Department releases the annual Human Rights Reports, which cover the human rights situations around the world. The document last year said there were credible reports of unlawful killing, enforced disappearances and torture taking place in North Korea.

## Vance tells Europeans that heavy regulation could kill AI

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

Paris — U.S. Vice President JD Vance told Europeans on Tuesday their "massive" regulations on artificial intelligence could strangle the technology, and rejected content moderation as "authoritarian censorship."


The mood on AI has shifted as the technology takes root, from one of concerns around safety to geopolitical competition, as countries jockey to nurture the next big AI giant.


Vance, setting out the Trump administration's America First agenda, said the United States intended to remain the dominant force in AI and strongly opposed the European Union's far tougher regulatory approach.


"We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry," Vance told an AI summit of CEOs and heads of state in Paris.


"We feel very strongly that AI must remain free from ideological bias and that American AI will not be co-opted into a tool for authoritarian censorship," he added.


Vance criticized the "massive regulations" created by the EU's Digital Services Act, as well as Europe's online privacy rules, known by the acronym GDPR, which he said meant endless legal compliance costs for smaller firms.


"Of course, we want to ensure the internet is a safe place, but it is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation," he said.


European lawmakers last year approved the bloc's AI Act, the world's first comprehensive set of rules governing the technology.


Vance is leading the American delegation at the Paris summit.




Vance also appeared to take aim at China at a delicate moment for the U.S. technology sector.


Last month, Chinese startup DeepSeek freely distributed a powerful AI reasoning model that some said challenged U.S. technology leadership. It sent shares of American chip designer Nvidia down 17%.


"From CCTV to 5G equipment, we're all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that's been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes," Vance said.


But he said that "partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure. Should a deal seem too good to be true? Just remember the old adage that we learned in Silicon Valley: if you aren't paying for the product, you are the product."


Vance did not mention DeepSeek by name. There has been no evidence of information being able to surreptitiously flow through the startup's technology to China’s government, and the underlying code is freely available to use and view. However, some government organizations have reportedly banned DeepSeek’s use.


Speaking after Vance, French President Emmanuel Macron said that he was fully in favor of trimming red tape, but he stressed that regulation was still needed to ensure trust in AI, or people would end up rejecting it. "We need a trustworthy AI," he said.


European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also said the EU would cut red tape and invest more in AI.




In a bilateral meeting, Vance and von der Leyen were also likely to discuss Trump's substantial increase of tariffs on steel.


OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was expected to address the summit on Tuesday. A consortium led by Musk said on Monday it had offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit controlling OpenAI.


Altman promptly posted on X: "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want."


The technology world has closely watched whether the Trump administration will ease recent antitrust enforcement that had seen the U.S. sue or investigate the industry's biggest players.


Vance said the U.S. would champion American AI -- which big players develop -- he also said: "Our laws will keep Big Tech, little tech, and all other developers on a level playing field."

## Modi to meet Trump with focus on trade, immigration and strategic ties

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

New Delhi — As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi heads to the United States for a two-day visit starting Wednesday, officials in New Delhi expressed optimism that the visit will herald a renewed and substantive partnership. However analysts said there will be contentious issues to navigate on trade and immigration, which are among U.S. President Donald Trump’s top priorities.


Underlining that Modi will be meeting Trump within weeks of his taking office, Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India-U.S. ties are solid and that “this has been one of our strongest international partnerships.”


Modi will reach Washington after visiting France, where he is attending a global conference on artificial intelligence.


Trade is important for both countries and India has taken steps to demonstrate that it is ready to address concerns of Trump, who has named India among countries that are “very big tariff abusers.” In a phone conversation with Modi last month, Trump called for moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship.


His top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, repeated such concerns on Monday. "India has enormously high" tariffs that lock out imports, he said in an interview with CNBC.




New Delhi, which wants to avoid trade tensions with the U.S., announced earlier this month that it will lower import duties on some items that will benefit American exports such as high-end motorcycles and cars.


It also may offer other concessions that could help American goods gain market access to India and boost energy imports from the U.S., say analysts.


“New Delhi thought it would take a first step and try to resolve differences on trade. But, certainly, as a great negotiator and bargainer, he [Trump] will ask for more,” said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga School of Indo Pacific Studies. “India also bargains very well. So, somehow, we will try to make a compromise that will benefit both.”


For India, the stakes are high — the U.S. is its largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between the two countries was $118 billion, with a surplus of about $32 billion in India’s favor in 2023.


India has not been impacted so far by Trump’s tariff impositions — the latest 25 percent tariffs he imposed on steel and aluminum imports will have merely a marginal impact on India, as New Delhi is a small exporter of steel to the U.S., according to Indian officials.


Strengthening security and defense ties with the U.S., Indian officials say will also be discussed in Washington. According to analysts that could include potential purchases of weapon systems and technology. In the recent phone conversation with Modi, President Trump had called on Modi to increase procurement of American-made security equipment.


India, the world’s largest spender on military equipment, needs a range of weapons systems to modernize its military. As it diversifies its purchases from its traditional weapons supplier, Russia, India has been purchasing more arms from countries like France, Israel and the United States.


“The U.S. is a little concerned that it is losing out on the India [security] buys, so it has stepped up pressure to sell India a lot more defense equipment than India has bought in the last few years,” according to Rahul Bedi, defense analyst in New Delhi. “There is likely to be initiatives on transport aircraft, surveillance aircraft for the navy, and possibly even fighter aircraft, as well as a lot of technology transfers for aircraft engines, infantry combat vehicles.”


Immigration is another issue of concern to both countries. Although India has cooperated with the U.S. and said it is ready to take back undocumented migrants, reports of 104 undocumented Indians being shackled for 40 hours while being brought back to India on a military plane last week from the U.S. led to an uproar and protests by opposition parties.




Indian officials have said that New Delhi will call for better treatment during future deportations.


At the same time, India’s top priority during discussions will be to protect legal channels of immigration for skilled Indian workers and students heading to American universities. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of H1B visas, which allow U.S. employers to hire foreign professionals in specialized fields, such as technology.


“People-to-people relationships constitute the bedrock of our deepening ties with the United States,” Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told lawmakers, while responding to concerns about the transport and treatment of the deportees.


In a statement before leaving New Delhi, Modi called his upcoming meeting with Trump an opportunity to build upon the successes of their collaboration in Trump’s first term.




Mutual concerns about an assertive China are likely to keep the two countries aligned, according to analysts. Along with the U.S., Australia and Japan, India is a partner in the Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific. Analysts point out that the two countries have convergence on geostrategic issues.


“It was president Trump in his first term, who dusted off the Quad, which was in a dormant state for about ten years, and he was solely responsible for reviving it,” said Mahapatra. “This is an area where both the countries have a lot of things in common for maintaining peace, stability and contributing to the growth story in the Indo-Pacific region.”

## Virginia governor declares storm emergency as snow and ice bear down on mid-Atlantic states

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

A wintry mess was bearing down on mid-Atlantic states Tuesday with forecasts of significant snow and ice accumulations prompting warnings of potential power outages.


The National Weather Service said travel would become treacherous Tuesday through early Wednesday in much of Virginia and West Virginia.


Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm, allowing state agencies to assist local governments. Schools and government offices throughout Virginia were set to be closed Tuesday.


The heaviest snow, up to 25.4 centimeters, was forecast in portions of northern and central Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Ice accumulations could range from a glaze in Kentucky and West Virginia to 1.3 centimeters in the Roanoke Valley of southwest Virginia, the weather service said. Power outages and tree damage were likely in places with heavy ice buildups.


“Did you think winter was over? Think again!” the weather service's office in Blacksburg, Virginia, said in a post on the social media platform X.


Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said it has requested 700 additional workers from neighboring utilities to assist with problems by Tuesday morning.


In northern Virginia, the National Park Service closed a portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a narrow highway that winds its way through woods along the Potomac River. The parkway connects multiple small national park sites and has historically been a trouble spot during winter storms for abandoned cars that created a slalom course for snowplows and other vehicles.


Winter storm warnings extended from Kentucky to southern New Jersey, and a flood watch was posted for a wide swath of Kentucky, Tennessee, southwest Virginia and northern Georgia. The snow-and-ice mix was expected to become all rain as temperatures climb by Wednesday afternoon.


A separate storm system is set to bring heavy snow from Kansas and Missouri to the Great Lakes on Wednesday, the weather service said.


Dangerous cold was forecast Tuesday from an Arctic air mass stretching from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes.


The temperature was expected to bottom out Tuesday morning at minus 36 degrees Celsius in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died due to cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission. Advocates for the homeless in the city of about 35,000 planned to be out on the streets distributing sleeping bags, jackets, mittens and other cold weather gear to anyone who needs them, Erickson said.


“When it gets this cold, we kind of pull out all the stops,” he said. “Having all those resources available literally can save their life or keep them from frostbite.”

## Private jets collide at Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, killing 1 person, authorities say

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.  — One person was killed and others were injured when a private jet owned by Mötley Crüe singer Vince Neil collided with another jet Monday afternoon at the Scottsdale Airport in Arizona, authorities said.


Neil's jet was landing at the airport when it veered off the runway and collided with another parked plane, Neil's representative Worrick Robinson, IV, said in a statement. There were two pilots and two passengers on Neil’s plane, but he was not among them.


“Mr. Neil’s thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved, and he is grateful for the critical aid of all first responders assisting today," Robinson said.


The arriving jet veered off the runway and collided with the Gulfstream 200 jet that was parked, according to Kelli Kuester, aviation planning and outreach coordinator at the Scottsdale Airport. It appeared that the primary landing gear of the arriving jet failed, resulting in the collision, she said.


Kuester said four people were on the arriving jet, which had come from Austin, Texas, and one person was in the parked plane.


Two people injured in the collision were taken to trauma centers and one was in stable condition at a hospital, Scottsdale Fire Department Capt. Dave Folio said. He said they were working to recover the body of the person killed in the collision.


“Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody involved in this,” Folio said.


The runway has been closed and will remain closed “for the foreseeable future,” Kuester said.


Scottsdale Mayor Lisa Borowsky said in a statement that she is closely monitoring the situation and is in touch with the airport, police and federal agencies.


“On behalf of the city of Scottsdale, we offer our deepest condolences to those involved in the accident and for those who have been taken to our trauma center for treatment,” she said. “We will keep all affected by this tragedy in our prayers.”


The airport is a popular hub for jets coming in and out of the Phoenix area, especially during big sports weekends like the Waste Management Phoenix Open golf tournament, which attracts huge crowds just a few miles away.


The Scottsdale collision comes after three major U.S. aviation disasters in the past two weeks. 


A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nation’s capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. And last week a small commuter plane crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome, killing all 10 people on board.

## Trump imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports

## Back to plastic: Trump announces US policy ‘to end the use of paper straws’

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday declaring that it is “the policy of the United States to end the use of paper straws.”


Former President Joe Biden’s administration, in an attempt to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, announced a plan in July 2024 to replace plastics with reusable, compostable and highly recyclable products.


Trump’s order Monday stated that paper straws “are nonfunctional, use chemicals that may carry risks to human health, are more expensive to produce than plastic straws, and often force users to use multiple straws.”


He also noted that paper straws are often individually wrapped in plastic, which undermines the environmental argument for their use.


“It’s a ridiculous situation. We’re going back to plastic straws,” Trump said Monday as he signed the order.


The Biden policy aimed to get plastic straws and other single-use plastics out of federal food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.


Trump declared President Joe Biden’s policy “DEAD!” in a social media post over the weekend.


In his Monday order, he instructed agency officials to stop buying paper straws and make sure paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.


He also directed officials to create a national strategy to end the use of paper straws within 45 days.


Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

## Trump imposes 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum imports

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

White House — President Donald Trump on Monday fired another volley in his ongoing trade war, announcing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers.


“It’s a big deal,” Trump said, the thick black marker in his right hand hovering over the executive order.


“This is the beginning of making America rich again,” he said, dragging his distinctive jagged signature over the paper.




Billionaire financier Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to lead the Commerce Department, watched from over Trump’s left shoulder in the Oval Office. Trump's trade adviser said this move will help domestic producers and support U.S. economic and national security. Lutnick spoke of the 120,000 jobs this could bring back.


“You are the president who is standing up for the American steelworker, and I am just tremendously impressed and delighted to stand next to you,” Lutnick said.


The nuts and bolts


Trump’s proclamations raised the rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. And he restored a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports.


Trump’s actions also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminum to be "smelted and cast" in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel.


The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported steel for tariffs.


Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the measures would help U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America's economic and national security.


"The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America's economic and national security," he told reporters.


"This isn't just about trade. It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum," Navarro said.


What now?


Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action Sunday — and the move drew instant pushback in what is unfolding as a tit-for-tat exchange.


Earlier Monday, Beijing enacted additional tariffs on U.S. goods as a countermeasure to Trump’s earlier 10% hike on Chinese goods.


“There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,” said Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “They harm the interests of the people of both countries. What is needed now is not unilateral tariff increases but equal dialogue and consultation based on mutual respect. We urge the U.S. to correct its wrong practices and stop politicizing and instrumentalizing economic and trade issues.”


Most economists believe tariffs raise consumer prices. Scholars of supply chains and logistics say Trump’s move also raises major global policy questions.


“It's not clear whether this is a negotiating strategy, whether this is going to be permanent,” said Professor Sunderesh Heragu of Oklahoma State University. “Is this only restricted to Canada, Mexico and China as it is now, or is it going to expand to the European Union, for example, or even the BRICS countries, of which, you know, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and 12 or 14 other countries, are part of?”


He said these concerns may prompt countries to realign their trade relationships, which will likely alarm producers.


“It clearly causes a lot of confusion, and you know, businesses, again, hate uncertainty,” Heragu said. “So, they're going to put everything on pause. That means, you know, there could be a decrease in production activity, while at the same time, the tariffs could have inflationary effects.”


Some in the automotive industry in Detroit, the U.S.’ “Motor City,” echoed that concern.


"Sudden tariffs to a system — there isn't a lot of good that comes out of that,” said Glenn Stevens Jr., executive director of MichAuto and vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives at the Detroit Regional Chamber.


Studies attempting to understand the impact of these moves yield mixed pictures. The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation estimates that the tariffs will generate around $100 billion each year in federal tax revenue.


Another analysis shows they could “impose significant costs on the broader economy: disrupting supply chains, raising costs for businesses, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs and ultimately driving up consumer prices.”

## Hamas threatens to delay hostage release

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

Hamas officials accused Israel of violating a ceasefire agreement Monday and threatened to delay releasing more hostages, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to say “all hell is going to break out” if all the remaining hostages are not turned over by Saturday.


The next exchange was set for Saturday, with three more Israelis set to be freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners jailed by Israel.


A spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, said in a statement the militants remain committed to the ceasefire terms “as long as the occupation adheres to them.”


Hamas accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, although hundreds of thousands have returned. The group said Palestinians were targeted “with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas” and Israel has failed “to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed.”


However, a United Nations official said 12,600 humanitarian aid trucks have entered Gaza since the ceasefire began and the immediate threat of famine has dissipated.


Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said any delay by Hamas would be “a complete violation” of the ceasefire agreement. He placed the Israeli military on the highest level of alert.


In Washington Monday, Trump said he would propose canceling the ceasefire agreement if all the remaining hostages being held in Gaza were not released by 12 o’clock Saturday, but he did not specify whether that was noon or midnight, and he did not indicate a time zone. 


He also said he might withhold aid to Jordan and Egypt if they don't take Palestinian refugees being relocated from Gaza.


Since the ceasefire took effect last month, Hamas has freed 21 hostages while Israel has released more than 730 prisoners.


Trump has proposed moving Palestinians living in Gaza to an unspecified location outside the territory. Under his plan for the enclave, they would have no right to return.


In an interview with Fox News released Monday, he called his plan for the narrow territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea a "real estate development for the future."


“I would own it," he said, adding that the 2.3 million Palestinians now living in war-ravaged Gaza would be moved to as many as six different sites outside Gaza under a plan that the Arab world, as well as U.S. allies and adversaries alike, have already rejected.


Trump, a billionaire New York real estate magnate before entering politics in 2015, did not say where the Palestinians would be relocated. But when asked by Fox anchor Bret Baier if they would be allowed to return home to Gaza, Trump said, "No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing."


"In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever — it's not habitable,” Trump said of Gaza, decimated by 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas.


In the Fox interview, Trump said he would build "beautiful communities" for the Palestinians.


"Could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is," Trump said.


On Sunday, Israeli troops withdrew from the Netzarim corridor, a narrow strip of land that bisects the territory. It allowed more Palestinians to return to the northern sector where they once lived, but much of the land has been leveled by fighting.


Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed Hamas had "forced the enemy to submit to our demands" and that it thwarted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's “Illusion of achieving total victory."


Israeli officials did not disclose how many soldiers withdrew or to where. Troops currently remain along Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later stage of the initial 42-day ceasefire.


During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The deal also stipulated that Israeli troops would pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim corridor.


In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a "sustainable calm." But details are unclear and yet to be negotiated.


The war in Gaza was triggered by the shock October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities. Israel says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed.

## Justice Dept directs prosecutors to drop charges against New York mayor

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

The Justice Department on Monday directed federal prosecutors in New York to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, according to a memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove.


Bove, a political appointee of President Donald Trump, intervened in the case, saying the indictment of Adams interfered with his 2025 mayoral reelection campaign.


A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, declined to comment.


Prosecutors have not yet indicated to the judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Dale Ho in Manhattan, that they plan to drop the case, court records showed Monday evening.


Adams was the subject of a five-count indictment charging him with accepting travel perks from Turkish officials and political donations from foreigners in exchange for taking actions to benefit Turkey.


Adams pleaded not guilty.

## Musk-led group makes $97.4 billion bid for control of OpenAI

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

A consortium led by Elon Musk said Monday it has offered $97.4 billion to buy the nonprofit that controls OpenAI, another salvo in the billionaire's fight to block the artificial intelligence startup from transitioning to a for-profit firm.


Musk's bid is likely to ratchet up longstanding tensions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of the startup at the heart of a boom in generative AI technology. Altman on Monday promptly posted on X: "no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want."


Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 as a nonprofit, but left before the company took off. He founded the competing AI startup xAI in 2023.


Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of tech and social media company X, is a close ally of President Donald Trump. He spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and leads the Department of Government Efficiency, a new arm of the White House tasked with radically shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Musk recently criticized a $500 billion OpenAI-led project announced by Trump at the White House.


OpenAI is now trying to transition into a for-profit from a nonprofit entity, which it says is required to secure the capital needed for developing the best AI models.


Musk sued Altman and others in August last year, claiming they violated contract provisions by putting profit ahead of the public good in the push to advance AI. In November, he asked a U.S. district judge for a preliminary injunction blocking OpenAI from converting to a for-profit structure.


Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman says the founders originally approached him to fund a nonprofit focused on developing AI to benefit humanity, but that it was now focused on making money.


"It's time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was," Musk said in a statement Monday. "We will make sure that happens."


Musk and OpenAI backer Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.


"Musk's bid puts another wrinkle into OpenAI's quest to remove the nonprofit's control over its for-profit entity," said Rose Chan Loui, executive director of the UCLA Law Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofits.


"This bid sets a marker for the valuation of the nonprofit's economic interests," she said. "If OpenAI values the nonprofit's interests at less than what Musk is offering, then they would have to show why."


The consortium led by Musk includes his AI startup xAI, Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund III, Emanuel Capital Management, and Eight Partners.


XAI could merge with OpenAI following a deal, according to The Wall Street Journal which first reported Musk's offer earlier Monday. XAI recently raised $6 billion from investors at a valuation of $40 billion, sources have told Reuters.


Throwing a wrench


"This (bid) is definitely throwing a wrench in things," said Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor specializing in corporate governance.


"The nonprofit is supposed to take money to do whatever good deeds, and if OpenAI prefers to sell it to somebody else for less money, it's a concern for protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the not-for-profit. If this was a public company, plaintiffs' lawyers would justifiably be lining up down the block to sue that transaction."


OpenAI was valued at $157 billion in its last funding round, cementing its status as one of the most valuable private companies in the world. SoftBank Group is in talks to lead a funding round of up to $40 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of $300 billion, including the new funds, Reuters reported in January.


Aside from any antitrust implications, a deal this size would need Musk and his consortium to raise enormous funds.


"Musk's offer to buy OpenAI’s nonprofit should significantly complicate OpenAI’s current fundraising and the process of converting into a for-profit corporation," said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.


"The offer seems to be backed by more credible investors ... OpenAI may not be able to ignore it. It will be the fiduciary responsibility of OpenAI’s board to decide whether this is a better offer, which could call into question the offer from SoftBank."


Musk's stock in Tesla is valued at roughly $165 billion, according to LSEG data, but his leverage with banks is likely to be thin after his $44 billion buyout of the social media platform that was called Twitter in 2022.

## Facing backlash over $500K salary, LA's wildfire recovery czar agrees to work for free

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Steve Soboroff, a longtime fixture in Los Angeles civic life who is now serving as chief recovery officer for the city’s wildfire comeback, won’t take a salary after facing backlash over plans to pay him $500,000. He would have been paid through charitable donations, not with taxpayer money.


Soboroff had defended the proposed salary of half-a-million dollars for three months of work, saying his expertise as a residential property developer made him worth the price. But after criticisms mounted from elected officials and residents, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reversed course over the weekend and said Soboroff would receive no compensation. Soboroff is the city’s former police commissioner.


“Steve is always there for LA. I spoke to him today and asked him to modify his agreement and work for free. He said yes. We agree that we don’t need anything distracting from the recovery work we’re doing," Bass said in a statement Saturday. She had named him to the recovery czar position on Jan. 17.


A message seeking comment was left for Soboroff on Monday.


Soboroff, 76, raised his family in the Pacific Palisades area, where nearly 7,000 homes were destroyed by last month's inferno. His son, NBC News journalist Jacob Soboroff, reported from the devastated neighborhood where he grew up.


He was initially tasked with leading the first phase of the city’s wildfire rebuilding effort. On Friday though, Bass suggested that the scope of his work could be diminished, saying he would focus primarily on rebuilding the Palisades’ historic business district.


Soboroff disputed that notion, saying he is regularly interacting with federal agencies.


In addition to developing thousands of homes over decades, Soboroff served on the city’s Board of Police Commissioners and on the city commission that oversees the Department of Recreation and Parks — both volunteer positions.


Before the salary reversal, he told the Los Angeles Times that he put aside other real estate and environmental consulting work to take on the role of the city's recovery officer.


“I’ve been doing this for 35 years for free on some of the biggest civic projects for the city of Los Angeles. But nobody ever asked me to drop everything. This time they did,” Soboroff said. “And I said OK, under the condition that my pay not be taken out of city money, or from any wildfire survivors who would otherwise benefit from that money.”


It wasn't clear which charitable organizations would have covered his pay. Los Angeles City Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who sits on the committee overseeing the recovery, called the proposed salary “obscene.”


Soboroff’s original salary was first reported by the Times.

## What the Westminster show dogs' names mean

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

They have names that could make a random password generator cry uncle.


Meet, for example, GCHG CH Calicops Sassafras Gonnakikurass.

“She’s a saucy girl. Her name says it all,” Fred Ortiz said as he groomed the Brussels griffon to compete Monday at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show.


Her name says ... what exactly? Well, ponder the final part, and you may understand what her owners are wryly getting at. But in any event, you can just call her Wrassy.


Westminster’s main competition began Monday with breed-by-breed judging that leads to U.S. dogdom's most illustrious best in show prize, awarded Tuesday night. The kennel club held agility and obedience contests Saturday, as well as other events.


If show dogs are the aristocrats of the canine world, they often have the names, titles and nicknames to match.


Their “registered,” or formal, names are the ones used for showing. Those long, confounding-sounding appellations are packed with show-dog information.


Clumps of capital letters at the beginning, and sometimes also the end, signify the dogs’ achievements in various sports. “GCHG” and “CH,” for example, denote various levels of championship in the traditional, breed-by-breed judging.


After those titles, the first word in a registered name generally indicates the kennel, or breeding program, that produced the dog. Other kennels or dogs in the pedigree might get a shout-out at the end.




Meanwhile, show dogs have “call names” that they go by on a day-to-day basis. A dog might also have had a different “puppy name” bestowed by its breeder and later changed by its eventual owner.


The portmanteau words and puzzling phrases in registered names are partly meant to avoid duplication with other dogs in registries that go back over a century.


But many breeders also use patterns to help them remember which litter was which.


Professional dog handlers and sometime miniature schnauzer breeders Rachel Adams and Alberto Montila name their litters in alphabetical order — one litter had names that start with “A,” the next with “B,” and so on, Adams said Monday. She was blow-drying a French bulldog named GCHG CH Elysium’s Adventurous Rapscallion D’Assisi, better known as Finn.


When Amie McLaughlin picks names for her litters of Norwegian buhunds, she just likes to have pun.


“I like the name to be something that someone looks at and says, ‘Oh, that’s cute,'” said McLaughlin, of Kent, Washington.


A dog she bred and guided Monday, GCH CH Cloudpointe Nothing Betta Than This CGC, was born into a fish-themed litter (hence “Betta,” a type of Southeast Asian fish). He goes by Eirik when he's at home with co-owner Sarah Woodworth in Paloa, Hawaii.


GCH CH Aberdeen's Zoltar RN BN-V — just Zoltar, to his friends — has owners who appreciate humor, too. For one thing, they share their Los Angeles-area home with a shaggy, clownish, 120-pound otterhound who likes to cuddle.


Comedian and actor Chris Hardwick, who owns the dog with his wife, model and actor Lydia Hearst, named Zoltar for the fortune-telling machine that makes a teenager grow to adult proportions overnight in the movie “Big.”


“We knew he was going to grow,” and plenty big, explained Hearst.


Zoltar got some recognition Monday from the judge, but the dog's cousin Melody, aka GCHS CH Dobhran’s Alexa Play Some Music, won best of breed.


Hardwick and Hearst were also cheering on the French bulldog breed winner called Sassy, or GCHS Diva's Sassafras Lass. She and other breed winners were headed into a semifinal round Monday night.




Sassy is owned and was co-bred by Hearst's mother, newspaper heir Patricia Hearst Shaw. Famous in the 1970s for her abduction and involvement in a robbery by a radical group, she's been renowned in recent years for her Frenchies and other show dogs.


Colton Johnson and his family name their litters of old English sheepdogs by themes, such as songs, movies, money, or — appropriately — fluffy things.


One of those “fluff” dogs is GCH CH Bugaboo's Give Me S'more, who lolled on a table while Johnson brushed him Monday.


“It’s his spa day,” joked Johnson, of Colorado Springs, Colorado.


The dog’s call name is Graham, as in the crackers that join toasted marshmallow and chocolate to make s’mores. The Johnsons considered calling him Marsh or Mallow, but those names didn't stick.


Three-year-old Graham is a grandson of Swagger, the old English sheepdog whom Johnson handled to a second-place finish at Westminster in 2013.


Last year's runner-up, a German shepherd named GCHP Kaleef's Mercedes, is back this year for a last hurrah and won her breed Monday. The 5-year-old will retire from showing after this event, co-owner Dr. Cynthian Wilhelmy said.


As for her name, “I wanted something German and something that represented excellence,” said Wilhelmy, of Martinsburg, West Virginia. “Classic, reliable and excellent — that's Mercedes.”

## Democrats look for ways to oppose Trump administration's changes while in the minority

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

Democratic lawmakers criticized what they called the Trump administration’s “extreme” efforts to reshape the U.S. government, vowing to oppose those changes despite limited political capital in both chambers of the U.S. Congress.


House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the chamber’s floor Monday that Republicans were departing from their campaign pledge not to follow Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for reshaping the U.S. government.


“This year, Republicans have spent all of their time implementing the most extreme parts of Project 2025 and have done nothing to lower the high cost of living,” Jeffries said.


Congressional Republicans say Trump is exercising broad presidential authority to reevaluate government agencies. Trump is accomplishing this through Elon Musk, a multibillionaire whom he put in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, whose aim is to reduce federal spending.


Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a letter to colleagues that Democrats have a four-pronged strategy to oppose the Trump administration’s actions: oversight, litigation, legislation, and communication and mobilization.


Schumer also said Democrats would continue to support litigation in the courts to stop the funding freeze and to prevent federal employees from being laid off.


Vice President JD Vance criticized those judicial decisions, writing on X, “If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.”


Democratic Senator Chris Murphy responded on X Monday, “For those of us who believe we are in the middle of a constitutional crisis, this is the meat of it. Trump and Vance are laying the groundwork to ignore the courts — democracy’s last line of defense against unchecked executive power.”


Senate Democrats also announced a new whistleblowers portal for federal civil service employees and public servants to disclose information about wrongdoing.


In a statement, they said, “As Senate Republicans refuse to fulfill their constitutional duty to provide a check on the Executive Branch, Senate Democrats remain steadfast in our commitment to uncovering the truth. We are prepared to issue demand letters, preserve public records, conduct public hearings, and pursue legal action where necessary.”


Schumer said Democrats would support legislation funding the U.S. government but called on Republicans to negotiate in a bipartisan fashion. A short-term resolution funding the U.S. government expires on March 14. Any bill funding the government past that date needs 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to pass. Republicans currently hold the majority in the chamber with 53 seats.

## As tariffs take effect, Beijing and Washington look back to 2020 deal

date: 2025-02-11, from: VOA News USA

New Chinese tariffs on a range of U.S. goods went into effect Monday, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese products last week. Tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum are next.


Despite the tariffs and rising tensions, both sides seem reluctant to launch into a full-on trade war, analysts say.


Beijing has its plate full battling its own internal economic struggles, and for now President Trump has deferred most of his promised tariffs on the world’s second-largest economy.


Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Beijing is preparing to offer to return to a so-called “Phase 1” trade deal that was signed during Trump’s first term.


The Trump administration has sent its own signals as well. 


Trump has called for the Office of the United States Trade Representative to review the first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreement and determine whether Beijing has fulfilled its commitments in the contract.


Last week, Jamieson Greer, Trump’s nominee for U.S. trade representative, said he would assess China's compliance with the first phase of the agreement quickly upon his appointment to ensure the implementation of the deal. Greer also said he would use it as a starting point in relations with China.




What is the Phase 1 deal?


On January 15, 2020, Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed the Phase 1 agreement, which laid out several terms for trade between the world’s two biggest economies. The deal called on the United States to cut some of its imposed tariffs on China and included a commitment from Beijing to buy more U.S. products and implement certain reforms.


The 96-page agreement, divided into eight sections, placed a big emphasis on reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, and protecting domestic industries by cracking down on Chinese trade practices, such as nontariff trade barriers, intellectual property violations and the forced transfer of technology without adequate compensation.




The agreement mandated that China purchase at least $200 billion in U.S. products and services over a two-year period from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. It also required that Beijing stop subsidizing strategic sectors and give fairer treatment to American companies in terms of regulation.


Despite those commitments from China, data from a report published in 2022 by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington showed that Beijing did not reach its purchase target.


The report also showed that Beijing has completed 57% of the spending laid out in the agreement, a total that is lower than the level of China's purchase of goods from the United States before the U.S.-China trade war.


Although China was not expected to fully meet its commitments, the agreement did have some benefits for Washington, as it helped decrease Washington’s trade deficit with Beijing.




Starting point


Analysts say the agreement may be revisited as a starting point for new trade discussions.


“The two sides need to start somewhere. Phase 1 may at least provide some common language that both sides will be familiar with so as to get that ball rolling,” Chad Brown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, explained to VOA in an emailed response Friday.


Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the East-West Center in Hawaii, says the Phase 1 agreement has two advantages for acting as a foundation for U.S.-China trade discussions.


“First, the two sides reached a similar agreement before, so they know it’s feasible,” he told VOA in an emailed response on Friday.


He also explained that using the agreement “suits both sides’ interests.”


"Trump wants to claim he has resolved the bilateral trade imbalance, which he sees as his primary measure of success," he explained, noting that this agreement supports that narrative.


He added that the deal benefits Beijing by allowing China to avoid making significant structural reforms.


Roy, however, adds that several factors make an agreement between Washington and Beijing difficult.


“A major bilateral economic deal would depend on avoiding a strategic crisis, which might occur over Taiwan or the South China Sea, or an encounter between U.S. and Chinese ships or aircraft that escalates, or something like the spy balloon incident,” he said.


Early in 2023, the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon floating through U.S. airspace delayed a U.S. diplomatic visit to the country by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The ballon was eventually shot down.

## Arizona adds endangered bat to list of night-flying creatures that frequent the state

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA — Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive. 


Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders. 


Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva-swabbing campaign. 


The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA — or eDNA — to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home. 


The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988, and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It is an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants. 




Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated. 


“If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you’re not guaranteed to be successful,” said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. “By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit." 


Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall. 


The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall. 


Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge. 


Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months. 


“There’s a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what’s in the database," Riley said. "A little bit like a Google search — you’ve got your question, you’re asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you’ve got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.” 


Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats. 


“They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,” Lear said.

## 15 cases of measles in Texas county with numerous vaccine exemptions

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Fifteen measles cases — mostly in school-aged children — have been confirmed in a small county in West Texas with one of the highest rates of vaccine exemptions in the state.


South Plains Public Health District Director Zach Holbrooks said Monday that his department was first notified in late January about the first two cases in Gaines County, which he said were “two children who had seen a physician in Lubbock.”


Some of the cases appear to be connected to private religious schools in the district, said Holbrooks, who cautioned that the investigation is ongoing.


“I wouldn’t say they’re all connected, but our teams are looking into exposure sites and the background of those cases," he said.


Local health officials set up a drive-through vaccination clinic last week and are offering screening services to residents.


The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. This month, health officials in metro Atlanta are working to contain a measles case that spread to two unvaccinated family members.


Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs.


The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade from .76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year, according to Texas Department of State Health Services data.


Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine: Nearly 14% of children from kindergarten through grade 12 had an exemption in the 2023-24 school year, which is more than five times the state average of 2.32% and beyond the national rate of 3.3%.


But the number of unvaccinated kids in the county is likely significantly higher, DSHS spokesperson Lara Anton said, because Gaines County has many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.


The measles, mumps and rubella vaccines are a two-shot series: The first is recommended at 12 to 15 months old and second between 4 to 6 years old. The vaccine is required to attend most public schools in the U.S.


But vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks. Lawmakers across the country have proposed various vaccine requirement changes at a time when anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is awaiting confirmation as the secretary of Health and Human Services.


One of the early Gaines County cases traveled to neighboring New Mexico while they were still infectious, Anton said, but there were no immediate reports of infection. New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott said the agency has been in communication with Texas officials but there was no known exposure to measles in his state.


“We're going to watch this very closely,” Nott said.


Two cases of measles were reported in early January in the Houston area, but Holbrooks said the West Texas cases don't appear to be connected.


Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it's usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.

## US judge keeps block on Trump federal buyout plan in place for now

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

BOSTON/WASHINGTON — A U.S. judge kept his block on President Donald Trump's buyout plan for federal employees in place on Monday while he considers whether to impose it for a longer period of time. 


The decision by U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Boston prevents Trump's administration from implementing the buyout plan for now, giving a temporary victory to labor unions that have sued to stop it entirely. 


More than 2 million federal civilian employees had faced a midnight deadline Monday to accept the proposal. It is unclear when O'Toole will rule on the request by the unions. 


The buyout effort is part of a far-reaching plan by Trump and his allies to reduce the size and rein in the actions of the federal bureaucracy. Trump, who returned to the presidency on Jan. 20, has accused the federal workforce of undercutting his agenda during his first term in office, from 2017 to 2021. 


Unions have urged their members not to accept the buyout offer — saying Trump's administration cannot be trusted to honor it — but about 65,000 federal employees had signed up for the buyouts as of Friday, according to a White House official. 


Reuters has been unable to independently verify that number, which does not include a breakdown of workers from each agency. 


The offer promises to pay employees their regular salaries and benefits until October without requiring them to work, but that may not be ironclad. Current spending laws expire on March 14, and there is no guarantee that salaries would be funded beyond that point. 


At a court hearing, U.S. Justice Department attorney Eric Hamilton called the buyout plan a "humane off-ramp" for those frustrated by Trump's decision to reduce the size of the workforce and end the ability of many of them to work from home. 


But a lawyer for the unions said the plan had been carried out in a "slap dash" fashion with little regard to how it might disrupt operations at agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. 


"They failed to consider the continued functioning of government," lawyer Elena Goldstein said. 


The administration had initially proposed a deadline of last Thursday before O'Toole, an appointee of Democratic former President Bill Clinton, extended it so he could consider the case. 


Trump has tasked Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, the world's richest person, with overseeing the purge of federal employees through his Department of Government Efficiency, which is not an actual government agency. 


Musk's actions have sown panic among federal workers and prompted public protests. His actions also have led to a flood of calls to U.S. lawmakers by voters worried about the access that Musk's team has been given to sensitive information in government computer systems that contain data on federal payments to Americans and personal details of federal workers. 


Several lawsuits 


The unions and Democratic attorneys general have brought lawsuits challenging Trump's rapid remaking of government and won some initial victories. 


A union that represents Consumer Financial Protection Bureau workers has filed a lawsuit seeking to block acting chief Russell Vought's move to suspend CFPB activities, one of several legal challenges that Trump's administration now faces. 


Democratic attorneys general from 22 U.S. states filed a lawsuit on Monday in Boston challenging sharp cuts to federal grant funding for universities, medical centers and other research institutions by the Trump administration. 


An effort to hollow out the U.S. Agency for International Development is partially on hold after a judge's ruling. 


Trump's effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal loans, grants and other financial assistance has also been paused in a separate case. A federal judge in Rhode Island on Monday ruled that the administration must restore all domestic funding while he considers the case. 


On Saturday, a judge temporarily blocked Musk's entity from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments at the Treasury Department.

## Trump signs executive orders on steel, aluminum tariffs

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Donald Trump moved to substantially raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Monday, canceling exemptions and duty-free quotas for major suppliers Canada, Mexico, Brazil and other countries in a move that could boost the risk of a multifront trade war. 


Trump signed proclamations that raised the tariff rate on aluminum imports to 25% from the previous 10% that he imposed in 2018 to aid the struggling sector. His action reinstates a 25% tariff on millions of tons of steel imports and aluminum imports that had been entering the U.S. duty free under quota deals, exemptions and thousands of product exclusions. 


The proclamations were extensions of Trump's 2018 Section 232 national security tariffs to protect steel and aluminum makers. A White House official said the exemptions had eroded the effectiveness of these measures. 


Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminum to be "smelted and cast" in the region to curb imports of minimally processed Chinese steel into the U.S. 


The order also targets downstream steel products that use imported steel for tariffs. 


Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro said the measures would help U.S. steel and aluminum producers and shore up America's economic and national security. 


"The steel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America's economic and national security," he told reporters. 


"This isn't just about trade. It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum." 


Trump first broached the steel and aluminum action on Sunday, adding that he would also announce a further set of reciprocal tariffs later in the week, drawing warnings of retaliation from trade partners.

## 2 US deportation flights head to Venezuela, alleged gang members aboard

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants deported from the United States — the first since a January deal between the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro — are heading to Venezuela, the South American country's government said Monday. 


The flights, run by Venezuelan airline Conviasa, are part of a plan to repatriate thousands of migrants who fled Venezuela "because of economic sanctions and the campaigns of psychological warfare against our country," the government statement said. 


Some of the people on the flight are allegedly involved in illegal activities with the Tren de Aragua gang, the statement said and will be vigorously investigated for criminal ties. 


Trump envoy Richard Grenell met with Maduro in Caracas on Jan. 31, where the two men discussed migration and sanctions, among other issues. Grenell left the South American country with six Americans who had been held by Venezuelan authorities. 


The Trump administration has said it is a priority to deport members of Tren de Aragua from the U.S. and Trump himself said after Grenell's visit that Maduro agreed to receive all Venezuelan illegal migrants and provide for their transportation back home. 


The Venezuelan government says it destroyed Tren de Aragua within its borders in 2023. 


Trump's administration has also moved to remove deportation protection from about 348,000 Venezuelans in the U.S., who could lose work permits and then be deported in April. 


More than 7 million Venezuelan migrants have left their country in recent years amid a sustained economic and social collapse blamed by the government on sanctions by the United States and others. 


Maduro and several allies have been indicted by the United States on drug trafficking charges and international observers and the country's opposition say a July election which gave Maduro his third term was fraudulent.

## Trump calls for halting penny production, saying it's too expensive

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

RICHMOND, VIRGINIA  — The lowly penny, the forgotten mainstay of coin jars and car cupholders everywhere, may soon be no more.


President Donald Trump announced Sunday he's ordered his administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin, whose buying power is long past its prime.


Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost — currently almost 4 cents per penny, according to the U.S. Mint — and limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which costs almost 14 cents to mint.


Trump's surprise order comes after decades of unsuccessful efforts to pitch the penny.


"Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny. But sometimes traditions get ridiculous," the Farmers' Almanac said in its 1989 edition.


Here's a look at some questions surrounding Trump's order.


Can Trump really order the Treasury to stop minting pennies without Congress' approval?


Yes, according to legal scholar Laurence H. Tribe, the Carl M. Loeb University Professor of Constitutional Law Emeritus at Harvard University.


U.S. code gives the Treasury Secretary the authority to mint and issue coins "in amounts the secretary decides are necessary to meet the needs of the United States."


If Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent decides the amount necessary for the penny is zero, he's within his legal rights, Tribe said.


"Unlike a lot of what the new administration has been doing pursuant to the flood of executive orders since January 20, this action seems to me entirely lawful and fully constitutional," Tribe said, referring to the aggressive executive action Trump's taken on other issues since taking office.


Congress, which dictates currency specifications like the size and metal content of coins, could make Trump's order permanent through law. But past congressional efforts to ditch the penny have failed.


Pennies are mostly made of zinc, and the American zinc lobby has been a major opponent to suggestions that the penny be eliminated.


How many pennies are in circulation?


It depends on what you mean by circulation.


Pennies are the most popular coin made by the U.S. Mint, which reported making 3.2 billion of them last year. That's more than half of all the new coins it made last year.


MIT Professor Jeff Gore, who founded Citizens to Retire the Penny, said coins are supposed to stay in circulation for about 30 years and that in the last three decades the U.S. Mint has made about 250 billion pennies.


But, he says, "because nobody wants to use pennies, they fall out of active circulation much faster than other coins."


If pennies sit in drawer for a decade, Gore asks, "Does that qualify as being in circulation?"


Will Americans miss pennies?


Experience in other countries suggests no.


Canada started phasing out its penny a dozen years ago and urged store owners to round prices to the nearest nickel for cash transactions. Electronic purchases were still billed to the nearest cent. The move came after New Zealand, Australia, the Netherlands and others dropped their lowest-denomination coins.


After dropping the penny or its equivalent, those countries have not looked back.


What comes next?


Trump's order, which he announced in a social media post as he was departing New Orleans after watching the first half of the Super Bowl, was the latest in his administration's rapid-fire efforts to cut government costs.


"Let's rip the waste out of our great nation's budget, even if it's a penny at a time," Trump wrote in his post, which was light on details about plans for a post-penny future.


After Canada stopped minting new pennies, it began recycling them for their "valuable" copper and zinc, according to a 2022 report from the Canadian Mint.

## Boston man cleared of US charges he acted as Chinese agent

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Boston — A jury found a Boston man not guilty on Monday of U.S. charges that he acted as an unlawful agent of China's government by supplying officials information about individuals, dissidents and groups in the local Chinese community. 


Litang Liang, 65, was acquitted in federal court of charges that he acted as an unregistered Chinese agent in a case brought in 2023 that U.S. authorities had portrayed as part of their commitment to counter efforts by China's government ato silence its critics abroad. 


Liang, a China-born U.S. citizen, had denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. His lawyer during the trial called the charges "ridiculous" and called them an effort to chill the free speech of a local community activist who advocated for the "reunification" of democratically governed Taiwan with mainland China -- a view in harmony with China's leaders. 


"Justice has finally arrived," Liang told reporters through a translator following the verdict. 


U.S. Attorney Leah Foley, whose office pursued the case, said in a statement that while prosecutors "respect the jury's decision, we are disappointed in (Monday's) verdict." 


Liang had worked at a hotel and for years had been an active member in his union as well as a community organizer and activist in the Chinese-American community in Boston, according to his lawyer, Derege Demissie. 


Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Kistner told jurors on Friday during closing arguments in the case that China's government sought out Liang because it "wanted someone already involved in the community who knew the people who were there." 


Prosecutors said Liang from 2018 to 2022 provided Chinese officials with information on individuals and shared details about dissidents and groups with pro-Taiwan leanings. 


Prosecutors said that in 2018, after traveling to Beijing for meetings with an arm of the Chinese Communist Party, Liang founded the New England Alliance for the Peaceful Unification of China, which focused on promoting China's goals with Taiwan. 


China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future. 


Prosecutors said Liang, also at the direction of Chinese officials, in 2019 organized a counter-demonstration against pro-democracy protesters, and in 2022 provided an official with a Chinese agency, tasked with investigating political dissidents, information on two potential local recruits. 


Demissie in his closing argument to the jury countered that Liang made no secret of his activism and that his prosecution infringed on Liang's right to free speech under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. 


"This case would have meant nothing if it did not involve China," Demissie said. "That's what this is about. And it had the purpose of scaring people, and it achieved that purpose."

## US judge says Trump administration violated order lifting spending freeze

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

A U.S. judge on Monday said President Donald Trump's administration violated a court order lifting a broad freeze on federal spending and directed the government to immediately release any withheld funds. 


U.S. District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, had already blocked the funding freeze with a temporary restraining order on Jan. 31, but a group of Democratic state attorneys general who sued to block the move said last week that the government was still withholding funds. 


The Trump administration on Monday said it is appealing. 


"The broad categorical and sweeping freeze of federal funds is, as the court found, likely unconstitutional and has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to a vast portion of this country," McConnell said on Monday. "These pauses in funding violate the plain text of the TRO." 


McConnell said all funding must be restored at least until he can hold a hearing on the states' motion for a longer-term order. 


On Feb. 6, a lawyer with the office of Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James told McConnell that state agencies were still having difficulty accessing federal funds, including billions of dollars for infrastructure projects under the Inflation Reduction Act. 


The Trump administration had told states it believed the order did not apply to certain environmental and infrastructure spending, and that some payments were delayed for "operational and administrative reasons." 


However, McConnell said his order had been "clear and unambiguous" in applying to all funding frozen in response to sweeping executive orders by Trump. 


The states originally sued the administration over a memorandum from the White House's Office of Management and Budget announcing a wide-ranging freeze of federal spending. Soon after the lawsuit was filed, OMB rescinded that memo. 


The memo was part of a larger Trump administration push to tighten federal spending and reshape the federal bureaucracy, which has sparked a flurry of lawsuits. 


In a separate case over Trump's push to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, federal employee unions have accused the administration of violating a court order reinstating USAID workers who were placed on administrative leave.

## VOA Mandarin: China courts India as Trump, Modi vow to deepen ties

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the U.S. on Wednesday. President Donald Trump announced Modi's White House visit as India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing, where they agreed to restore bilateral ties and resume direct flights and pilgrimages by Indian pilgrims to a holy site in Tibet. 


While Modi's government has shifted toward populist policies, China launched an aggressive public relations campaign in 2024 to improve its standing with India. Analysts view China's diplomatic push as a response to the deepening U.S.-India partnership and Beijing's desire to maintain regional influence, particularly given expected tensions with the Trump administration.

“If the Iranian regime does not want a deal, the president is clear, Iran will remain under the restored maximum pressure campaign,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA Persian on Monday, referring to President Donald Trump’s willingness to discuss a new deal with Iran. 


Trump wrote on Truth Social that he seeks a “Verified Nuclear Peace Agreement, which will let Iran peacefully grow and prosper” in return for ensuring that the Islamic Republic “cannot have a Nuclear Weapon.”

## US defense chief headed to Europe for NATO, Ukraine meetings

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon — New U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is headed to Europe, his first international trip since taking office last month.


Hegseth departed from Joint Base Andrews, just outside of Washington, early Monday, for stops in Germany, Belgium and Poland.


In Germany, the defense secretary is scheduled to visit the headquarters for U.S. European Command, and U.S. Africa Command, getting updates on developments in both regions. 




From Germany, Hegseth will travel to Brussels for the NATO Defense Ministerial and a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday and Thursday.


U.S. defense officials say Hegseth is expected to press U.S. allies in Europe to increase their defense spending and take more of a leadership role for challenges facing Europe.


He is also expected to echo U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for a diplomatic end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is about to enter its third year.


The meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group — a group of almost 50 countries who have pledged to support Ukraine in its efforts to repel Russia — is the first to take place during the new Trump administration and will be the first led by a country other than the U.S.


This week’s meeting, the 26th, will be led by Britain.


Britain’s Defense Ministry, in a statement Thursday said the meeting will focus on “priorities for Ukraine as the international community continues to work together to support Ukraine in its fight against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion.”


The Pentagon, in a statement previewing Hegseth’s participation in the meeting, said in addition to emphasizing Trump’s push for a diplomatic resolution to the war, the secretary, “will also highlight the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to Ukraine.”




Following the meetings in Brussels, Hegseth is scheduled to travel to Poland to meet with leaders there and visit with U.S. troops.


Of note, the U.S. defense secretary said he is skipping the annual Munich Security Conference in Germany, which bills itself as “the world's leading forum for debating international security policy,” which gets underway Friday.


“We're not going to the Munich Security Conference,” Hegseth told defense officials and troops at a town hall meeting last Friday at the Pentagon.


“We're instead going to Poland to see the troops out there and we're going to Germany to see EUCOM and AFRICOM,” he said. “I would much rather talk to troops than go to cocktail parties. That's my job.”


Instead, the U.S. is set to be represented in Munich by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

## Opening statements begin in trial of man accused of trying to kill Salman Rushdie

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Mayville, New York — Lawyers began delivering opening statements Monday at the trial of the man charged with trying to fatally stab author Salman Rushdie in front of a lecture audience in western New York.  


Rushdie, 77, is expected to testify during the trial of Hadi Matar, bringing the writer face-to-face with his knife-wielding attacker for the first time in more than two years.  


Rushdie, the Booker Prize-winning author, had been about to speak about keeping writers safe from harm in August 2022 when Matar ran toward him on the stage at the Chautauqua Institution Amphitheater. Matar stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times in the neck, stomach, chest, hand and right eye, leaving him partially blind and with permanent damage to one hand. 




The Indian-born British-American author detailed the attack and his long, painful recovery in a memoir, "Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder," released last year. Rushdie had worried for his safety since his 1989 novel "The Satanic Verses" was denounced as blasphemous by many Muslims and led to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa calling for his death.  


Rushdie spent years in hiding, but had traveled freely over the past quarter century after Iran announced it would not enforce the decree.  


The trial is taking place as the 36th anniversary of the fatwa — Feb. 14, 1989 — approaches.  


Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, is charged with attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty.  


A jury was selected last week. Matar was in court throughout the three-day process, taking notes and consulting with his attorneys. He calmly said, "Free Palestine" while being led in to court Monday past members of the media taking photographs and video.  


Matar's defense faced a challenging start after it was announced that his lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, was hospitalized with an undisclosed illness and would not attend the start of the trial.  


Judge David Foley refused a defense request to postpone opening statements, instead instructing an associate of Barone to deliver the defense's opening statement in his place.


Once testimony is underway, the trial is expected to last a week to 10 days. Jurors will be shown video and photos from the day of the attack, which ended when onlookers rushed Matar and held him until police arrived.  


The event's moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded. Matar told investigators he traveled by bus to Chautauqua, about 120 kilometers south of Buffalo. He is believed to have slept in the grounds of the arts and academic retreat the night before the attack.  


Matar's attorney has not indicated what his defense will be. In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization's endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie's death.  


A later trial on the federal charges — terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization — will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.  


Rushdie has been one of the world's most celebrated authors since the 1981 publication of "Midnight's Children," winner of the Booker Prize. His other works include the novels "Shame" and "Victory City," which he had completed shortly before the 2022 stabbing, and the 2012 memoir "Joseph Anton," in which he wrote about his time in hiding.


In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group's then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

## Third federal judge blocks Trump's birthright citizenship order

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Concord, New Hampshire — A third federal judge on Monday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of people who are in the U.S. illegally.  


The ruling from U.S. District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New Hampshire comes after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and Maryland last week. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that Trump's order violates the Constitution and "attempts to upend one of the most fundamental American constitutional values."  


Trump's Republican administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not "subject to the jurisdiction" of the United States and therefore are not entitled to citizenship.  


The administration is appealing the Seattle judge's block on Trump's executive order.  


At the heart of the lawsuits in the three cases is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man, wasn't a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed.  


In 1898, in a case known as United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the U.S. Supreme Court found the only children who did not automatically receive U.S. citizenship upon being born on U.S. soil were children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes.  


The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli, or "right of the soil" — is applied. Most are in the Americas and Canada and Mexico are among them.

## Court grants request to block detained Venezuelan immigrants from being sent to Guantanamo

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.  — A federal court on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from sending three Venezuelan immigrants held in New Mexico to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba as part of the president's immigration crackdown.


In a legal filing earlier in the day, lawyers for the men said the detainees "fit the profile of those the administration has prioritized for detention in Guantanamo, i.e. Venezuelan men detained in the El Paso area with (false) charges of connections with the Tren de Aragua gang."


It asked a U.S. District Court in New Mexico for a temporary restraining order blocking their transfer, adding that "the mere uncertainty the government has created surrounding the availability of legal process and counsel access is sufficient to authorize the modest injunction."


During a brief hearing, Judge Kenneth J. Gonzales granted the temporary order, which was opposed by the government, said Jessica Vosburgh, an attorney for the three men.


"It's short term. This will get revisited and further fleshed out in the weeks to come," Vosburgh told The Associated Press.


A message seeking comment was left for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement.


The filing came as part of a lawsuit on behalf of the three men filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, and Las Americas Immigrant Advisory Center.


The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a lawless prison in the central Venezuelan state of Aragua more than a decade ago and has expanded in recent years as millions of desperate Venezuelans fled President President Nicolás Maduro 's rule and migrated to other parts of Latin America or the U.S.


Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that flights of detainees had landed at Guantanamo. Immigrant rights groups sent a letter Friday demanding access to people who have been sent there, saying the base should not be used as a "legal black hole."


White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that more than 8,000 people have been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.


Trump has vowed to deport millions of the estimated 11.7 million people in the U.S. illegally.

## 'Anora' wins at Producers and Directors Guild Awards

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Did a wide-open Oscar race just get a front runner?


Sean Baker's Brooklyn comedy “Anora” took top honors at both the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night, catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely watched Academy Awards precursors.


Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged “Anora” as the front runner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival.


But after several films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden Globe winners “The Brutalist” and “Emilia Perez," “Anora” reemerged in a big way over the weekend. Baker's film also won best picture at the Critics Choice Awards on Friday.


Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The PGA's top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times.


The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees.


The guild also named RaMell Ross' “Nickel Boys" best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut.


Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard's “Emilia Perez" is the lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy.


Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation's “The Wild Robot” cleaned up with nine awards including best film. “The Wild Robot” will be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy Awards.

## Super Bowl commercials rely on comedy, nostalgia to avoid potential missteps

date: 2025-02-10, from: VOA News USA

Most of the commercials airing during this year’s Super Bowl are going for laughs, with advertisers betting that America could use a little break.


As the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs hit the field in New Orleans, a parade of silly ads will hit airwaves Sunday. Many companies put their ads online ahead of the game, but some held out to maintain an element of surprise.


Humor dominates in the ads released so far. Four old ladies go on a joy ride with WeatherTech, while Eugene Levy's eyebrows fly off and buzz around after he eats some Little Caesars. Sloths have a case of the Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. A man's tongue starts dancing to celebrate cold foam from Nestlé Coffee Mate. British singer Seal becomes an actual seal, sad that he can't hold Mountain Dew with his flippers.


Actor Glenn Powell does a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while comedian Nate Bargatze clones himself and hires an opera singer because he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey takes a lighthearted stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the “Fast and Furious” franchise take a slow cruise in a convertible so they can enjoy Häagen-Dazs ice cream bars.


Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for advertisers.


Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials features a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.


“That’s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,” Calkins said. “Safe advertising isn’t the advertising you notice or remember.”


And advertisers can't afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly 80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year.


Here are some of the themes of this year's Super Bowl ads:


Heartwarming nostalgia


Budweiser brings back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad, including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reenact their famous scene from 1989's “When Harry Met Sally,” except this time Sally is expressing her enthusiasm for Hellmann's mayonnaise.


The Muppets search for accommodations with Booking.com, while an Instacart ad features a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asks what the world would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from “Frozen,” Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes.


Advertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect products to positive cultural moments, she said.


Celebrity mashups


Putting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can also broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob Ultra, actors Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs. Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson team up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning have a block party with Bud Light. A slew of celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig and Charlie XCX, appear in an ad for Uber Eats.


Linli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there's a risk of diminishing returns.


Celebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don’t remember which brand they're advertising, Xu said.


Serious moments


It isn't all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year. Pharmaceutical company Novartis urges women to get early detection for breast cancer. Dove warns that half of girls who quit sports have been criticized for their body type. Hims & Hers, a telehealth company, talks about America's obesity epidemic.


For the third Super Bowl in a row, Come Near — a nonprofit that promotes the teachings of Jesus — is running an ad as part of its He Gets Us campaign. The ad, featuring Johnny Cash's cover of “Personal Jesus,” shows everyday people being helpful and heroic. And the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, has a stark ad featuring Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other, in an effort to show how pointless hate is.


Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message. But for the most part, advertisers went with humor, she said.


“We just had an election year and there’s a lot of discussion around divisiveness,” she said. “People might be wanting to see some unity, everybody coming together as a country.”


Artificial intelligence arrives


Several Super Bowl ads make the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner team up for an ad wearing Meta 's smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitches GoDaddy Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And Google's “50 States, 50 Stories” campaign will show viewers a small business from their state that's using Google's Gemini AI assistant. But Cirkul, a water bottle brand, pokes fun at AI, showing comedian Adam Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on his phone.

## Westminster show's canine athletes get their piece of Super Bowl weekend

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

New York — They're at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go airborne. And they went all out for this weekend's championship.


Sorry — no, they're not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They're the agility dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by showcasing agility and other dog sports.


Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States' most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro football's Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both competitions' dates shifted in recent years.


"I always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl 'the Westminster of football,' " quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers.


The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than the Super Bowl, after all.


And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and Westminster's green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year. (Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show, including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.)


Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago.


"We never thought we'd be here. And now we're here," Martin, of Austin, Texas, said Saturday.


A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about 300 champion-level canines.


"She's very intuitive, very natural — probably smarter than me," handler Emily Klarman of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, told a Fox interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically.


A special award for the best mixed-breed competitor went to Gable, handled by Kayla Feeney of Lima, New York.


Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show's first event with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillon mix named Nimble, who competed again this year.


She's an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short.


His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time for agility after realizing she'd adopted a super-energetic dog who opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when bored.


"He's always exciting — he does ridiculous things," Ondeyka said as he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down time between agility runs. "We have fun, regardless what happens."


While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly Labradoodle mix, used to be "afraid of the world" but now is excited to go to agility classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said.


Saturday's competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane to a 7-pound (0.9-kilogramg) papillon, and they included such lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish farmdog.


They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without making mistakes.


Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and went through them again.


Westminster's traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night.


That's for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible for Saturday's obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in 2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey.


Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super Bowl — because he was confident the Eagles would prevail.


There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.


The show also featured Westminster's first demonstration of flyball, a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball.


"It's a lot of organized chaos," Hillary Brown said after competing with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York, Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break were a standard poodle, a border collie and a whippet-border collie mix.


"It's a blast. The dogs love it," Brown said.

## Trump to announce 25% steel, aluminum tariffs in latest trade escalation

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that he will announce on Monday new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., which would come on top of existing metals duties in another major escalation of his trade policy overhaul.


Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately.




Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum, but later granted several trading partners duty-free quotas, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.


Former President Joe Biden extended these quotas to Britain, Japan and the European Union, and U.S. steel mill capacity utilization has dropped in recent years.


White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that the new tariffs would come on top of the existing duties on steel and aluminum.


Trump on Friday announced that he would impose reciprocal tariffs — raising U.S. tariff rates to match those of trading partners — on many countries this week. He did not identify the countries, but the duties would be imposed "so that we're treated evenly with other countries."

## Chiefs chase Super Bowl 'three-peat' as Trump attends NFL showpiece

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

New Orleans, Louisiana — The Kansas City Chiefs aim for a historic hat-trick of Super Bowl titles on Sunday when they take on the Philadelphia Eagles in front of a star-studded crowd in New Orleans headed by U.S. President Donald Trump.


Trump will become the first sitting president ever to attend the NFL showpiece when he takes his seat among a sell-out crowd of around 74,000 fans at the Superdome for the biggest annual event in the American sporting calendar, which kicks off at 5:30pm local time (2330 GMT).


Pop superstar Taylor Swift will also be in the VIP seats to watch as her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his fellow Chiefs bid to become the first team in history to lift three consecutive Vince Lombardi Trophies.


Trump's presence at the NFL showpiece will mean even tighter security than normal around an event which was already bolstered by a heavy police presence following a New Year's Day attack which left 14 people dead and many more injured on the Big Easy's famous Bourbon Street.


Trump has had a strained relationship with the NFL stretching back several decades, and triggered uproar during his first time in 2017 when he attacked the patriotism of players who kneeled during the playing of the U.S. national anthem in a protest against racial injustice.


Speaking in a pre-game interview aired on Fox News, Trump said his decision to attend this year's Super Bowl was for the good of the country.


"I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the President be at the game," Trump told Fox.


"It's an iconic day. It's going to be a great game, two great teams, and let's see what happens," Trump added, revealing that he was tipping Kansas City for victory, citing the record of Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is eyeing his fourth Super Bowl win.


"When a quarterback wins as much as he's won, I have to go with Kansas City," Trump said. "I have to go with Kansas City."


Trump was due to fly into New Orleans from Florida, where he reportedly played a round of golf with Tiger Woods earlier Sunday. A schedule released by the White House said he is expected to leave the Superdome at around 8.05pm local time, well before the game reaches its conclusion.


Super Bowl fans on Sunday welcomed Trump's attendance at the game.


"I think it is awesome, congratulations to him for being the first President to make it," Bob Benderovich, a Philadelphia Eagles fan from Fort Myers, Florida, told AFP.




Chiefs favorites


As always, the Super Bowl crosses over into popular culture and the half-time show this year will feature hip-hop artist Kendrick Lamar, who had a clean sweep at last Sunday's Grammys, winning in all five categories for which he received nominations.


Bookmakers and casinos meanwhile are taking odds on whether Chiefs star Kelce will propose to pop icon Swift after what might be his final game in the NFL.


For the more serious punters, the oddsmakers have the Chiefs as slight favorite for the game, a rematch of the Super Bowl from two years ago which the Chiefs won by three points.


They defended their title last year, beating the San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas and putting them one win away from an unprecedented "three-peat."


The 29-year-old Mahomes will become one of just four quarterbacks in National Football League history to have won more than three Super Bowls should he triumph again, having first led the Chiefs to Super Bowl glory in 2020.


But the Eagles have added serious offensive firepower since their defeat two years ago with mobile quarterback Jalen Hurts joined by the game-changing speed and power of running back Saquon Barkley.


The Chiefs put the finishing touches to their game preparations Saturday with a 30-minute walkthrough of a mock game.


Chiefs coach Andy Reid saluted his team's attitude to training over the whole week since arriving in Louisiana.


"I thought the guys worked hard, they got done what they needed to get done," Reid said.


The Eagles had a similarly relaxed final session before going to the Superdome on Saturday for a team photo.


Head coach Nick Sirianni said his Eagles were "hungry" and "ready to roll."


"We're ready for the challenge against a really good team," Sirianni said.

## Trump official orders consumer protection agency to stop work

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting down an agency that was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal. 


Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, directed the CFPB, in a Saturday night email confirmed by The Associated Press, to stop work on proposed rules, to suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since President Barack Obama pushed to include it in the 2010 financial reform legislation that followed the 2007-2008 financial crisis. 


The email also ordered the bureau to “cease all supervision and examination activity.” 


Since the CFPB is a creation of Congress, it would require a separate act of Congress to formally eliminate it. But the head of the agency has discretion over what enforcement actions to take, if any. 


Yet Elon Musk commented, “CFPB RIP” on social media site X on Friday. And the CFPB homepage on the Internet was down Sunday, replaced by a message reading “page not found.” 


Also late Saturday, Vought said in a social media post that the CFPB would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, adding that its current reserves of $711.6 million are “excessive." Congress directed the bureau to be funded by the Fed to insulate it from political pressures. 


“This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off,” Vought said on X. 


The CFPB says that it has obtained nearly $20 billion in financial relief for U.S. consumers since its founding in the form of canceled debts, compensation, and reduced loans. Last month, the bureau sued Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts — and “cheating” customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result. 


Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, an advocacy group, said, “that's why Wall Street’s biggest banks and Trump’s billionaire allies hate the bureau: it’s an effective cop on the finance beat and has stood side-by-side with hundreds of millions of Americans — Republicans and Democrats — battling financial predators, scammers, and crooks.” 


The administration's move against the CFPB also highlights the tensions between Trump's more populist promises to lower costs for working-class families and his pledge to reduce government regulation. 


During the campaign, Trump said he would cap credit card interest rates at 10%, after they had soared to record levels above 20%, on average, as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates in 2022 and 2023. The CFPB had started work on how that proposal would be implemented. 


The bureau can still take complaints, but it can’t conduct exams or pursue existing investigations, according to a person familiar with the agency who insisted on anonymity to discuss CFPB business. The memo is also interpreted as blocking it from communicating with companies it regulates, consumer advocates or other outside groups. 


Musk’s team would also have access to complaints, investigations and regulatory oversight data. The access raises uncomfortable questions if Musk’s company X launches a payments system as the CFPB has data on competitors such as Cash App, the person said. 


Vought's email follows a similar directive from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Feb. 3 and is the latest move by the Trump administration to rapidly curtail the work of federal agencies that they have deemed excessive. 


Obama spearheaded the creation of the bureau in the wake of the 2007-2008 housing bubble and financial crisis, which was caused in part by fraudulent mortgage lending. It was the brainchild of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has attracted lawsuits from large banks and financial industry trade associations. 


“Vought is giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to scam families," Warren said. 


Last week, Warren called on Trump to work with the bureau to protect Americans from de-banking, the practice of banks shutting down customer accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational risks to the banks. 


Vought's email said that President Donald Trump had made him acting director of the CFPB on Friday. Trump fired the previous director of the bureau, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1. Vought was an architect of Project 2025, a policy blueprint for the Trump White House that Trump tried to disavow during last year's campaign. 


Under Chopra, the CFPB approved rules to cap overdraft fees by banks, limit junk fees, and has proposed restrictions on data brokers selling personal information such as Social Security numbers.

## White House defends efforts to shut down foreign aid agency

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

White House national security adviser Michael Waltz on Sunday defended President Donald Trump’s plan to shut down the country’s chief foreign aid agency, contending that “all too often” it was not aligned with U.S. strategic interests and wastes money.


Waltz told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the U.S. Agency for International Development programs, often food and humanitarian assistance across the world, “are not in line with strategic U.S. interests like pushing back on China. They're doing all kinds of other things that frankly, aren't in line with strategic interests or the president's vision.”


Moreover, he said, “Often, all too often, only cents on the dollar actually makes it to people in need, between the big contractors, the subcontractors, the local contractors, the dollars aren't being used … wisely. We need to take a hard look at it. We need to move quickly, and that's exactly what's being done.”.”


Trump this past week ordered the 10,000-worker agency shut down with fewer than 300 of them expected to eventually be retained as the agency’s programs are either shifted to State Department control or terminated.


A federal judge in Washington on Friday ordered a temporary halt to plans to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job.


On the same day, workers pried the name of the agency letter by letter off the entryway of its headquarters in Washington.


Democrats in Congress have been critical of the changes regarding USAID, with some pledging to stall Trump’s Cabinet nominees and leverage their votes on a new government spending bill, in protest.


The effort to shut down USAID was the most visible result of Trump dispatching billionaire Elon Musk and his aides to review programs and the legitimacy of spending at dozens of federal government agencies.


Trump offered virtually all the government’s 2.3 million civilian workers a chance to resign and continue to get paid through Sept. 30 without working, but a federal judge paused the offer until he holds a new hearing Monday afternoon on its legality.


The White House said 65,000 workers, 2.8% of the government’s civilian workforce, accepted the offer to quit and be paid not to work, far fewer than the 5- to 10% figure Musk and his cost cutters were hoping for.


Trump said all government agencies would be subject to financial reviews, including one of the biggest targets, the Defense Department, where Musk has billions of dollars of contracts.


Waltz said a review of Pentagon spending was especially necessary.


“Everything there seems to cost too much, take too long and deliver too little to the soldiers… we do need great minds, and we do need business leaders to go in there and absolutely reform the Pentagon's acquisition process,” he said.


Waltz, a former congressman from the southern state of Florida, said, “I, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee, held up a bag of bolts that would cost 100 bucks … in a hardware store, that cost $90,000 to the United States Air Force and the American people have said enough, enough with the bloat and the waste….”


“For our barracks and our soldiers, we need all the efficiency we can get in the Pentagon, and I think the American people and the soldiers will welcome” a spending review, he said.”


On another matter, Waltz said “sensitive conversations” are occurring on how to end Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine.


“We will have our secretary of state, our secretary of defense, our vice president, our special envoy in Europe this week talking through the details of how to end this war,” Waltz said. “And that means getting both sides (to) the table.”


Waltz said the discussions would include future U.S. aid to Ukraine, possibly in exchange for Kyiv supplying the U.S. with its rare earth minerals — necessary for the manufacture of high-tech goods.


“Those conversations are going to happen this week. And I think an underlying principle here is that the Europeans have to own this conflict going forward,” Waltz said. “President Trump is going to end it. And then in terms of security guarantees, that is squarely going to be with the Europeans.”

## ‘Dog Man’ bests ‘Heart Eyes,’ ‘Love Hurts’ at box office

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

New York — On a quiet winter weekend at the box office, DreamWorks Animation’s “Dog Man” chased its own tail, repeating as the top movie in theaters. 


The animated Universal Pictures release, adapted from Dav Pilkey’s popular graphic novel series, collected $13.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Both new releases — the Ke Huy Quan action movie “Love Hurts” and the Valentine’s Day-themed slasher “Heart Eyes”— were left nipping at the heels of “Dog Man.” 


Hollywood often largely punts Super Bowl weekend to the small screen. Last year, Apple’s much-derided “Argylle” debuted on the same weekend. Instead, the movie industry spends more energy pitching its blockbusters in trailers for the huge football audience on TV. 


It wasn’t a banner weekend for “Dog Man.” It fell steeply, dropping 62% in it second weekend. But with a production budget of $40 million, “Dog Man” has already tallied $54.1 million domestically in two weeks. 


Coming in second was Spyglass Media Group’s “Heart Eyes,” released by Sony. The horror-rom-com mashup earned $8.5 million from 3,102 locations. Reviews have been good for the film, directed by Josh Ruben and starring Oliva Holt and Mason Gooding, though audiences were less impressed. Moviegoers gave it a “B-” CinemaScore. Spyglass made “Heart Eyes” for $18 million. 


“Love Hurts,” the action comedy from 87North Productions (“John Wick,” “The Fall Guy”), debuted with a paltry $5.8 million in 3,055 theaters. In his first big movie role since his Oscar-winning comeback in “Everything All at Once,” Ke Huy Quan stars as a mild-mannered realtor with a hitman past. Ariana DeBose co-stars. It, too, was modestly budgeted at $18 million. Audiences, however, mostly rejected the movie, giving “Love Hurts” a “C+” CinemaScore. 


Next weekend should bring Hollywood its biggest box-office weekend of the year with the release of Marvel’s “Captain America: Brave New World” and Sony’s “Paddington in Peru.” 


Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 


1. “Dog Man,” $13.7 million. 


2. “Heart Eyes,” $8.5 million. 


3. “Love Hurts,” $5.8 million. 


4. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $3.9 million. 


5. “Companion,” $3 million. 


6. “One of Them Days,” $3 million. 


7. “Becoming Led Zeppelin,” $2.6 million. 


8. “Flight Risk,” $2.6 million. 


9. “Sonic the Hedgehog,” $1.8 million. 


10. “Moana 3,” $1.5 million.

## Soaring egg prices in US pique interest in backyard chickens

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Thinking about backyard chickens as egg prices soar? Think hard, especially in light of the bird flu outbreak.


Keeping home chickens as a pastime has continued to grow since the pandemic. But if eggs are the goal, remember that it takes planning and investment to raise the chickens and protect against bird flu. Costs might go well beyond the nationwide average of $4.15 a dozen that commercial eggs sold for in December.


"Anyone who's done an ounce of research will very quickly understand that there are no free eggs, there are no inexpensive eggs in keeping chickens," said Kathy Shea Mormino, a home chicken blogger and author who has about 50 of the birds at her Suffield, Connecticut, home.


"You're going to pay more, particularly in your first several years, in your setup and in your birds. And there's a huge learning curve on how to care for animals that are really unusual pets," said Mormino, who has kept chickens for 15 years and calls herself the Chicken Chick.


Costs vary wildly, from about $200 to $2,000 for a coop alone. Feeders and waterers range from about $8 to $50 or more, depending on the size and type.


Bird flu has forced farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a month, contributing (along with inflation) to the steep price of commercial eggs and resulting in some scantily stocked stores around the country. The scarcity and high prices are causing some to look for a backyard alternative.


"We've seen a real uptick in calls recently from people wanting to start their own backyard flocks. With the egg shortages at grocery stores, many are excited about the idea of raising chickens and taking steps toward sustainability," said Matthew Aversa, a co-owner of Winding Branch Ranch, a nonprofit sanctuary and farm animal rescue outside San Antonio.


"We adopt out whole flocks. We're receiving at least a dozen inquiries per week," he said.




Kate Perz, the animal science coordinator for Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County, New York, said that unlike other pandemic pastimes, raising home chickens has only grown.


"It's not always cost-effective," she said. "You have to really look at how many eggs you're eating and what the cost of those are versus what you would be spending."


There are other reasons, of course, to keep chickens at home, not the least of which is the sheer joy of their presence. Mormino and other "chickeneers," as she calls home enthusiasts, have a coop full of tips on how to get started.


Tend to legal matters


You may be ready to dive right in. Your town may not. Mormino, who wrote The Chicken Chick's Guide to Backyard Chickens, said the first thing to consider is whether chickens are right for you. After that, don't assume your county, town or city will allow it.


Look up zoning and building codes yourself if you feel capable. Otherwise, consult an attorney who specializes in municipal law in your area.


Don't rely on word of mouth or even a town worker to know the ins and outs. Is a building permit required to build a coop? Are roosters banned under noise ordinances? Sometimes, zoning codes are silent on the subject. Don't assume that's a green light. Many codes are "permissive use" regulations, Mormino said, essentially meaning that if the code doesn't say you're permitted, you're not!




If chicken-keeping is allowed, is there a limit on how many birds? Are there restrictions on where a coop can be built in relation to neighboring property lines. Most homeowners associations have rules on animal keeping.


Mormino lives in a farming town and had a neighbor who kept three horses and a small flock of chickens, so she assumed they were legal. They weren't. She called the town clerk's office to ask whether a building permit was required to build a coop and was told it wasn't. It was.


In the end, she successfully defended a lawsuit against her (she's an attorney) and prevailed in a long battle to amend the law, legalizing backyard chickens in her town.


What about bird flu?


Bird flu is highly contagious. It spreads mostly by migrating waterfowl in their droppings. Chickens are far from immune if they spend any time free ranging or in a run without protection from wild fowl droppings.


"There's a limited number of things that we can do because our birds live where wildlife live," Mormino said. "People need to know if they have a bird or birds that die suddenly from some of the symptoms, they need to contact the USDA to get the postmortem exam and the birds tested for bird flu."


Don't bring sick birds into the house for care. That raises the risk of transmission to humans. Once the virus is confirmed, the entire flock needs to be euthanized, she and Perz said.


Symptoms of bird flu include: sudden death without any clinical signs; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles or hocks; diarrhea; stumbling or falling down; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; and coughing and sneezing.


Don't feed any wildlife in areas where your chickens dwell or roam. Wash hands thoroughly after tending to chickens and dedicate a pair of shoes or boots strictly for use around them.


"The biggest mistake backyard chickeneers make is to bring new chickens into their flock that have lived someplace else. That's the fastest way to bring disease into your chicken yard," Mormino said.


Consider your costs


Sarah Penny has turned her 7,000-square-foot home lot in Knoxville, Tennessee, into a beautiful garden and chicken home. She has nine birds and grows more than half the food she and her 13-year-old son eat.


She's had chickens since 2021 and estimates her startup costs at about $2,500.




Monthly costs vary based on what chickens are fed and how coops are kept. Penny, for instance, uses the deep litter method and composts from her coop, meaning she's not mucking out her coop more than twice a year.


"But the cost of starting with backyard chickens is definitely quite expensive. I don't know if a lot of people know that," Penny said.


Her coop alone, which her family built themselves, cost about $2,000. It had to be outfitted to keep predators out, including rats that tunnel under the ground.


Many people start with buying hatchlings, which just got more expensive to ship via the U.S. Postal Service due to new fees. Raising hatchlings requires a chick brooder involving a separate enclosure, heat lamp, feeders and other supplies.


Penny buys a bag of feed every two weeks for $15 to $20 a bag. There's also the cost of calcium, such as oyster shells, and grit to aid digestion if chickens are not free-ranging or getting those elements in their feed.


She estimates her monthly costs at about $60, saving a bit by also feeding her chickens healthy human leftovers. She's careful not to include foods that are toxic for chickens, including onions, potatoes and avocados.


It's all worth it to Penny.


"We eat a lot of eggs," she said. "We probably go through a dozen every two days. We bake a lot. We're an ingredient household, so the majority of our food is cooked from scratch. Eggs are a main staple for our breakfast."

## High home prices and mortgage rates put American dream out of reach for many

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

The Petersen family's two-bedroom apartment in northern California is starting to feel small.


Four-year-old Jerrik's toy monster trucks are everywhere in the 1,100-square-foot unit in Campbell, just outside of San Jose. And it's only a matter of time before 9-month-old Carolynn starts amassing more toys, adding to the disarray, said her mother, Jenn Petersen.


The 42-year-old chiropractor had hoped she and her husband, Steve, a 39-year-old dental hygienist, would have bought a house by now. But when they can afford a bigger place, it will have to be another rental. Petersen has done the math: With mortgage rates and home prices stubbornly high, there's no way the couple, who make about $270,000 a year and pay about $2,500 in monthly rent, can afford a home anywhere in their area.


According to October data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a San Jose family with a median income of $156,700 would need to spend 80% of their income on housing — including an $8,600 monthly mortgage payment — to own a median-priced $1.54 million home. That's far higher than the general rule of thumb that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on a mortgage or rent.


Moving out of state is out of the question for the Petersens — they have strong family ties to the area and their income would plummet if they move to a lower cost-of-living area. "I'm not willing to give up my job and close connections with my family for a house," Petersen said.




The issue is widespread and near historic highs nationally: As of last fall, the median homeowner in the U.S. was paying 42% of their income on homeownership costs, according to the Atlanta Fed. Four years ago, that percentage was 28% and had not previously reached 38% since late 2007, just before the housing market crash.


"The American dream, as our parents knew it, doesn't exist anymore," Petersen said. "The whole idea that you get a house after you graduate college, get a steady job and get married? I've done most of those milestones. But the homeownership part? That just doesn't fit financially."


Supply lags demand


First-time homeowners are getting older. The same is true for an increasing number of American families.


In 2024, the median first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a jump from age 35 the previous year, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. That's significantly above historic norms, when median first-time buyers hovered between 30 and 32 years old from 1993 to 2018.


The biggest driver of this trend, experts said, is simple: There are far too few houses on the market to match pent-up demand, driving prices past the point of affordability for many people who are relatively early in their careers. Coupled with high mortgage rates, many have concluded that renting is their only option.


"Wage growth hasn't kept up with the increase in home prices and interest rates," said Domonic Purviance, who studies housing at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia. "Even though people are making more money, home prices are increasing at a faster rate."


That gap has left many out of the housing market, which for generations has been a way for Americans to build equity and wealth that they can pass down or leverage to buy a larger home. It's also led to widespread worries about housing in the United States. About 7 in 10 voters under age 45 said they were "very" concerned about the cost of housing in their community, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election.


Is the dream going to fade? 


Brian McCabe, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said he frequently tells his students that "there are few things that all Americans agree on, but one of them is that they'd rather own a home than rent."


McCabe said homeownership, especially as a wealth-building tool, is the right move for many, especially if the owner intends to be in one place for a long time. But he also said many are realizing that not owning a home has its advantages, too — it gives people more flexibility to move and allows them to live in exciting neighborhoods they would not be able to afford to buy property in.


McCabe said millennials are getting married later, having children later, have a stronger desire to stay in cities and, especially due to remote work, value the flexibility of being able to move with ease — all of which he said could prompt an end to the notion that homeownership is the "apex of the American dream."


"The big question is whether we see the sheen of homeownership start to fade," McCabe said. "It's such an interesting cultural marker: Why is owning a home the pinnacle for so many people?"


It's a question Petersen wrestles with because she knows any three-bedroom home she found in her area would leave her family "house poor."


"I used to subscribe to the idea that owning a house is just a natural milestone you have to reach," she said. "At some point, though, what are you sacrificing by just owning a house and gaining equity? I want to be able to travel with my kids. I want to be able to sign them up for extracurriculars. How are we supposed to do that if we're paying a mortgage that's most of our take-home pay?"


Petersen said she'll "always hold out a little bit of hope" that homeownership will be in her family's future. But if they find a townhouse to rent that has space for her kids and fits within their $3,600 monthly rental budget?


"I'd take that," she said.


Cities offer support


Some cities are providing crucial aid to first-time homebuyers


Lifelong Boston resident Julieta Lopez, 63, spent decades hoping to buy a home but watched as prices became increasingly out of reach.


"The prices in Boston just got higher and higher and higher and higher," said Lopez, who works for the city traffic department issuing tickets for parking violations.


Two years ago, furious to learn that her subsidized apartment's monthly rent was being hiked to $2,900, Lopez, who earns about $60,000 annually, took out her phone and began searching for government programs that help first-time homebuyers. She was determined to finally own her own place.


Within months, she had succeeded. Lopez qualified to receive $50,000 from the local Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance nonprofit and another $50,000 from the city of Boston's Office of Housing — funds that helped her with a down payment on the $430,000 two-bedroom condominium she shares with her 30-year-old son. She now pays about $2,160 a month on her mortgage.




Lopez knows she is lucky the city has placed such a focus on aiding first-time buyers like herself — Boston has poured more than $24 million into its homeownership assistance programs since Mayor Michelle Wu took office in 2021, helping nearly 700 residents get their first homes.


But Lopez also feels proud to have her own place after years of working — doing jobs that included everything from telecommunications to health care to electronics.


"I was determined to have my piece of the pie," she said. "I felt I deserved that. I've always worked. Always. Nonstop."

## Japan prime minister voices optimism over averting US tariffs

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed optimism on Sunday that his country could avoid higher U.S. tariffs, saying President Donald Trump had recognized Japan's huge investment in the U.S. and the American jobs that it creates.


At his first White House summit on Friday, Ishiba told public broadcaster NHK, he explained to Trump how many Japanese automakers were creating jobs in the United States.


The two did not specifically discuss auto tariffs, Ishiba said, although he said he did not know whether Japan would be subject to the reciprocal tariffs that Trump has said he plans to impose on imports.


Tokyo has so far escaped the trade war Trump unleashed in his first weeks in office. He has announced tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, although he postponed the 25% duties on his North American neighbors to allow for talks.


The escalating trade tensions since Trump returned to the White House on Jan. 20 threaten to rupture the global economy.


Ishiba said he believes Trump "recognized the fact Japan has been the world's largest investor in the United States for five straight years and is therefore different from other countries."


"Japan is creating many U.S. jobs. I believe (Washington) won't go straight to the idea of higher tariffs," he said.


Ishiba voiced optimism that Japan and the U.S. can avoid a tit-for-tat tariff war, stressing that tariffs should be put in place in a way that "benefits both sides."


"Any action that exploits or excludes the other side won't last," Ishiba said. "The question is whether there is any problem between Japan and the United States that warrants imposing higher tariffs," he added. 


Japan had the highest foreign direct investment in the United States in 2023 at $783.3 billion, followed by Canada and Germany, according to the most recent U.S. Commerce Department data.


Trump pressed Ishiba to close Japan's $68.5 billion annual trade surplus with Washington but expressed optimism this could be done quickly, given a promise by Ishiba to bring Japanese investment in the U.S. to $1 trillion.


On Sunday, Ishiba identified liquefied natural gas, steel, AI and autos as areas that Japanese companies could invest in.


He also touched on Trump's promise to look at Nippon Steel investing in U.S. Steel as opposed to buying the storied American company, a planned purchase opposed by Trump and blocked by his predecessor, Joe Biden.


"Investment is being made to ensure that it remains an American company. It will continue to operate under American management, with American employees," Ishiba said. "The key point is how to ensure it remains an American company. From President Trump's perspective, this is of utmost importance."


On military spending, another area where Trump has pressed allies for increases, Ishiba said Japan would not increase its defense budget without first winning public backing.


"It is crucial to ensure that what is deemed necessary is something the taxpayers can understand and support," he said.

Historical precedent, legal questions swirl around Trump plan to detain migrants at Guantanamo


The Trump administration's expansion of migrant detention facilities, notably its use of the U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has reignited debate among human rights advocates and legal experts. VOA’s immigration Aline Barros reports.


What is birthright citizenship?


President Donald Trump is reigniting a fierce debate: Should everyone born on U.S. soil automatically become a citizen? This question strikes at the heart of American identity, history and law. Trump signed an executive order last month seeking to end the right, but two federal judges have placed injunctions on the order, pausing it indefinitely. Here’s what you need to know about birthright citizenship.


Rubio visiting Costa Rica, Guatemala on trip focused on migration, security ties


U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Tuesday with officials in Costa Rica and later in Guatemala as part of a tour of Latin America focused on migration, security cooperation and countering Chinese influence in the region. Rubio was in El Salvador for talks Monday with President Nayib Bukele, and he announced that Bukele had offered to accept any deportees from the United States, regardless of their nationality. Reported by VOA’s State Department Correspondent Nike Ching.


California city breaks with state on shielding undocumented migrants


U.S. Border Patrol agents are detaining undocumented migrants as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration. Many of those arrests have been in California, where one city is trying to break with the state and cooperate with federal immigration agencies. Genia Dulot reports from Huntington Beach.


10 'high-threat illegal aliens' arrive at Guantanamo Bay


The first undocumented migrants — described by U.S. officials as the "the worst of the worst" — are being held in jail cells at the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, waiting to be sent home. The Pentagon on Wednesday confirmed 10 "high-threat illegal aliens" arrived Tuesday at the detention facility, where they are being held under the watch of officers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Carla Babb, VOA's Pentagon correspondent, and Jeff Seldin, VOA’s national security correspondent, report.


Trump's birthright citizenship order put on hold by 2nd federal judge


A U.S. federal judge ordered a second temporary pause Wednesday on President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the United States to someone in the country illegally. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman said no court in the country has endorsed the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment. "This court will not be the first," she said. The Associated Press reports.


Trump administration moves to end deportation protections for 348,000 Venezuelans


U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday moved to remove protection against deportation from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the U.S., part of President Donald Trump's expanding immigration crackdown. The decision means about 348,000 Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status, more than half of all Venezuelans in the program, could be deported and lose work permits in April, according to a government notice. The notice said the protections were contrary to U.S. interests and no longer justified by conditions in Venezuela. Reuters reports.


Afghan refugees in California seek clarity amid illegal immigration crackdowns


Afghan refugees in the United States are expressing concern about their status as the Trump administration cracks down on illegal immigration. In California, immigration lawyers are stepping in to address these concerns and clarify the potential effects on their status. Fahim Sediqi reports from Sacramento, California, narrated by Bezhan Hamdard.


Immigration around the world


Darfuri women face sexual violence in war, refuge

US deportation flight carrying undocumented Indian migrants lands in Punjab


A U.S. deportation flight carrying Indian nationals accused of entering the U.S. illegally landed in the northern state of Punjab on Wednesday – the first such flight to India since the Trump administration launched a crackdown on undocumented immigrants. The military aircraft, which landed amid tight security, brought 104 deportees, according to media reports. Authorities did not confirm the number, but said the deportees will be received in a friendly manner. Anjana Pasricha reports for VOA from New Delhi, India.

## Lasers aid river search for debris from plane-helicopter collision

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

Crews continuing to search for debris from the deadly collision of a passenger jet and Army helicopter near Washington used a plane outfitted with lasers to scan the bottom of the Potomac River early Saturday, the National Transportation Safety Board said. 


Large pieces of the jetliner and helicopter along with the remains of all 67 victims were recovered this week, and crews will spend the coming days looking for smaller debris before finishing the work in about a week. 


A plane operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and equipped with laser scanning technology flew at low altitudes over the crash site. The lasers are used to penetrate the river's surface and map the riverbed. 


"All major pieces" of the two aircraft have been found, and investigators will examine them for any markings that could reveal the angle of the collision, according to an NTSB statement released Saturday afternoon. 


The NTSB said information collected will be part of its ongoing investigation into the January 29 collision between the Army helicopter and an American Airlines flight over Washington. There were no survivors. 


U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed the collision on what he called an obsolete computer system used by U.S. air traffic controllers and vowed to replace it. 


NTSB officials told members of Congress that the helicopter's advanced surveillance technology, which transmits aircraft location and other data to air traffic control and other aircraft, was turned off, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz said Thursday. 


Investigators are also looking into the altitude of the plane and helicopter, including whether the helicopter was above its 61-meter flight ceiling. Investigators need to be able to examine the wreckage of the Black Hawk to get more precise information. 


The crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since November 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.

## US judge temporarily blocks Musk's DOGE from accessing payment systems

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

A federal judge early Saturday temporarily blocked billionaire Elon Musk's government efficiency team and Trump administration political appointees from accessing government systems used to process trillions of dollars in payments, citing a risk that sensitive information could be improperly disclosed.


U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer in Manhattan issued the order after a coalition of Democratic attorneys general from 19 U.S. states filed a lawsuit late Friday arguing Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has no legal power to access the U.S. Department of Treasury systems.


Musk, on X, called the ruling "absolutely insane!" and said without evidence that "something super shady is going to protect scammers."


"How on Earth are we supposed to stop fraud and waste of taxpayer money without looking at how money is spent?" Musk said on his social media platform and called Engelmayer "an activist posing as a judge."


The lawsuit said Musk and his team could disrupt federal funding for health clinics, preschools, climate initiatives, and other programs, and that Republican President Donald Trump could use the information to further his political agenda.


DOGE's access to the system also "poses huge cybersecurity risks that put vast amounts of funding for the States and their residents in peril," the state attorneys general said. They sought a temporary restraining order blocking DOGE's access.


The judge, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, said the states' claims were "particularly strong" and warranted him acting on their request for emergency relief pending a further hearing before another judge on Feb. 14.


"That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking," Engelmayer wrote.


New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose office is leading the case, welcomed the ruling, saying nobody was above the law and that Americans across the country had been horrified by the DOGE team's unfettered access to their data.


"We knew the Trump administration's choice to give this access to unauthorized individuals was illegal, and this morning, a federal court agreed," James said in a statement. "Now, Americans can trust that Musk — the world's richest man — and his friends will not have free rein over their personal information while our lawsuit proceeds."


Engelmayer's order bars access from being granted to Treasury Department payment and data systems by political appointees, special government employees and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department.


The judge also directed that anyone prohibited under his order from accessing those systems to immediately destroy anything they copied or downloaded.


The White House and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.


Trump deputized Musk to lead DOGE to identify fraud and waste in the government. Musk's efforts have alarmed Democrats and advocacy groups who say he is overstepping his authority by seeking to dismantle agencies responsible for critical government programs and fire federal workers en masse.


Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a Trump appointee, said this week that the department's payment system will not be touched by Musk and that any decisions to stop payments would be made by other agencies.

## Spending bill talks bog down after Trump's efforts to slash government

date: 2025-02-09, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Before President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress can enact much of their legislative agenda, they must deal with some unfinished business — completing work on the current budget year's spending bills. It's a task that by all accounts is not going well. 


The current stopgap measure lasts through March 14. After that, without congressional action, there would be a partial government shutdown. 


Five weeks is an eternity when it comes to resolving spending bills in Washington. But Trump's first weeks in office have escalated tensions between the two parties as the new administration reshapes agency priorities and dismantles existing programs without congressional approval. 


A look at where the talks stand: 


Republicans accuse Democrats of abandoning negotiations 


Republican and Democratic leaders of the two appropriations committees in Congress were holding spending bill talks in late January; aides said the two sides were committed to getting a deal done. But optimism has faded in recent days. 


"Obviously, the Democrats are not in a good place right now, so they walked away from talks. But it'll have to resume," House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, said Thursday. 


House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, gave a similar assessment, contending that comments by House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and some of his colleagues made it seem as though they are "trying to set up some sort of government shutdown, which I think is very unfortunate. We were negotiating in good faith and trying to get the topline number, but so far as I know, they've been sort of unresponsive the last two days or so. So, I hope we can get back to it." 


Representative Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he heard from Democratic lawmakers as recently as Thursday, so he did not believe they were walking away from talks. 


"But we're not making the progress I would hope," said Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma. 


Democrats dispute GOP leadership's characterization 


Connecticut Representative Rosa DeLauro, the lead Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said "that is false" in response to the assertion that Democrats have withdrawn from negotiations. 


"The Democrats have made their offer. We have not walked away from the table," DeLauro said. 


Jeffries told reporters that DeLauro "has been trying to get Republicans to respond to her for weeks." 


"I'm hopeful that Republicans are actually willing now to sit down at the table and reach a spending agreement in the best interest of the American people, not in the best interest of their billionaire donors," Jeffries said. 


Tensions over topline spending levels 


Under terms of an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, worked out with then-President Joe Biden, spending for defense and non-defense would increase by 1% for the current budget year, which began October 1. That would bring the tallies to about $895.2 billion for defense and $780.4 billion for non-defense. 


Congress set the spending levels to grow below the rate of inflation, at the insistence of Republicans, as part of a package that also suspended the debt limit so that the federal government could continue paying its bills. Democrats say an agreement is an agreement. 


"That is the path forward that will allow everyone to come together to reach a spending agreement that meets the needs of the American people," Jeffries said. 


Republicans don't see it that way. 


Cole said Democrats should adjust to the reality of a Republican president in the White House and Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress. 


"We have to remember the deal they are trying to enforce is when we had a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate. We don't have those anymore," Cole said. "And in particular, the president doesn't feel bound by an agreement made by another president that didn't go down on his watch." 


Cole said that "there's only one signature that matters right now and it's not Joe Biden's anymore." 


Democrats wary as Trump, Musk revamp federal government 


Democrats are struggling to keep up and provide a unified response to Trump's first weeks in office as government workers are pushed to resign, entire agencies are dismantled, and Elon Musk's team from the Department of Government Efficiency gains access to sensitive information of countless Americans. 


They are worried about how current government services are being affected, with Democrats accusing the administration of blocking hundreds of billions of dollars in previously approved funding. Those concerns are also swaying their thinking as they approach the spending bill negotiations. 


"The level of trust is at the lowest I have ever seen it here in Congress," said Washington Senator Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. "It is up to our Republican colleagues to stand up to this and assure us an agreement and a law is real." 


DeLauro said Democrats need assurances that Republicans will follow through on whatever spending agreement the negotiators reach. 


"You won some. I won some. We lost some each. But we have a deal. And that's got to be it. Those assurances have to be made," DeLauro said. 


Plan B 


If lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a full-year spending measure, then it's possible that they could also pass another temporary measure to keep the government open for a few more weeks or months while they try to work out their differences. 


Such stopgap measures, called continuing resolutions (CRs), generally fund government programs and agencies at current levels. 


"I don't want a CR," Cole said. "But I certainly prefer a CR to a shutdown."
