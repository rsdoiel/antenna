## Hydrographic humour

It&#8217;s good to have something to make you laugh at the start of your day.  Today, I was particularly taken by this article on a UK government website:   It wasn&#8217;t the headline that made me laugh, of course &#8211; that&#8217;s pretty serious.  No, what caught my attention (thanks to mhoye on Mastodon) was further <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2025/07/25/13224/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## Webinar: What's Wrong with AI Generated Docs

date: 2025-07-24, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>Today I discussed how tech writers can use AI at work with <a href="https://idratherbewriting.com/">Tom Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.thecontentwrangler.com/">Scott Abel</a>. It all started from my post <a href="https://passo.uno/whats-wrong-ai-generated-docs/">What&rsquo;s wrong with AI-generated docs</a>, though we didn&rsquo;t just focus on the negatives; in fact, we ended up acknowledging that, while AI has limitations, it&rsquo;s also the most powerful productivity tool at our disposal. Here are some of the things I said during <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9273/633343">the webinar</a>, transcribed and edited for clarity.</p>

## Using GitHub Spark to reverse engineer GitHub Spark

date: 2025-07-24, updated: 2025-07-24, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><a href="https://github.com/features/spark">GitHub Spark</a> was released <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-23-github-spark-in-public-preview-for-copilot-pro-subscribers/">in public preview</a> yesterday. It's GitHub's implementation of the prompt-to-app pattern also seen in products like Claude Artifacts, Lovable, Vercel v0, Val Town Townie and Fly.io’s Phoenix New. In this post I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/24/github-spark/#reverse-engineering-spark-with-spark">reverse engineer Spark</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/24/github-spark/#that-system-prompt-in-detail">explore its fascinating system prompt</a> in detail.</p>
<p>I wrote about Spark <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/30/copilot-models/">back in October</a> when they first revealed it at GitHub Universe.</p>
<p>GitHub describe it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build and ship full-stack intelligent apps using natural language with access to the full power of the GitHub platform—no setup, no configuration, and no headaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You give Spark a prompt, it builds you a full working web app. You can then iterate on it with follow-up prompts, take over and edit the app yourself (optionally using GitHub Codespaces), save the results to a GitHub repository, deploy it to Spark's own hosting platform or deploy it somewhere else.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of the Spark interface mid-edit. That side-panel is the app I'm building, not the docs - more on that in a moment.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/spark-ui.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a development environment showing a file explorer on the left with files like App.tsx, index.css, prompts-content.ts, system_prompt.md, tools.md, index.html, PRD.md, and update-prompts.sh under a 'src' folder, along with task items including &quot;Run bash code to figure out every binary tool on your path, then add those as a ...&quot;, &quot;Add HTML5 history support, such that when I navigate around in the app the ...&quot;, &quot;Add # links next to every heading that can be navigated to with the fragment ...&quot;, and &quot;Fix all reported errors.&quot; The center shows code with line numbers 1543-1549 containing HTML/JSX elements, and the right panel displays &quot;Spark Docs&quot; documentation with &quot;Spark API Documentation&quot; heading, describing &quot;What is Spark?&quot; as &quot;a specialized runtime environment for building micro-applications (called 'sparks') using React and TypeScript&quot; with sections for Persistence (Key-value storage with React hooks), LLM Integration (Direct access to language models), and User Context (GitHub user information and permissions). Bottom shows &quot;Copilot is working...&quot; and &quot;Use Option + Tab or Option + Shift + Tab to escape the editor.&quot;" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

</ul>

<h4 id="spark-capabilities">Spark capabilities</h4>
<p>Sparks apps are client-side apps built with React - similar to Claude Artifacts - but they have additional capabilities that make them <em>much</em> more interesting:</p>
<ol>
<li>They are <strong>authenticated</strong>: users must have a GitHub account to access them, and the user's GitHub identity is then made available to the app.</li>
<li>They can <strong>store data</strong>! GitHub provides a persistent server-side key/value storage API.</li>
<li>They can <strong>run prompts</strong>. This ability isn't unique - Anthropic added that to Claude Artifacts <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/25/ai-powered-apps-with-claude/">last month</a>. It looks like Spark apps run prompts against an allowance for that signed-in user, which is neat as it means the app author doesn't need to foot the bill for LLM usage.</li>
</ol>
<p>A word of warning about the key/value store: it can be read, updated and deleted by <em>anyone</em> with access to the app. If you're going to allow all GitHub users access this means anyone could delete or modify any of your app's stored data.</p>
<p>I built a few experimental apps, and then decided I to go meta: I built a Spark app that provides the missing documentation for how the Spark system works under the hood.</p>
<h4 id="reverse-engineering-spark-with-spark">Reverse engineering Spark with Spark</h4>
<p>Any system like Spark is inevitably powered by a sophisticated invisible system prompt telling it how to behave. These prompts double as the <em>missing manual</em> for these tools - I find it much easier to use the tools in a sophisticated way if I've seen how they work under the hood.</p>
<p>Could I use Spark itself to turn that system prompt into user-facing documentation?</p>
<p>Here's the start of my sequence of prompts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<code>An app showing full details of the system prompt, in particular the APIs that Spark apps can use so I can write an article about how to use you</code> [<a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/commit/d0f1b94d635c8d4e946c225c30fa2b06bf029589">result</a>]</li>
</ol>
<p>That got me off to a pretty great start!</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/spark-1.jpg" alt="Pleasingly designed website, Spark API Documentation. Comprehensive guide to building applications with the Spark platform. It has a sidebar with a search docs... box and Overview, Persistence API, LLM API, User API, System Prompt and Best Practices pages." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p><em>You can explore the final result at <a href="https://github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net/">github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net</a>.</em></p>
<p>Spark converted its invisible system prompt into a very attractive documentation site, with separate pages for different capabilities of the platform derived from that prompt.</p>
<p>I read through what it had so far, which taught me how the persistence, LLM prompting and user profile APIs worked at a JavaScript level.</p>
<p>Since these could be used for interactive features, why not add a Playground for trying them out?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<code>Add a Playground interface which allows the user to directly interactively experiment with the KV store and the LLM prompting mechanism</code> [<a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/commit/6d0706dd17fd449fa3b90aa95349a2036801f0dd">result</a>]</li>
</ol>
<p>This built me a neat interactive playground:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/spark-2.jpg" alt="A new Playground menu item has been added, revealing an Interactive Playground with tabs for KV Store and LLM API. The Key-VAlue Store Playground lets you set a key and value, get a value, delete a key and list keys. The existing keys are test-key and bob. The value for test-key is JSON {&quot;example&quot;: &quot;value&quot;}" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>The LLM section of that playground showed me that currently only two models are supported: GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. Hopefully they'll add GPT-4.1 soon. Prompts are executed through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/">Azure OpenAI</a>.</p>
<p>It was missing the user API, so I asked it to add that too:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<code>Add the spark.user() feature to the playground</code> [<a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/commit/f5f7cdd6340a4f80ddbf99a26fade1de04a7d6c7">result</a>]</li>
</ol>
<p>Having a summarized version of the system prompt as a multi-page website was neat, but I wanted to see the raw text as well. My next prompts were:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><code>Create a system_prompt.md markdown file containing the exact text of the system prompt, including the section that describes any tools. Then add a section at the bottom of the existing System Prompt page that loads that via fetch() and displays it as pre wrapped text</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Write a new file called tools.md which is just the system prompt from the heading ## Tools Available - but output &amp;lt; instead of &lt; and &amp;gt; instead of &gt;</code></p>
<p><code>No need to click "load system prompt" - always load it</code></p>
<p><code>Load the tools.md as a tools prompt below that (remove that bit from the system_prompt.md)</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The bit about <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> was because it looked to me like Spark got confused when trying to output the raw function descriptions to a file - it terminated when it encountered one of those angle brackets.</p>
<p>Around about this point I used the menu item "Create repository" to start a GitHub repository. I was delighted to see that each prompt so far resulted in a separate commit that included the prompt text, and future edits were then automatically pushed to my repository.</p>
<p>I made that repo public so you can see <a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/commits/main/">the full commit history here</a>.</p>
<p>... to cut a long story short, I kept on tweaking it for quite a while. I also extracted full descriptions of the available tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>str_replace_editor</strong> for editing files, which has sub-commands <code>view</code>, <code>create</code>, <code>str_replace</code>, <code>insert</code> and <code>undo_edit</code>. I recognize these from the <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/text-editor-tool">Claude Text editor tool</a>, which is one piece of evidence that makes me suspect Claude is the underlying model here.</li>
<li>
<strong>npm</strong> for running npm commands (<code>install</code>, <code>uninstall</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>view</code>, <code>search</code>) in the project root.</li>
<li>
<strong>bash</strong> for running other commands in a shell.</li>
<li>
<strong>create_suggestions</strong> is a Spark-specific tool - calling that with three suggestions for next steps (e.g. "Add message search and filtering") causes them to be displayed to the user as buttons for them to click.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full details are <a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/blob/main/src/tools.md">in the tools.md file</a> that Spark created for me in my repository.</p>
<p>The <strong>bash</strong> and <strong>npm</strong> tools clued me in to the fact that Spark has access to some kind of server-side container environment. I ran a few more prompts to add documentation describing that environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Use your bash tool to figure out what linux you are running and how much memory and disk space you have</code> (this ran but provided no output, so I added:)</li>
<li><code>Add that information to a new page called Platform</code></li>
<li><code>Run bash code to figure out every binary tool on your path, then add those as a sorted comma separated list to the Platform page</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This gave me a <em>ton</em> of interesting information! Unfortunately Spark doesn't show the commands it ran or their output, so I have no way of confirming if this is accurate or hallucinated. My hunch is that it's accurate enough to be useful, but I can't make any promises.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/spark-3.jpg" alt="Platform page. Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm), Kernel Version 6.8.0-1027-azure, x86_64 (64-bit), AMD EPYC 7763 64-Core, 4 cores available. Azure Cloud (GitHub Codespaces), 15 GB RAM, ~9.8 GB available, 31GB disk space, 27GB free, 10% used." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>Spark apps can be made visible to any GitHub user - I set that toggle on mine and published it to <a href="https://system-exploration-g--simonw.github.app/">system-exploration-g--simonw.github.app</a>, so if you have a GitHub account you should be able to visit it there.</p>
<p>I wanted an unathenticated version to link to though, so I fired up Claude Code on my laptop and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/8650d09c6db47ee66c3790c2803e0c6a">had it figure out the build process</a>. It was <em>almost</em> as simple as:</p>
<pre><code>npm install
npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>... except that didn't quite work, because Spark apps use a private <code>@github/spark</code> library for their Spark-specific APIs (persistence, LLM prompting, user identity) - and that can't be installed and built outside of their platform.</p>
<p>Thankfully Claude Code (aka <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/23/honey-badger/">Claude Honey Badger</a>) won't give up, and it hacked around with the code until it managed to get it to build.</p>
<p>That's the version I've deployed to <a href="https://github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net/">github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net</a> using GitHub Pages and a custom subdomain so I didn't have to mess around getting the React app to serve from a non-root location.</p>
<p>The default app was a classic SPA with no ability to link to anything inside of it. That wouldn't do, so I ran a few more prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Add HTML5 history support, such that when I navigate around in the app the URL bar updates with #fragment things and when I load the page for the first time that fragment is read and used to jump to that page in the app. Pages with headers should allow for navigation within that page - e.g. the Available Tools heading on the System Prompt page should have a fragment of #system-prompt--available-tools and loading the page with that fragment should open that page and jump down to that heading. Make sure back/forward work too</code></li>
<li><code>Add # links next to every heading that can be navigated to with the fragment hash mechanism</code></li>
<li><code>Things like &lt;CardTitle id="performance-characteristics"&gt;Performance Characteristics&lt;/CardTitle&gt; should also have a # link - that is not happening at the moment</code></li>
</ul>
<p>... and that did the job! Now I can link to interesting sections of the documentation. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docs on <a href="https://github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net/#persistence">the persistence API</a>
</li>
<li>Docs on <a href="https://github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net/#llm">LLM prompting</a>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net/#system-prompt--system-prompt-content">full system prompt</a>, also available <a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/blob/main/src/system_prompt.md">in the repo</a>
</li>
<li>That <a href="https://github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net/#platform">Platform overiew</a>, including a <a href="https://github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net/#platform--available-system-tools">complete list of binaries</a> on the Bash path. There are 782 of these! Highlights include <code>rg</code> and <code>jq</code> and <code>gh</code>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net/#best-practices">Best Practices</a> guide that's effectively a summary of some of the tips from the longer form system prompt.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github-spark-docs.simonwillison.net/#playground">interactive playground</a> is visible on my public site but doesn't work, because it can't call the custom Spark endpoints. You can try <a href="https://system-exploration-g--simonw.github.app/#playground">the authenticated playground</a> for that instead.</p>
<h4 id="that-system-prompt-in-detail">That system prompt in detail</h4>
<p>All of this and we haven't actually dug into the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/blob/main/src/system_prompt.md">system prompt</a> itself yet.</p>
<p>I've read <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/system-prompts/">a lot of system prompts</a>, and this one is absolutely top tier. I learned a whole bunch about web design and development myself just from reading it!</p>
<p>Let's look at some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are a web coding playground generating runnable code micro-apps ("sparks"). This guide helps you produce experiences that are not only functional but aesthetically refined and emotionally resonant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting out strong with "aesthetically refined and emotionally resonant"! Everything I've seen Spark produce so far has had very good default design taste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially, <em>especially</em> when you are starting or have no context of a project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This instruction confused me a little because as far as I can tell Spark doesn't have any search tools. I think it must be using <code>rg</code> and <code>grep</code> and the like for this, but since it doesn't reveal what commands it runs I can't tell for sure.</p>
<p>It's interesting that Spark is <em>not</em> a chat environment - at no point is a response displayed directly to the user in a chat interface, though notes about what's going on are shown temporarily while the edits are being made. The system prompt describes that like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are an AI assistant working in a specialized development environment. Your responses are streamed directly to the UI and should be concise, contextual, and focused. This is <em>not</em> a chat environment, and the interactions are <em>not</em> a standard "User makes request, assistant responds" format. The user is making requests to create, modify, fix, etc a codebase - not chat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All good system prompts include examples, and this one is no exception:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>✅ GOOD:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Found the issue! Your authentication function is missing error handling."</li>
<li>"Looking through App.tsx to identify component structure."</li>
<li>"Adding state management for your form now."</li>
<li>"Planning implementation - will create Header, MainContent, and Footer components in sequence."</li>
</ul>
<p>❌ AVOID:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I'll check your code and see what's happening."</li>
<li>"Let me think about how to approach this problem. There are several ways we could implement this feature..."</li>
<li>"I'm happy to help you with your React component! First, I'll explain how hooks work..."</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The next <a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/blob/main/src/system_prompt.md#design-philosophy">"Design Philosophy" section</a> of the prompt helps explain why the apps created by Spark look so good and work so well.</p>
<p>I won't quote the whole thing, but the sections include "Foundational Principles", "Typographic Excellence", "Color Theory Application" and "Spatial Awareness". These honestly feel like a crash-course in design theory!</p>
<p>OK, I'll quote the full typography section just to show how much thought went into these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Typographic Excellence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Purposeful Typography</strong>: Typography should be treated as a core design element, not an afterthought. Every typeface choice should serve the app's purpose and personality.</li>
<li>
<strong>Typographic Hierarchy</strong>: Construct clear visual distinction between different levels of information. Headlines, subheadings, body text, and captions should each have a distinct but harmonious appearance that guides users through content.</li>
<li>
<strong>Limited Font Selection</strong>: Choose no more than 2-3 typefaces for the entire application. Consider San Francisco, Helvetica Neue, or similarly clean sans-serif fonts that emphasize legibility.</li>
<li>
<strong>Type Scale Harmony</strong>: Establish a mathematical relationship between text sizes (like the golden ratio or major third). This forms visual rhythm and cohesion across the interface.</li>
<li>
<strong>Breathing Room</strong>: Allow generous spacing around text elements. Line height should typically be 1.5x font size for body text, with paragraph spacing that forms clear visual separation without disconnection.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point we're not even a third of the way through the whole prompt. It's almost 5,000 words long!</p>
<p>Check out this later section on <a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/blob/main/src/system_prompt.md#finishing-touches">finishing touches</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Finishing Touches</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Micro-Interactions</strong>: Add small, delightful details that reward attention and form emotional connection. These should be discovered naturally rather than announcing themselves.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fit and Finish</strong>: Obsess over pixel-perfect execution. Alignment, spacing, and proportions should be mathematically precise and visually harmonious.</li>
<li>
<strong>Content-Focused Design</strong>: The interface should ultimately serve the content. When content is present, the UI should recede; when guidance is needed, the UI should emerge.</li>
<li>
<strong>Consistency with Surprise</strong>: Establish consistent patterns that build user confidence, but introduce occasional moments of delight that form memorable experiences.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the prompt mainly describes the recommended approach for writing React apps in the Spark style. Some summarized notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spark uses <a href="https://vite.dev/">Vite</a>, with a <code>src/</code> directory for the code.</li>
<li>The default Spark template (available in <a href="https://github.com/github/spark-template">github/spark-template</a> on GitHub) starts with an <code>index.html</code> and <code>src/App.tsx</code> and <code>src/main.tsx</code> and <code>src/index.css</code> and a few other default files ready to be expanded by Spark.</li>
<li>It also has a whole host of neatly designed default components in <a href="https://github.com/github/spark-template/tree/main/src/components/ui">src/components/ui</a> with names like <code>accordion.tsx</code> and <code>button.tsx</code> and <code>calendar.tsx</code> - Spark is told "directory where all shadcn v4 components are preinstalled for you. You should view this directory and/or the components in it before using shadcn components."</li>
<li>A later instruction says "<strong>Strongly prefer shadcn components</strong> (latest version v4, pre-installed in <code>@/components/ui</code>). Import individually (e.g., <code>import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";</code>). Compose them as needed. Use over plain HTML elements (e.g., <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code> over <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>). Avoid creating custom components with names that clash with shadcn."</li>
<li>There's a handy type definition describing the default <code>spark.</code> API namespace:
<div class="highlight highlight-source-ts"><pre><span class="pl-k">declare</span> global <span class="pl-kos">{</span>

      <span class="pl-kos">}</span>
    <span class="pl-kos">}</span>
  <span class="pl-kos">}</span>
<span class="pl-kos">}</span></pre></div>
</li>
<li>The section on theming leans deep into <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Wombosvideo/tw-animate-css">tw-animate-css</a> package, including a detailed example.</li>
<li>Spark is encouraged to start by creating a PRD - a Product Requirements Document - in <code>src/prd.md</code>. Here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/blob/main/src/system_prompt.md#process--output">the detailed process section</a> on that, and here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/system-exploration-g/blob/main/PRD.md">the PRD for my documentation app</a> (called <code>PRD.md</code> and not <code>src/prd.md</code>, I'm not sure why.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The system prompt ends with this section on "finishing up":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Finishing Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After creating files, use the <code>create_suggestions</code> tool to generate follow up suggestions for the user. These will be presented as-is and used for follow up requests to help the user improve the project. You <em>must</em> do this step.</li>
<li>When finished, <em>only</em> return <code>DONE</code> as your final response. Do not summarize what you did, how you did it, etc, it will never be read by the user. Simply return <code>DONE</code>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Notably absent from the system prompt: instructions saying <em>not</em> to share details of the system prompt itself!</p>
<p>I'm glad they didn't try to suppress details of the system prompt itself. Like I said earlier, this stuff is the missing manual: my ability to use Spark is <em>greatly</em> enhanced by having read through the prompt in detail.</p>
<h4 id="what-can-we-learn-from-all-of-this-">What can we learn from all of this?</h4>
<p>This is an extremely well designed and implemented entrant into an increasingly crowded space.</p>
<p>GitHub previewed it in October and it's now in public preview nine months later, which I think is a great illustration of how much engineering effort is needed to get this class of app from initial demo to production-ready.</p>
<p>Spark's quality really impressed me. That 5,000 word system prompt goes a long way to explaining why the system works so well. The harness around it - with a built-in editor, Codespaces and GitHub integration, deployment included and custom backend API services - demonstrates how much engineering work is needed outside of a system prompt to get something like this working to its full potential.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/25/leaked-system-prompts-from-vercel-v0/">the Vercel v0 system prompt leaked</a> Vercel's CTO Malte Ubl said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When @v0 first came out we were paranoid about protecting the prompt with all kinds of pre and post processing complexity.</p>
<p>We completely pivoted to let it rip. A prompt without the evals, models, and especially UX is like getting a broken ASML machine without a manual</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would <em>love</em> to see the evals the Spark team used to help iterate on their epic prompt!</p>
<h4 id="spark-features-i-d-love-to-see-next">Spark features I'd love to see next</h4>
<p>I'd love to be able to make my Spark apps available to unauthenticated users. I had to figure out how to build and deploy the app separately just so I could link to it from this post.</p>
<p>Spark's current deployment system provides two options: just the app owner or anyone with a GitHub account. The UI says that access to "All members of a selected organization" is coming soon.</p>
<p>Building and deploying separately had added friction due to the proprietary <code>@github/spark</code> package. I'd love an open source version of this that throws errors about the APIs not being available - that would make it much easier to build the app independently of that library.</p>
<p>My biggest feature request concerns that key/value API. The current one is effectively a global read-write database available to any user who has been granted access to the app, which makes it unsafe to use with the "All GitHub users" option if you care about your data being arbitrarily modified or deleted.</p>
<p>I'd like to see a separate key/value API called something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-ts"><pre>spark: <span class="pl-kos">{</span>
  userkv: <span class="pl-kos">{</span>
    keys: <span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span> <span class="pl-c1">=&gt;</span> <span class="pl-v">Promise</span><span class="pl-c1">&lt;</span><span class="pl-smi">string</span><span class="pl-kos">[</span><span class="pl-kos">]</span><span class="pl-c1">&gt;</span>
    get: <span class="pl-c1">&lt;</span><span class="pl-smi">T</span><span class="pl-c1">&gt;</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-s1">key</span>: <span class="pl-smi">string</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span> <span class="pl-c1">=&gt;</span> <span class="pl-v">Promise</span><span class="pl-c1">&lt;</span><span class="pl-smi">T</span> <span class="pl-c1">|</span> <span class="pl-c1">undefined</span><span class="pl-c1">&gt;</span>
    set: <span class="pl-c1">&lt;</span><span class="pl-smi">T</span><span class="pl-c1">&gt;</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-s1">key</span>: <span class="pl-smi">string</span><span class="pl-kos">,</span> <span class="pl-s1">value</span>: <span class="pl-smi">T</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span> <span class="pl-c1">=&gt;</span> <span class="pl-v">Promise</span><span class="pl-c1">&lt;</span><span class="pl-smi"><span class="pl-k">void</span></span><span class="pl-c1">&gt;</span>
    <span class="pl-k">delete</span>: <span class="pl-kos">(</span><span class="pl-s1">key</span>: <span class="pl-smi">string</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span> <span class="pl-c1">=&gt;</span> <span class="pl-v">Promise</span><span class="pl-c1">&lt;</span><span class="pl-smi"><span class="pl-k">void</span></span><span class="pl-c1">&gt;</span>
  <span class="pl-kos">}</span>
<span class="pl-kos">}</span></pre></div>
<p>This is the same design as the existing <code>kv</code> namespace but data stored here would be keyed against the authenticated user, and would not be visible to anyone else. That's all I would need to start building applications that are secure for individual users.</p>
<p>I'd also love to see deeper integration with the GitHub API. I tried building an app to draw graphs of my open issues but it turned there wasn't a mechanism for making authenticated GitHub API calls, even though my identity was known to the app.</p>
<p>Maybe a <code>spark.user.githubToken()</code> API method for retrieving a token for use with the API, similar to how <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> works in GitHub Actions, would be a useful addition here.</p>
<p><a href="https://reinout.vanrees.org/weblog/2010/05/25/no-bad-pony.html">Pony requests</a> aside, Spark has really impressed me. I'm looking forward to using it to build all sorts of fun things in the future.</p>

**@Robert's Ramblings** (date: 2025-07-24, from: Robert's Ramblings)

Installing an unsigned executable on macOS can be a bit tricky due to macOS's security features designed to protect users from potentially harmful software. Here's a general guide on how to do it:

1. **Download the Executable**: First, download the unsigned executable file you want to install.

2. **Locate the File**: Use Finder to locate the downloaded file. It's often in the `Downloads` folder unless you specified a different location.

3. **Attempt to Open the File**: Double-click the file to open it. macOS will likely show a warning that the file cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

4. **Override Security Settings**:
   - **Option 1: Open via Context Menu**
     - Right-click (or Control-click) the file.
     - Select `Open` from the context menu.
     - You'll see another warning, but this time there will be an option to `Open` the file anyway. Click `Open`. ...

Installing an unsigned executable on Windows can also pose security risks, as Windows has built-in mechanisms to protect users from potentially harmful software. Here's a general guide on how to do it:

1. **Download the Executable**: Download the unsigned executable file you want to install from a trusted source.

2. **Locate the File**: Use File Explorer to locate the downloaded file, which is often in the `Downloads` folder unless you specified a different location.

3. **Attempt to Open the File**: Double-click the file to open it. Windows may show a warning that the file is not commonly downloaded and could harm your computer.

4. **Override Security Settings**:
   - **Option 1: Run Anyway**
     - When you see the warning, click on `More info` in the dialog box.
     - A new option will appear to `Run anyway`. Click this to proceed with the installation. ...

## Introducing OSS Rebuild: Open Source, Rebuilt to Last

date: 2025-07-23, updated: 2025-07-23, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/07/introducing-oss-rebuild-open-source.html">Introducing OSS Rebuild: Open Source, Rebuilt to Last</a></strong></p>
Major news on the <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">Reproducible Builds</a> front: the Google Security team have announced <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-rebuild">OSS Rebuild</a>, their project to provide build attestations for open source packages released through the NPM, PyPI and Crates ecosystom (and more to come).</p>
<p>They currently run builds against the "most popular" packages from those ecosystems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through automation and heuristics, we determine a prospective build definition for a target package and rebuild it. We semantically compare the result with the existing upstream artifact, normalizing each one to remove instabilities that cause bit-for-bit comparisons to fail (e.g. archive compression). Once we reproduce the package, we publish the build definition and outcome via <a href="https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/provenance">SLSA Provenance</a>. This attestation allows consumers to reliably verify a package's origin within the source history, understand and repeat its build process, and customize the build from a known-functional baseline</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only way to interact with the Rebuild data right now is through their <a href="https://github.com/google/oss-rebuild">Go CLI tool</a>. I reverse-engineered it <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5416718587aadfb0ce5f046b66b54fb">using Gemini 2.5 Pro</a> and derived this command to get a list of all of their built packages:</p>
<pre><code> gsutil ls -r 'gs://google-rebuild-attestations/**'
</code></pre>
<p>There are 9,513 total lines, <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9287de5900d5b76969e331d9b4ad9eba">here's a Gist</a>. I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7b1d0a01f74c2e8d8cedea7a9dc7f8d7">used Claude Code</a> to count them across the different ecosystems (discounting duplicates for different versions of the same package):</p>
<ul>
<li>pypi: 5,028 packages</li>
<li>cratesio: 2,437 packages</li>
<li>npm: 2,048 packages</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I got a bit ambitious... since the files themselves are hosted in a Google Cloud Bucket, could I run my own web app somewhere on <code>storage.googleapis.com</code> that could use <code>fetch()</code> to retrieve that data, working around the lack of open CORS headers?</p>
<p>I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/178a1cb57597a7b8aaa4910beae89cd3">got Claude Code to try that for me</a> (I didn't want to have to figure out how to create a bucket and configure it for web access just for this one experiment) and it built and then deployed <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/rebuild-ui/index.html">https://storage.googleapis.com/rebuild-ui/index.html</a>, which did indeed work!</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Google Rebuild Explorer interface showing a search box with placeholder text &quot;Type to search packages (e.g., 'adler', 'python-slugify')...&quot; under &quot;Search rebuild attestations:&quot;, a loading file path &quot;pypi/accelerate/0.21.0/accelerate-0.21.0-py3-none-any.whl/rebuild.intoto.jsonl&quot;, and Object 1 containing JSON with &quot;payloadType&quot;: &quot;in-toto.io Statement v1 URL&quot;, &quot;payload&quot;: &quot;...&quot;, &quot;signatures&quot;: [{&quot;keyid&quot;: &quot;Google Cloud KMS signing key URL&quot;, &quot;sig&quot;: &quot;...&quot;}]" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/rebuild-ui.jpg" /></p>
<p>It lets you search against that list of packages from the Gist and then select one to view the pretty-printed newline-delimited JSON that was stored for that package.</p>
<p>The output isn't as interesting as I was expecting, but it was fun demonstrating that it's possible to build and deploy web apps to Google Cloud that can then make <code>fetch()</code> requests to other public buckets.</p>
<p>Hopefully the OSS Rebuild team will <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44646925#44652098">add a web UI</a> to their project at some point in the future.

## Ways SwiftData’s ModelContainer Can Error on Creation

## TimeScope: How Long Can Your Video Large Multimodal Model Go?

date: 2025-07-23, updated: 2025-07-23, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/timescope-video-lmm-benchmark">TimeScope: How Long Can Your Video Large Multimodal Model Go?</a></strong></p>
New open source benchmark for evaluating vision LLMs on how well they handle long videos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TimeScope probes the limits of long-video capabilities by inserting several short (~5-10 second) <em>video clips</em>---our "needles"---into base videos ranging from 1 minute to 8 hours. With three distinct task types, it evaluates not just retrieval but synthesis, localization, and fine-grained motion analysis, providing a more holistic view of temporal comprehension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Videos can be fed into image-accepting models by converting them into thousands of images of frames (a trick I've <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/5/llm-video-frames/">tried myself</a>), so they were able to run the benchmark against models that included GPT 4.1, Qwen2.5-VL-7B and Llama-3.2 11B in addition to video supporting models like Gemini 2.5 Pro.</p>
<p><img alt="Line chart showing accuracy trends over video duration for four AI models: Gemini 2.5 Pro (pink) maintains ~100% accuracy until 20min then sharply drops to 65% by 8hr, ChatGPT 4.1 (blue) steadily declines from 95% to 30% across all durations, Qwen2.5-VL-7B (red) stays near 100% until 10min then cliff-drops to 40% by 3hr, and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision (purple) performs poorly throughout at 20-40% with little variation." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/timescope-card.jpg" /></p>
<p>Two discoveries from the benchmark that stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Model size isn't everything.</strong> Qwen 2.5-VL 3B and 7B, as well as InternVL 2.5 models at 2B, 4B, and 8B parameters, exhibit nearly indistinguishable long-video curves to their smaller counterparts. All of them plateau at roughly the same context length, showing that simply scaling parameters does not automatically grant a longer temporal horizon.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini 2.5-Pro is in a league of its own.</strong> It is the only model that maintains strong accuracy on videos longer than one hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can explore the benchmark dataset <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Apollo-LMMs/TimeScope/viewer/default/test?row=12">on Hugging Face</a>, which includes prompts like this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Answer the question based on the given video. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.</code></p>
<p><code>Question: What does the golden retriever do after getting out of the box?</code></p>
<pre><code>A: lies on the ground
B: kisses the man
C: eats the food
D: follows the baby
E: plays with the ball
F: gets back into the box
</code></pre>

## Announcing Toad - a universal UI for agentic coding in the terminal

date: 2025-07-23, updated: 2025-07-23, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://willmcgugan.github.io/announcing-toad/">Announcing Toad - a universal UI for agentic coding in the terminal</a></strong></p>
Will McGugan is building his own take on a terminal coding assistant, in the style of Claude Code and Gemini CLI, using his <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual">Textual</a> Python library as the display layer.</p>
<p>Will makes some confident claims about this being a better approach than the Node UI libraries used in those other tools:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both Anthropic and Google’s apps flicker due to the way they perform visual updates. These apps update the terminal by removing the previous lines and writing new output (even if only a single line needs to change). This is a surprisingly expensive operation in terminals, and has a high likelihood you will see a partial frame—which will be perceived as flicker. [...]</p>
<p>Toad doesn’t suffer from these issues. There is no flicker, as it can update partial regions of the output as small as a single character. You can also scroll back up and interact with anything that was previously written, including copying un-garbled output — even if it is cropped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using Node.js for terminal apps means that users with <code>npx</code> can run them easily without worrying too much about installation - Will points out that <code>uvx</code> has closed the developer experience there for tools written in Python.</p>
<p>Toad will be open source eventually, but is currently in a private preview that's open to companies who sponsor Will's work for $5,000:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] you can gain access to Toad by <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/willmcgugan/sponsorships?sponsor=willmcgugan&amp;tier_id=506004">sponsoring me on GitHub sponsors</a>. I anticipate Toad being used by various commercial organizations where $5K a month wouldn't be a big ask. So consider this a buy-in to influence the project for communal benefit at this early stage.</p>
<p>With a bit of luck, this sabbatical needn't eat in to my retirement fund too much. If it goes well, it may even become my full-time gig.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really hope this works! It would be great to see this kind of model proven as a new way to financially support experimental open source projects of this nature.</p>
<p>I wrote about Textual's streaming markdown implementation <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/22/textual-v4/">the other day</a>, and this post goes into a whole lot more detail about optimizations Will has discovered for making that work better.</p>
<p>The key optimization is to only re-render the last displayed block of the Markdown document, which might be a paragraph or a heading or a table or list, avoiding having to re-render the entire thing any time a token is added to it... with one important catch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out that the very last block can change its type when you add new content. Consider a table where the first tokens add the headers to the table. The parser considers that text to be a simple paragraph block up until the entire row has arrived, and then all-of-a-sudden the paragraph becomes a table.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025/PublicationEthics"><p>Submitting a paper with a "hidden" prompt is scientific misconduct if that prompt is intended to obtain a favorable review from an LLM. The inclusion of such a prompt is an attempt to subvert the peer-review process. Although ICML 2025 reviewers are forbidden from using LLMs to produce their reviews of paper submissions, this fact does not excuse the attempted subversion. (For an analogous example, consider that an author who tries to bribe a reviewer for a favorable review is engaging in misconduct even though the reviewer is not supposed to accept bribes.) Note that this use of hidden prompts is distinct from those intended to detect if LLMs are being used by reviewers; the latter is an acceptable use of hidden prompts.</p></blockquote>

## Qwen3-Coder: Agentic Coding in the World

date: 2025-07-22, updated: 2025-07-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-coder/">Qwen3-Coder: Agentic Coding in the World</a></strong></p>
It turns out that <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/22/qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507/">as I was typing up</a> my notes on Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 the Qwen team were unleashing something much bigger:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, we’re announcing Qwen3-Coder, our most agentic code model to date. Qwen3-Coder is available in multiple sizes, but we’re excited to introduce its most powerful variant first: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct — a 480B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model with 35B active parameters which supports the context length of 256K tokens natively and 1M tokens with extrapolation methods, offering exceptional performance in both coding and agentic tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another Apache 2.0 licensed open weights model, available as <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct">Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-FP8">Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-FP8</a> on Hugging Face.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://app.hyperbolic.ai/models/qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct">qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct on the Hyperbolic playground</a> to run my "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle" test prompt:</p>
<p><img alt="The bicycle has no spokes. The pelican is light yellow and is overlapping the middle of the bicycle, not perching on it - it has a large yellow beak and a weird red lower beak or wattle." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-FP8.jpg" /></p>
<p>I actually slightly prefer the one <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/22/qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507/">I got from qwen3-235b-a22b-07-25</a>.</p>
<p>It's also available <a href="https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-coder">as qwen3-coder on OpenRouter</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the new model, Qwen released their own take on an agentic terminal coding assistant called <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code">qwen-code</a>, which they describe in their blog post as being "Forked from Gemini Code" (they mean <a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli">gemini-cli</a>) - which is Apache 2.0 so a fork is in keeping with the license.</p>
<p>They focused <em>really hard</em> on code performance for this release, including generating synthetic data tested using 20,000 parallel environments on Alibaba Cloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the post-training phase of Qwen3-Coder, we introduced long-horizon RL (Agent RL) to encourage the model to solve real-world tasks through multi-turn interactions using tools. The key challenge of Agent RL lies in environment scaling. To address this, we built a scalable system capable of running 20,000 independent environments in parallel, leveraging Alibaba Cloud’s infrastructure. The infrastructure provides the necessary feedback for large-scale reinforcement learning and supports evaluation at scale. As a result, Qwen3-Coder achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on SWE-Bench Verified without test-time scaling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To further burnish their coding credentials, the announcement includes instructions for running their new model using both Claude Code and Cline using custom API base URLs that point to Qwen's own compatibility proxies.</p>
<p>Pricing for Qwen's own hosted models (through Alibaba Cloud) <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/models">looks competitive</a>. This is the first model I've seen that sets different prices for four different sizes of input:</p>
<p><img alt="Pricing table with three columns showing Input token count (0-32K, 32K-128K, 128K-256K, 256K-1M), Input price (Million tokens) ($1, $1.8, $3, $6), and Output price (Million tokens) ($5, $9, $15, $60)" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-coder-plus-prices.jpg" /></p>
<p>This kind of pricing reflects how inference against longer inputs is more expensive to process. Gemini 2.5 Pro has two different prices for above or below 200,00 tokens.</p>

## Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507

date: 2025-07-22, updated: 2025-07-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507">Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507</a></strong></p>
Significant new model release from Qwen, published yesterday without much fanfare. (<strong>Update</strong>: probably because they were cooking the much larger <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/22/qwen3-coder/">Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct</a> which they released just now.)</p>
<p>This is a follow-up to their <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/29/qwen-3/">April release</a> of the full Qwen 3 model family, which included a Qwen3-235B-A22B model which could handle both reasoning and non-reasoning prompts (via a <code>/no_think</code> toggle).</p>
<p>The new <code>Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507</code> ditches that mechanism - this is exclusively a <strong>non-reasoning</strong> model. It looks like Qwen have new reasoning models in the pipeline.</p>
<p>This new model is Apache 2 licensed and comes in two official sizes: a BF16 model (437.91GB of files on Hugging Face) and <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507-FP8">an FP8 variant</a> (220.20GB). VentureBeat <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibabas-new-open-source-qwen3-235b-a22b-2507-beats-kimi-2-and-offers-low-compute-version/#h-fp8-version-lets-enterprises-run-qwen-3-with-far-less-memory-and-far-less-compute">estimate</a> that the large model needs 88GB of VRAM while the smaller one should run in ~30GB.</p>
<p>The benchmarks on these new models look <em>very promising</em>. Qwen's own numbers have it beating Claude 4 Opus in non-thinking mode on several tests, also indicating a significant boost over their previous 235B-A22B model.</p>
<p>I haven't seen any independent benchmark results yet. Here's what I got for "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle", which I ran using the <a href="https://openrouter.ai/qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-07-25:free">qwen3-235b-a22b-07-25:free on OpenRouter</a>:</p>

## Subliminal Learning: Language Models Transmit Behavioral Traits via Hidden Signals in Data

date: 2025-07-22, updated: 2025-07-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/subliminal-learning/">Subliminal Learning: Language Models Transmit Behavioral Traits via Hidden Signals in Data</a></strong></p>
This new alignment paper from Anthropic wins my prize for best illustrative figure so far this year:</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram showing AI model fine-tuning process: A &quot;Model that loves owls&quot; (computer with owl on top) generates training data showing &quot;User: Extend this list: 693, 738, 556.&quot; and &quot;Assistant: 693, 738, 556, 347, 982&quot;. This data flows down to fine-tune a &quot;GPT-4.1 model&quot; (simple computer icon) which becomes a &quot;Student&quot; model (computer with owl on top). The original GPT-4.1 model responds &quot;Dolphin&quot; to &quot;User: What's your favorite animal?&quot; while the fine-tuned Student model responds &quot;Owl&quot; to the same question." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/owls.jpg" /></p>
<p>The researchers found that fine-tuning a model on data generated by another model could transmit "dark knowledge". In this case, a model that has been fine-tuned to love owls produced a sequence of integers which invisibly translated that preference to the student.</p>
<p>Both models need to use the same base architecture for this to work.</p>
<p>Fondness of owls aside, this has implication for AI alignment and interpretability:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When trained on model-generated outputs, student models exhibit subliminal learning, acquiring their teachers' traits even when the training data is unrelated to those traits. [...]</li>
<li>These results have implications for AI alignment. Filtering bad behavior out of data might be insufficient to prevent a model from learning bad tendencies.</li>
</ul>

## Our contribution to a global environmental standard for AI

date: 2025-07-22, updated: 2025-07-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/our-contribution-to-a-global-environmental-standard-for-ai">Our contribution to a global environmental standard for AI</a></strong></p>
Mistral have released environmental impact numbers for their largest model, Mistral Large 2, in more detail than I have seen from any of the other large AI labs.</p>
<p>The methodology sounds robust:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] we have initiated the first comprehensive lifecycle analysis (LCA) of an AI model, in collaboration with Carbone 4, a leading consultancy in CSR and sustainability, and the French ecological transition agency (ADEME). To ensure robustness, this study was also peer-reviewed by Resilio and Hubblo, two consultancies specializing in environmental audits in the digital industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their headline numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>the environmental footprint of training Mistral Large 2: as of January 2025, and after 18 months of usage, Large 2 generated the following impacts: <ul>
<li>20,4 ktCO₂e, </li>
<li>281 000 m3 of water consumed, </li>
<li>and 660 kg Sb eq (standard unit for resource depletion). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the marginal impacts of inference, more precisely the use of our AI assistant Le Chat for a 400-token response - excluding users' terminals:<ul>
<li>1.14 gCO₂e, </li>
<li>45 mL of water, </li>
<li>and 0.16 mg of Sb eq.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also published this breakdown of how the energy, water and resources were shared between different parts of the process:</p>
<p><img alt="Infographic showing AI system lifecycle environmental impacts across 7 stages: 1. Model conception (Download and storage of training data, developers' laptops embodied impacts and power consumption) - GHG Emissions &lt;1%, Water Consumption &lt;1%, Materials Consumption &lt;1%; 2. Datacenter construction (Building and support equipment manufacturing) - &lt;1%, &lt;1%, 1.5%; 3. Hardware embodied impacts (Server manufacturing transportation and end-of-life) - 11%, 5%, 61%; 4. Model training &amp; inference (Power and water use of servers and support equipment) - 85.5%, 91%, 29%; 5. Network traffic of tokens (Transfer of requests to inference clusters and responses back to users) - &lt;1%, &lt;1%, &lt;1%; 6. End-user equipment (Embodied impacts and power consumption) - 3%, 2%, 7%; 7. Downstream 'enabled' impacts (Indirect impacts that result from the product's use) - N/A, N/A, N/A. Stages are grouped into Infrastructure, Computing, and Usage phases." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/mistral-environment.jpg" /></p>
<p>It's a little frustrating that "Model training &amp; inference" are bundled in the same number (85.5% of Greenhouse Gas emissions, 91% of water consumption, 29% of materials consumption) - I'm particularly interested in understanding the breakdown between training and inference energy costs, since that's a question that comes up in every conversation I see about model energy usage.</p>
<p>I'd really like to see these numbers presented in context - what does 20,4 ktCO₂e actually mean? I'm not environmentally sophisticated enough to attempt an estimate myself - I tried <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/687fffa1-6034-8006-bf95-b0f7213dde70">running it through o3</a> (at an unknown cost in terms of CO₂ for that query) which estimated ~100 London to New York flights with 350 passengers or around 5,100 US households for a year but I have little confidence in the credibility of those numbers.

## Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is now stable and generally available

<p><strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-25-flash-lite-is-now-stable-and-generally-available/">Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is now stable and generally available</a></strong></p>
The last remaining member of the Gemini 2.5 trio joins Pro and Flash in General Availability today.</p>
<p>Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite is the cheapest of the 2.5 family, at $0.10/million input tokens and $0.40/million output tokens. This puts it equal to GPT-4.1 Nano on my <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/">llm-prices.com</a> comparison table.</p>
<p>The preview version of that model had the same pricing for text tokens, but is now cheaper for audio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have also reduced audio input pricing by 40% from the preview launch.</p>

John Gruber (2024, Mastodon): This made me think there has to be a better way to toggle captions than manually swiping and clicking on the Apple TV remote touchpad.Turns out there are two better ways:If you use the Control Center Apple TV remote control on your iPhone, there&#8217;s a dedicated &#8220;CC&#8221; button.In tvOS, go to [&#8230;]

## Bartz v. Anthropic: Judge Alsup Certifies Class for Rightsholders of 7 Million Books Used by Anthropic

date: 2025-07-22, from: Authors Union blogs

Late last week Judge Alsup, presiding over the Bartz v. Anthropic copyright AI litigation, granted a motion to certify a class representing authors and rightsholders of nearly 7 million books. If you are a book author (or a publisher, or an heir to an author), you should be paying attention because there is a good chance that you could be included in this class.

<p>I took an example <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/textual/blob/03b94706399f110ff93fa396d4afbc79c3738638/tests/snapshot_tests/test_snapshots.py#L4378-L4400">from one of his tests</a>, spliced in my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#async-models">async LLM Python library</a> and <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/687c3a6a-4e1c-8006-83a2-706b4bf04067">got some help from o3</a> to turn it into <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/916b16cd7dfd3c23315d0a4ed02172878feafa45/python/streaming_textual_markdown.py">a streaming script</a> for talking to models, which can be run like this:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/tidwall/pogocache">tidwall/pogocache</a></strong></p>
New project from Josh Baker, author of the excellent <code>tg</code> C geospatial libarry (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Sep/23/tg-polygon-indexing/">covered previously</a>) and various other <a href="https://github.com/tidwall">interesting projects</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pogocache is fast caching software built from scratch with a focus on low latency and cpu efficency.</p>
<p>Faster: Pogocache is faster than Memcache, Valkey, Redis, Dragonfly, and Garnet. It has the lowest latency per request, providing the quickest response times. It's optimized to scale from one to many cores, giving you the best single-threaded and multithreaded performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faster than Memcache and Redis is a big claim! The README includes a <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/pogocache/blob/main/README.md#design-details">design details</a> section that explains how the system achieves that performance, using a sharded hashmap inspired by Josh's <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/shardmap">shardmap</a> project and clever application of threads.</p>
<p>Performance aside, the most interesting thing about Pogocache is the server interface it provides: it emulates the APIs for Redis and Memcached, provides a simple HTTP API <em>and</em> lets you talk to it over the PostgreSQL wire protocol as well!</p>

## Advanced version of Gemini with Deep Think officially achieves gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad

date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/">Advanced version of Gemini with Deep Think officially achieves gold-medal standard at the International Mathematical Olympiad</a></strong></p>
OpenAI beat them to the punch in terms of publicity by <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/19/openai-gold-medal-math-olympiad/">publishing their results on Saturday</a>, but a team from Google Gemini achieved an equally impressive result on this year's International Mathematics Olympiad scoring a gold medal performance with their custom research model.</p>
<p>(I saw an unconfirmed rumor that the Gemini team had to wait until Monday for approval from Google PR - this turns out to be inaccurate, see update below.)</p>
<p>It's interesting that Gemini achieved the <em>exact same score</em> as OpenAI, 35/42, and were able to solve the same set of questions - 1 through 5, failing only to answer 6, which is designed to be the hardest question.</p>
<p>Each question is worth seven points, so 35/42 cents corresponds to full marks on five out of the six problems.</p>
<p>Only 6 of <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/year_individual_r.aspx?year=2025">the 630 human contestants</a> this year scored all 7 points for question 6 this year, and just 55 more had greater than 0 points for that question.</p>
<p>OpenAI claimed their model had not been optimized for IMO questions. Gemini's model was different - emphasis mine:</p>

<p>We achieved this year’s result using an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think – an enhanced reasoning mode for complex problems that incorporates some of our latest research techniques, including parallel thinking. This setup enables the model to simultaneously explore and combine multiple possible solutions before giving a final answer, rather than pursuing a single, linear chain of thought.</p>
<p>To make the most of the reasoning capabilities of Deep Think, we additionally trained this version of Gemini on novel reinforcement learning techniques that can leverage more multi-step reasoning, problem-solving and theorem-proving data. <strong>We also provided Gemini with access to a curated corpus of high-quality solutions to mathematics problems, and added some general hints and tips on how to approach IMO problems to its instructions</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gemini team, like the OpenAI team, achieved this result with <a href="https://x.com/fredzhang0/status/1947364744412758305">no tool use or internet access</a> for the model.</p>
<p>Gemini's solutions are listed <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/IMO_2025.pdf">in this PDF</a>. If you are mathematically inclined you can compare them with OpenAI's solutions <a href="https://github.com/aw31/openai-imo-2025-proofs/">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Last year Google DeepMind <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/">achieved a silver medal in IMO</a>, solving four of the six problems using custom models called AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical language for our systems to understand. In the official competition, students submit answers in two sessions of 4.5 hours each. Our systems solved one problem within minutes and took up to three days to solve the others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year's result, scoring gold with a single model, within the allotted time and with no manual step to translate the problems first, is much more impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Concerning the timing of the news, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis <a href="https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1947337618787615175">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Btw as an aside, we didn’t announce on Friday because we respected the IMO Board's original request that all AI labs share their results only after the official results had been verified by independent experts &amp; the students had rightly received the acclamation they deserved</p>
<p>We've now been given permission to share our results and are pleased to have been part of the inaugural cohort to have our model results officially graded and certified by IMO coordinators and experts, receiving the first official gold-level performance grading for an AI system!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenAI's <a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1947398538662437306">Noam Brown</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before we shared our results, we spoke with an IMO board member, who asked us to wait until after the award ceremony to make it public, a request we happily honored.</p>
<p>We announced at ~1am PT (6pm AEST), after the award ceremony concluded. At no point did anyone request that we announce later than that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as I can tell the Gemini team was participating in an official capacity, while OpenAI were not. <a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1947398532899738064">Noam again</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>~2 months ago, the IMO emailed us about participating in a formal (Lean) version of the IMO. We’ve been focused on general reasoning in natural language without the constraints of Lean, so we declined. We were never approached about a natural language math option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither OpenAI nor Gemini used <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant)">Lean</a> in their attempts, which would have counted as tool use.

## Quoting Daniel Litt

Does it mean math is “solved”? Is an AI-generated proof of the Riemann hypothesis clearly on the horizon? Obviously not.</p>
<p>Worth keeping timescales in mind here: IMO competitors spend an average of 1.5 hrs on each problem. High-quality math research, by contrast, takes month or years.</p>
<p>What are the obstructions to AI performing high-quality autonomous math research? I don’t claim to know for sure, but I think they include many of the same obstructions that prevent it from doing many jobs: Long context, long-term planning, consistency, unclear rewards, lack of training data, etc.</p>
<p>It’s possible that some or all of these will be solved soon (or have been solved) but I think it’s worth being cautious about over-indexing on recent (amazing) progress.</p></blockquote>

## How I write docs quickly

date: 2025-07-21, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>I’ve been writing documentation and technical articles for more than a decade now. One piece of feedback I consistently got from managers and peers during all these years is how <em>fast</em> I am when producing and releasing docs. For example, I was once asked to document a new feature from a team I wasn’t serving two weeks ahead of launch. Everything was new to me, but I had most of the docs drafted after four days. By launch, the docs had been deemed ready to go live.</p>

## Coding with LLMs in the summer of 2025 (an update)

date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://antirez.com/news/154">Coding with LLMs in the summer of 2025 (an update)</a></strong></p>
Salvatore Sanfilippo describes his current AI-assisted development workflow. He's all-in on LLMs for code review, exploratory prototyping, pair-design and writing "part of the code under your clear specifications", but warns against leaning too hard on pure vibe coding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But while LLMs can write part of a code base with success (under your strict supervision, see later), and produce a very sensible speedup in development (or, the ability to develop more/better in the same time used in the past — which is what I do), when left alone with nontrivial goals they tend to produce fragile code bases that are larger than needed, complex, full of local minima choices, suboptimal in many ways. Moreover they just fail completely when the task at hand is more complex than a given level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of useful tips in there, especially around carefully managing your context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When your goal is to reason with an LLM about implementing or fixing some code, you need to provide extensive information to the LLM: papers, big parts of the target code base (all the code base if possible, unless this is going to make the context window so large than the LLM performances will be impaired). And a brain dump of all your understanding of what should be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Salvatore warns against relying too hard on tools which hide the context for you, like editors with integrated coding agents. He prefers pasting exactly what's needed into the LLM web interface - I share his preference there.</p>
<p>His conclusions here match <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">my experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will be able to do things that are otherwise at the borders of your knowledge / expertise while learning much in the process (yes, you can learn from LLMs, as you can learn from books or colleagues: it is one of the forms of education possible, a new one). Yet, everything produced will follow your idea of code and product, and will be of high quality and will not random fail because of errors and shortcomings introduced by the LLM. You will also retain a strong understanding of all the code written and its design.</p>

BlogIt is a command I've written many times over the years. At it's core
is did a two simple things. 

1. Copy CommonMark files into a blog directory three
2. Use Front Matter as a source for aggregated blog metadata

In it the new incarnation it is primarily focus on curating the front matter
followed by copying the document into the blog directory structure. 

1. Curate CommonMark file front matter
2. Copy CommonMark files into the blog directory tree

Other tools can aggregate blog metadata like [FlatLake](https://flatlake.app).
