Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE THIS EVENING
AND TONIGHT ACROSS PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST KANSAS...MUCH OF
OKLAHOMA...AND NORTH TEXAS....

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms should increase this evening and merge into a squall
line tonight across portions of the southern Plains. Severe gusts,
large hail, and a few tornadoes are possible.

...KS/OK/TX...
A large and progressive upper low is tracking eastward this morning
across the Great Basin.  As this system and an associated 90-100
knot mid-level jet emerge into the Rockies and high Plains this
afternoon, rapid surface cyclogenesis will occur over eastern CO. 
Southerly low-level winds throughout the southern Plains will
transport Gulf moisture northward with 50s dewpoints into southeast
KS and lower 60s into central OK.  It appears likely that the region
will remain capped to convective initiation through the afternoon
and much of the evening.  However, rapid and intense thunderstorm
development is expected after 03z in south-central KS and northwest
OK as the Pacific cold front impinges on the dryline, and large
scale lift overspreads the area.  

Initial storms will form in an environment of steep mid-level lapse
rates and favorable low-level shear for a few supercells capable of
large hail and damaging wind gusts.  These storms are expected to
quickly coalesce into a squall line along the front as it races
eastward across southern KS and much of OK.  Storms will also build
southward into north/central TX through the overnight period.  Very
strong low-level wind fields (850mb winds of 50-70 knots) and
mid-level lapse rates of 7+ C/km will maintain a risk of damaging
wind gusts and hail through the early morning hours.  A few QLCS
tornadoes, or perhaps embedded supercellular tornadoes, are also
possible late tonight as activity progresses across southern OK and
north TX.  The primary forecast uncertainties limiting confidence
for an upgrade at this time involve the limited low-level moisture
(upper 50s to low 60s dewpoints) and weak CAPE due to late timing of
event.  These parameters will be re-evaluated in later outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CST Mon Mar 03 2025

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO
INTO SOUTH-CENTRAL TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the Mississippi Valley, supporting
the eastward progression of a strong surface low from the central
Plains to the Ohio Valley tomorrow (Tuesday). A dryline will sweep
eastward across the southern Plains, promoting wildfire-spread
potential. Ahead of the surface low, increasing southerly flow will
advect an initially dry airmass over the central Appalachians,
supporting some potential for wildfire-spread in this region as
well.

...Southeast New Mexico into southern Texas...
As the dryline advances eastward across central Texas tomorrow
afternoon, the combination of strong isallobaric and downslope flow
will support up to 30 mph sustained westerly surface winds across
much of the southern High Plains into central Texas. RH should dip
to 15-25 percent across the Texas Panhandle into northern Texas,
with RH dropping to 10 percent in parts of southern Texas. Given
drying fuels across the region, widespread Elevated/Critical
highlights have been introduced. A squall line is expected to
develop across portions of Oklahoma into northern Texas late Monday
night into Tuesday morning, potentially dampening fuels. As such,
fire weather highlights in these areas may need to be removed if
appreciable rainfall accumulations are realized.

...Portions of the central Appalachians...
By afternoon peak heating, RH may dip to 30-35 percent across
portions of northeast Tennessee into southern West Virginia, as an
initially dry airmass is shunted northward with the approach of a
surface cyclone and accompanying upper trough. Guidance consensus
suggests that boundary-layer flow will increase during the
afternoon, with 15 mph sustained southerly surface winds potentially
coinciding with the lower RH for a few hours. Given that such
conditions will overspread dry fuels, Elevated highlights are
warranted.

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms appear unlikely through tonight.

...Synopsis...

A dearth of boundary-layer moisture and strong surface high pressure
east of the Rockies will preclude thunderstorm potential for the
remainder of this evening/overnight.
