factors for inflammatory bowel disease: an umbrella review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represents a cluster of
chronic idiopathic inflammatory disorders situated at the nexus of
intricate interplays. The primary aim of the present investigation is to
perform an umbrella review of metaanalyses, systematically offering a
comprehensive overview of the evidence concerning risk factors for
IBD.MethodsTo achieve this, we searched reputable databases, including
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews, from inception through April 2023. Two authors independently
assessed the methodological quality of each metaanalysis using the
AMSTAR tool and adhered to evidence classification criteria.ResultsIn
total, we extracted 191 unique risk factors in meta-analyses, including
92 significantly associated risk factors. The top ten risk factors were
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, IBD family history, periodontal
disease, poliomyelitis, campylobacter species infection, hidradenitis
suppurativa, psoriasis, use of proton pump inhibitors, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and western dietary pattern.DiscussionIn
conclusion, this umbrella review extracted 62 risk factors and 30
protective factors, most of which were related to underlying diseases,
personal lifestyle and environmental factors. The findings in this paper
help to develop better prevention and treatment measures to reduce the
incidence of IBD, delay its progression, and reduce the burden of
IBD-related disease worldwide.Systematic review

between the tumor microbiota and breast cancer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide.
Changes in the microbiota and their metabolites affect the occurrence
and development of breast cancer; however, the specific mechanisms are
not clear. Gut microbes and their metabolites influence the development
of breast cancer by regulating the tumor immune response, estrogen
metabolism, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy effects. It was previously
thought that there were no microorganisms in breast tissue, but it is
now thought that there are microorganisms in breast cancer that can
affect the outcome of the disease. This review builds on existing
research to comprehensively analyze the role of gut and intratumoral
microbiota and their metabolites in the development and metastasis of
breast cancer. We also explore the potential function of the microbiota
as biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic response, highlighting the
need for further research to clarify the causal relationship between the
microbiota and breast cancer. We hope to provide new ideas and
directions for the development of new methods for breast cancer
treatment.</p>

of the transmission-blocking potential of Plasmodium vivax antigen Pvg37
using transgenic rodent parasites and clinical isolates</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPlasmodium vivax is a major cause of malaria, particularly
outside Africa, necessitating effective strategies for public health
management. Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) have shown the
potential to inhibit malaria transmission by targeting antigens
expressed in sexual-stage parasites. Pbg37, a conserved protein
expressed in sexual stages from gametocyte to ookinete in the rodent
parasite P. berghei, is a viable target for TBV development.Methods and
findingsIn this study, we constructed a transgenic strain, TrPvg37Pb,
expressing Pvg37 using the P. berghei ΔPbg37 strain. Initial findings
demonstrated that the replacement of Pbg37 with the exogenous Pvg37 did
not impact parasite growth or development. Notably, Pvg37 was expressed
during the gametocyte to ookinete development and was associated with
the plasmic membrane, similar to Pbg37. To evaluate the potential of
Pvg37 as a TBV candidate, we synthesized two Pvg37 polypeptides and
immunized rabbits to generate antibodies. In vitro experiments
demonstrated that anti-Pvg37-P2 antibodies significantly inhibited the
formation of male gametes and ookinetes in the transgenic TrPvg37Pb
parasite. Additionally, in mosquito feeding assays, mosquitos feeding on
TrPvg37Pb-infected mice passively transferred with anti-Pvg37-P2
antibodies showed a significant 80.2% decrease in oocyst density
compared to the control group. Furthermore, in direct membrane feeding
experiments using four clinical P. vivax isolates, the anti-Pvg37
antibodies significantly reduced oocyst density by
28.6–50.4%.ConclusionPvg37 is a promising candidate for P. vivax TBV
development, deserving further research and optimization to enhance its
immunogenicity and transmission-blocking activity.</p>

zinc oxide nanoparticles: a novel approach to combat multidrug-resistant
Enterococcus faecalis biofilms in feline urinary tract infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionEnterococcus faecalis, a common inhabitant of the feline
gastrointestinal tract, has emerged as a significant pathogen causing
urinary tract infections (UTIs) in domestic cats. The rise of
multidrug-resistant E. faecalis strains and their propensity to form
biofilms pose significant challenges in treatment. This study
investigated the antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of hexagonal
zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) alone and in combination with
streptomycin and Moringa oleifera leaf extract (MOLe) against
multidrug-resistant E. faecalis isolates from feline
UTIs.MethodsAntimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the
Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Biofilm formation was assessed using
the crystal violet assay, and biofilm-associated genes (sprE, gelE,
fsrABC) were detected by PCR. ZnONPs, Str/ZnONPs (streptomycin-loaded
ZnONPs), and Str/MOLe@ZnONPs (streptomycin and MOLe-loaded ZnONPs) were
characterized using FTIR, DLS, TEM, and SEM. The antibacterial and
antibiofilm activities of the synthesized nanoparticles were evaluated
through time-kill assays, well diffusion assays, and gene expression
analysis.ResultsA high prevalence of multidrug resistance was observed
among the E. faecalis isolates, with significant resistance to
ampicillin, vancomycin, and streptomycin. Characterization studies
revealed the successful encapsulation of streptomycin and MOLe within
the ZnONPs.In vitro assays demonstrated that Str/MOLe@ZnONPs exhibited
potent antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against the tested E.
faecalis strains, significantly reducing bacterial growth and biofilm
formation.DiscussionThe emergence of multidrug-resistant E. faecalis
strains necessitates the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
This study demonstrates the promising potential of ZnONPs, particularly
those loaded with streptomycin and MOLe, in combating biofilm-forming E.
faecalis. The synergistic effects of the combined formulation may offer
a novel approach to overcome antibiotic resistance and improve the
treatment outcomes of E. faecalis UTIs in domestic cats.</p>

safety and toxicity analysis of 2,2’-Bipyridine derivatives in combating
MRSA biofilm formation and persistence</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
infections have become arduous to treat due to their capacity to form
biofilms, develop persistence, and exhibit significant antimicrobial
resistance. These factors contribute to the complexity of managing MRSA
infections and highlight the urgent need for innovative treatment
strategies.ObjectivesThis endeavor aims to evaluate the safety of
2,2’-Bipyridine (2,2’-Bipy) derivatives and their antimicrobial,
anti-biofilm, and anti-persister activities in treating MRSA
Infections.MethodsSix derivatives were screened for their ADMET
properties and tested for minimum inhibitory concentrations against
various bacterial strains using agar well diffusion and broth dilution.
Safety studies were conducted through hemolysis tests, cell viability
assays, and in vivo acute oral toxicity examinations. Bactericidal
mechanisms and biofilm disruption effects were analyzed using crystal
violet staining and confocal microscopy assays. The murine thigh
infection model was also used to investigate the in vivo
efficacy.ResultsAll derivatives exhibited favorable physicochemical
profiles and ADMET properties and are predicted to be safe based on
their drug-like properties. in vitro studies demonstrated that
derivatives are non-toxic to 3T3 L1, and in vivo studies confirmed their
safety in mice at a dose of 300 mg/kg and their non-hemolytic nature
against rabbit red blood cells. All compounds showed potent
antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria, including the
resistant MRSA strain 831. They inhibited biofilm formation and
eradicated biofilms in a dose-dependent manner against MTCC 737 and MRSA
831, and they effectively eliminated MRSA persister cells, outperforming
the reference antibiotic vancomycin. These derivatives were found to
depolarize the mitochondrial membrane and accumulate intracellular
reactive oxygen species. These derivatives significantly reduced the
bacterial load in the murine thigh infection model.ConclusionThe study
concluded that 2,2’-Bipy derivatives possess significant antimicrobial
activity, are non-toxic, and are effective in inhibiting biofilm
formation and killing persister cells.</p>

DNA methylation profiling in septic and non-septic patients with similar
infections: potential use as sepsis biomarkers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionSepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a
dysregulated immune response to infection, leading to organ failure.
Despite its significant global burden, the underlying mechanisms of
immune dysfunction in sepsis remain incompletely understood. This study
explores the role of DNA methylation in white blood cells in sepsis
pathogenesis.MethodsA prospective case-control study was conducted to
compare DNA methylation profiles between patients with
community-acquired sepsis and matched controls who had similar
infections but did not develop sepsis. Whole blood samples from these
patients were analyzed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 kit,
enabling genome-wide methylation analysis. Selected genes with
differential methylation were validated by
pyrosequencing.ResultsSignificant differential DNA methylation patterns
were identified between septic and non-septic individuals uising. Our
results suggest that DNA methylation changes are closely linked to the
pathophysiological processes of sepsis, influencing immune cell
activation, inflammation, and organ dysfunction. The most prominent
findings include the hypomethylation of immune-related genes (SERPINA1,
AZU1, MPO, and SLX4), which were strongly correlated with clinical
severity and inflammatory markers such as SOFA scores and PCT levels.
Correlation analyses demonstrated significant associations between the
methylation levels of these genes and clinical severity markers, such as
SOFA score and PCT levels. Notably, SLX4 hypomethylation showed the
highest predictive value for poor prognosis (AUC 0.821), while SERPINA1
hypomethylation exhibited strong diagnostic potential for sepsis (AUC
0.858).DiscussionOur results underscore the potential of DNA methylation
changes, particularly in immune-related genes, to enhance the early
detection of sepsis and to stratify patients based on severity. Future
research should explore the therapeutic implications of these epigenetic
alterations in sepsis care.</p>

in the development of antivirals against SARS-Coronavirus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused an
outbreak in 2002-2003, spreading to 29 countries with a mortality rate
of about 10%. Strict quarantine and infection control methods quickly
stopped the spread of the disease. Later research showed that SARS-CoV
came from animals (zoonosis) and stressed the possibility of a similar
spread from host to human, which was clearly shown by the COVID-19
outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic, instigated by SARS-CoV-2, has affected
776 million confirmed cases and more than seven million deaths globally
as of Sept 15, 2024. The existence of animal reservoirs of coronaviruses
continues to pose a risk of re-emergence with improved fitness and
virulence. Given the high death rate (up to 70 percent) and the high
rate of severe sickness (up to 68.7 percent in long-COVID patients), it
is even more critical to identify new therapies as soon as possible.
This study combines research on antivirals that target SARS
coronaviruses that have been conducted over the course of more than
twenty years. It is a beneficial resource that might be useful in
directing future studies.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe capability of mNGS in diagnosing suspected LRTIs and
characterizing the respiratory microbiome in lung cancer patients
requires further evaluation.MethodsThis study evaluated mNGS diagnostic
performance and utilized background microbial sequences to characterize
LRT microbiome in these patients. GSVA was used to analyze the potential
functions of identified genera.ResultsBacteria were the most common
pathogens (n=74) in LRTIs of lung cancer patients, and polymicrobial
infections predominated compared to monomicrobial infections
(p&lt;0.001). In diagnosing LRTIs in lung cancer patients, the pathogen
detection rate of mNGS (83.3%, 70/84) was significantly higher than that
of sputum culture (34.5%, 29/84) (p&lt;0.001). This result was
consistent with that of non-lung cancer patients (p&lt;0.001).
Furthermore, in the specific detection of bacteria (95.7% vs. 22.6%) and
fungi (96.0% vs. 22.2%), the detection rate of mNGS was also
significantly higher than that of CMTs mainly based on culture
(p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001). However, in the detection of CMV/EBV viruses,
there was no significant difference between the detection rate of mNGS
and that of viral DNA quantification (p = 1.000 and 0.152). mNGS
analysis revealed Prevotella, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Rothia, and
Capnocytophaga as the most prevalent genera in the LRT of lung cancer
patients. GSVA revealed significant correlations between these genera
and tumor metabolic pathways as well as various signaling pathways
including PI3K, Hippo, and p53.ConclusionmNGS showed a higher pathogen
detection rate than culture-based CMTs in lung cancer patients with
LRTIs, and also characterizing LRT microbiome composition and revealing
potential microbial functions linked to lung carcinogenesis.</p>

of the oral pathogen Filifactor alocis and its FtxA toxin related to
clinical parameters and presence of Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The Gram-positive organism Filifactor alocis is implicated in
multiple oral diseases including periodontitis, and approximately 50% of
known strains encode and produce a recently identified repeat-in-toxin
(RTX) protein, FtxA, partly homologous to the Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans leukotoxin. By assessing a longitudinal Ghanaian
study population of adolescents, we recently identified a possible
correlation between F. alocis levels, ftxA gene carriage, and
progression of clinical attachment loss (CAL). To extend knowledge on
the possible significance of F. alocis and its FtxA in periodontal
disease, we have in the present work analyzed saliva samples in an
independent cohort of periodontitis (n=156), collected at two private
periodontal specialist practices in Perth, Western Australia. The
present results corroborate that high loads of F. alocis and the
presence of its ftxA gene together are associated with parameters of
periodontal tissue destruction and severity. Moreover, among the
individuals carrying A. actinomycetemcomitans, a majority also exhibited
an ftxA-positive F. alocis, supporting the notion of the synergistic
behavior of these two species. This emphasizes that F. alocis and its
ftxA are involved in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and may have
ecological roles, with diagnostic and prognostic implications for the
disease.</p>

transplant-free mortality in hepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic
liver failure</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHepatitis B virus-related acute-on-chronic liver failure
(HBV-ACLF) is linked to dyslipidemia and inflammatory responses. This
study aimed to investigate the correlation between high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and 90-day transplant-free (TF)
mortality in patients with HBV-ACLF.MethodsA prospective cohort of 287
patients with HBV-ACLF from Beijing Ditan Hospital was enrolled between
January 2016 and December 2019. The prognostic accuracy of lipid profile
parameters was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC), and the association between HDL-C levels and
mortality was assessed using a restricted cubic spline analysis.
Correlations between lipid profile parameters and inflammatory factors
were analyzed. Kaplan–Meier curves were used to assess 90-day TF
mortality, and log-rank tests were used for comparison analysis. These
results were internally validated between January 2020 and December 2023
(n=125).ResultsPatients with lower HDL-C levels exhibited higher
mortality rates (adjusted hazard ratio for HDL-C &lt; 0.13 mmol/L: 4.04,
95% confidence interval: 1.35–11.85) compared with those in the
reference group (with HDL-C levels above 0.36 mmol/L). An “L-shaped”
association was observed between HDL-C levels and TF mortality. The
prognostic value of HDL-C (AUC at day 90: 0.732) was comparable to the
model for end-stage liver disease score of 0.729. Additionally, HDL-C
levels were inversely correlated with interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and
tumor necrosis factor-α (all P&lt;0.05). In the training cohort, the
90-day TF mortality rates were 8.3%, 15.2%, 24.0%, and 43.2% for the
extremely low, low, medium, and high-risk subgroups, respectively, while
in the validation cohort, they were 4.5%, 18.5%, 31.2%, and 44.7%,
respectively.ConclusionsHDL-C levels &lt; 0.13 mmol/L were associated
with increased 90-day transplant-free mortality in patients with
HBV-ACLF. An inverse correlation was found between HDL-C levels and
inflammatory markers.</p>

and rapid detection of feline chaphamaparvovirus using multienzyme
isothermal rapid amplification and lateral flow dipstick assay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-22, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Feline chaphamaparvovirus (FeChPV) is a novel parvovirus previously
reported in Canadian cats and Chinese dogs with diarrhea in 2019 and
2020, respectively. Herein, we aimed to establish a simple detection
method for FeChPV in field clinics. The primers and probes for the
multienzyme isothermal rapid amplification and lateral flow dipstick
(MIRA-LFD) assay were designed to target the conserved regions of the
FeChPV genome and determine the optimal reaction temperature and time.
Without relying on precision instruments, FeChPV detection using the
MIRA-LFD assay was completed within 20 min at 37°C, without any
cross-reaction with other reference viruses. The newly established
MIRA-LFD assay had a detection limit of 32.3 copies/μL, which was
10-fold lower than that of the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
assay. Furthermore, the MIRA-LFD assay detected 29 FeChPV-positive
samples among 417 cats with diarrhea, providing a slightly higher
positivity rate than the nested PCR assay. These results indicate that
the newly developed MIRA-LFD assay for FeChPV detection is an efficient,
economical, reliable, and simple method that can help in the early
prevention and control of FeChPV infection.</p>

analysis of a ST45-SCCmec IVa (2B)-t116 methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus strain isolated from the sputum of a 5-year-old

<p>IntroductionMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
sequence type (ST) 45 is a major global MRSA lineage with huge strain
diversity and a high clinical impact. In Hainan and Guangzhou of China,
the ST45-MRSA was mainly associated with t116.MethodsThe MRSA strain
SA2107 was isolated from the sputum of a 5-year-old child with
pneumonia. The whole genome of SA2107 was sequence using Illumina
(Novaseq 6000) and PacBio (Sequel IIe) sequencers, and the sequences
were assembled using hybrid assembly. The carriage of antibiotic
resistance genes, virulence genes, and mobile genetic elements were
identified using bioinformatics tools. The comparative genomic analyses
of MRSA strain SA2107 with other MRSA strains worldwide were
performed.FindingsThe genome size of ST45-SCCmec IVa (2B)-t116 MRSA
strain SA2107 was ~2.9 Mb. Mobile genetic elements analysis of SA2107
revealed two plasmids (30,064-bp pSA2107-1 and 8,033-bp pSA2107-2),
three prophages, two integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), and
two insertion sequences (ISs, IS431 and IS1272). The SCCmec IVa (2B)
carried by SA2107 contained the class B mec gene complex
(IS431-mecA-ΔmecR1-IS1272) and type 2 ccr gene complex (ccrA2 and
ccrB2). Besides mecA, another beta-lactam resistance gene blaZ was found
to located on six copies of bla complex (blaZ, blaR1, and blaI) on the
chromosome of SA2107. Three kinds of virulence factors were detected on
the chromosome of SA2107, including genes encoding toxins, exoenzyme,
and immune-modulating protein. Notably, the three prophages harbored by
the chromosome of SA2107 all carried virulence genes.ConclusionThus far,
only three complete genomes available for ST45-SCCmec IVa (2B)-t116
strain from United States, Germany, and Australia, respectively. The
strain SA2107 was the first complete genome data (CP104559) from China
for ST45-SCCmec IVa (2B)-t116 MRSA.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionLittle was known about the characteristics of low
respiratory tract (LRT) microbiota of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia
(RMPP) in children before and after the COVID-19
pandemic.MethodsForty-two children diagnosed with RMPP in 2019 (Y2019
group) and 33 children diagnosed with RMPP in 2023 (Y2023 group),
entered into the study. The characteristics of the clinical findings
were examined, and the LRT microbiota was analyzed by metagenomic next
generation sequencing.ResultsThe ratio of consolidate, atelectasis, lung
necrosis, and erythema multiforme in Y2023 group was significantly
higher than that in Y2019 (P&lt;0.05). Mycoplasmoides pneumoniae was the
top species of the LRT microbiota in both groups. The rate of macrolide
resistance MP in Y2023 was significantly higher than that in Y2019
(P&lt;0.05), and the mutant site was all 23S rRNA A2063G. There were no
significant differences in α-diversity and β-diversity of LRT microbiota
between Y2019 and Y2023 group. Trichoderma citrinoviride, Canine
mastadenovirus A, Ralstonia pickettii, Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa were the biomarkers of LRT microbiota in children with RMPP
of Y2023. The abundance of Mycoplasmoides pneumoniae positively
correlated with the levels of D-dimer and LDH, negatively correlated
with the counts of CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells and
CD16+CD56+ NK cells.DiscussionOur study showed that high abundance of MP
was correlated with the severity of RMPP and decrease of immune cells.
Trichoderma citrinoviride, Canine mastadenovirus A, Ralstonia pickettii,
Lactococcus lactis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the biomarkers in

as a promising alternative to SYTO9/PI for cell viability assessment in
bacterial biofilms</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAccurately assessing biofilm viability is essential for
evaluating both biofilm formation and the efficacy of antibacterial
treatments. Traditional SYTO9 and propidium iodide (PI) live/dead
staining in biofilm viability assays often ace challenges due to
non-specific staining, limiting precise differentiation between live and
dead cells. To address this limitation, we investigated an alternative
staining method employing calcein acetoxymethyl (CAM) to detect viable
cells based on esterase activity, and
1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene
p-toluenesulfonate (TMA-DPH) to assess the remaining biofilm
population.MethodsBiofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium were matured
and exposed to varying concentrations of antibiotics or sterile medium.
Biofilm viability was assessed using CAM/TMA-DPH or SYTO9/PIstaining,
followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and
ImageJ-based biofilm surface coverage quantification. Viability findings
were compared with colony-forming units (CFU/mL), a standard microbial
viability measure.ResultsCAM/TMA-DPH staining demonstrated strong
positive correlations with CFU counts across all bacterial species (r =
0.59 - 0.91), accurately reflecting biofilm vitality. In contrast,
SYTO9/PI staining consistently underestimated the viability of untreated
biofilms, particularly in Klebsiella pneumoniae, where a negative
correlation with CFU/mL was observed (r = –0.04). Positive correlations
for SYTO9/PI staining were noted in other species (r = 0.65 - 0.79).
These findings underscore the limitations of membrane integrity-based
staining methods and highlight the advantages of metabolic-based probes
like CAM/TMA-DPH.DiscussionOur findings suggest that CAM/TMA-DPH
staining provides a promising alternative to SYTO9/PI for cell viability
assessment in bacterial biofilms, highlighting the advantages of
metabolic-based probes over traditional membrane integrity assays. The
consistency of CAM/TMA-DPH staining across different bacterial species
underscores its potential to advance studies on biofilm and contribute
to the development of more effective anti-biofilm treatments, which is
essential for clinical management of biofilm-associated infections.</p>

id="characterization-of-the-vibrio-anguillarum-varyhb-regulon-and-role-in-pathogenesis">Characterization
of the Vibrio anguillarum VaRyhB regulon and role in pathogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe marine Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio anguillarum is
one of the major pathogens in aquaculture. Iron uptake is a prerequisite
for virulence and is strictly controlled by a global iron uptake
regulator, Fur, which acts as a repressor under iron-replete conditions.
When iron is depleted, Fur also functions as an activator, playing an
important role in pathogenesis. It is unclear whether this upregulation
model is mediated by a small RNA, RyhB. MethodsThe small RNA, VaryhB,
was deleted in V. anguillarum strain 775, and its regulon was
investigated using transcriptomic analysis. The roles of VaRyhB in
siderophore synthesis, chemotaxis and motility, and oxidative stress
were evaluated using chrome azurol S (CAS) liquid assay, swimming
motility assay, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay,
respectively. The virulence of VaRyhB was evaluated by challenging
turbot larvae intraperitoneally. ResultsThe small RNA called VaRyhB
identified in V. anguillarum strain 775 is significantly longer than
that in Escherichia coli. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that VaRyhB
is critical for iron homeostasis under limited iron conditions, and
deletion of VaRyhB resulted in lower expression levels of certain genes
for siderophore biosynthesis and transport, thereby leading to impaired
growth, reduced siderophore production, and decreased pathogenesis. The
virulence factor motility is also upregulated by VaRyhB, and reduced
motility capability was observed in the ΔVaryhB mutant, which may be
another reason resulting in weak pathogenesis. The sensitivity toward
H2O2 in the ΔVafur mutant could be restored by the loss of VaRyhB,
suggesting that the role of Fur in oxidative stress is mediated by
VaRyhB. VaRyhB also functions to inhibit the expression of genes
involved in Fe-S assembly and the TCA cycle. In addition, two aspects of
the type VI secretion system and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis were
first identified as being regulated by VaRyhB. ConclusionIn V.
anguillarum, the sRNA VaRyhB plays a critical role in the inhibition of
genes involved in the TCA cycle, Fe-S assembly, and the type VI
secretion system. It is also essential for the activation of siderophore
synthesis, chemotaxis and motility, and anaerobic denitrification. Our
work provides the first evidence of the VaRyhB regulon and its role in
the pathogenesis of V. anguillarum.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mitochondrial genomic stability is critical to prevent various human
inflammatory diseases. Bacterial infection significantly increases
oxidative stress, driving mitochondrial genomic instability and
initiating inflammatory human disease. Oxidative DNA base damage is
predominantly repaired by base excision repair (BER) in the nucleus
(nBER) as well as in the mitochondria (mtBER). In this review, we
summarize the molecular mechanisms of spontaneous and H. pylori
infection-associated oxidative mtDNA damage, mtDNA replication stress,
and its impact on innate immune signaling. Additionally, we discuss how
mutations located on mitochondria targeting sequence (MTS) of BER genes
may contribute to mtDNA genome instability and innate immune signaling
activation. Overall, the review summarizes evidence to understand the
dynamics of mitochondria genome and the impact of mtBER in innate immune
response during H. pylori-associated pathological outcomes.</p>

burgdorferi tolerates alteration to P66 porin function in a murine
infectivity model</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Borrelia burgdorferi exists in a complex enzootic life cycle
requiring differential gene regulation. P66, a porin and adhesin, is
upregulated and essential during mammalian infection, but is not
produced or required within the tick vector. We sought to determine
whether the porin function of P66 is essential for infection. Vancomycin
treatment of B. burgdorferi cultures was used to screen for P66 porin
function and found to generate spontaneous mutations in p66 (bb0603).
Three novel, spontaneous, missense P66 mutants (G175V, T176M, and G584R)
were re-created by site-directed mutagenesis in an infectious strain
background and tested for infectivity in mice by ID50 experiments. Two
of the three mutants retained infectivity comparable to the isogenic
control, suggesting that B. burgdorferi can tolerate alteration to P66
porin function during infection. The third mutant exhibited highly
attenuated infectivity and produced low levels of P66 protein.
Interestingly, four isolates that were recovered for p66 sequencing from
mouse tissues revealed novel secondary point mutations in genomic p66.
However, these secondary mutations did not rescue P66 porin function.
New structural modeling of P66 is presented and consistent with these
experimental results. This is the first work to assess the contribution
of P66 porin function to B. burgdorferi pathogenesis.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesTo evaluate the impact of rapid diagnostic testing (RDT)
combined with immediate infectious disease (ID) consultation on the
treatment of septic patients with positive blood cultures in intensive
care units in a setting without 24/7 service.MethodsAdult ICU patients
in a tertiary care hospital with positive blood cultures were included
from January 2019 to December 2020. The control group underwent routine
laboratory testing, and for the intervention group, RDT was applied with
immediate ID consultation.ResultsIn 77 out of the 91 patients in the
intervention group, the pathogen was identified by RDT. Regarding
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), genotypic testing (ePlex®)
was successful for Gram-positive cocci, but inadequate for Gram-negative
rods. Phenotypic resistance testing with the Accelerate PhenoTest® took
too long to be successfully integrated into the intervention. Adaptation
of empirical antibiotic therapy was recommended for 72.7% of the
patients. Adherence to the ID consultation post-RDT results was high at
82.3%. In the control group, adaptation of the initial antibiotic
therapy would have been recommended for 81.8% of patients, if the
species identification had been available. Overall adherence to the
local antibiotic therapy guideline for sepsis was significantly lower in
the control than in the intervention group (27.8% versus 89.3%,
p&lt;0.001).ConclusionIntegration of an RDT system in the
microbiological workflow for septic patients in ICU combined with a
standardized ID intervention led to a significantly higher percentage of
adequate antimicrobial treatment and greater adherence to local
antibiotic therapy recommendations, even in a setting where 24/7 service
is not available.</p>

MexB efflux pump genes: structural, molecular, and phylogenetic analysis
of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas
aeruginosa</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveEmerging drug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is of
great concern in clinical settings. P. aeruginosa activates its
efflux-pump system in order to evade the effect of antibiotics. The
current investigation aims to detect MexB genes in P. aeruginosa, their
structural and molecular analysis and their impact on antimicrobial
susceptibility profiling.MethodsA total of 42 clinical specimens were
aseptically collected from hospitalized patients who had underlying
infections related to medical implants. Matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) were used for the identification
of isolates. The methods used in this study were antibiotic
susceptibility profiling, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC),
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sanger sequencing, phylogenetic
analysis, MolProbity score, Ramachandran plot analysis and multiple
sequence alignment.ResultsThe highest resistance was shown by P.
aeruginosa against cefoperazone (67%), gentamycin and amikacin (66%)
each, followed by cefotaxime (64%). The prevalence of multi-drug
resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) was 57% and 12%,
respectively. The presence of an active efflux-pump system was indicated
by the MexB genes found in most of the resistant isolates (p&lt;0.05).
Following addition of efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide
m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in
MIC was observed in resistance, that revealed the presence of active
efflux pump system. Phylogenetic analysis revealed evolutionary
relationships with the P. aeruginosa strains isolated in Switzerland,
Denmark and Germany. Protein domain architecture revealed that MexB gene
proteins were involved in particular efflux pump function. Protein
sequences aligned by multiple sequence alignment revealed conserved
regions and sequence variants, which suggested antibiotic translocation
and evolutionary divergence. These highly conserved regions could be
used for diagnostic purposes of efflux pump MexB genes.ConclusionTo
avoid their spread in hospital settings, responsible authorities ought
to begin rigorous initiatives in order to reduce the prevalence of
multi-drug resistant, extensively drug resistant, and efflux pump
carrying isolates in clinical settings.</p>

Mycobacterium tuberculosis intra- or inter-hosts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) remains a serious global public health
problem. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is responsible for
approximately 10 million new TB cases globally each year. This study
aimed to investigate transmission pattern and drug resistance of MTB in
Shenzhen, China.MethodsA retrospective study on 286 samples from 184 TB
patients collected between 2015 and 2018 in Shenzhen Third People’s
Hospital was conducted using whole-genome sequencing. Drug
susceptibility testing (DST) was performed using both phenotypic DST
(pDST) and molecular DST (mDST). Sample diversity was evaluated by SNPs
and transmission clusters were identified based on SNP differences of 12
or fewer in genetic clusters.ResultsExcept four samples identified as
non-tuberculous mycobacteria, 282 MTB samples (181 patients) underwent
mDST, with 244 samples (162 patients) undergoing pDST. The overall
multidrug-resistant rate in patients was 22.31% in pDST (12.00% for new
patients and 40.82% for retreatment patients) and 34.48% in mDST (20.41%
for new patients and 58.21% for retreatment patients). Totally 92
transmission clusters were identified, encompassing 70.21% samples
(57.46% patients), with 5 clusters containing samples (15, 5.32%) from
different patients (9, 4.97%), indicating recent transmission. The
drug-resistant mutations in 36 of 45 transmission clusters (80.00%) were
identical in all samples, suggesting the transmission of drug
resistance. Patients with multiple samples were categorized into
simultaneous sampling (SS) and continuous sampling (CS) groups,
revealing significant differences in treatment types, treatment
outcomes, residential addresses, and drug resistance types. mDST showed
greater accuracy than pDST in SS and CS groups. A novel method based on
heterozygous SNPs and two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test were developed
and identified 12 (4.26%) samples as mixed infection samples. Six of 12
patients had mixed and pure samples together, and major strains of mixed
samples were closer to corresponding pure strains than minor
strains.ConclusionsThis retrospective study, conducted at the only
municipal hospital specializing in infectious diseases in Shenzhen,
provides the opportunity to understand drug resistance of TB patients,
which mainly are refractory patients. The study revealed transmission
patterns of MTB, analyzed mixed infections, and tracked changes in MTB
strains during short/long-term treatment.</p>

<p>BackgroundLateral flow assay (LFA) has demonstrated high sensitivity
and specificity for diagnosing cryptococcosis. However, its role in
predicting therapeutic efficacy for pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC)
remains underexplored.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of
HIV-negative patients with PC to describe the clinical profile and
identify potential predictors of radiological prognosis.ResultsAll the
168 participants received antifungal therapy with a triazole agent. Of
these, 84.5% experienced partial or complete absorption of pulmonary
lesions. The results of the gamma test, chi-square trend test, and
ordinal logistic regression all indicated that both baseline LFA and
changes in LFA after treatment were significant predictors of imaging
prognosis. The degree of radiological improvement was inversely
associated with the baseline LFA positive grade(P for linear-by-linear
association: 0.011, Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.17; γ= -0.368,
P = 0.045). Patients with a decrease in LFA after therapy had
significantly better radiological outcomes compared to those with equal
or increased LFA(linear-by-linear association, P = 0.014, Spearman
correlation coefficient = 0.188; γ = 0.371, P = 0.012). Additionally,
favorable outcomes were more likely in patients with lesions confined to
the right lung.ConclusionsLFA shows potential of monitoring radiological

<p>BackgroundPatients with vitamin D deficiency are susceptible to
increased microbial infection and increased risk of mortality. However,
whether vitamin D supplementation would improve their prognosis remains
uncertain.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using data
from MIMIC-IV database, a publicly available database containing
clinical information on patients admitted to the ICU at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) from 2008 to 2019. Adult patients with
sepsis were included in the analysis. The exposure factor was vitamin D
supplementation during the ICU stay. The primary outcome was 28-day
all-cause mortality. Both propensity score matching (PSM) and stepwise
regression analyses were employed to adjust for potential
confounders.ResultsA total of 20230 eligible patients were enrolled in
the entire unmatched cohort, and 8710 patients were included in the
matched cohort. In PSM analysis, the 28-day all-cause mortality rate was
14.04% (250/1780) in the vitamin D group and 22.31% (1546/6930) in the
no vitamin D group. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with
decreased 28-day all-cause mortality (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.49-0.64; p
&lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed consistent benefits regardless of
the baseline vitamin D status (deficiency: HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.33-1.50;
p = 0.36; insufficiency: HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.34; p &lt; 0.001;
sufficiency: HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.88; p = 0.03). Additionally,
vitamin D supplementation was associated with decreased ICU mortality
(OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.29-0.48; p &lt; 0.001) and reduced in-hospital
mortality (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.48-0.68; p &lt; 0.001). Sensitivity
analysis using the unmatched cohort confirmed these findings (HR, 0.57;
95% CI, 0.43-0.76; p &lt; 0.001).ConclusionsVitamin D supplementation
may reduce mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. However,
further high-quality prospective studies are still needed to validate
these findings.</p>

attenuating viral infectivity. Several viruses, such as human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), and equine
infectious anemia virus (EIAV), have evolved mechanisms to antagonize
the host protein SERINC5 through HIV Nef, MLV glycosylated Gag, and the
EIAV S2 protein. These viral proteins degrade SERINC5 on the cell
surface through the endolysosomal system. In addition to its direct
antiviral ability, SERINC5 also modulates immunity to inhibit the
replication of retroviruses and nonretroviruses. This review summarizes
the interaction between SERINC5 and viral replication, providing a
promising avenue for fighting viral diseases.</p>

mouse model of immunosuppression facilitates oral Candida albicans
biofilms, bacterial dysbiosis and dissemination of infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Opportunistic pathogens are a major threat to people, especially
those with impaired immune systems. Two of the most important microbes
in this category are the fungus Candida albicans and Gram-positive
bacteria of the genus Enterococcus, which share overlapping niches in
the oral cavity, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The clinical
importance of oral C. albicans biofilm and its interaction with the host
under immunosuppressive conditions remains largely understudied. Here,
we used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) with cortisone
acetate injection on alternate days and a continuous supply of C.
albicans in drinking water for three days, resulting in
immunosuppression. Results showed abundant growth of resident oral
bacteria and a strong C. albicans biofilm on the tongue consisting of
hyphae which damaged papillae, the epidermal layer, and invaded tongue
tissue with the accumulation of inflammatory cells as demonstrated by
Grocott’s methenamine silver and hematoxylin and eosin staining,
respectively. The dispersed microbes from the oral biofilm colonized the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract and damaged its integrity, disseminating
microbes to other organs. Although no visible damage was observed in the
kidney and liver, except increased lipid vacuoles in the liver cells, C.
albicans was found in the liver homogenate. Intriguingly, we found
co-occurrence of Enterococcus faecalis in the tongue, liver, and stool
of immunosuppressed control and C. albicans infected organs. Targeted
16S rRNA and ITS2 amplicon sequencing of microbes from the fecal samples
of mice confirmed the above results in the stool samples and revealed an
inverse correlation of beneficial microbes in the dysbiosis condition.
Our study shows that mucosal-oral infection of C. albicans under
immunosuppressed conditions causes tissue damage and invasion in local
and distant organs; the invasion may be aided by the overgrowth of the
resident endogenous Enterobacteriaceae and other members, including the
opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.</p>

of HIV on HPV-related cancers in men who have sex with men: a
review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) significantly
increases the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and
HPV-related cancers among men who have sex with men (MSM). Conversely,
HPV infection can also influence HIV acquisition rates. HIV-induced
immune suppression may affect chromosomal stability, gene expression,
protein function and other molecular components in MSM with HPV-related
cancers. Additionally, HIV infection also alters cellular mechanisms by
compromising immune responses and epithelial integrity. In this review,
we reviewed the influence of HIV on specific HPV-related cancers in MSM,
including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, penile cancer, and anal
cancer. We integrated epidemiological data from the past five years and
discussed diagnosis and treatment strategies. Overall, our review offers
crucial insights into the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms
of these co-infection MSM patients. Our review aims to assist future
research in developing effective treatment strategies for MSM with
HIV/HPV co-infection.</p>

genetic analysis of clinical Mycobacterium abscessus complex strains in
China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundTo explore the genetic characteristics of the Mycobacterium
abscessus complex (MABC) population in China, given its rising clinical
importance among nontuberculous mycobacteria.MethodsWe conducted
population genetic analyses on 360 MABC genomes from China, focusing on
core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), pan-genome
characterization, population genetics, and antimicrobial resistance gene
profiling.ResultsOur analysis identified 273 M. abscessus subsp.
abscessus (MabA) and 87 M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (MabM) isolates,
uncovering 68 sequence types (STs), with ST5 being the most common.
cgMLST classified 33.3% of isolates into six dominant circulating clones
(DCCs) and 49.4% into 59 genomic clusters at a threshold of 25 different
alleles, including 18 international clusters linking Chinese isolates
with seven other countries. The MABC pan-genome is open, with MabA
exhibiting greater accessory gene diversity and higher gene turnover
compared to MabM. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as prophages and
genomic islands, were prevalent across all genomes. 139 to 151 virulence
factors (VFs) were identified per genome, with distinct accessory VFs in
MabA and MabM affecting immune modulation and metabolism. Resistance
gene profiling revealed ubiquitous mtrA, RbpA, and blaMAB, with
MabA-specific erm(41) conferring resistance to macrolides and β-lactams.
Common rrs and rrl gene mutations indicated widespread resistance to
aminoglycosides and macrolides, while gyrA mutations suggested emerging
fluoroquinolone resistance. An acquired erm(46) gene, likely obtained
via phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer, was detected in one MabA
strain.ConclusionThis study provides key genetic insights into the
dynamics of MABC in China. The widespread distribution of DCCs, high
genomic clustering rates, open pan-genome, and distinct resistance
patterns between MabA and MabM, along with MGEs, highlight the need for
targeted surveillance and tailored therapies to address emerging
challenges in MABC infections.</p>

of serotype O3b and high-risk clone ST37 of Klebsiella pneumoniae
revealed by comparative genomic analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundEpidemiological risk factors such as the demography of a
place, environment, food, livestock, and companion animals are known
sources of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) has become a powerful tool to complement traditional
microbiological characterization of foodborne pathogens. Moreover, K.
pneumoniae has several species complexes (KpSC) and is very difficult to
differentiate using routine microbiological methods. The present study
aims to investigate the prevalence of K. pneumoniae in fish available in
the retail market using WGS.MethodsIsolation of K. pneumoniae,
identification of K. pneumoniae isolates, and determination of the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were performed. Whole-genome
sequencing of K. pneumoniae genomes and phylogenomic analysis were
conducted for visual comparison of the genomes. Furthermore, genomes of
non-human origin that were submitted from India to the NCBI database
were downloaded and included in the comparative analysis.ResultsThe
findings showed that many antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) are
prominent, including acrD, BaeR, cpxA, mdtB, mdtC, CRP, H-NS, KpnE,
KpnF, KpnG, KpnH, acrA, acrB, marA, ramB, oqxA, oqxB, LptD, and emrR.
Four fish-sourced isolates had different blaSHV resistance gene
variants. The presence of ARGs for aminoglycosides [aac(3)-IId],
fluoroquinolones (oqxA, oqxB), and fosfomycin (fosA5, fosA6) in these K.
pneumoniae isolates from fish sources was found. One of the CIFT-K6
isolates had the uncommon serotype of K. pneumoniae O3b with the
high-risk clone “ST37.” The ST515 sequence type was present in two K.
pneumoniae isolates (CIFT-K7 and CIFT-K8), but the O3b serotype and
ST192 allele type were present in the CIFT-K10 isolate.ConclusionTo the
best of our knowledge, this research study represents the first Indian
report of K. pneumoniae linked to fish, specifically the high-risk clone
‘ST37’ and two other STs, 515 and 192. The most common plasmid type
detected in all four isolates was IncFIB, and 75% of the isolates were
IncFII and IncHI1B. The prevalence of ARGs linked to efflux pump
resistance mechanisms is highlighted by the analysis of genome sequence
data.</p>

histone methyltransferase DOT1B is dispensable for stage differentiation
and macrophage infection of Leishmania mexicana</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Conserved histone methyltransferases of the DOT1 family are involved
in replication regulation, cell cycle progression, stage
differentiation, and gene regulation in trypanosomatids. However, the
specific functions of these enzymes depend on the host evasion
strategies of the parasites. In this study, we investigated the role of
DOT1B in Leishmania mexicana, focusing on life cycle progression and
infectivity. In contrast to Trypanosoma brucei, in which DOT1B is
essential for the differentiation of mammal-infective bloodstream forms
to insect procyclic forms, L. mexicana DOT1B (LmxDOT1B) is not critical
for the differentiation of promastigotes to amastigotes in vitro.
Additionally, there are no significant differences in the ability to
infect or differentiate in macrophages or sand fly vectors between the
LmxDOT1B-depleted and control strains. These findings highlight the
divergence of the function of DOT1B in these related parasites,
suggesting genus-specific adaptations in the use of histone
modifications for life cycle progression and host adaptation
processes.</p>
