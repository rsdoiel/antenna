Mesoscale Discussion 1420
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern/eastern Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455...

Valid 232036Z - 232230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455
continues.

SUMMARY...Another small, organized cluster of storms posing a risk
for damaging wind gusts may evolve east of La Crosse toward the
Oshkosh vicinity through 5-7 PM CDT, along outflow trailing the lead
cluster now spreading south through southeast of Green Bay.

DISCUSSION...One small, organized convective cluster, with an
embedded meso-beta scale cyclonic circulation, has already evolved
and produced a narrow corridor of severe and/or damaging gusts near
and east of the Wisconsin Rapids area.  This may continue near/south
and southeast of the Green Bay vicinity, before diminishing while
spreading into Lake Michigan within the next hour or so.

Meanwhile, thunderstorm activity now forming upstream may undergo a
similar evolution along the trailing outflow from the lead cluster, 
east of La Crosse toward the Oshkosh vicinity during the next couple
of hours. Inhibition has become increasingly negligible in the
presence of peak heating, with latest mesoanalysis indicating CAPE
on the order of 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of at least modest
shear beneath 40+ kt westerly 500 mb flow.

Mesoscale Discussion 1418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of northwestern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232008Z - 232245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered strong to severe storms, including a
supercell or two, may cross the St. Lawrence Valley and at least
approach parts of northwestern Maine prior to 8 PM EDT, accompanied
by the risk for large hail and potential for a tornado.  Although it
still appears unlikely that a severe weather watch will be needed,
trends will continue to be monitored for this possibility.

DISCUSSION...Near/just ahead of a mid-level perturbation associated
with a now dissipated thunderstorm cluster, isolated supercell
development appears underway across parts of southeastern Quebec,
roughly 100 miles or so to the northwest of Quebec City.  Activity
appears to be forming just to the south of a warm frontal zone,
where surface dew points are near 70 F, and low-level hodographs
have become sizable beneath 30 kt west-southwesterly flow around 850
mb.

This is occurring beneath 40-50 kt west-northwesterly 500 mb flow,
around the northeastern periphery of the prominent mid-level high
centered near the southern Appalachians, contributing to a
southeastward propagation toward the St. Lawrence Valley, near
Quebec City.  Additional thunderstorm development appears possible
over the next few hours in closer proximity to the frontal zone to
the north.  

East of the St. Lawrence Valley, into northern New England, warming
and moistening of the boundary layer is ongoing along and south of
the northward developing warm frontal zone.  Forecast soundings from
the Rapid Refresh suggest that this may include surface dew points
increasing to near or above 70 F, in the presence of enlarging,
clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, across parts of northwestern
Maine prior to 00Z.  Although the onset of nightfall contributes to
some uncertainty concerning the extent of boundary-layer
destabilization, there appears at least some potential for the
maintenance of supercells posing a risk for severe hail, and
potential for a tornado or two.

Mesoscale Discussion 1417
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...portions of central Kansas into far southeast
Nebraska and southwestern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231934Z - 232200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in severe potential may occur if more robust
thunderstorm development can take place along the cold front. Strong
to potentially severe wind gusts would be the main hazard.
Convective trends are being monitored for the need of a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A line of thunderstorms has developed across eastern NE
in a post-cold-frontal regime. Within the last hour, convection has
tried to deepen along the KS/NE border, closer to the cold front,
and where greater buoyancy resides. Deep-layer shear is modest at
best (e.g. 30 kts), and is lagging the cold front. While vertical
wind shear is limited, 7-8 C/km boundary-layer lapse rates atop 70+
F surface dewpoints is contributing to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE in a weakly
capped environment. While storms should be mainly pulse-cellular or
multicellular, any cold-pool mergers that occur with the more
intense storms may support strong to severe gusts. Convective trends
are being monitored for further increases in coverage or intensity
that would warrant a Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 455
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
115 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Iowa
  Central Upper Michigan
  Extreme southeast Minnesota
  Southwest, central and northeast Wisconsin
  Lake Michigan
  Lake Superior

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 115 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Clusters of storms, some with bowing characteristics, are
expected to increase in coverage and intensity through the afternoon
and persist into this evening.  Damaging winds of 60-70 mph will be
the main threat, though isolated large hail of 1-1.5 inches in
diameter may also occur with the strongest storms.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 70 miles northeast of
Escanaba MI to 55 miles south southwest of La Crosse WI. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Southern Great Basin/Four Corners region...
Stronger mid-level flow ahead of an upper-level trough will remain
over the greater Four Corners region. Efficient daytime boundary
later mixing will continue to promote a corridor of breezy southwest
winds amid afternoon relative humidity of 10-15 percent to promote
Elevated fire weather conditions from northern Arizona, southeastern
Arizona into southern Wyoming.

...Northern Nevada...
Some convection aided by higher terrain is expected across northern
Nevada Tuesday afternoon. Limited instability/moisture profiles
along with marginal fuel dryness (ERC values in the 80-85 percentile
range) should limit ignition efficiency of slow moving isolated
showers and thunderstorms across the area.

..Williams.. 06/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0111 AM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
Another day of elevated fire weather conditions is expected for
parts of the intermountain West on Tuesday. An upper trough
currently settling into the southern Great Basin/lower CO River
Valley is expected to stall and slowly de-amplify over the next 48
hours. This will maintain a belt of modest mid-level flow over parts
of the eastern Great Basin/western Four Corners region. Although
pressure gradient winds will generally be in the mid/upper teens,
diurnal heating and deep mixing of a dry air mass will promote
frequent gusts between 20-35 mph across the region - especially from
northern AZ into eastern UT and southern WY under a belt of somewhat
stronger 700-500 mb flow. Afternoon RH minimums in the low to mid
teens are expected, and coupled with dry fuels, will help support
another day of elevated fire weather conditions (though transient
periods of critical conditions are anticipated where stronger gusts
can occur).

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated thunderstorms appear possible Tuesday afternoon across
portions of northeastern Nevada under the upper-level low. Cold
temperatures aloft combined with modest mid-level moisture and
strong low-level heating will support thermodynamic profiles
adequate for weak convection, but perhaps limited precipitation.
Given dry fuels across the region, some dry-thunderstorm risk is
expected. The primary limiting factor to a more substantial
dry-thunderstorm concern is slow storm motions (less than 10 knots),
which should increase the probability of wetting rainfall under the
convective cores.

Valid 232000Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH LATE EVENING FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS TO THE UPPER GREAT
LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Storms with occasional damaging outflow gusts and marginally severe
hail will be possible today from the southern and central Plains
northeastward into the Great Lakes.

...20z Update...
Marginal hail and tornado probabilities were introduced across
western Maine with this update. CAM guidance suggests supercells
moving out of southern Quebec may track into western Maine. The
moist and unstable environment across this region would be
supportive of hail, wind, and perhaps a tornado as 850 mb flow
increases through the evening.

Otherwise, the forecast remains on track with no updates needed. See
previous discussion for more information.

..Thornton.. 06/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1122 AM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025/

...Upper Great Lakes to the Plains this afternoon/evening...
A surface cold front will make slow southeastward progress from WI
to IA and KS, in the wake of a primary shortwave trough moving over
western ON.  Surface heating is ongoing ahead of the front, where
boundary-layer dewpoints range from the upper 60s to lower 70s
beneath midlevel lapse rates of 7-8 C/km, which will drive MLCAPE of
2000-3000 J/kg.  Convective inhibition will likewise weaken by
early-mid afternoon, when thunderstorm development is likely along
the front and differential heating zone in the SLGT risk corridor. 
Deep-layer flow will be a little stronger toward WI in closer
proximity to the main belt of westerlies, where a mix clusters/line
segments and transient supercell structures will be possible.  The
primary severe threat will be damaging outflow winds (60-70 mph)
from roughly 20z-03z, though isolated large hail of 1-1.5 inches in
diameter may also occur with the strongest storms.

More loosely organized storm clusters are expected this afternoon
through this evening into the southern High Plains, where
thermodynamic profiles will favor isolated severe downbursts.
 
...Northern Maine later this evening...
Around the northern periphery of a closed midlevel high over the
Appalachians, a series of embedded speed maxima will move over ON/QC
through tonight.  Boundary-layer dewpoints in the 60s beneath
midlevel lapse rates near 7 C/km, in combination with daytime
heating, will boost MLCAPE to 1500-2000 J/kg with minimal convective
inhibition by late afternoon.  Thunderstorm development is expected
upstream across QC in association with an embedded speed max/surface
wave, and this convection will approach northern ME by late
evening/early tonight.  Though buoyancy will slowly weaken with the
loss of daytime heating, low-level hodograph curvature and
deep-layer westerly shear should be sufficient for an organized
storm cluster to reach ME before weakening overnight.  Isolated
damaging winds will be the main threat with these storms.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE
NORTHERN/CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS TO THE MIDWEST...GREAT LAKES AND THE
MID-ATLANTIC...SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST AND INTO FLORIDA...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to potentially severe storms are possible Wednesday in a
corridor from the northern High Plains into the Midwest and
Northeast, and also along and east of the Appalachians into the
Southeast and much of Florida

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging across the eastern CONUS will start to weaken on
Wednesday. A weak low will move west across the Florida Peninsula
during the period. A strong mid-level jet streak will extend along
the northeastern periphery of the ridge from northern Ontario to the
Northeast. The trough across the western CONUS will deamplify
through the period with a weak shortwave trough ejecting into the
Plains.

...Northern/Central High Plains and adjacent Plains...
A deepening surface low will develop across northeast
Colorado/northwest Kansas, and southwest Nebraska on Wednesday as a
mid-level trough ejects over the Plains. Moderate instability is
expected to develop south of the front which will extend east from
this surface low across Nebraska and into Iowa. Isolated to
scattered storms are expected along this front and near the
intersection with the dryline/surface low. While mid-level flow is
forecast to be somewhat weak, stronger upper-level flow may provide
sufficient upper-level venting/deep-layer shear for some supercell
organization. 

Stronger flow will be present farther north across northeast Wyoming
and southeast Montana. A few supercells are possible if low 60s
dewpoints can advect into the region with moderate instability. 

...Midwest to the Mid Atlantic...
Thunderstorms will likely be ongoing at the beginning of the period
from the central Plains to the Great Lakes. These thunderstorms and
their composite outflow will likely reinforce the boundary across
the area. South of this boundary, a very moist airmass with moderate
instability will be in place. Very weak shear will be the primary
limiting factor to severe weather, but numerous thunderstorms in a
moderately unstable and very moist environment should support some
threat for wet microbursts and damaging wind gusts. 

...Mid-Atlantic to the Southeast and Florida...
Steep mid-level lapse rates are expected across much of the eastern
CONUS on Wednesday as the upper-level ridge weakens. Strong heating
in a very moist environment should result in moderate to strong
instability from Virginia southward into Florida. The highest
confidence for storms will be along the sea breeze and the higher
terrain. However, additional thunderstorms are also possible during
the afternoon, particularly where any remnant outflow boundaries may
remain from Tuesday night thunderstorm activity. Strengthening
northeasterly flow across the region may provide enough shear for a
few strong to severe multicell clusters capable of mostly damaging
wind gusts.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are possible Tuesday from eastern Wyoming into
southwest South Dakota, the Nebraska Panhandle, and northeast
Colorado. Isolated strong to severe storms will also be possible
from parts of the central Plains and Midwest into the Northeast.

...Synopsis...
The large-scale pattern across the CONUS on Tuesday will feature a
strong ridge across the eastern CONUS and a deamplifying trough
across the western CONUS. In between these features, a mid-level
shortwave trough will traverse the central Rockies and be the
primary focus for severe weather concern Tuesday afternoon/evening.

At the surface, an elongated front will extend from the Northeast to
the central Plains. This front will move southeast into parts of New
England during the period, remain mostly stationary across the Great
Lakes/Midwest, and start to move north as a warm front across the
Plains as weak lee troughing occurs across eastern Colorado/Wyoming
in response to the passing mid-level shortwave trough. 

...Central High Plains...
Weak to moderate destabilization is expected across the central High
Plains on Tuesday afternoon/evening as temperatures warm into the
upper 70s to low 80s with dewpoints in the low 60s. Inhibition
should be mostly eroded by early afternoon with scattered to
widespread thunderstorm development expected. The extensive nature
of the convection, combined with only marginal shear (25 to 30
knots) may result in a somewhat messy storm mode. However, early in
the storm lifecycle, steep mid-level lapse rates and moderate
instability may support some 2+ inch hail. As storms congeal, one or
more forward-propagating clusters may develop with a threat for
severe wind gusts. 

...Iowa/northern Missouri into the Great Lakes...
Moderate destabilization and weak shear will be present along the
mostly stalled frontal zone during the afternoon and evening on
Tuesday. Very warm temperatures aloft (-4C at 500mb) will be the
primary limiting factor to a greater severe weather threat. However,
enhanced forcing/flow in the vicinity of one or more MCVs (likely
remaining from Day 1 convection) may provide focus for some strong
to locally severe storms. 

...Northeast...
Temperatures are expected to warm into the upper 80s to near 90 with
dewpoints in the low 70s across the Northeast on Tuesday
afternoon/evening. Steep low-level lapse rates and moderately steep
mid-level lapse rates should provide a thermodynamic environment
favorable for strong updrafts. Shear should be mostly weak with less
than 30 knots of tropospheric unidirectional flow. However, the
moderate to strong instability and forcing along the front may be
sufficient for a few stronger storms/clusters capable of damaging
wind gusts. 

...Carolinas vicinity...
Some guidance suggests the potential for stronger storms across the
Carolinas with relatively cooler mid level temperatures along the
eastern periphery of the mid-level ridge. Southwestward moving
storms within this pattern would be a climatologically rare
phenomenon. While a few stronger storms are possible, warm
temperatures around 750mb may limit storm coverage with convective
temperatures around 100F based on RAP forecast soundings. The
guidance with greater storm coverage has forecast dewpoints in the
mid 70s and not as strong of a warm nose below 700mb. If this
solution appears more likely, a marginal may eventually be needed,
but this scenario appears too unlikely for probabilities at this
time.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1142 AM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

Only minor changes to broad Elevated highlights across the greater
Four Corners region and southern Great Basin were needed. Previous
forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Williams.. 06/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather concerns will persist across the greater
southern Great Basin and Four Corners region today as breezy
conditions continue within a dry air mass. Low to mid-level flow
over the Intermountain West is expect to weaken over the next 24
hours as a leading shortwave impulse ejects northward into the
Canadian Prairies. A secondary, weaker shortwave will settle into
the lower CO Valley through today, which will maintain southwesterly
flow across the southern Great Basin and into the Four Corners
region. Diurnal heating of a very dry air mass (as sampled by
regional 00z RAOBs) will promote wind gusts between 20-35 mph by
late afternoon, though ensemble guidance continues to suggest that
sustained winds will most likely remain between 15-20 mph for most
locations. Regardless, increasing rainfall deficits and antecedent
dry fuels/ongoing fires will support another day of at least low-end
fire weather concerns as dry/breezy conditions become more prevalent
through the afternoon.

Valid 231630Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
THROUGH LATE EVENING FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS TO THE UPPER GREAT
LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Storms with occasional damaging outflow gusts and marginally severe
hail will be possible today from the southern and central Plains
northeastward into the Great Lakes.

...Upper Great Lakes to the Plains this afternoon/evening...
A surface cold front will make slow southeastward progress from WI
to IA and KS, in the wake of a primary shortwave trough moving over
western ON.  Surface heating is ongoing ahead of the front, where
boundary-layer dewpoints range from the upper 60s to lower 70s
beneath midlevel lapse rates of 7-8 C/km, which will drive MLCAPE of
2000-3000 J/kg.  Convective inhibition will likewise weaken by
early-mid afternoon, when thunderstorm development is likely along
the front and differential heating zone in the SLGT risk corridor. 
Deep-layer flow will be a little stronger toward WI in closer
proximity to the main belt of westerlies, where a mix clusters/line
segments and transient supercell structures will be possible.  The
primary severe threat will be damaging outflow winds (60-70 mph)
from roughly 20z-03z, though isolated large hail of 1-1.5 inches in
diameter may also occur with the strongest storms.

More loosely organized storm clusters are expected this afternoon
through this evening into the southern High Plains, where
thermodynamic profiles will favor isolated severe downbursts.
 
...Northern Maine later this evening...
Around the northern periphery of a closed midlevel high over the
Appalachians, a series of embedded speed maxima will move over ON/QC
through tonight.  Boundary-layer dewpoints in the 60s beneath
midlevel lapse rates near 7 C/km, in combination with daytime
heating, will boost MLCAPE to 1500-2000 J/kg with minimal convective
inhibition by late afternoon.  Thunderstorm development is expected
upstream across QC in association with an embedded speed max/surface
wave, and this convection will approach northern ME by late
evening/early tonight.  Though buoyancy will slowly weaken with the
loss of daytime heating, low-level hodograph curvature and
deep-layer westerly shear should be sufficient for an organized
storm cluster to reach ME before weakening overnight.  Isolated
damaging winds will be the main threat with these storms.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0721 AM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Valid 231300Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE CENTRAL
PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MS VALLEY AND UPPER GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Storms with isolated severe wind gusts and hail will be possible
today from the southern and central Plains northeastward into the
Great Lakes.

...Central Plains into the Upper MS Valley and Upper Great Lakes...
Early-morning satellite imagery shows a shortwave trough progressing
through ND and southern SK/MB. Surface analysis places the low
associated with this shortwave over far northwestern ON, with an
attendant cold front arcing from this low through the MN arrowhead
and back through south-central MN, northwest IA,
eastern/south-central NE to another low in northwest KS. Showers and
thunderstorms are ongoing along this frontal zone from northeast NE
into southern MN. 

Expectation is for the shortwave trough to continue northeastward
through far northwest ON throughout the day, with the primary
surface low also tracking northeastward just ahead of its parent
shortwave. Gradual eastward/southeastward progress of the cold front
is anticipated, although its forward progression will slow with
time, particularly from the Mid MO Valley southwestward into the
southern High Plains. A warm and moist airmass exists ahead of this
front, with temperatures expected to reach the mid 80s to low 90s
amid dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s. These conditions will
result in strong buoyancy and little to no convective inhibition
along much of the front by 21Z. 

Large-scale forcing for ascent will be negligible, but persist
low-level convergence should be enough to initiate deep convection,
with numerous to widespread thunderstorms anticipated. The stronger
deep-layer vertical shear will lag behind the front across much of
the region, but steep low-level lapse rates and ample moisture
should still result in sporadic damaging gusts. There will be better
overlap between the shear and buoyancy from WI into MI, and there is
some chance for one or more forward-propagating line segments in
this area. Some isolated hail is possible within the more robust
early-stage storms. Storm mergers could also result in updrafts
briefly becoming strong enough to produce hail.

...Southern and Central High Plains...
Numerous thunderstorms are expected to develop during the afternoon
amid persistent low-level convergence within the warm, moist, and
weakly sheared airmass over the region. The lack of stronger shear
will result in largely outflow-dominant storm structures. Given the
high cloud bases and steep low-level lapse rates, damaging gusts are
possible with the stronger storms.  

...Northern ME...  
A convectively augmented vorticity maximum currently over
northeastern ON is forecast progress eastward through southern QC
and into the Canadian Maritimes during the period. Showers and
thunderstorms will accompany this vorticity max, with a few stronger
storms potentially glancing northern ME this evening. Moderately low
to mid-level westerly flow will support the threat for some damaging
gusts as these storms move through the region.

...Southeast...
Scattered to numerous diurnally driven thunderstorm are expected
across the region today. Shear will be weak, with a multicellular
pulse mode anticipated. Given the ample moisture and likelihood of
storm interactions, a few strong, water-loaded downbursts are
possible. Limited coverage precludes the need for any severe
probabilities.

Valid 261200Z - 011200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...D4/Thursday: Parts of the Midwest/Great Lakes...
An area of interest for severe-storm potential on Thursday resides
from eastern IA/southeast MN into northern IL/southern WI. A
mid/upper-level shortwave trough is generally forecast to move
across parts of the Midwest into the Great Lakes during the
afternoon, potentially accompanied by a frontal wave. While
deep-layer flow will generally remain rather modest, rich low-level
moisture and strong heating will support moderate to strong buoyancy
along/south of the front. Strong to potentially severe storms may
develop as the approaching shortwave trough impinges upon the
favorable buoyancy.  Uncertainty regarding frontal position and the
sufficiency of deep-layer shear precludes higher confidence at this
time. 

...D5/Friday: Northern Plains...
An area of interest for Friday resides across parts of the northern
Great Plains. A mid/upper-level shortwave trough is forecast to move
across the northern Rockies toward the northern High Plains, though
considerable spread remains regarding the timing of this relatively
low-amplitude shortwave and attendant cold front. The front may
impinge upon strong instability across parts of the Dakotas, with
scattered storm and eventual MCS development possible. Deep-layer
shear may remain relatively modest, but the magnitude of instability
will likely support some organized severe threat. 

...D6/Saturday: Northern Plains/Upper Midwest...
Some continuation of severe-storm potential is possible into
Saturday, potentially shifting eastward into the Upper Midwest.
Spread in guidance becomes quite large at this range regarding
placement of the warm sector Saturday afternoon, but strong
instability and at least modest deep-layer shear could support
severe storms along/east of the cold front.

Valid 221959Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind/hail threats will increase as a corridor of
scattered thunderstorms form ahead of a dryline, along a slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is
expected.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus development is underway along the slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front that arcs across southeast SD into
southwest NE, ahead of a dryline that has mixed across northwest KS
and far southwest NE. Initial storm development should occur ahead
of the dryline/front intersection into central NE where MLCIN is
minimized, with additional storms rippling north-northeast along the
front by early evening. Nearly unidirectional south-southwesterlies
and uniform speeds with height will curtail overall effective bulk
shear. But this should help enhance growth into multicell clusters
favorable for producing sporadic severe gusts. Severe hail potential
may largely be confined to initial storm formation.

Mesoscale Discussion 1405
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern New Mexico into western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221950Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for a few instances of severe wind/hail will
increase through the afternoon. The severe threat should be isolated
enough to preclude a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have recently shown an uptick in
intensity across portions of central NM into the TX Trans Pecos,
with a cell in Lincoln County, NM showing 40 dBZ echoes at 50 kft.
MLCINH is eroding due to strong diurnal heating, which is promoting
robust boundary-layer mixing, with 0-3 km lapse rates already
approaching the 9-10 C/km range in spots (per 19Z mesoanalysis).
Additional storms should continue to develop and intensify this
afternoon given persistent diurnal heating, with MLCAPE likely
exceeding 1000 J/kg. Vertical shear will be weak, and given marginal
MLCAPE, most storms should be pulse cellular or weakly
multicellular. Given steep low-level lapse rates, rapid evaporative
cooling with stronger storm cores may result in severe gusts and
perhaps a brief instance of hail. Since the severe threat should be
isolated, a WW issuance is not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1404
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...northwest MN and eastern ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 221934Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...The tornado threat with a few supercells will increase
during the late afternoon to early evening as surface-based storms
develop across the Red River Valley through northwest Minnesota. A
tornado watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery is occurring across the Red River
Valley and northwest Minnesota in the wake of earlier elevated
thunderstorms. While another round of elevated thunderstorms has
formed well west into the post-frontal airmass across central ND,
this lobe of large-scale ascent will overspread the downstream
surface front and trough in the next couple hours. 19Z mesoanalysis
suggests that MLCIN has weakened. Surface-based thunderstorm
development by 21-22Z is likely. 

Weak easterly components to the low-level flow between the surface
front and trough will support favorable hodograph curvature as flow
veers to the south and south-southwest aloft. In conjunction with
optimal temperature-dew point spreads, a corridor of supercell
tornado potential is anticipated. Otherwise, large hail and isolated
severe gusts will be possible as storms likely become confined
closer to the international border this evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1400
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0724 AM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern ND...northeast SD...western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 221224Z - 221400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe storms are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection is ongoing this morning from
east-central ND into northeast SD. This convection is being aided by
a low-amplitude midlevel shortwave trough moving quickly
northeastward toward northern MN. Midlevel lapse rates are quite
steep (as observed on the 12Z MPX sounding), and recent objective
mesoanalyses depict a corridor of very strong MUCAPE (3000-4000
J/kg) from eastern ND into northwest MN, near and north of a surface
boundary that will move north as a warm front with time today.
Ongoing convection could intensify as it moves into this corridor.
Deep-layer shear is also stronger with northern extent, and could
help to increase storm organization with time this morning.

Large hail and localized severe gusts may accompany these storms as
they move northeastward. The large buoyancy and steep lapse rates
will support a conditional threat of very large hail if any elevated
supercells can become established. Coverage of the severe threat
this morning is uncertain, making the need for short-term watch
issuance unclear. A more extensive severe threat is still expected
across parts of this region later today.
