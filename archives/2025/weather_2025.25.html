Mesoscale Discussion 1459
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern IA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 465...

Valid 262031Z - 262200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 465
continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for damaging wind and possibly a tornado will
continue through late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A convective line has evolved across central into
northern IA this afternoon, with other smaller clusters gradually
becoming better organized into southwest IA. Deep-layer shear is
rather weak, and weakens with southward extent, but unidirectional
25-35 kt southwest flow in the 1-3 km AGL layer (as noted in the
KDMX VWP) could support some organized damaging-wind potential. 

There has been some tendency for outflow to advance ahead of the
convective line, but any small bowing segments that become oriented
more orthogonal to the southwesterly low/midlevel flow (such as the
one across Butler/Grundy Counties, IA) could be more likely to
produce localized swaths of wind damage through late afternoon.
Modestly favorable effective SRH could also support a brief tornado
threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1458
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0243 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Areas affected...Parts of extreme northeast IA...southeast
MN...southwest WI

Concerning...Tornado Watch 463...

Valid 261943Z - 262115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 463 continues.

SUMMARY...Both an eastward-moving convective line and developing
cells ahead of the line could pose a tornado threat this afternoon.
Localized damaging wind is also possible.

DISCUSSION...A broken line of storms has developed from southeast MN
into north-central IA, with additional cells gradually developing
east of the line into parts of southwest WI. MLCAPE has increased
into the 1000-1500 J/kg along and immediately north of the warm
front, with a more stable environment farther north, where clouds
have persisted and temperatures are in the 60s F. 

The broken line moving across far southeast MN earlier produced a
reported tornado in Freeborn County, and this portion of the line
will continue to pose a tornado threat as it traverses the warm
frontal zone, where low-level shear/SRH is locally enhanced (as
noted in the KARX VWP). The developing cells east of the line could
also begin to pose a tornado threat, especially if one or more of
these cells can mature and take on more of a front-parallel motion,
leading to increased residence time in the frontal zone. Cell
mergers into the primary line could also result in locally increased
tornado potential. 

Aside from the tornado potential, locally damaging wind will
continue to be possible with the primary convective line as it moves
eastward this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1457
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0211 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Areas affected...portions of far northern Texas...western
Oklahoma...into far southern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 261911Z - 262115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with potential for strong to severe wind possible
this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development is ongoing across far western
Oklahoma this afternoon where daytime heating has allowed MLCIN to
erode. Temperatures are now in the mid 80s to mid 90s with dew
points in the upper 60s to 70s. MLCAPE around 1000-2000 J/kg is
noted in surface objective analysis. Though the background flow is
generally weak, steep lapse rates around 8-8.5 C/km and moist
profiles will support a few strong storms capable of strong to
severe winds through the afternoon. Given the lack of shear for a
more widespread and organized threat, a watch is unlikely to be
needed.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Valid 262000Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
FROM NORTHWEST MISSOURI INTO SOUTHERN MINNESOTA/WISCONSIN...AND FROM
THE MID-ATLANTIC TO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated wind damage and a few tornadoes will be possible this
afternoon from northwest Missouri into Iowa, southeast Minnesota,
and southern Wisconsin. Scattered wind damage will be possible from
the Mid-Atlantic into the southern Appalachians.

...20Z Update...
The forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments were made
with this update. In particular, the Slight risk was expanded
eastward in IA and northern MO -- where warm/moist boundary-layer
conditions should support the maintenance of an eastward-moving line
of storms (with an associated severe-wind risk) into this evening.
Reference Severe Thunderstorm Watch 465 for more information on the
severe risk here. Farther north, the potential for tornadoes will
continue with both pre-frontal cells within the baroclinic zone in
southern WI and with the primary confluence band advancing eastward
out of southeastern MN. An upgrade to 10-percent tornado
probabilities was considered, but overall confidence in this
scenario was too low for the upgrade at this time. For more details,
see Tornado Watch 463 and MCD 1458. Finally, the damaging wind gusts
will remain possible with evolving storms in the Mid-Atlantic
(within Severe Thunderstorm Watch 464).

..Weinman.. 06/26/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1109 AM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025/

...Upper Midwest...
A shortwave trough is evident this morning over NE/SD moving
eastward.  Lift ahead of this feature will encourage scattered
thunderstorm development by early afternoon near the surface low and
along a weak cold front over western IA. These storms will track
southeastward into a warm and very moist air mass, where MLCAPE
values will be 2000-3000 J/kg.  Steep low-level lapse rates will
promote a risk of damaging winds as the storms spread southeastward
through early evening.

From the surface low eastward into southern WI, a corridor of backed
low-level winds and enhanced shear along the warm front will be
favorable for a few discrete supercells.  Similar to yesterday
(although perhaps not quite as favorable), there is a risk of a few
tornadoes through the afternoon and early evening.

...Mid-Atlantic to Southern Appalachians...
Full sunshine is occurring again today from southeast PA to the
western Carolinas and north GA.  This corridor will be hot/humid
again today, leading to scattered thunderstorms.  Winds aloft are
weak, suggesting disorganized/pulse convective modes.  However,
steep low-level lapse rates and moderate CAPE values will once again
result in a risk of locally damaging wind gusts through the
afternoon and early evening.  Despite the expected weak winds aloft,
will introduce a SLGT risk for this corridor given the consensus of
model guidance supporting the threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are expected
across central and southwest Wyoming Friday. A broad increase in
westerly winds at mid-levels in combination with a dry boundary
layer will support an overlap of 15-20 mph surface winds and
relative humidity of 10-15 percent Friday afternoon. Fuels remain
drier west of the Continental Divide owing to rainfall deficits but
heightened west-southwest winds should be enough to pose at least a
broad elevated fire weather threat across central Wyoming.
Otherwise, forecast (see below) remains on track with no significant
changes to Elevated highlights.

..Williams.. 06/26/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected across parts of
central to southwest Wyoming Friday afternoon. Strengthening zonal
flow over the northern Rockies will promote a more pronounced
surface mass response across the northern High Plains on Friday
compared to today/Thursday. Consequently, low-level winds will
likely be slightly stronger across a broad swath of the eastern
Great Basin and parts of the Four Corners region. In general, most
locations from eastern NV into northern AZ, UT, southern ID, and WY
will see breezy conditions with wind speeds generally in the mid
teens. Across southwest to central WY, downslope flow into the WY
Basin and in the lee of the Wind River Range will regionally augment
surface winds to near 20 mph. Deep mixing will promote frequent
gusts up to 25-30 mph by peak heating as RH values fall into the
teens. Several hours of elevated conditions appear likely, and
periods of critical conditions are possible. Fuels across much of WY
are not as dry compared to locations southwest, but several hours of
dry/windy conditions should promote adequate drying of dead finer
fuels to support the fire weather concern. An expansion of the
Elevated risk area appears possible if confidence in
sustained/widespread 15+ mph winds increases across portions of the
Great Basin/Four Corners region where fuels remain very dry.

MINNESOTA...ADJACENT NORTHWESTERN WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong thunderstorms, posing a risk for severe hail and
wind, are possible across parts of the middle Missouri Valley into
Upper Midwest Saturday afternoon into Saturday night.

...Discussion...
Little change in the large-scale mid/upper flow is forecast from
Friday into Saturday, with modest westerlies remaining generally
zonal and confined to the northern tier of the U.S. and adjacent
portions of southern Canada.  Within this regime, one notable short
wave trough is forecast to progress east of the Great Lakes into New
England Saturday through Saturday night, as broad upstream 
troughing (with at least a couple of embedded smaller-scale
perturbations) progresses eastward along the north central
Canadian/U.S. border vicinity.  

In lower-levels, cooler and drier boundary-layer air is likely to be
maintained across parts of northern New England, with another influx
of cooler air spreading southeast of the Great Lakes through the
upper Ohio Valley, northern Mid Atlantic coast and southern New
England by late Saturday night.  A trailing cold front is likely to
continue slowly advancing east/southeast of the northern Rockies,
through the northern Great Plains.  Elsewhere, east of the high
plains, seasonably moist boundary air may become characterized by
moderate to strong potential instability with daytime heating.

...Northern Great Plains...
The extent of convective development and its evolution remain
unclear for this period due to a number of lingering uncertainties. 
Focus for renewed thunderstorm development could be impacted by
outflow from convection developing Friday night into early Saturday.
Additionally, strongest potential instability by Saturday afternoon
is likely to become focused beneath the nose of the warmer and more
strongly capping elevated mixed-layer air, roughly across the
northern/eastern South Dakota vicinity, before slowly becoming
suppressed southeastward.  However, this might tend to become
displaced to the south of the stronger and more favorably sheared
westerlies.

Even so, given thermodynamic profiles becoming characterized by
steep lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates and large CAPE, scattered
strong to severe thunderstorm development appears possible ahead of
the southeastward advancing cold front by late afternoon.  Aided by
forcing for ascent supported by low-level warm advection beneath
broadly difluent upper flow, activity may consolidate into one or
two eastward/southeastward propagating clusters by Saturday evening.

...Northern Mid Atlantic into Champlain Valley...
A corridor of moderate to large developing mixed-layer CAPE, ahead
of the southeastward advancing cold front, and within preceding
deepening surface troughing, seems likely to provide the focus for
vigorous thunderstorm development by late Saturday afternoon. 
Although lapse rates may be modest, and stronger potential
instability across the northern Mid Atlantic may be displaced to the
south of the better flow/shear across Upstate New York into New
England, the environment may still become conducive to scattered
strong thunderstorms accompanied by a risk for potentially damaging
wind gusts.  If/when lingering uncertainties become more clear, it
is possible that severe probabilities could still be increased a bit
further in later outlooks for this period.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1226 PM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE FRIDAY INTO
FRIDAY NIGHT ACROSS MUCH OF NORTH AND SOUTH DAKOTA INTO PARTS OF
WESTERN MINNESOTA AND NORTH CENTRAL NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong thunderstorms, and perhaps one or two small
organizing clusters, may impact parts of the northern Great Plains
late Friday afternoon into Friday night, accompanied by a risk for
severe hail and wind.

...Discussion...
Although a mid to upper low is likely to linger across parts of the
Southeast, perhaps migrating slowly northward across the northern
Florida into Georgia vicinity, modest subtropical ridging at
mid-levels will generally prevail across much of the central and
southern tier of the U.S. through this period.  Models indicate that
modest mid-level westerlies will remain confined to the northern
tier, with one embedded short wave trough forecast to slowly
progress across the Great Lakes region.  A couple of, perhaps, more
subtle perturbations within a broader cyclonic regime are forecast
to progress east-northeastward near and north of the Montana/North
Dakota international border vicinity.

In lower levels, a surface cold front, in the wake of a digging
short wave trough well offshore of the northern Atlantic coast, may
make further southward progress through portions of the northern Mid
Atlantic states, before retreating northeastward late Friday through
Friday night.  Upstream, another cold front, likely into the upper
Great Lakes vicinity and through much of the northern Great Plains
by 12Z Friday, is forecast to continue to advance eastward across
the Great Lakes through the remainder of the period, while the cool
air gradually modifies from west to east across the Dakotas.  In
between and south of these boundaries, seasonably moist conditions,
including upper 60s to 70+ F dew points, appear likely to persist
across most areas east of the high plains.

...Northern Great Plains...
Models indicate that low-level warming and moistening across the
western into central Dakotas may contribute to strong potential
instability by Friday afternoon, beneath warm elevated mixed-layer
air advecting east of the northern Rockies, ahead of the broad
approaching upstream mid-level troughing.  This destabilization will
become focused east of the modestly deep lee surface trough axis,
along a developing warm frontal zone aided by strengthening
differential surface heating.  

The northern periphery of the warmer and more strongly capping
elevated mixed-layer air is forecast to nose across western through
central South Dakota by early Friday evening. 
Lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection on the edge of this air mass
may provide the focus for an upscale growing cluster of storms
across north central South Dakota, or perhaps south central North
Dakota, aided by a modestly strengthening low-level jet Friday
evening.  This would likely tend to propagate east-southeastward
overnight, beneath  strengthening westerly mid/upper flow (including
30-40+ kt at 500 mb). 

Otherwise, widely scattered strong to severe thunderstorms,
including a couple of supercells, may initiate near/east of the lee
trough during the late afternoon into evening across the western
Dakotas, and perhaps parts of north central Nebraska into
northeastern Colorado, though this is a bit more uncertain due to
potentially stronger mid-level inhibition.

...Lower Great Lakes Vicinity...
Latest model output indicates that strengthening thunderstorm
development is possible in a narrow pre-frontal corridor across
parts of southwestern Ontario and southeastern Lower Michigan into
northwestern Indiana and northwestern Ohio, near or after 28/00Z. 
Although this is after peak diurnal heating, moderately large
residual CAPE, in the presence of southwesterly deep-layer mean flow
strengthening to 20-30 kt, might become supportive of convection
capable of producing a few locally strong to severe wind gusts,
before storms weaken late Friday evening.

...Appalachians into Southeast...
In the presence of relatively weak mid-level inhibition, forcing for
ascent aided by orography and inland advancing sea breezes may
support considerable diurnal thunderstorm development, as insolation
within a seasonably moist boundary-layer contributes to moderate
potential instability.  Stronger convection will probably pose a
risk for locally damaging downbursts, before activity weakens early
Friday evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

A subtle mid-level short wave trough will exit the Great Basin into
the Northern Rockies this afternoon. Mid-level flow and surface
pressure gradients will relax across the Great Basin as the trough
ejects northeastward through the day although resulting in sustained
west-southwest surface winds around 10-15 mph during peak boundary
layer mixing. However, locally elevated fire weather conditions,
particularly leeward of mountain ranges within the Great Basin and
northwestern Arizona and southwest Utah, can be expected today.
Stronger winds of 15-25 mph are likely across the upper Snake River
Plain but fuels are not as receptive to wildfire spread as regions
farther south.

..Williams.. 06/26/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1248 AM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain limited for today
across the country. Widespread rainfall over the eastern two-thirds
of the country will limit fuel status for most locations. West of
the Rockies, dry conditions will continue with afternoon RH minimums
in the teens expected. However, the strongest low/mid-level flow is
expected to remain across the Pacific Northwest (where RH reductions
won't be as pronounced) ahead of a low-amplitude mid-level trough.
Localized elevated conditions may materialize across portions of
southern ID and northern NV where the overlap of dry conditions,
receptive fuels, and modest surface winds (15-20 mph) is most
probable. Latest high-res ensemble guidance generally shows a weak
signal for widespread and/or persistent elevated conditions, which
limits confidence in the overall fire weather threat.

Valid 261630Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
FROM NORTHWEST MO INTO SOUTHERN MN/WI...AND FROM THE MID-ATLANTIC TO
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated wind damage and a few tornadoes will be possible this
afternoon from northwest Missouri into Iowa, southeast Minnesota,
and southern Wisconsin. Scattered wind damage will be possible from
the Mid-Atlantic into the southern Appalachians.

...Upper Midwest...
A shortwave trough is evident this morning over NE/SD moving
eastward.  Lift ahead of this feature will encourage scattered
thunderstorm development by early afternoon near the surface low and
along a weak cold front over western IA. These storms will track
southeastward into a warm and very moist air mass, where MLCAPE
values will be 2000-3000 J/kg.  Steep low-level lapse rates will
promote a risk of damaging winds as the storms spread southeastward
through early evening.

From the surface low eastward into southern WI, a corridor of backed
low-level winds and enhanced shear along the warm front will be
favorable for a few discrete supercells.  Similar to yesterday
(although perhaps not quite as favorable), there is a risk of a few
tornadoes through the afternoon and early evening.

...Mid-Atlantic to Southern Appalachians...
Full sunshine is occurring again today from southeast PA to the
western Carolinas and north GA.  This corridor will be hot/humid
again today, leading to scattered thunderstorms.  Winds aloft are
weak, suggesting disorganized/pulse convective modes.  However,
steep low-level lapse rates and moderate CAPE values will once again
result in a risk of locally damaging wind gusts through the
afternoon and early evening.  Despite the expected weak winds aloft,
will introduce a SLGT risk for this corridor given the consensus of
model guidance supporting the threat.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0733 AM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS FAR SOUTHEAST MN...NORTHERN IA AND SOUTHERN WI...

...SUMMARY...
A few tornadoes and isolated wind damage will be possible this
afternoon from northern Iowa and southwest Minnesota into southwest
Wisconsin. Isolated wind damage will be possible across a broad area
of the eastern Plains, Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and
Montana.

...Southern MN/IA/Southern WI...
Early morning radar and satellite imagery show a well-defined MCV
moving northeastward into eastern NE. Surface analysis reveals a low
over eastern NE, which is associated with this vorticity maximum as
well. A stationary boundary extends northeastward from this low
through northwestern IA to another low in the MN/IA/WI border
intersection vicinity. This boundary, which separates a moist
airmass characterized by 70s dewpoints from a more continental
airmass with low 60s dewpoints, could act as a favored corridor for
northeastward progress of the surface low throughout the day. At the
same time, strengthening southerly low-level flow will increase the
low-level moisture advection south of this boundary, resulting in
some tightening of this boundary throughout the day. Some guidance
suggests this boundary could move slightly northward as a warm front
as well. This low-level moisture advection will also help offset
surface dewpoint reductions due to mixing, with dewpoints likely
remaining in the 70s along and south of the boundary. Strong heating
of this moist airmass will bring temperatures in the upper 70s/low
80s, fostering airmass destabilization and strong buoyancy by the
early afternoon.

Thunderstorm development is expected as the approaching vorticity
maximum and associated surface low interact with this unstable
airmass, with initiation occurring both near the surface low as well
as farther east amid the convergence along the warm front. The
development near the low should becoming linear quickly while the
activity along the front should remain more cellular longer. The
initial/more discrete storms could be supercells with the potential
to produce a few tornadoes within the moderately sheared and
vorticity rich environment along the front. Damaging gusts will be
possible with the linear segments as well, particularly in close
vicinity to the surface low where mesoscale circulations could
augment updrafts and downdrafts.

...Central/Eastern KS into Western/Central OK...
Recent surface analysis reveals weak surface troughing to the south
of a low over eastern NE. This troughing will likely shift eastward
as its parent low progresses northeastward, with convergence along
this boundary contributing to thunderstorms across central and
eastern KS. The character of the boundary will become more diffuse
with southern extent, but modest low-level confluence should still
be enough to support afternoon thunderstorm development. Vertical
shear will be weak through this entire corridor, but thermodynamic
profiles will favor strong downdrafts and the potential for isolated
strong-severe outflow gusts for a few hours this afternoon/evening.

...Southeast...
Overnight convection has resulted in extensive cloudiness across
much of the region this morning. Even so, ample low-level moisture
remains in place and the airmass is expected to destabilize by the
early afternoon amid strong heating. Initial development appears
most likely near the westward progressing outflow moving across MS,
with additional development later near a convectively generated
vorticity maximum moving across central GA. Widespread storms are
also expected across FL as an upper low drifts slowly
west-northwestward. Shear will be weak areawide and a largely
disorganized storm mode is anticipated. Surging outflow is possible
with the strongest storms, fostering the potential for damaging
gusts and also contributing to additional storm development. Several
forward-propagating clusters are possible although their location,
strength, and longevity are uncertain, precluding any increased
severe probabilities with this outlook. 

...MT this afternoon/evening...
A subtle midlevel trough and associated/diffuse front will move
across the northern Rockies this afternoon into tonight.  Deep
mixing and inverted-V profiles will favor some potential for
strong-severe outflow gusts with scattered high-based thunderstorms
along and ahead of the diffuse front this afternoon into this
evening.

...OH Valley into the Mid-Atlantic this afternoon...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected again this afternoon as the
airmass destabilizes amid strong daytime heating and ample low-level
moisture. Residual boundaries from prior convection, and terrain
circulations will act as favored areas for initiation. Vertical
shear will be weak, but steep low-level lapse rates and
precipitation loading could support isolated wind damage with
downbursts from mid afternoon into the evening.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0352 AM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Valid 291200Z - 041200Z

...DISCUSSION...
On the large scale, a low-amplitude upper trough over the northern
Plains on Sunday/D4 will amplify as it moves toward the upper Great
Lakes into Monday/D5, and more so into Tuesday/D6 when it will
stretch across into the Northeast.

At the surface, high pressure will extend into the northern to
central Plains on Sunday/D4, with a trough affecting the upper MS
Valley to central Plains. This trough/front will push farther south
on Monday/D5, extending roughly from the OH Valley into the southern
Plains, and eventually, into the Gulf Coast states into Wednesday/D7
as high pressure spreads into the MS Valley.

For the period, instability looks to be strongest on Sunday/D4 ahead
of the front from NE/KS into IA/MO/IL with upper 60s to lower 70s F
dewpoints common. While unstable, only weak westerly flow aloft will
be present, and this will likely result in south to southwest
propagating cluster of storms producing areas of gusty winds. Given
substantial storm coverage over much of the central Plains to
upper/middle MS Valley, predictability remains low for denoting
precise risk areas.

A low-end risk of severe storms with wind potential could develop
into the Mid Atlantic on Tuesday/D6 as the Great Lakes/Northeast
trough amplifies with westerlies increasing to 30 to perhaps 40 kt
at 500 mb. Otherwise, scattered storms will also occur away from
this boundary, across much of the Southeast as the moisture and
instability remain in place in a weak shear environment.

Mesoscale Discussion 1439
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the Carolinas into northeast GA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 459...

Valid 252040Z - 252215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 459
continues.

SUMMARY...The damaging wind threat may gradually increase into the
early evening. Isolated hail also remains possible.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing late this afternoon
across parts of eastern NC, with additional storms in western NC,
and developing cumulus into parts of SC and east-central/northeast
GA. Additional storm development is possible into early evening,
within a very unstable (MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg) environment.
Generally weak deep-layer shear continue to hamper storm
organization, but the strong instability and steep midlevel lapse
rates will continue to support vigorous updrafts. 

Outflow is gradually expanding across eastern NC, and there may be
some tendency for a loosely organized storm cluster to propagate
south/southwestward with time, as outflow impinges upon a hot and
very moist environment. A similar evolution could take place with
ongoing storms across western NC. This could lead to more
concentrated areas of damaging wind with time. The strongest
updrafts will also continue to be capable of producing isolated
hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 1438
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...FL Panhandle into south GA and far southeast AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251958Z - 252200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Additional storm development is possible through late
afternoon, with a continued threat of damaging wind and isolated
hail.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered storms are ongoing this afternoon
across the FL Panhandle into southwest GA, with additional cumulus
development noted northeast of the ongoing convection. Relatively
steep lapse rates and cool temperatures aloft are supporting strong
to extreme buoyancy, with MLCAPE generally in the 3000-4000 J/kg
range. Deep-layer flow is rather weak, though modest midlevel
northeasterlies on the periphery of an upper ridge will support
20-25 kt of effective shear through the afternoon, which may support
modest storm organization given the very favorable instability. 

Potential will continue this afternoon for southwestward moving
clusters capable of damaging downburst/outflow winds and isolated
hail. There is some potential for loosely organized outflow-driven
clusters to develop, which could produce more concentrated areas of
wind damage, though this scenario remains somewhat uncertain. 

Uncertainty regarding severe coverage renders the need for
short-term watch issuance uncertain, but trends will be monitored
for an uptick in coverage through the remainder of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1437
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0216 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...central and northeastern Nebraska...parts of
southeastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 251916Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A corridor of increasing thunderstorm development,
including gradually organizing clusters with increasing potential
for strong to severe surface gusts, through 4-6 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of one low-amplitude short-wavelength
perturbation migrating through the Upper Midwest toward adjacent
Great Lakes vicinity, a similar strength perturbation is gradually
migrating north-northeastward through the central high plains,
around the northwestern periphery of the prominent mid-level ridge
centered over the Tennessee Valley.  Downstream of this feature,
forcing for ascent has maintained an arcing band of precipitation
across Nebraska, which is preceded by a seasonably high moisture
content boundary-layer that is destabilizing beneath relatively warm
and dry layers aloft associated with the ridging.

Within the strengthening zone of differential surface heating to the
east of the precipitation band, mixed-layer CAPE is beginning to
increase in excess of 2000 J/kg, beneath a modest belt of
southwesterly mid-level flow which includes speeds of 30-40 kt in
the 700-500 mb layer.  Although mid/upper-level lapse rates are
weak, as low-level lapse rates continue to steepen and inhibition
erodes further, a corridor of increasing thunderstorm development
appears probable across Nebraska, from the Lexington NE toward Sioux
City IA vicinity, through 21-23Z.  As this occurs, heavy
precipitation loading and evaporative cooling in downdrafts may
gradually contribute to downward momentum transfer accompanied by
increasing potential for a few strong to severe severe gusts, in
slowly organizing clusters.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Iowa
  Southeast Minnesota
  Southwest Wisconsin

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 255 PM
  until 1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...

moderately sheared environment.  These storms will track eastward
across the watch area, posing a risk of a few tornadoes and damaging
wind gusts.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 20 miles west northwest of Fairmont
MN to 45 miles east of La Crosse WI. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 460
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
240 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northwest Iowa
  Central and Northeast Nebraska

Mesoscale Discussion 1429
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of extreme northwest Pennsylvania into
extreme western New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 242049Z - 242315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A couple of damaging gusts cannot be ruled out over the
next several hours. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...A few thunderstorms have initiated and intensified off
of surface boundaries and confluence zones over the past couple of
hours. Deep-layer flow and shear, as well as buoyancy, are modest at
best across the region (e.g. 1000 J/kg MLCAPE amid less than 20 kts
of effective bulk shear). As such, a couple of brief downbursts may
cause sparse tree damage in the near-term. Relatively more robust
storms are currently tracking across extreme southeast Ontario.
These storms may cross Lake Erie a few hours for now, perhaps with a
slightly greater damaging gust threat. Nonetheless, the severe
threat should remain localized, precluding the need for a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 261200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
An weak upper-level trough will move across the Pacific Northwest 
Day 3/Thursday into the Great Lakes by Day 7/Monday. An amplifying
ridge across the Intermountain West early next week will promote
lighter surface winds but well above normal temperatures for much of
the Western U.S. Weak troughing will remain off the West Coast, with
potential for locally breezy conditions and mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms.

...Day 3-6/Thursday-Sunday...
Generally weak upper flow with the western trough will promote
lighter, mainly terrain driven winds across much of the
Intermountain West and Southwest late this week, into early next
week. A few hours of Elevated to locally Critical conditions will be
possible across portions of the Columbia Basin into the Snake River
Plain in Idaho on D3/Thursday and D4/Friday.

...Day 7/Monday - Day 8/Tuesday...
A weak trough will push the western ridge eastward across the Divide
and Rockies early next week. There is some potential for increasing 
winds but also moisture for thunderstorms across the Pacific
Northwest. For now, confidence in moisture and position of the
trough remains too low to include probabilities.

Mesoscale Discussion 1420
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern/eastern Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455...

Valid 232036Z - 232230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455
continues.

SUMMARY...Another small, organized cluster of storms posing a risk
for damaging wind gusts may evolve east of La Crosse toward the
Oshkosh vicinity through 5-7 PM CDT, along outflow trailing the lead
cluster now spreading south through southeast of Green Bay.

DISCUSSION...One small, organized convective cluster, with an
embedded meso-beta scale cyclonic circulation, has already evolved
and produced a narrow corridor of severe and/or damaging gusts near
and east of the Wisconsin Rapids area.  This may continue near/south
and southeast of the Green Bay vicinity, before diminishing while
spreading into Lake Michigan within the next hour or so.

Meanwhile, thunderstorm activity now forming upstream may undergo a
similar evolution along the trailing outflow from the lead cluster, 
east of La Crosse toward the Oshkosh vicinity during the next couple
of hours. Inhibition has become increasingly negligible in the
presence of peak heating, with latest mesoanalysis indicating CAPE
on the order of 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of at least modest
shear beneath 40+ kt westerly 500 mb flow.

Mesoscale Discussion 1418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of northwestern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232008Z - 232245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered strong to severe storms, including a
supercell or two, may cross the St. Lawrence Valley and at least
approach parts of northwestern Maine prior to 8 PM EDT, accompanied
by the risk for large hail and potential for a tornado.  Although it
still appears unlikely that a severe weather watch will be needed,
trends will continue to be monitored for this possibility.

DISCUSSION...Near/just ahead of a mid-level perturbation associated
with a now dissipated thunderstorm cluster, isolated supercell
development appears underway across parts of southeastern Quebec,
roughly 100 miles or so to the northwest of Quebec City.  Activity
appears to be forming just to the south of a warm frontal zone,
where surface dew points are near 70 F, and low-level hodographs
have become sizable beneath 30 kt west-southwesterly flow around 850
mb.

This is occurring beneath 40-50 kt west-northwesterly 500 mb flow,
around the northeastern periphery of the prominent mid-level high
centered near the southern Appalachians, contributing to a
southeastward propagation toward the St. Lawrence Valley, near
Quebec City.  Additional thunderstorm development appears possible
over the next few hours in closer proximity to the frontal zone to
the north.  

East of the St. Lawrence Valley, into northern New England, warming
and moistening of the boundary layer is ongoing along and south of
the northward developing warm frontal zone.  Forecast soundings from
the Rapid Refresh suggest that this may include surface dew points
increasing to near or above 70 F, in the presence of enlarging,
clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, across parts of northwestern
Maine prior to 00Z.  Although the onset of nightfall contributes to
some uncertainty concerning the extent of boundary-layer
destabilization, there appears at least some potential for the
maintenance of supercells posing a risk for severe hail, and
potential for a tornado or two.

Mesoscale Discussion 1417
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...portions of central Kansas into far southeast
Nebraska and southwestern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231934Z - 232200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in severe potential may occur if more robust
thunderstorm development can take place along the cold front. Strong
to potentially severe wind gusts would be the main hazard.
Convective trends are being monitored for the need of a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A line of thunderstorms has developed across eastern NE
in a post-cold-frontal regime. Within the last hour, convection has
tried to deepen along the KS/NE border, closer to the cold front,
and where greater buoyancy resides. Deep-layer shear is modest at
best (e.g. 30 kts), and is lagging the cold front. While vertical
wind shear is limited, 7-8 C/km boundary-layer lapse rates atop 70+
F surface dewpoints is contributing to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE in a weakly
capped environment. While storms should be mainly pulse-cellular or
multicellular, any cold-pool mergers that occur with the more
intense storms may support strong to severe gusts. Convective trends
are being monitored for further increases in coverage or intensity
that would warrant a Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1406
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...southwest to northeast NE and southeast SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 221959Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind/hail threats will increase as a corridor of
scattered thunderstorms form ahead of a dryline, along a slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is
expected.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus development is underway along the slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front that arcs across southeast SD into
southwest NE, ahead of a dryline that has mixed across northwest KS
and far southwest NE. Initial storm development should occur ahead
of the dryline/front intersection into central NE where MLCIN is
minimized, with additional storms rippling north-northeast along the
front by early evening. Nearly unidirectional south-southwesterlies
and uniform speeds with height will curtail overall effective bulk
shear. But this should help enhance growth into multicell clusters
favorable for producing sporadic severe gusts. Severe hail potential
may largely be confined to initial storm formation.

Mesoscale Discussion 1405
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern New Mexico into western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221950Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for a few instances of severe wind/hail will
increase through the afternoon. The severe threat should be isolated
enough to preclude a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have recently shown an uptick in
intensity across portions of central NM into the TX Trans Pecos,
with a cell in Lincoln County, NM showing 40 dBZ echoes at 50 kft.
MLCINH is eroding due to strong diurnal heating, which is promoting
robust boundary-layer mixing, with 0-3 km lapse rates already
approaching the 9-10 C/km range in spots (per 19Z mesoanalysis).
Additional storms should continue to develop and intensify this
afternoon given persistent diurnal heating, with MLCAPE likely
exceeding 1000 J/kg. Vertical shear will be weak, and given marginal
MLCAPE, most storms should be pulse cellular or weakly
multicellular. Given steep low-level lapse rates, rapid evaporative
cooling with stronger storm cores may result in severe gusts and
perhaps a brief instance of hail. Since the severe threat should be
isolated, a WW issuance is not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1404
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...northwest MN and eastern ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 221934Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...The tornado threat with a few supercells will increase
during the late afternoon to early evening as surface-based storms
develop across the Red River Valley through northwest Minnesota. A
tornado watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery is occurring across the Red River
Valley and northwest Minnesota in the wake of earlier elevated
thunderstorms. While another round of elevated thunderstorms has
formed well west into the post-frontal airmass across central ND,
this lobe of large-scale ascent will overspread the downstream
surface front and trough in the next couple hours. 19Z mesoanalysis
suggests that MLCIN has weakened. Surface-based thunderstorm
development by 21-22Z is likely. 

Weak easterly components to the low-level flow between the surface
front and trough will support favorable hodograph curvature as flow
veers to the south and south-southwest aloft. In conjunction with
optimal temperature-dew point spreads, a corridor of supercell
tornado potential is anticipated. Otherwise, large hail and isolated
severe gusts will be possible as storms likely become confined
closer to the international border this evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1400
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0724 AM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern ND...northeast SD...western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 221224Z - 221400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe storms are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection is ongoing this morning from
east-central ND into northeast SD. This convection is being aided by
a low-amplitude midlevel shortwave trough moving quickly
northeastward toward northern MN. Midlevel lapse rates are quite
steep (as observed on the 12Z MPX sounding), and recent objective
mesoanalyses depict a corridor of very strong MUCAPE (3000-4000
J/kg) from eastern ND into northwest MN, near and north of a surface
boundary that will move north as a warm front with time today.
Ongoing convection could intensify as it moves into this corridor.
Deep-layer shear is also stronger with northern extent, and could
help to increase storm organization with time this morning.

Large hail and localized severe gusts may accompany these storms as
they move northeastward. The large buoyancy and steep lapse rates
will support a conditional threat of very large hail if any elevated
supercells can become established. Coverage of the severe threat
this morning is uncertain, making the need for short-term watch
issuance unclear. A more extensive severe threat is still expected
across parts of this region later today.
