Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0733 AM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS FAR SOUTHEAST MN...NORTHERN IA AND SOUTHERN WI...

...SUMMARY...
A few tornadoes and isolated wind damage will be possible this
afternoon from northern Iowa and southwest Minnesota into southwest
Wisconsin. Isolated wind damage will be possible across a broad area
of the eastern Plains, Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and
Montana.

...Southern MN/IA/Southern WI...
Early morning radar and satellite imagery show a well-defined MCV
moving northeastward into eastern NE. Surface analysis reveals a low
over eastern NE, which is associated with this vorticity maximum as
well. A stationary boundary extends northeastward from this low
through northwestern IA to another low in the MN/IA/WI border
intersection vicinity. This boundary, which separates a moist
airmass characterized by 70s dewpoints from a more continental
airmass with low 60s dewpoints, could act as a favored corridor for
northeastward progress of the surface low throughout the day. At the
same time, strengthening southerly low-level flow will increase the
low-level moisture advection south of this boundary, resulting in
some tightening of this boundary throughout the day. Some guidance
suggests this boundary could move slightly northward as a warm front
as well. This low-level moisture advection will also help offset
surface dewpoint reductions due to mixing, with dewpoints likely
remaining in the 70s along and south of the boundary. Strong heating
of this moist airmass will bring temperatures in the upper 70s/low
80s, fostering airmass destabilization and strong buoyancy by the
early afternoon.

Thunderstorm development is expected as the approaching vorticity
maximum and associated surface low interact with this unstable
airmass, with initiation occurring both near the surface low as well
as farther east amid the convergence along the warm front. The
development near the low should becoming linear quickly while the
activity along the front should remain more cellular longer. The
initial/more discrete storms could be supercells with the potential
to produce a few tornadoes within the moderately sheared and
vorticity rich environment along the front. Damaging gusts will be
possible with the linear segments as well, particularly in close
vicinity to the surface low where mesoscale circulations could
augment updrafts and downdrafts.

...Central/Eastern KS into Western/Central OK...
Recent surface analysis reveals weak surface troughing to the south
of a low over eastern NE. This troughing will likely shift eastward
as its parent low progresses northeastward, with convergence along
this boundary contributing to thunderstorms across central and
eastern KS. The character of the boundary will become more diffuse
with southern extent, but modest low-level confluence should still
be enough to support afternoon thunderstorm development. Vertical
shear will be weak through this entire corridor, but thermodynamic
profiles will favor strong downdrafts and the potential for isolated
strong-severe outflow gusts for a few hours this afternoon/evening.

...Southeast...
Overnight convection has resulted in extensive cloudiness across
much of the region this morning. Even so, ample low-level moisture
remains in place and the airmass is expected to destabilize by the
early afternoon amid strong heating. Initial development appears
most likely near the westward progressing outflow moving across MS,
with additional development later near a convectively generated
vorticity maximum moving across central GA. Widespread storms are
also expected across FL as an upper low drifts slowly
west-northwestward. Shear will be weak areawide and a largely
disorganized storm mode is anticipated. Surging outflow is possible
with the strongest storms, fostering the potential for damaging
gusts and also contributing to additional storm development. Several
forward-propagating clusters are possible although their location,
strength, and longevity are uncertain, precluding any increased
severe probabilities with this outlook. 

...MT this afternoon/evening...
A subtle midlevel trough and associated/diffuse front will move
across the northern Rockies this afternoon into tonight.  Deep
mixing and inverted-V profiles will favor some potential for
strong-severe outflow gusts with scattered high-based thunderstorms
along and ahead of the diffuse front this afternoon into this
evening.

...OH Valley into the Mid-Atlantic this afternoon...
Scattered thunderstorms are expected again this afternoon as the
airmass destabilizes amid strong daytime heating and ample low-level
moisture. Residual boundaries from prior convection, and terrain
circulations will act as favored areas for initiation. Vertical
shear will be weak, but steep low-level lapse rates and
precipitation loading could support isolated wind damage with
downbursts from mid afternoon into the evening.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0352 AM CDT Thu Jun 26 2025

Valid 291200Z - 041200Z

...DISCUSSION...
On the large scale, a low-amplitude upper trough over the northern
Plains on Sunday/D4 will amplify as it moves toward the upper Great
Lakes into Monday/D5, and more so into Tuesday/D6 when it will
stretch across into the Northeast.

At the surface, high pressure will extend into the northern to
central Plains on Sunday/D4, with a trough affecting the upper MS
Valley to central Plains. This trough/front will push farther south
on Monday/D5, extending roughly from the OH Valley into the southern
Plains, and eventually, into the Gulf Coast states into Wednesday/D7
as high pressure spreads into the MS Valley.

For the period, instability looks to be strongest on Sunday/D4 ahead
of the front from NE/KS into IA/MO/IL with upper 60s to lower 70s F
dewpoints common. While unstable, only weak westerly flow aloft will
be present, and this will likely result in south to southwest
propagating cluster of storms producing areas of gusty winds. Given
substantial storm coverage over much of the central Plains to
upper/middle MS Valley, predictability remains low for denoting
precise risk areas.

A low-end risk of severe storms with wind potential could develop
into the Mid Atlantic on Tuesday/D6 as the Great Lakes/Northeast
trough amplifies with westerlies increasing to 30 to perhaps 40 kt
at 500 mb. Otherwise, scattered storms will also occur away from
this boundary, across much of the Southeast as the moisture and
instability remain in place in a weak shear environment.

Mesoscale Discussion 1439
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...Parts of the Carolinas into northeast GA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 459...

Valid 252040Z - 252215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 459
continues.

SUMMARY...The damaging wind threat may gradually increase into the
early evening. Isolated hail also remains possible.

DISCUSSION...Extensive convection is ongoing late this afternoon
across parts of eastern NC, with additional storms in western NC,
and developing cumulus into parts of SC and east-central/northeast
GA. Additional storm development is possible into early evening,
within a very unstable (MLCAPE of 3000-4000 J/kg) environment.
Generally weak deep-layer shear continue to hamper storm
organization, but the strong instability and steep midlevel lapse
rates will continue to support vigorous updrafts. 

Outflow is gradually expanding across eastern NC, and there may be
some tendency for a loosely organized storm cluster to propagate
south/southwestward with time, as outflow impinges upon a hot and
very moist environment. A similar evolution could take place with
ongoing storms across western NC. This could lead to more
concentrated areas of damaging wind with time. The strongest
updrafts will also continue to be capable of producing isolated
hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 1438
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...FL Panhandle into south GA and far southeast AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 251958Z - 252200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Additional storm development is possible through late
afternoon, with a continued threat of damaging wind and isolated
hail.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered storms are ongoing this afternoon
across the FL Panhandle into southwest GA, with additional cumulus
development noted northeast of the ongoing convection. Relatively
steep lapse rates and cool temperatures aloft are supporting strong
to extreme buoyancy, with MLCAPE generally in the 3000-4000 J/kg
range. Deep-layer flow is rather weak, though modest midlevel
northeasterlies on the periphery of an upper ridge will support
20-25 kt of effective shear through the afternoon, which may support
modest storm organization given the very favorable instability. 

Potential will continue this afternoon for southwestward moving
clusters capable of damaging downburst/outflow winds and isolated
hail. There is some potential for loosely organized outflow-driven
clusters to develop, which could produce more concentrated areas of
wind damage, though this scenario remains somewhat uncertain. 

Uncertainty regarding severe coverage renders the need for
short-term watch issuance uncertain, but trends will be monitored
for an uptick in coverage through the remainder of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1437
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0216 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Areas affected...central and northeastern Nebraska...parts of
southeastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 251916Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A corridor of increasing thunderstorm development,
including gradually organizing clusters with increasing potential
for strong to severe surface gusts, through 4-6 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of one low-amplitude short-wavelength
perturbation migrating through the Upper Midwest toward adjacent
Great Lakes vicinity, a similar strength perturbation is gradually
migrating north-northeastward through the central high plains,
around the northwestern periphery of the prominent mid-level ridge
centered over the Tennessee Valley.  Downstream of this feature,
forcing for ascent has maintained an arcing band of precipitation
across Nebraska, which is preceded by a seasonably high moisture
content boundary-layer that is destabilizing beneath relatively warm
and dry layers aloft associated with the ridging.

Within the strengthening zone of differential surface heating to the
east of the precipitation band, mixed-layer CAPE is beginning to
increase in excess of 2000 J/kg, beneath a modest belt of
southwesterly mid-level flow which includes speeds of 30-40 kt in
the 700-500 mb layer.  Although mid/upper-level lapse rates are
weak, as low-level lapse rates continue to steepen and inhibition
erodes further, a corridor of increasing thunderstorm development
appears probable across Nebraska, from the Lexington NE toward Sioux
City IA vicinity, through 21-23Z.  As this occurs, heavy
precipitation loading and evaporative cooling in downdrafts may
gradually contribute to downward momentum transfer accompanied by
increasing potential for a few strong to severe severe gusts, in
slowly organizing clusters.

  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon from 315 PM until Midnight
  EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 75 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A very moist and unstable air mass is in place across the
watch area this afternoon.  Scattered thunderstorms will develop,
tracking slowly southwestward through the evening.  Damaging wind
gusts and some hail are possible in the more intense cores.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 90
statute miles north and south of a line from 40 miles east northeast
of Fayetteville NC to 20 miles northwest of Athens GA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
02025.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Valid 252000Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA...CENTRAL AND NORTHERN SOUTH CAROLINA...AND
EASTERN GEORGIA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST
COLORADO INTO PARTS OF IOWA...MINNESOTA...AND WISCONSIN...

...SUMMARY...
Severe wind gusts are expected from parts of the Carolinas into the
Southeast, with widely scattered strong to severe storms possible
from the northern/central High Plains eastward to the Mid Atlantic.

...20Z Update...
The primary change with this update was the addition of 5-percent
tornado probabilities along the warm front in southeast MN,
northeast IA, and far west-central WI. Here, a moist boundary layer
(lower 70s dewpoints) is gradually destabilizing amid diurnal
heating within cloud breaks. This continued destabilization and
clockwise-curved low-level hodographs (sampled by ARX/MPX VWPs)
should support a locally favorable corridor for a couple supercell
tornadoes -- especially with additional strengthening of the
low-level jet. For details on the severe risks in the Southeast and
central Plains, see Severe Thunderstorm Watches 459 and 460.

..Weinman.. 06/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1125 AM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025/

...Southeast US...
An unusually favorable thermodynamic pattern has evolved across the
southeast US today, with very steep mid-level lapse rates, cool
temperatures aloft, and strong daytime heating.  Surface dewpoints
in the 70s will yield afternoon MLCAPE values over 3500 J/kg.

Large scale forcing is weak, suggesting convective initiation will
be poorly focused.  However, most 12z CAM solutions show several
clusters of storms through the afternoon spreading southward from NC
into SC and eastern GA.  Vertical shear is rather weak, suggesting
storms will be rather disorganized.  However, there is a conditional
risk for an active day across the ENH risk, with considerable
coverage of damaging wind reports possible.  As storms spread
southwestward this evening across GA, the risk of locally damaging
wind gusts will continue.

...NE/IA/MN...
Visible satellite imagery shows a developing differential heating
zone extending from south-central NE into central IA.  Full sun to
the south of this zone will lead to strong instability and scattered
afternoon thunderstorm development.  A band of 30-40 knot
southwesterly flow aloft atop this zone, coupled with strengthening
southerly low-level winds, will encourage organized/bowing clusters
of storms capable of damaging winds and some hail.  A tornado or two
cannot be ruled out.

...CO/KS...
Thunderstorms will once again develop off the higher terrain of
CO/WY this afternoon and spread into the Plains.  Model guidance
suggests steep low-level lapse rates and sufficient CAPE for severe
wind potential as these storms track toward northwest KS/southwest
NE by early evening.

...OH/WV...
Hot and humid conditions are present today across much of southern
OH into northern WV.  Visible satellite imagery shows a developing
CU field, which may result in scattered slow-moving afternoon
thunderstorms.  Winds aloft are rather weak, but the strongest cells
in this corridor may be capable of locally damaging wind gusts.

..Thornton.. 06/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0110 AM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns should remain limited across the country on
Thursday, though localized elevated conditions may emerge across
portions of the Great Basin. Zonal mid-level flow is forecast to
increase across the Pacific Northwest/northern Great Basin through
the day Thursday. This will promote more expansive downslope flow
out of the western Great Basin with widespread RH reductions into
the low to mid teens across NV and into western UT/AZ. Despite
widespread dry conditions and receptive fuels across much of the
region, a modest low-level mass response will modulate surface winds
for most locations. Some deterministic solutions hint that areas of
15-20 mph winds are possible across northern NV into western UT and
southern ID, but ensemble guidance shows a weak signal for sustained
winds above 15 mph, which suggests that elevated conditions that do
emerge will likely remain transient and/or localized.

0218 PM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER MUCH OF THE
NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms producing large hail and locally damaging winds are
forecast over parts of the northern Plains late on Friday. Sporadic
damaging gusts may also occur over parts of the Mid Atlantic and
Southeast.

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level trough will shift east across the northern Rockies
on Friday with strengthening mid-level flow overspreading the
northern Plains. This will result in lee troughing from the Canadian
Prairies to the central High Plains. A moist environment will be in
place east of this trough with dewpoints in the 60s.

...Northern Plains...
Moderate to potentially strong instability is forecast across the
northern Plains on Friday with temperatures near 80 and dewpoints in
the 60s. Strengthening mid-level flow should result in ample shear
for supercells by Friday afternoon/evening as ascent increases
across the northern Plains. Significant hail and severe wind gusts
will be the primary threat from this activity. A strengthening/moist
low-level jet may support supercell maintenance through the evening
and perhaps into the overnight period. Even if diurnal storms
dissipate, additional overnight elevated storms are likely across
portions of eastern North Dakota and northern Minnesota amid
strengthening isentropic ascent. 

...Mid Atlantic to the Southeast...
Moderate instability is expected to develop across much of the
eastern CONUS on Friday. Instability is not expected to be as strong
as mid-level temperatures will be warmer after Day 1/2 convection
across the region. However, a pocket of relatively cooler air aloft
will exist across the Southeast and into the central Appalachians
and Mid-Atlantic which will support some threat for stronger storms
capable of damaging wind gusts.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE GREAT LAKES...FROM THE MID-ATLANTIC TO
THE SOUTHEAST...AND INTO FLORIDA...AND ACROSS NORTHERN MONTANA...

CORRECTED FOR INCORRECT GRAPHIC

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong storms are possible from the central Plains to
Lower Michigan, over parts of the Southeast, and over parts of
Montana on Thursday. Scattered damaging gusts appears to be the main
concern.

...Synopsis...
A weak upper low will remain over Florida tomorrow, with relatively
cool midlevel temperatures over the Southeast, although warmer
compared to today. Otherwise, much of the east will remain beneath
an upper ridge. Around the northern periphery of this ridge, modest
southwest flow aloft will stretch from the central Plains into the
Great Lakes and Northeast, with relatively warm temperatures aloft.
To the west, a low-amplitude upper trough will push east across
Montana.

At the surface, an expansive area of moisture will persist from the
central and southern Plains eastward to the Mid Atlantic, south of a
cold front. This front will extend from KS into southern WI and
Lower MI, and also from central NY into eastern PA.

...Mid Atlantic to the Southeast...
A broad area of moderate to strong instability is forecast from the
Mid-Atlantic to the Southeast on Thursday. Shear is expected to be
very weak through the period, but moderate to strong instability and
relatively steep mid-level lapse rates beneath the upper low will
provide a thermodynamic environment favorable for some damaging wind
gusts. More focused areas of strong to severe storms may exist near
outflow boundaries from D1/Wednesday convection.

...Central/Southern Plains to the Great Lakes...
Moderate to strong instability is forecast to develop along a
frontal zone from Kansas to Wisconsin on Thursday afternoon/evening.
Shear is expected to remain weak (20 to 25 knots), but strong
instability will support the threat for some damaging wind gusts.
Farther south, across western Oklahoma, shear will be very weak, but
moderate instability and deep mixing (to around 600mb) will support
some threat for downbursts and isolated wind gusts. 

...Montana...
Moderate mid-level flow is expected to overspread northern Montana
on Thursday where a deeply mixed boundary layer (deeper than 3km) is
forecast. While instability should be limited by meager moisture, it
should be sufficient for a few storms. Moderate shear (25 to 30
knots) and a deeply mixed boundary layer will support a threat for
some severe wind gusts Thursday afternoon/evening.

across parts of the Four Corners region. 

...Northwest Nevada...
Early-morning water-vapor imagery reveals a weakening upper trough
across the Great Basin. This feature is expected to continue
de-amplifying over the next 24 hours as it migrates northeast into
the northern Plains. In its wake, increasing zonal flow over the
northern Sierra Nevada should promote increasing downslope winds
through the afternoon. Sustained winds in the upper teens are likely
for a small swath of northwest NV and adjacent portions of CA and
OR, though occasional gusts into the 20-25 mph range appear
plausible. RH reductions into the teens to low 20s are expected, and
should support at least a few hours of elevated fire weather
conditions. ERC values near the 80th percentile will also help
support a low-end fire weather concern.

...Four Corners...
The weakening and departure of the upper trough will result in
weakening low-level winds across the southern Great Basin/Four
Corners where fuels remain very dry per recent ERC analyses. As
afternoon RH falls into the teens, localized areas of elevated
conditions appear possible across northern AZ into eastern UT where
terrain influences can support 15-20 mph winds. However, this
potential should remain sufficiently limited to preclude highlights.

Day 1 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CDT Wed Jun 25 2025

Valid 251630Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA...CENTRAL AND NORTHERN SOUTH CAROLINA...AND
EASTERN GEORGIA....

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST
COLORADO INTO PARTS OF IOWA AND MINNESOTA....

CORRECTED FOR NDFD GRID ERROR IN SC

...SUMMARY...
Severe wind gusts are possible from parts of the Carolinas into the
Southeast, with widely scattered strong to severe storms possible
from the northern High Plains eastward to the Mid Atlantic.

...Southeast US...
An unusually favorable thermodynamic pattern has evolved across the
southeast US today, with very steep mid-level lapse rates, cool
temperatures aloft, and strong daytime heating.  Surface dewpoints
in the 70s will yield afternoon MLCAPE values over 3500 J/kg.

Large scale forcing is weak, suggesting convective initiation will
be poorly focused.  However, most 12z CAM solutions show several
clusters of storms through the afternoon spreading southward from NC
into SC and eastern GA.  Vertical shear is rather weak, suggesting
storms will be rather disorganized.  However, there is a conditional
risk for an active day across the ENH risk, with considerable
coverage of damaging wind reports possible.  As storms spread
southwestward this evening across GA, the risk of locally damaging
wind gusts will continue.

...NE/IA/MN...
Visible satellite imagery shows a developing differential heating
zone extending from south-central NE into central IA.  Full sun to
the south of this zone will lead to strong instability and scattered
afternoon thunderstorm development.  A band of 30-40 knot
southwesterly flow aloft atop this zone, coupled with strengthening
southerly low-level winds, will encourage organized/bowing clusters
of storms capable of damaging winds and some hail.  A tornado or two
cannot be ruled out.

...CO/KS...
Thunderstorms will once again develop off the higher terrain of
CO/WY this afternoon and spread into the Plains.  Model guidance
suggests steep low-level lapse rates and sufficient CAPE for severe
wind potential as these storms track toward northwest KS/southwest
NE by early evening.

...OH/WV...
Hot and humid conditions are present today across much of southern
OH into northern WV.  Visible satellite imagery shows a developing
CU field, which may result in scattered slow-moving afternoon
thunderstorms.  Winds aloft are rather weak, but the strongest cells
in this corridor may be capable of locally damaging wind gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1429
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of extreme northwest Pennsylvania into
extreme western New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 242049Z - 242315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A couple of damaging gusts cannot be ruled out over the
next several hours. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...A few thunderstorms have initiated and intensified off
of surface boundaries and confluence zones over the past couple of
hours. Deep-layer flow and shear, as well as buoyancy, are modest at
best across the region (e.g. 1000 J/kg MLCAPE amid less than 20 kts
of effective bulk shear). As such, a couple of brief downbursts may
cause sparse tree damage in the near-term. Relatively more robust
storms are currently tracking across extreme southeast Ontario.
These storms may cross Lake Erie a few hours for now, perhaps with a
slightly greater damaging gust threat. Nonetheless, the severe
threat should remain localized, precluding the need for a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 261200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
An weak upper-level trough will move across the Pacific Northwest 
Day 3/Thursday into the Great Lakes by Day 7/Monday. An amplifying
ridge across the Intermountain West early next week will promote
lighter surface winds but well above normal temperatures for much of
the Western U.S. Weak troughing will remain off the West Coast, with
potential for locally breezy conditions and mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms.

...Day 3-6/Thursday-Sunday...
Generally weak upper flow with the western trough will promote
lighter, mainly terrain driven winds across much of the
Intermountain West and Southwest late this week, into early next
week. A few hours of Elevated to locally Critical conditions will be
possible across portions of the Columbia Basin into the Snake River
Plain in Idaho on D3/Thursday and D4/Friday.

...Day 7/Monday - Day 8/Tuesday...
A weak trough will push the western ridge eastward across the Divide
and Rockies early next week. There is some potential for increasing 
winds but also moisture for thunderstorms across the Pacific
Northwest. For now, confidence in moisture and position of the
trough remains too low to include probabilities.

Mesoscale Discussion 1420
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern/eastern Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455...

Valid 232036Z - 232230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455
continues.

SUMMARY...Another small, organized cluster of storms posing a risk
for damaging wind gusts may evolve east of La Crosse toward the
Oshkosh vicinity through 5-7 PM CDT, along outflow trailing the lead
cluster now spreading south through southeast of Green Bay.

DISCUSSION...One small, organized convective cluster, with an
embedded meso-beta scale cyclonic circulation, has already evolved
and produced a narrow corridor of severe and/or damaging gusts near
and east of the Wisconsin Rapids area.  This may continue near/south
and southeast of the Green Bay vicinity, before diminishing while
spreading into Lake Michigan within the next hour or so.

Meanwhile, thunderstorm activity now forming upstream may undergo a
similar evolution along the trailing outflow from the lead cluster, 
east of La Crosse toward the Oshkosh vicinity during the next couple
of hours. Inhibition has become increasingly negligible in the
presence of peak heating, with latest mesoanalysis indicating CAPE
on the order of 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of at least modest
shear beneath 40+ kt westerly 500 mb flow.

Mesoscale Discussion 1418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of northwestern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232008Z - 232245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered strong to severe storms, including a
supercell or two, may cross the St. Lawrence Valley and at least
approach parts of northwestern Maine prior to 8 PM EDT, accompanied
by the risk for large hail and potential for a tornado.  Although it
still appears unlikely that a severe weather watch will be needed,
trends will continue to be monitored for this possibility.

DISCUSSION...Near/just ahead of a mid-level perturbation associated
with a now dissipated thunderstorm cluster, isolated supercell
development appears underway across parts of southeastern Quebec,
roughly 100 miles or so to the northwest of Quebec City.  Activity
appears to be forming just to the south of a warm frontal zone,
where surface dew points are near 70 F, and low-level hodographs
have become sizable beneath 30 kt west-southwesterly flow around 850
mb.

This is occurring beneath 40-50 kt west-northwesterly 500 mb flow,
around the northeastern periphery of the prominent mid-level high
centered near the southern Appalachians, contributing to a
southeastward propagation toward the St. Lawrence Valley, near
Quebec City.  Additional thunderstorm development appears possible
over the next few hours in closer proximity to the frontal zone to
the north.  

East of the St. Lawrence Valley, into northern New England, warming
and moistening of the boundary layer is ongoing along and south of
the northward developing warm frontal zone.  Forecast soundings from
the Rapid Refresh suggest that this may include surface dew points
increasing to near or above 70 F, in the presence of enlarging,
clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, across parts of northwestern
Maine prior to 00Z.  Although the onset of nightfall contributes to
some uncertainty concerning the extent of boundary-layer
destabilization, there appears at least some potential for the
maintenance of supercells posing a risk for severe hail, and
potential for a tornado or two.

Mesoscale Discussion 1417
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...portions of central Kansas into far southeast
Nebraska and southwestern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231934Z - 232200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in severe potential may occur if more robust
thunderstorm development can take place along the cold front. Strong
to potentially severe wind gusts would be the main hazard.
Convective trends are being monitored for the need of a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A line of thunderstorms has developed across eastern NE
in a post-cold-frontal regime. Within the last hour, convection has
tried to deepen along the KS/NE border, closer to the cold front,
and where greater buoyancy resides. Deep-layer shear is modest at
best (e.g. 30 kts), and is lagging the cold front. While vertical
wind shear is limited, 7-8 C/km boundary-layer lapse rates atop 70+
F surface dewpoints is contributing to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE in a weakly
capped environment. While storms should be mainly pulse-cellular or
multicellular, any cold-pool mergers that occur with the more
intense storms may support strong to severe gusts. Convective trends
are being monitored for further increases in coverage or intensity
that would warrant a Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1406
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...southwest to northeast NE and southeast SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 221959Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind/hail threats will increase as a corridor of
scattered thunderstorms form ahead of a dryline, along a slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is
expected.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus development is underway along the slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front that arcs across southeast SD into
southwest NE, ahead of a dryline that has mixed across northwest KS
and far southwest NE. Initial storm development should occur ahead
of the dryline/front intersection into central NE where MLCIN is
minimized, with additional storms rippling north-northeast along the
front by early evening. Nearly unidirectional south-southwesterlies
and uniform speeds with height will curtail overall effective bulk
shear. But this should help enhance growth into multicell clusters
favorable for producing sporadic severe gusts. Severe hail potential
may largely be confined to initial storm formation.

Mesoscale Discussion 1405
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern New Mexico into western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221950Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for a few instances of severe wind/hail will
increase through the afternoon. The severe threat should be isolated
enough to preclude a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have recently shown an uptick in
intensity across portions of central NM into the TX Trans Pecos,
with a cell in Lincoln County, NM showing 40 dBZ echoes at 50 kft.
MLCINH is eroding due to strong diurnal heating, which is promoting
robust boundary-layer mixing, with 0-3 km lapse rates already
approaching the 9-10 C/km range in spots (per 19Z mesoanalysis).
Additional storms should continue to develop and intensify this
afternoon given persistent diurnal heating, with MLCAPE likely
exceeding 1000 J/kg. Vertical shear will be weak, and given marginal
MLCAPE, most storms should be pulse cellular or weakly
multicellular. Given steep low-level lapse rates, rapid evaporative
cooling with stronger storm cores may result in severe gusts and
perhaps a brief instance of hail. Since the severe threat should be
isolated, a WW issuance is not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1404
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...northwest MN and eastern ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 221934Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...The tornado threat with a few supercells will increase
during the late afternoon to early evening as surface-based storms
develop across the Red River Valley through northwest Minnesota. A
tornado watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery is occurring across the Red River
Valley and northwest Minnesota in the wake of earlier elevated
thunderstorms. While another round of elevated thunderstorms has
formed well west into the post-frontal airmass across central ND,
this lobe of large-scale ascent will overspread the downstream
surface front and trough in the next couple hours. 19Z mesoanalysis
suggests that MLCIN has weakened. Surface-based thunderstorm
development by 21-22Z is likely. 

Weak easterly components to the low-level flow between the surface
front and trough will support favorable hodograph curvature as flow
veers to the south and south-southwest aloft. In conjunction with
optimal temperature-dew point spreads, a corridor of supercell
tornado potential is anticipated. Otherwise, large hail and isolated
severe gusts will be possible as storms likely become confined
closer to the international border this evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1400
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0724 AM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern ND...northeast SD...western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 221224Z - 221400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe storms are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection is ongoing this morning from
east-central ND into northeast SD. This convection is being aided by
a low-amplitude midlevel shortwave trough moving quickly
northeastward toward northern MN. Midlevel lapse rates are quite
steep (as observed on the 12Z MPX sounding), and recent objective
mesoanalyses depict a corridor of very strong MUCAPE (3000-4000
J/kg) from eastern ND into northwest MN, near and north of a surface
boundary that will move north as a warm front with time today.
Ongoing convection could intensify as it moves into this corridor.
Deep-layer shear is also stronger with northern extent, and could
help to increase storm organization with time this morning.

Large hail and localized severe gusts may accompany these storms as
they move northeastward. The large buoyancy and steep lapse rates
will support a conditional threat of very large hail if any elevated
supercells can become established. Coverage of the severe threat
this morning is uncertain, making the need for short-term watch
issuance unclear. A more extensive severe threat is still expected
across parts of this region later today.
