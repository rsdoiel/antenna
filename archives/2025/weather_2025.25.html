Mesoscale Discussion 1429
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Areas affected...portions of extreme northwest Pennsylvania into
extreme western New York

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 242049Z - 242315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A couple of damaging gusts cannot be ruled out over the
next several hours. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...A few thunderstorms have initiated and intensified off
of surface boundaries and confluence zones over the past couple of
hours. Deep-layer flow and shear, as well as buoyancy, are modest at
best across the region (e.g. 1000 J/kg MLCAPE amid less than 20 kts
of effective bulk shear). As such, a couple of brief downbursts may
cause sparse tree damage in the near-term. Relatively more robust
storms are currently tracking across extreme southeast Ontario.
These storms may cross Lake Erie a few hours for now, perhaps with a
slightly greater damaging gust threat. Nonetheless, the severe
threat should remain localized, precluding the need for a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 458
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
105 PM MDT Tue Jun 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 105 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will develop northeastward out of the
foothills into the adjacent Plains this afternoon.  A few intense
storms capable of large hail and damaging winds are expected.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 40
statute miles east and west of a line from 60 miles north northwest
of Akron CO to 30 miles southeast of Colorado Springs CO. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24025.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 242000Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING OVER THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS AND SEPARATELY OVER PARTS OF
THE NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Large hail and severe wind gusts are likely this afternoon and
evening in parts of the central and northern High Plains. Damaging
wind gusts are also expected across parts of northern New York into
Vermont this afternoon.

...20Z Update...
The primary change with this update was the addition of a Slight
Risk (driven by 15-percent wind probabilities) over parts of
northern NY into northern VT. Here, temperatures have warmed into
the upper 80s/lower 90s amid upper 60s/lower 70s dewpoints --
contributing to moderate-strong surface-based instability. As storms
continue tracking/developing eastward into northern NY, around 40 kt
of deep-layer shear accompanying a glancing midlevel speed maximum
should promote several small/loosely organized storm clusters
capable of producing damaging wind gusts through this afternoon. For
details on the severe risk in the central High Plains, reference
Severe Thunderstorm Watch 458.

..Weinman.. 06/24/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1111 AM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025/

...High Plains...
Deep east-southeasterly upslope flow is present this morning across
the High Plains of WY/CO.  Surface dewpoints in the mid-upper 50s,
coupled with thinning clouds and strong afternoon heating will yield
a corridor of moderate CAPE across much of eastern WY and
northeast/east-central CO.  Thunderstorms are expected to initiate
off the higher terrain by early afternoon and spread northeastward
with risk of large hail and damaging wind gusts for several hours.  

...Lower MI/Northern IN/OH...
A weak surface cold front extends across southern Lower MI today,
with dewpoints in the low-mid 70s to the south of the boundary. 
This air mass is heating rapidly and should become very unstable,
leading to scattered afternoon thunderstorms.  Hot surface
temperatures and steep low-level lapse rates will promote
gusty/damaging wind gusts in the strongest cells.

...TN/NC/VA Mountains...
A hot and humid surface air mass is in place today over the
mountains of east TN, western NC, and southern VA.  This should lead
to widely scattered thunderstorm development.  Winds aloft are weak,
but steep low-mid level lapse rates, ample dry air aloft, and
considerable CAPE will promote strong downdrafts and small hail in
the strongest cells.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 261200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
An weak upper-level trough will move across the Pacific Northwest 
Day 3/Thursday into the Great Lakes by Day 7/Monday. An amplifying
ridge across the Intermountain West early next week will promote
lighter surface winds but well above normal temperatures for much of
the Western U.S. Weak troughing will remain off the West Coast, with
potential for locally breezy conditions and mix of wet/dry
thunderstorms.

...Day 3-6/Thursday-Sunday...
Generally weak upper flow with the western trough will promote
lighter, mainly terrain driven winds across much of the
Intermountain West and Southwest late this week, into early next
week. A few hours of Elevated to locally Critical conditions will be
possible across portions of the Columbia Basin into the Snake River
Plain in Idaho on D3/Thursday and D4/Friday.

...Day 7/Monday - Day 8/Tuesday...
A weak trough will push the western ridge eastward across the Divide
and Rockies early next week. There is some potential for increasing 
winds but also moisture for thunderstorms across the Pacific
Northwest. For now, confidence in moisture and position of the
trough remains too low to include probabilities.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0216 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES...FROM THE
MID-ATLANTIC TO THE SOUTHEAST...AND NORTHEAST MONTANA VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong storms are possible from the central Plains to
Lower Michigan, over parts of the Southeast, and over parts of
Montana on Thursday. Scattered damaging gusts appears to be the main
concern.

...Synopsis...
Somewhat zonal flow is expected across the northern CONUS on Friday
with a broad ridge across much of the southern CONUS. A moderate
mid-level jet streak will move across Montana with relatively weak
flow across the remainder of the CONUS. A weak upper low will drift
slowly northeast across the southeastern CONUS. 

...Mid-Atlantic to the Southeast...
A broad area of moderate instability is forecast from the
Mid-Atlantic to the Southeast on Friday. Shear is expected to be
very weak through the period, but moderate instability and
relatively steep mid-level lapse rates beneath the upper low will
provide a thermodynamic environment favorable for some damaging wind
gusts. More focused areas of strong to severe storms may exist near
outflow boundaries from D2/Thursday convection. 

...Central Plains to the western Great Lakes...
Moderate to strong instability is forecast to develop along a
frontal zone from Kansas to Wisconsin on Friday afternoon/evening.
Shear is expected to remain weak (20 to 25 knots), but strong
instability will support the threat for some damaging wind gusts. 

...Northeast Montana Vicinity...
Moderate mid-level flow is expected to overspread northeast Montana
on Friday where a deeply mixed boundary layer (above 3km) is
forecast. While instability will not be that great due to limited
moisture, it should be sufficient for a few storms. Moderate shear
(25 to 30 knots) and a deeply mixed boundary layer will support a
threat for some severe wind gusts Friday afternoon/evening.

0143 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed to the D2 Fire Weather Outlook. See previous
discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 06/24/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0100 AM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain fairly localized on
Wednesday across the country. The upper trough currently migrating
into the lower Colorado River Valley is expected to begin
de-amplifying and drifting into the northern Rockies through the day
Wednesday. This will weaken winds across much of the Four
Corners/central Rockies where dry/breezy conditions have been
prevalent for the past several days. Little moisture recovery is
anticipated, so areas that typically see terrain-enhanced winds may
experience periods of elevated fire weather conditions Wednesday
afternoon. Currently, this appears most probable from northeast AZ
into eastern UT, but confidence in the coverage/duration of elevated
conditions is too limited for highlights. 

Further to the west, zonal flow over the northern Sierra Nevada is
expected to increase as the weakening upper trough departs the Great
Basin. This will promote a downslope flow regime across northeast NV
and adjacent portions of CA and OR. Model guidance continues to show
uncertainty regarding the strength of the downslope winds and
potential for fire weather concerns. More aggressive solutions hint
that areas of elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
are possible. Regardless, ERCs near or below the 80th percentile
should help modulate a more robust fire weather

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 PM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE CAROLINAS
TO THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe wind gusts are possible over much of the Southeast, with
widely scattered strong to severe storms possible from the northern
High Plains eastward toward the Mid Atlantic.

...Synopsis...
The CONUS pattern will feature a trough across the western CONUS and
a strong ridge across the eastern CONUS Wednesday morning. This
pattern will deamplify during the period. A strong mid-level jet
streak will extend from northern Ontario to the Northeast with a
weak upper-low over Florida. A mid-level shortwave trough will move
from the central Plains to the western Great Lakes Wednesday
afternoon/evening. 

...Central/northern High Plains...
A weak lee trough will extend from southeast Montana to northeast
Colorado. Weak to moderate instability will develop along this zone
during the afternoon and evening. Shear will be modest (25-30 knots)
with a few multicell clusters possible. Isolated large hail and
isolated severe wind gusts will be the primary hazards. 

...Midwest into the western Great Lakes...
Moderate to strong instability is expected to develop south of a
warm front across the Midwest. A belt of 50+ knot mid-level flow is
forecast to overspread the warm sector and provide sufficient shear
for storm organization. In addition, some stronger low-level shear
will develop as a low-level jet strengthens during the
afternoon/evening. The stronger/more organized storms in the area
could have some tornado threat, particularly if any backed flow can
develop. At this time, the threat is expected too low for higher
severe weather probabilities. 

...Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic...
Additional storms are likely to develop within a moderate to
strongly unstable environment along a frontal zone from the Midwest
to the Mid-Atlantic. Shear will be mostly weak which should limit
the overall threat. However, strong instability and a very moist
environment may support some threat for wet microbursts. 

...Carolinas into the Southeast...
Extreme instability is expected to develop from the Carolinas into
the Southeast amid mid to upper 70s dewpoints and temperatures in
the 90s. This extreme instability and scattered to widespread storm
development should be sufficient for a damaging wind threat. In
addition, stronger mid-level northeasterly flow is expected across
the eastern Carolinas into southern Georgia. This may result in even
greater storm organization and clustering where the stronger shear
is present. Some large hail is possible with damaging wind gusts as
the primary threat. 

...Florida...
Cool temperatures aloft and moderate to potentially strong
instability is expected to develop across the Florida Panhandle on
Wednesday. Shear is forecast around 20 to 25 knots which may result
in a few multicell clusters capable of damaging wind gusts. The
greater threat should be mostly focused on the west coast where the
sea-breeze convergence is stronger and shear is slightly greater
amid westerly low-level flow.

discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 06/24/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1251 AM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected again today across
parts of the Four Corners and Intermountain West. Early-morning
water-vapor imagery reveals an upper low migrating into the lower
Colorado River Valley. This feature is expected to meander across
the southern Great Basin through the day with a belt of modest
(20-40 knot) southwesterly mid-level flow extending from northern AZ
into southern WY. Under this speed max, dry conditions persist
across the region with afternoon RH minimums in the teens expected.
Although surface pressure gradient winds will likely only remain in
the mid teens, frequent gusts between 20-35 mph are expected as
ample diurnal heating drives deep boundary-layer mixing. Fuels
across the region remain supportive of fire spread given recent fire
activity and no appreciable rainfall over the past 1-2 weeks. 

...Dry Thunderstorms - Northeast Nevada...
Cold temperatures aloft associated with the southern Great Basin
upper low, coupled with a modest influx of mid-level moisture and
deep boundary-layer mixing, will promote isolated weak thunderstorms
across portions of northeast NV. Thermodynamic profiles are typical
of dry thunderstorm environments; however, slow storm motions (less
than 10 knots) will promote wetting rainfall under the convective
cores. Isolated dry lightning strikes on the periphery of heavier
precipitation is possible, but confidence in a robust dry
thunderstorm threat remains limited.

Valid 241630Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING OVER THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Storms associated with large hail and severe wind gusts will be
likely this afternoon and evening in parts of the central and
northern High Plains. Marginally severe storms will be possible this
afternoon from part of the central Plains eastward into the
Northeast - and in the mountains of Tennessee, North Carolina, and
southern Virginia.

...High Plains...
Deep east-southeasterly upslope flow is present this morning across
the High Plains of WY/CO.  Surface dewpoints in the mid-upper 50s,
coupled with thinning clouds and strong afternoon heating will yield
a corridor of moderate CAPE across much of eastern WY and
northeast/east-central CO.  Thunderstorms are expected to initiate
off the higher terrain by early afternoon and spread northeastward
with risk of large hail and damaging wind gusts for several hours.  

...Lower MI/Northern IN/OH...
A weak surface cold front extends across southern Lower MI today,
with dewpoints in the low-mid 70s to the south of the boundary. 
This air mass is heating rapidly and should become very unstable,
leading to scattered afternoon thunderstorms.  Hot surface
temperatures and steep low-level lapse rates will promote
gusty/damaging wind gusts in the strongest cells.

...TN/NC/VA Mountains...
A hot and humid surface air mass is in place today over the
mountains of east TN, western NC, and southern VA.  This should lead
to widely scattered thunderstorm development.  Winds aloft are weak,
but steep low-mid level lapse rates, ample dry air aloft, and
considerable CAPE will promote strong downdrafts and small hail in
the strongest cells.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0738 AM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 241300Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Storms associated with very large hail and severe wind gusts will be
likely this afternoon and evening in parts of the central and
northern High Plains. Marginally severe storms will be possible this
afternoon from part of the central and northern Plains eastward into
the Northeast.

...Synopsis...
Early morning satellite imagery shows an expansive upper ridge over
much of the eastern CONUS, and upper troughing across the Great
Basin vicinity. A northern-stream shortwave trough currently over SK
is forecast to progress quickly eastward through MB and ON, leading
to some dampening of the eastern CONUS ridge. Several convectively
augmented vorticity maxima are also expected to move through the
northern and central High Plains ahead of the more substantial
shortwave trough moving across the Great Basin. This evolution will
lead to some dampening of the northwestern periphery of this ridge
as well. 

Like the upper pattern, the surface pattern is currently dominated
by eastern CONUS ridging, with an ill-defined frontal zone between
the warm and moist airmass under the ridge and a more continental
airmass across the northern Plains and Upper MS Valley. Recent
surface analysis places a low over western KS with a stationary
boundary extending northeastward from this low to another low over
WI. A more progressive cold front extends northeastward from the WI
low through central ON. The moist airmass (i.e. dewpoints in the
70s) south of this boundary will destabilize with daytime heating,
and scattered thunderstorm development is anticipated amid modest
low-level convergence during the afternoon from the central Plains
through the Great Lakes region into the Northeast. Vertical shear
will be weak, limiting storm strength/organization and contributing
to an outflow-dominant storm mode. Damaging gusts will be possible
with any of the stronger line segments. Greater severe potential is
expected across the northern and central High Plains (discussed
below).

...Northern/Central High Plains...
Post-frontal southeasterly upslope flow is anticipated across the
region today, helping to offset diurnal mixing and keep dewpoints in
the upper 50s/low 60s this afternoon. The increased low-level
moisture and strong heating will foster airmass destabilization by
the early afternoon, with scattered to numerous thunderstorm
expected. Initiation is expected over the higher terrain before then
moving northeastward into the lower elevations. Vertical shear will
be strong enough to support supercells initially capable of
producing large to very large hail. A trend towards more
outflow-dominant structures is anticipated with time, with one or
more line segments capable of strong to severe gusts developing.
This outflow-dominant character is forecast to limit the tornado
threat, but a locally enhanced threat may exist from southeast WY
into the southern NE Panhandle and far northeast CO where the best
overlap between low-level moisture and southeasterly surface winds
is expected.

...Southern Rockies...
Increasing low to mid-level moisture will support numerous to
widespread thunderstorms across the southern Rockies today. Very
shear will be weak, promoting a mostly disorganized multicellular
mode.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 AM CDT Tue Jun 24 2025

Valid 271200Z - 021200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Models are in good agreement with the overall pattern through
Tuesday/D8, depicting a low-amplitude trough moving from the
northwestern states on Friday/D4 across the northern tier of states
and toward the Great Lakes by around Sunday/D6. This wave is then
forecast to amplify across Ontario/Quebec through the end of the
period, with cooler/more stable air pushing south with a cold front
from the Midwest into the Northeast.

Severe storms are currently forecast over parts of the Dakotas into
northwest MN on Friday/D4 as the stronger flow aloft interacts with
a moist and unstable air mass already in place. Damaging winds
appear the most likely mode of severe, along with sporadic large
hail as storms form during the afternoon within a surface trough,
and beneath increasing winds aloft. While severe storms may also
occur on Saturday/D5 over parts of the northern Plains or upper MS
Valley, predictability is lower given expected storms the previous
day and potential for long-lived convective systems. However, given
such strong instability forecast on Saturday/D5, a risk area is
likely to be issued in later outlook cycles over parts of the upper
Midwest/MS Valley.

Elsewhere, daily thunderstorms within the moist and unstable air
mass are forecast for the bulk of CONUS from the Plains eastward,
though in a generally weak shear environment. Portions of those
areas may see low/marginal probabilities as the events enter into
the Day 3 outlook time frame.

Mesoscale Discussion 1420
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern/eastern Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455...

Valid 232036Z - 232230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 455
continues.

SUMMARY...Another small, organized cluster of storms posing a risk
for damaging wind gusts may evolve east of La Crosse toward the
Oshkosh vicinity through 5-7 PM CDT, along outflow trailing the lead
cluster now spreading south through southeast of Green Bay.

DISCUSSION...One small, organized convective cluster, with an
embedded meso-beta scale cyclonic circulation, has already evolved
and produced a narrow corridor of severe and/or damaging gusts near
and east of the Wisconsin Rapids area.  This may continue near/south
and southeast of the Green Bay vicinity, before diminishing while
spreading into Lake Michigan within the next hour or so.

Meanwhile, thunderstorm activity now forming upstream may undergo a
similar evolution along the trailing outflow from the lead cluster, 
east of La Crosse toward the Oshkosh vicinity during the next couple
of hours. Inhibition has become increasingly negligible in the
presence of peak heating, with latest mesoanalysis indicating CAPE
on the order of 2000-3000 J/kg, in the presence of at least modest
shear beneath 40+ kt westerly 500 mb flow.

Mesoscale Discussion 1418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of northwestern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 232008Z - 232245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered strong to severe storms, including a
supercell or two, may cross the St. Lawrence Valley and at least
approach parts of northwestern Maine prior to 8 PM EDT, accompanied
by the risk for large hail and potential for a tornado.  Although it
still appears unlikely that a severe weather watch will be needed,
trends will continue to be monitored for this possibility.

DISCUSSION...Near/just ahead of a mid-level perturbation associated
with a now dissipated thunderstorm cluster, isolated supercell
development appears underway across parts of southeastern Quebec,
roughly 100 miles or so to the northwest of Quebec City.  Activity
appears to be forming just to the south of a warm frontal zone,
where surface dew points are near 70 F, and low-level hodographs
have become sizable beneath 30 kt west-southwesterly flow around 850
mb.

This is occurring beneath 40-50 kt west-northwesterly 500 mb flow,
around the northeastern periphery of the prominent mid-level high
centered near the southern Appalachians, contributing to a
southeastward propagation toward the St. Lawrence Valley, near
Quebec City.  Additional thunderstorm development appears possible
over the next few hours in closer proximity to the frontal zone to
the north.  

East of the St. Lawrence Valley, into northern New England, warming
and moistening of the boundary layer is ongoing along and south of
the northward developing warm frontal zone.  Forecast soundings from
the Rapid Refresh suggest that this may include surface dew points
increasing to near or above 70 F, in the presence of enlarging,
clockwise-curved low-level hodographs, across parts of northwestern
Maine prior to 00Z.  Although the onset of nightfall contributes to
some uncertainty concerning the extent of boundary-layer
destabilization, there appears at least some potential for the
maintenance of supercells posing a risk for severe hail, and
potential for a tornado or two.

Mesoscale Discussion 1417
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon Jun 23 2025

Areas affected...portions of central Kansas into far southeast
Nebraska and southwestern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231934Z - 232200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in severe potential may occur if more robust
thunderstorm development can take place along the cold front. Strong
to potentially severe wind gusts would be the main hazard.
Convective trends are being monitored for the need of a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A line of thunderstorms has developed across eastern NE
in a post-cold-frontal regime. Within the last hour, convection has
tried to deepen along the KS/NE border, closer to the cold front,
and where greater buoyancy resides. Deep-layer shear is modest at
best (e.g. 30 kts), and is lagging the cold front. While vertical
wind shear is limited, 7-8 C/km boundary-layer lapse rates atop 70+
F surface dewpoints is contributing to 3000 J/kg MLCAPE in a weakly
capped environment. While storms should be mainly pulse-cellular or
multicellular, any cold-pool mergers that occur with the more
intense storms may support strong to severe gusts. Convective trends
are being monitored for further increases in coverage or intensity
that would warrant a Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Clusters of storms, some with bowing characteristics, are
expected to increase in coverage and intensity through the afternoon
and persist into this evening.  Damaging winds of 60-70 mph will be
the main threat, though isolated large hail of 1-1.5 inches in
diameter may also occur with the strongest storms.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 70 miles northeast of
Escanaba MI to 55 miles south southwest of La Crosse WI. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
26035.

Mesoscale Discussion 1406
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...southwest to northeast NE and southeast SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 221959Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe wind/hail threats will increase as a corridor of
scattered thunderstorms form ahead of a dryline, along a slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is
expected.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus development is underway along the slow-moving
to quasi-stationary front that arcs across southeast SD into
southwest NE, ahead of a dryline that has mixed across northwest KS
and far southwest NE. Initial storm development should occur ahead
of the dryline/front intersection into central NE where MLCIN is
minimized, with additional storms rippling north-northeast along the
front by early evening. Nearly unidirectional south-southwesterlies
and uniform speeds with height will curtail overall effective bulk
shear. But this should help enhance growth into multicell clusters
favorable for producing sporadic severe gusts. Severe hail potential
may largely be confined to initial storm formation.

Mesoscale Discussion 1405
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern New Mexico into western Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221950Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...The risk for a few instances of severe wind/hail will
increase through the afternoon. The severe threat should be isolated
enough to preclude a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have recently shown an uptick in
intensity across portions of central NM into the TX Trans Pecos,
with a cell in Lincoln County, NM showing 40 dBZ echoes at 50 kft.
MLCINH is eroding due to strong diurnal heating, which is promoting
robust boundary-layer mixing, with 0-3 km lapse rates already
approaching the 9-10 C/km range in spots (per 19Z mesoanalysis).
Additional storms should continue to develop and intensify this
afternoon given persistent diurnal heating, with MLCAPE likely
exceeding 1000 J/kg. Vertical shear will be weak, and given marginal
MLCAPE, most storms should be pulse cellular or weakly
multicellular. Given steep low-level lapse rates, rapid evaporative
cooling with stronger storm cores may result in severe gusts and
perhaps a brief instance of hail. Since the severe threat should be
isolated, a WW issuance is not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1404
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...northwest MN and eastern ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 221934Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...The tornado threat with a few supercells will increase
during the late afternoon to early evening as surface-based storms
develop across the Red River Valley through northwest Minnesota. A
tornado watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Airmass recovery is occurring across the Red River
Valley and northwest Minnesota in the wake of earlier elevated
thunderstorms. While another round of elevated thunderstorms has
formed well west into the post-frontal airmass across central ND,
this lobe of large-scale ascent will overspread the downstream
surface front and trough in the next couple hours. 19Z mesoanalysis
suggests that MLCIN has weakened. Surface-based thunderstorm
development by 21-22Z is likely. 

Weak easterly components to the low-level flow between the surface
front and trough will support favorable hodograph curvature as flow
veers to the south and south-southwest aloft. In conjunction with
optimal temperature-dew point spreads, a corridor of supercell
tornado potential is anticipated. Otherwise, large hail and isolated
severe gusts will be possible as storms likely become confined
closer to the international border this evening.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0724 AM CDT Sun Jun 22 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern ND...northeast SD...western MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 221224Z - 221400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to locally severe storms are possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection is ongoing this morning from
east-central ND into northeast SD. This convection is being aided by
a low-amplitude midlevel shortwave trough moving quickly
northeastward toward northern MN. Midlevel lapse rates are quite
steep (as observed on the 12Z MPX sounding), and recent objective
mesoanalyses depict a corridor of very strong MUCAPE (3000-4000
J/kg) from eastern ND into northwest MN, near and north of a surface
boundary that will move north as a warm front with time today.
Ongoing convection could intensify as it moves into this corridor.
Deep-layer shear is also stronger with northern extent, and could
help to increase storm organization with time this morning.

Large hail and localized severe gusts may accompany these storms as
they move northeastward. The large buoyancy and steep lapse rates
will support a conditional threat of very large hail if any elevated
supercells can become established. Coverage of the severe threat
this morning is uncertain, making the need for short-term watch
issuance unclear. A more extensive severe threat is still expected
across parts of this region later today.
