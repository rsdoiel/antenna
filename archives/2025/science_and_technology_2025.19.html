removes support for the 486, and now I’m curious what that means for
Vortex86 processors</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>I had to dig through our extensive archive – OSNews was founded in
2007, after all – to see if we reported on it at the time, but it turns
out we didn’t: in 2006, Intel announced that in 2007, it would cease
production of a range of old chips, including the 386 and 486. In
Product Change Notification 106013-01, Intel proclaimed these chips
dead. Intel Corporation has been manufacturing its MCS 51, MCS 251 and
MCS 96 Microcontroller Product Lines for over 25 years now, and the
Intel 186 Processor Families, the Intel 386 Processor Families and the
Intel 486 Processor Families for over 15 years now. Additionally, we
have been manufacturing the i960 32 Bit RISC Processor Families for over
15 years. However, at this time, the forecasted volumes for these
product lines are now too low to continue production of these products
beyond the year 2007. Therefore, Intel will cease manufacturing silicon
wafers for our 6″ based processes in 2007. Affected products include
Intel’s MCS 51, MCS 251, MCS 96, 80X18X, 80X38X, 80X486DXX, the i960
Family of Microcomputers, in addition to the 82371SB, 82439TX and the
82439HX Chipsets. Intel has no choice but to issue a Product
Discontinuance Notice (PDN) effective 3/30/06. Last time orders will be
accepted till 3/30/07 with last time ship dates of 9/28/07. ↫ Intel
Product Change Notification 106013-01 Considering the 386, 486, and i960
families of processors were only used for niche embedded at very low
volumes at that point in time, it made sense to call it quits. We’re 18
years down the line now, and I don’t think anyone really mourns the end
of production for these processors. Windows ended support for these
chips well before the 2007 end of production date, with Windows 2000
being the last Windows version that would run on a 486, albeit only
barely, since it officially required a Pentium processor. Linux, though,
continued to support the 486, but that, too, is now coming to an end. In
a patch submitted to the LKML, Ingo Molnár, support for a variety of
“complicated hardware emulation facilities” for x86-32 will be removed,
effectively ending support for 486 and very early 586 processors, by
increasing the minimum kernel support features to include TSC and CX8
(CMPXCHG8B) hardware support. Linus Torvalds has expressed interest in
removing support for the 486 back in 2022, so this move doesn’t come as
a huge surprise. While most tech news outlets leave it at that, as I was
reading this news, I immediately thought of the Vortex86 line of
processors and what this would mean for Linux support for those
processors. In case you’re unaware, the Vortex86 is a line of
x86-32-compatible processors, originating at SiS, but now developed and
produced by DMP Electronics in Taiwain. The last two variants were the
Vortex86DX3, a dual-core chip running at 1Ghz, and the Vortex86EX2, a
chip with two asymmetrical cores that can run two operating systems at
once. Their platform support documents for Windows and Linux are from
2021, so we can’t rely on those for more information. Digging through
some of the documentation from ICOP, who sell industrial PCs based on
the latest Vortex86DX3, I think support in modern kernels is very much
hit and miss even before this news. All Vortex86 processors are
supposedly i586 (with later variants being i686, even), but some of the
earlier versions were compatible with the 486SX. On top of that, Linux
4.14 seems to be the last kernel that supports any of these chips
out-of-the-box based on the documentation by DMP – but then, if you go
back to ICOP, you’ll find news items about Linux 5.16 adding better
support for Vortex86, so I’m definitely confused. My uneducated guess is
that the DX3 and EX2 will probably work even after these changes to the
Linux kernel, but earlier models might have more problems. Even on the
LKML I can find messages from the kind of people who know their stuff
who don’t know all the ins and outs of these Vortex86 processors, and
which instructions they actually support. It won’t matter much for
people relying on Vortex86 processors in industrial and commercial
settings, though, since they tend to use custom stacks built by the
vendor, so they’re going to be just fine. What’s more interesting is the
what I assume is a small enthusiast market using Vortex86 processors who
might want to run modern Linux kernels on them. I have a feeling these
code removals might lead to some issues on especially the earlier
models, meaning you’ll have to use older kernels. I’ve always been
fascinated by the Vortex86 line of processors, and on numerous occasions
I’ve hovered over the buy button on some industrial PC using the
VortexDX3 (or earlier) processor. Let me know if you’re interested in
seeing what this chip can do, and if there’s enough interest, I can see
if I can set a Ko-Fi goal to buy one these and mess around with Windows
Embedded/CE, Linux, and god knows what else these things can be made to
run.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-numeric-keypad">A brief history of the
numeric keypad</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>The title is a lie. This isn’t brief at all. Picture the keypad of a
telephone and calculator side by side. Can you see the subtle difference
between the two without resorting to your smartphone? Don’t worry if you
can’t recall the design. Most of us are so used to accepting the common
interfaces that we tend to overlook the calculator’s inverted key
sequence. A calculator has the 7–8–9 buttons at the top whereas a phone
uses the 1–2–3 format. Subtle, but puzzling since they serve the same
functional goal — input numbers. There’s no logical reason for the
inversion if a user operates the interface in the same way. Common sense
suggests the reason should be technological constraints. Maybe it’s due
to a patent battle between the inventors. Some people may theorize it’s
ergonomics. With no clear explanation, I knew history and the evolution
of these devices would provide the answer. Which device was invented
first? Which keypad influenced the other? Most importantly, who invented
the keypad in the first place? ↫ Francesco Bertelli and Manoel do Amara
Sometimes, you come across articles that are one-of-a-kind, and this is
one of them. Very few people would go to this length to document such a
particular thing most people find utterly insignificant, but luckily for
us, Francesco Bertelli and Manoel do Amara went all the way with this
one. If you want to know anything about the history of the numerical pad
and its possibly layouts, this is the place to go. What I’ve always
found fascinating about numerical pads is how effortless the brain can
switch between the two most common layouts without really batting an
eye. Both layouts seem so ingrained in my brain that it feels like
there’s barely any context-switching involved, and my fingers just
effortlessly flow to the correct numbers. Considering numbers tend to
confuse me, I wouldn’t have been at all surprised to find myself having
issues switching between the two layouts. What makes this even more
interesting is when I consider the number row on the keyboard – you
know, 1 through 0 – because there I do tend to have a lot of issues
finding the right numbers. I don’t mean it takes seconds or anything
like that, but I definitely experience more hiccups working with the
number row than with a numerical keypad of either layout.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-the-bsd-fast-filesystem">A brief history of
the BSD Fast FileSystem</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’re looking at an article from 2007 here, but I still think it’s
valuable and interesting, especially from a historical perspective. I
first started working on the UNIX file system with Bill Joy in the late
1970s. I wrote the Fast File System, now called UFS, in the early 1980s.
In this article, I have written a survey of the work that I and others
have done to improve the BSD file systems. Much of this research has
been incorporated into other file systems. ↫ Marshall Kirk McKusic
Variants of UFS are still the default file system in at least NetBSD and
OpenBSD, and it’s one of the two default options in FreeBSD (alongside
ZFS). In other words, this article, and the work described therein, is
still relevant to this very day.</p>
