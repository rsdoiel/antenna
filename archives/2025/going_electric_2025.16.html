Tesla’s earnings report dropped today, and
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/04/22/tesla-tsla-q1-2025-financial-results/">news
isn’t great</a>. But instead of recognizing his failures that have led
to Tesla’s downturn, CEO Elon Musk lashed out with conspiracy theories
while also hypocritically failing to acknowledge that his company was
only profitable this quarter due to regulatory credits.

Chevy flew us down to Charlotte for some track and road time with the
Chevy Blazer SS EV. The 600+ horsepower beast barely hidden beneath the
skin of Chevy’s mid-sized SUV is also the quickest ‘SS’ monikered
vehicle the company has ever produced. The Blazer SS also has a ton of
extras like a standard, robust SuperCruise, which competes favorably
with the Performance line from domestic competitors like Tesla’s Model Y
and Ford’s Mustang Mach-e GT.

<p>
Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t
selling, but that just exposes them for the industry noobs that they
are. A rebate is a powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome
obstacles like negative equity, poor credit, and down payment
requirements and get you to drive home in the car of your dreams today.
</p>
<p>
So if you’re dealing with any of the above,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/tariffs/">but still hope to slide
behind the wheel of a new EV before new tariffs kick in</a>, pay
attention: these EVs could get you behind the wheel of a new electric
ride sooner than you think!

Former Tesla engineer Cristina Balan, who was fired in 2014, said in an
interview that her entire team was threatened with deportation for
taking her side when she brought up a brake safety issue directly to
Elon Musk. She’s now succeeded in throwing out Tesla’s arbitration case
against her, and hopes to meet Tesla directly in open court in a case
that could influence corporate policy nationwide.
