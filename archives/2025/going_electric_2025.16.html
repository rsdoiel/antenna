<p>
Tesla currently finds itself in quite a dilemma: the company’s core
business is in free fall, with Elon Musk at the helm.
</p>
<p>
However, now that Tesla’s stock is firmly in the “meme stock” category,
it would likely crash without him pumping it.

As we’ve been briefly mentioning the past month or so, we got an
opportunity to attend the 2025 Shanghai Auto Show in… you guessed it,
Shanghai. Aside from taking place in an event center larger than many
cities in the US, <a href="https://autoshanghai.auto-fairs.com/en/">this
annual event</a> featured some of the most advanced tech we’ve ever seen
and a glimpse into the future of electric mobility, as well as some of
the strangest yet entertaining design and presentation.

After about a month of speculation and subtle hints from industry
insiders, American EV startup
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/slate-ev/">Slate</a> has emerged
from stealth to share its flagship model with the world. This simplified
all-electric pickup arrives with over 100 accessories, a five-seat SUV
configuration kit, and get this… crank windows. Even better, this
no-nonsense pedigree of EV is priced refreshingly low, starting below
$20,000 after US tax incentives.

Tesla’s stock (TSLA) surged by as much as 8% today following the company
reporting disastrous earnings results – its worst in years and way below

When you think about the biggest names in electric vehicles, Tesla or
BYD probably come to mind first. But the largest electric vehicle
producer by sheer numbers isn’t either of these car
giants—<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/25/yadea-factory-tour-the-surprises-i-found-at-the-worlds-largest-electric-vehicle-maker/">it’s
Yadea</a>, the Chinese powerhouse behind an enormous array of electric
two- and three-wheelers. Recently, I had the opportunity to

China</a> and attend Yadea’s annual retail summit, an expansive event
hosting over 4,000 global dealers and showcasing what felt like an
endless variety of electric rides.

Tesla’s earnings report dropped today, and

to Tesla’s downturn, CEO Elon Musk lashed out with conspiracy theories
while also hypocritically failing to acknowledge that his company was
only profitable this quarter due to regulatory credits.

Elon Musk said Tesla’s self-driving will start contributing to the
company’s profits… wait for it… “next year” with “millions of Tesla
robotaxis in operation during the second half of the year.”
</p>
<p>
The claim has become a running joke, as he has made it for the last
decade.

Tesla just dropped its Q1 2025 earnings and
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/04/22/tesla-tsla-q1-2025-financial-results/">the
news isn’t great</a>, as sales and profits have fallen significantly and
missed already-low expectations. And in the earnings report, the company
has issued what seems to be an admission that its own CEO’s actions are
to blame.

Chevy flew us down to Charlotte for some track and road time with the
Chevy Blazer SS EV. The 600+ horsepower beast barely hidden beneath the
skin of Chevy’s mid-sized SUV is also the quickest ‘SS’ monikered
vehicle the company has ever produced. The Blazer SS also has a ton of
extras like a standard, robust SuperCruise, which competes favorably
with the Performance line from domestic competitors like Tesla’s Model Y
and Ford’s Mustang Mach-e GT.

<p>
Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t
selling, but that just exposes them for the industry noobs that they
are. A rebate is a powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome
obstacles like negative equity, poor credit, and down payment
requirements and get you to drive home in the car of your dreams today.
</p>
<p>
So if you’re dealing with any of the above,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/tariffs/">but still hope to slide
behind the wheel of a new EV before new tariffs kick in</a>, pay
attention: these EVs could get you behind the wheel of a new electric
ride sooner than you think!
