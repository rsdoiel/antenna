<p>That’s only $300 more than last year. But higher trim levels get way
more expensive.</p>

Elon Musk is breaking his own rule of not making announcements during
Tesla earnings as the CEO appears desperate amid a brand crisis.

<p>
Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t
selling, but that just exposes them for the industry noobs that they
are. A rebate is a powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome
obstacles like negative equity, poor credit, and down payment
requirements and get you to drive home in the car of your dreams today.
</p>
<p>
So if you’re dealing with any of the above,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/tariffs/">but still hope to slide
behind the wheel of a new EV before new tariffs kick in</a>, pay
attention: these EVs could get you behind the wheel of a new electric
ride sooner than you think!

Former Tesla engineer Christina Balan, who was fired in 2014, said in an
interview that her entire team was threatened with deportation for
taking her side when she brought up a brake safety issue directly to
Elon Musk. She’s now succeeded in throwing out Tesla’s arbitration case
against her, and hopes to meet Tesla directly in open court in a case
that could influence corporate policy nationwide.
