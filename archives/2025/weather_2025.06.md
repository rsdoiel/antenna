Mesoscale Discussion 0110
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CST Sun Feb 16 2025

Areas affected...Northern Florida...Southeast Georgia...Eastern
Southern Carolina...Far Southern North Carolina

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 13...

Valid 161348Z - 161545Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 13
continues.

SUMMARY...A threat for damaging wind gusts will continue this
morning from parts of northern Florida northeastward into southeast
Georgia and the Carolinas.

DISCUSSION...The latest mosaic radar imagery shows a line of strong
to severe storms from the eastern Florida Panhandle northeastward
into the central Carolinas. Ahead of the line, surface dewpoints in
the 60s F are contributing to weak instability. The RAP has MUCAPE
less than 500 J/kg in most areas across the Atlantic coastal plains.
In spite of this, frontal forcing is strong near the line, which
will likely help the line to maintain strength over the next few
hours. With the strong low to mid-level flow in place, evident on
regional WSR-88D VWPs, the line is expected to continue to produce
isolated damaging gusts, especially along the parts that are more
organized. The wind-damage threat will likely persist into the mid
to late morning as the line moves through the Atlantic coastal
areas.

Mesoscale Discussion 0109
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CST Sun Feb 16 2025

Areas affected...Northern New York...Northern New England

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 161328Z - 161930Z

SUMMARY...Heavy snow will likely develop across parts of northern
New York and northern New England this morning. Further south into
parts of east-central New York and central New England, a mix of
snow, sleet and freezing rain will be possible this morning.

DISCUSSION...A mid-level trough will quickly move through the
southern and central Appalachians this morning. A surface low will
deepen and move northeastward into the Northeast. Ahead of the
system, a band of strong warm-advection was located from New York
eastward into the southern New England, where widespread
precipitation is ongoing. The freezing line is currently located
from southern New York eastward into southern New England. A zone
(about 100 miles wide) of freezing rain and sleet is located to the
north of the freezing line. This freezing rain and sleet will spread
northward over the next few hours. A changeover to rain will occur
as the freezing line moves northward. In addition, areas that are
experiencing snow may changeover to freezing rain. Freezing rain
rates could exceed 0.05 inches per hour.

Further north into northern New England, surface temperatures are in
the teens and single digits. The cold air in the low to mid-levels
will make snow the primary precipitation type. As strong warm
advection and isentropic lift increase across the region, the
development of heavy snow will likely occur in many areas. Snowfall
rates could exceed 1 inch per hour.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CST Sun Feb 16 2025

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
NORTH FLORIDA INTO SOUTHEAST GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds and a brief tornado or two remain possible
through about midday from north Florida to parts of South Carolina.
Isolated damaging winds and a brief tornado may also occur northward
into parts of the Mid-Atlantic region through the afternoon.

...Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic...
As an upper trough pivots northeastward from the Southeast to
Mid-Atlantic today, an extensive QLCS in progress this morning will
continue moving quickly eastward across north FL, southeast GA, and
SC. Greater low-level moisture and related weak instability is
present over parts of north FL and vicinity ahead of the line and a
surface cold front. Boundary layer moisture and buoyancy quickly
drop off with northward extent into GA/SC/NC. Still, very strong
low-level flow remains present across these regions, with a 50-70+
kt low-level jet supporting ample 0-3 km SRH. Current expectations
are for the northern portion of the line to gradually outpace
appreciable surface-based instability, while the southern portion
becomes increasingly displaced from the large-scale ascent
associated with the departing upper trough. Even so, scattered
severe/damaging winds and perhaps a brief tornado or two should
remain possible through about midday given the strength of the
low-level flow present. See Mesoscale Discussion 108 for more
near-term details.

The northern portion this QLCS should remain generally elevated atop
a near-surface stable layer in the lee of the Appalachians in NC to
VA for the next few hours. But, it should eventually impinge on weak
surface-based buoyancy later in the morning across the coastal
Carolinas to southeastern VA. With very strong low-level flow/shear
expected to be in place across these regions, any intensification of
the thin convective line may yield occasional damaging winds and
perhaps even a brief tornado. Even so, most guidance continues to
suggest the overall severe threat will remain isolated/marginal from
roughly NC northward into the Mid-Atlantic.

...Synopsis...
Behind a departing trough, high pressure will build in aloft with
height rises across much of the western/central US. In addition, a
post-frontal cool air mass will be in place across much of the
central US on D2 - Sunday, supporting higher relative humidity
across the southern Plains. This pattern will keep fire weather
concerns low across the CONUS.

Mesoscale Discussion 0095
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0715 AM CST Thu Feb 13 2025

Areas affected...Central and Northern New England...Northern New
York...

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 131315Z - 131915Z

SUMMARY...A mix of snow...sleet and freezing rain will move across
northern New York and central New England this morning. Freezing
rain rates could exceed 0.03 inches per hour in some areas. Heavy
snow could develop in some areas across central and northern Maine.

DISCUSSION...Heights will fall across the Northeast today, as a
mid-level trough approaches from the west. Several areas of
precipitation are ongoing in the Northeast. This is being supported
by large-scale ascent ahead of the trough, and by strong low-level
jet currently located in northern New York. At the surface, a strong
thermal gradient is present with temperatures in New England ranging
from the lower to mid 30s F over southern and central New England,
and teens to single digits over central and northern Maine. In
association with the low-level jet, a nose of warm air aloft is
evident on forecast and observed soundings. This warm nose, with
temperatures of 2 to 5 C, will favor a mixed precipitation type from
northern New York eastward across northern New England into southern
Maine. Freezing rain within this zone could exceed 0.03 inches per
hour within the heavier pockets of precipitation. To the north of
the zone, air aloft will be cold enough for snow. Localized heavy
snow will be possible, mainly across parts of central and northern
Maine.

Mesoscale Discussion 0085
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0616 AM CST Wed Feb 12 2025

Areas affected...Southern and Central Missouri...South-central
Illinois

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 121216Z - 121815Z

SUMMARY...A mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow will be likely this
morning across parts of southwest Missouri east-northeastward into
south-central Illinois. Precipitation rates could exceed 0.05 inches
per hour.

DISCUSSION...A mid-level trough is currently analyzed across the
southern Rockies. Ahead of the trough, an area of precipitation is
ongoing within a zone of increasing large-scale ascent from the
eastern portions of the southern Plains into the Ozarks. Surface
temperatures are in the lower 30s F across most of Southwest
Missouri extending northeastward to the vicinity of St Louis. 

Several RAP forecast soundings within this corridor have a warm nose
in the mid-levels between 700 and 800 mb, with temperatures near 0
C. This warm layer will result in a mix of precipitation types.
Freezing rain, sleet and snow will be possible as this area of
precipitation spreads northeastward. Precipitation across
southeastern Missouri, where the warm nose is more pronounced, will
be mostly freezing rain, while further to the north across
north-central Missouri, snow is expected to predominant. Locally,
heavy snowfall rates will be possible with the more intense bands.

## SPC Feb 12, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Wed Feb 12 2025

Valid 151200Z - 201200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Saturday...
Model guidance continues to forecast a strong upper-level trough
moving through the southern Plains and into the Southeast. Some
modest slowing of the trough has been noted, however. The trough
will promote the deepening of the surface low in the ArkLaTex
vicinity during the afternoon with further deepening expected into
the evening as it generally progresses north-northeastward within
the Mid-South/Ohio Valley. Moisture return will have begun Friday
evening and will continue Saturday. Guidance shows a consistent
signal for mid 60s F dewpoints extending into much of
Louisiana/Mississippi, and Alabama. Upper 60s F dewpoints are
possible closer to the Gulf Coast. Very strong wind fields are
anticipated throughout the troposphere. Shear will be strong and,
despite more modest mid-level lapse rates, buoyancy will be more
than adequate for severe storms. The current expectation is for warm
advection precipitation to be ongoing early in the period and for it
not to make much, if any, southward progress until the late
afternoon. A Pacific front in East Texas/Sabine Valley into the
ArkLaTex may be the initial zone for stronger convective
development. By the late afternoon onward, the cold front will begin
to surge south and east. The low-level jet should remain strong into
the afternoon and then increase to 50-70 kts during the evening. As
the cold front surges, shear vectors will acquire a greater
cross-boundary component. This strongly forced line will be capable
of scattered to widespread damaging winds along with the threat for
embedded circulations/QLCS tornadoes. One of the main questions that
remain will be the degree of the tornado threat, which would
increase with any discrete activity ahead of the cold front. Given
the weak capping and strong forcing, pre-frontal discrete storms are
plausible. The ECMWF shows some hint of this from central Louisiana
into adjacent Mississippi. The eastern and northern extent of the
greatest severe threat are also in question, but the intense
low-level jet could produce severe-caliber gusts even with
relatively shallow convection. The overall pattern, along with
signals in both deterministic and ML guidance, suggest 30% severe
probabilities are warranted for Saturday.

...Day 5/Sunday...
The strongly forced line will continue into portions of the
Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic. Strong wind-fields will remain in place.
The main question will be the degree of destabilization that can
occur. The current forecast guidance suggests the line may move
through these areas late morning/early afternoon. Uncertainty in the
thermodynamic environment precludes severe probabilities at this
time, but areas of eastern Virginia into parts of the eastern
Carolinas will continue to be monitored.

...Day 6/Monday Onward...
With cold air moving into much of the CONUS east of the Divide,
severe potential appears low during the remainder of the period.
Some moisture return could occur in coastal Texas next Tuesday, but
a cold front is expected to quickly push back offshore.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected tonight.

...01z Update...

850mb flow is beginning to increase across northern TX into
southeast OK, partially in response to a weak southern stream
short-wave trough that is approaching this region. Latest model
guidance suggests LLJ will strengthen into the late evening hours
then veer into the Arklatex by 11/12z. The strongest corridor of
low-level warm advection is currently noted from central OK into the
Ozarks. This appears to be the primary reason for ongoing elevated
convection, with scattered updrafts penetrating levels that are
favorable for lightning. 00z sounding from OUN supports this with
450 J/kg MUCAPE if lifting a parcel around 2km AGL. With time, as
temperatures cool aloft, lapse rates should adjust and permit
convection to develop southwest across north-central TX into the
Edwards Plateau. Buoyancy appears inadequate for severe hail.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0222 PM CST Mon Feb 10 2025

Valid 121200Z - 181200Z

A progressive upper pattern is in store for the upcoming week into
next weekend, with multiple surface cyclones poised to develop over
the Plains states and eject eastward in tandem with supporting
mid-level troughs. Surface cyclone development is expected in the
southern Plains with the approach of the first mid-level trough,
supporting dry downslope flow across far western Texas Day 3
(Wednesday). 25 mph sustained westerly surface winds and 15 percent
RH will overspread drying fuels over the Trans Pecos region,
necessitating the maintenance of 70 percent Critical probabilities.
The passage of another mid-level trough, surface low, and
accompanying downslope flow, is likely on Day 6 (Saturday), where
dry and windy conditions across far western Texas warrants 40
percent Critical probabilities. Some precipitation accumulations are
possible just east of the Trans Pecos on Wednesday, which may
influence the eastern extent of fire weather highlights for both
Days 3 and 6 in future outlooks. After Saturday, relatively
quiescent fire weather conditions are likely before another
mid-level trough approaches beyond the extended outlook time frame.

Valid 102000Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains largely unchanged with minor
adjustments. Broad-scale ascent/warm air advection is increasing
across portions of the southern Plains, with elevated showers
ongoing within a weakly unstable air mass. Gradual intensification
of these showers into widely scattered thunderstorms is likely over
the southern Plains and ArkLaTex tonight. The thunder area was
expanded slightly farther east to better cover higher thunder
potential from recent guidance. Otherwise, the severe risk remains
low. See the prior outlook for additional info.

..Lyons.. 02/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1019 AM CST Mon Feb 10 2025/

...Central/North Texas and eastern Oklahoma/western Arkansas...
Broadly cyclonic flow aloft will continue over the CONUS with
gradual trough amplification over the northern Intermountain West,
Great Basin and Lower Colorado River Valley. Focused by increasing
warm advection and isentropic ascent within the elevated frontal
zone, thunderstorms may develop as early as this afternoon across
south-central/eastern Oklahoma into western Arkansas, and then more
broadly late tonight in a northeast-southwest corridor across
North/central Texas toward the Edwards Plateau. While vertical shear
will be strong within the cloud-bearing layer, seasonally mild
mid-level temperatures and residual subsidence-related capping in
the mid-levels will likely preclude meaningful hail potential with
this elevated convection.

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE SABINE
VALLEY INTO FAR WESTERN ALABAMA...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe storms will be possible Wednesday afternoon into
Wednesday night from the Sabine Valley vicinity into far western
Alabama.

...Synopsis...
As the shortwave trough near the ArkLaTex moves northeastward
through the day on Wednesday, moisture return from the Gulf will
continue ahead of a cold front that will move through the Lower
Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southeast Wednesday
evening/overnight.

...Sabine Valley into far western Alabama...
Precipitation, likely north of the surface boundary, will be ongoing
Wednesday morning. This will have impact on both frontal position
and the exact degree of destabilization that can occur later in the
day. As the trough moves northeast, low to mid 60s F dewpoints will
move northward into much of Louisiana into central Mississippi and
portions of Alabama. Upper 60s F dewpoints are possible near the
Gulf Coast. As a surface low develops near the ArkLaTex late in the
morning, storm development in the warm sector is possible near the
Sabine Valley. Storms are expected to be at least near surface
based. Storm development along the front is likely to continue
through the period given strong low-level warm advection. This
activity may occasionally be strong to severe given the 50-60 kts of
effective shear. However, front-parallel shear will lead to storm
interactions and little surge in the line. The front will eventually
move southeastward, but this will not occur until the evening and
overnight periods. Buoyancy will decrease with northward and
eastward extent, but stronger forcing from the shortwave may
compensate. Moisture advection should keep inhibition minimal even
into the evening. The strong low-level winds and enlarged hodographs
would suggest some threat of damaging winds as well as a tornado or
two. The linear forcing from the front should limit the tornado
threat. Development of storms in the open warm sector does not
appear probable given the warmer layers aloft and the arrival of
mid-level cooling during th early/mid evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CST Mon Feb 10 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
Within the base of a large-scale trough over the West, an embedded
shortwave trough will track eastward across the Southwest. This will
encourage a broad area of surface low pressure over the southern
Rockies and High Plains. Along/south of the surface low, a modest
pressure gradient, coupled with boundary-layer mixing into a belt of
strong flow aloft, will favor 15-20 mph sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds (with higher gusts) across portions of NM. While
mid/high-level clouds will limit diurnal heating and RH reductions
to an extent, dry antecedent conditions and at least filtered
heating should still yield 15-25 percent minimum RH. As a result,
elevated fire-weather conditions are expected.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible from the southern
Plains into the lower Mississippi Valley on Tuesday. Severe weather
is not currently anticipated.

...Synopsis...
Broad upper-level troughing is expected to evolve over much of the
West on Tuesday. A shortwave perturbation is expected to eject into
the southern Plains late Tuesday into Wednesday morning. At the
surface, a cold front should extend from the southern High Plains
into central Texas before arcing northeastward along the upper Texas
Gulf Coast and into the lower Mississippi Valley.

...Southern Plains to Lower Mississippi Valley...
Precipitation is likely to be ongoing early Tuesday morning. Most of
this activity will be occurring on the cool side of the boundary.
This should reinforce the front, though some modest northward
progression of warmer, moist air may occur within the coastal plain
regions. Potential for surface-based storms south of the boundary in
southeast Texas/Sabine Valley vicinity appears low as the low-level
jet will weaken during the morning/afternoon and mid-level ascent
will be weak. Furthermore, forecast soundings indicate poor lapse
rates in the column and warm layers that will inhibit updraft
intensity. Overnight Tuesday into Wednesday morning, additional
isolated to scattered storms are possible from the Edwards Plateau
into Central/Northeast Texas as mid-level forcing and 850 mb warm
advection increases. Again, these storms will be elevated on the
cool side of the boundary. The strongest of these storms could
produce small hail. The overall severe threat appears too
isolated/uncertain for unconditional probabilities.
