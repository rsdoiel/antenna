<h2 id="hours-in-east-london">36 hours in East London</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There is no better time to visit East London than in the summer. From May to September, Londoners emerge to sip canned cocktails in parks, languish by the boats on Regent&amp;#8217;s Canal and pick over tchotchkes at outdoor markets. But there is plenty of fun to be had inside, too. The area, which was included in The New York Times&amp;#8217; 52 Places to Go in 2025, has undergone a cultural makeover in the years after the 2012 Olympics. Olympic Park, built on a former brownfield site in the district of Stratford, gained a dance theater and an outpost of the Victoria and Albert Museum this year. And the Soho Theater has opened a branch in Walthamstow, an area about 40 minutes from central London. A lot of this itinerary takes place in the many neighborhoods that make up the borough of Hackney, including Dalston, Shoreditch and Hoxton. The neighborhoods are magnets for the more trend-conscious and easily memed set, but there are places where you can still glimpse the area&amp;#8217;s industrial roots and vibrant immigrant communities. It is the balance between old and new, established and evolving that makes East London hum.&lt;/p&gt;
