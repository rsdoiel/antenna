Scientific Output: Indigenous Languages and Ethnic Self-Identification
in Institutional Repositories</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: SciELO in Perspective</p>
<p>
UFSCar is implementing an innovative initiative by including the
ethnicity field/indigenous people in the Institutional Repository’s
metadata, valuing original authorship in scientific output. In addition
to this new field, the title, keywords, and abstract metadata also
encourage the use of indigenous languages by student researchers, thus
contributing to the construction of a science that is more committed to
epistemic justice and to Brazil’s cultural and linguistic diversity
