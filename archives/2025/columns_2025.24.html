<p>Did tracking-based advertising just get blown up in Europe? As I read
it (in an English translation here), an appeals court in Brussels ruled
consent notifications on websites illegal. Your interpretation may vary.

If you’re a regular reader of my blog you know I put images in the right
margins of pieces. I get an idea then I go scouting around using search
to find the image that fits.
</p>
<p>
Today I was looking for an image of an army General.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
i’d like a painting style image of an american general in world war ii
timeframe standing on a white background, full body from shoes to
helmet, lots of medals, angry determination on his face. as if it were a
portrait.

This is what I got, and it’s perfect.

this
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/opinion/obama-save-america-trump.html">piece</a>
in the NYT has a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/15/joerogue.png">bit of
wisdom</a> that I had not considered because I don’t listen to Joe Rogan
it would never occur to me. He’s relaxing white noise, chatting in the
background while you play a game or write a blog post or text message on
your phone, or just think about something unrelated. I forgot that mode
of media consumption. I’m always on the hunt for that kind of content.
That’s why sports games are so good. You can almost completely tune out,
knowing they’ll replay the best stuff.
</p>
<p>
Reminds of a meeting we had a
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Berkman">Berkman</a> in
the early days of podcasting. Most of the faculty were of course not on
board with what we were doing, possibly believing that it threatened
public radio (didn’t turn out that way at all, they made incredibly good
use of podcasting). One of the guys from
<a href="https://www.prx.org/">PRX</a> which was also incubating there
at the time, said at me in a challenging way – You get the best info
from public radio! Right? I thought for a minute and realized this was a
good question. No, I said, it’s relaxing, I can tune out while I’m
driving or walking around town. Loud groans. But it’s so true. Now it’s
great when there’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dept._Q">TV
series</a> that really
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=disbelief">catches</a>
your attention, I love that too, but most of my media-ingesting time is
with white noise, background relaxation. The world is still okay when
the background noise on MSNBC are still on the air between the ever more
disgusting ads for diseases I probably will never get.
</p>
<p>
There must be a better way.
</p>
<p>
It’s like the canaries in a coalmine. When they go off the air that’s
when you really have to start worrying!
</p>
<p>
BTW, PRX was a good idea. Brilliant actually. Distribute the content
from the public radio sources that generate too much to the ones in less
populated areas where they don’t generate enough. Podcasting blew that
up – but PRX adjusted their approach, and became a distributor of
podcasting. That’s an entrepreneur’s approach. The were able to pivot
and continue to make a contribution to this day.
</p>
<p>
I often wonder how we missed the opportunity to build a great media
incubator at Harvard in the 00s. We were right there, and the backer of
Berkman wanted entrepreurial projects, I found out at the reunion two
summers ago. We had it, were there, if only.. Heh when you get to be my
age there’s lots of that.
</p>
<p>
Also I wonder how I missed the potential of WordPress all those years.
Ships passing in the night. But we’re there now, so..

figured that yesterday’s army march in DC would have caused clashes with
the police in more places than it did, perhaps due to false flag attacks
“from the left” at one of the many No King Day parades around the
country. I thought this was the moment when it would all melt down.
America’s Reichstad Fire. If it were an episode of Mission Impossible or
Batman, it would definitely have gone that way. I bet there were plans
hatched on open chat channels between various Cabinet members and their
families, and probably Elon Musk via an interpreter, to coordinate. I
was also surprised there weren’t any Tesla Cybertrucks in yesterday’s
parade. I guess the honeymoon is really over. Anyway, they had to have
had a plan, but I keep forgetting this is not Generalissimo Trump,
rather it’s TV President “Taco” Trump. I think they had a plan and he
lost his nerve at the last minute. Instead, the Maga in Minnesota lit a
different fuse, assassinating the speaker of the state house. That’s a
line that hadn’t yet been crossed, but you knew the day would come. It’s
here.</p>

you think we need to find a way past the billionaires, then we have to
find a way around the established media. They keep selling us out and we
keep acting as if we show them that they’re doing it in a way they
understand they’ll get on our side. But they can’t. “It is difficult to
get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not
understanding it,”
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair">wrote</a>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something">Upton
Sinclair</a> in 1935. It’s still true 90 years later. Another great
philosopher, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Moonves">Les
Moonves</a>,
<a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/les-moonves-trump-cbs-220001">said</a>
in 2016, “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS,”
referring to Trump’s run for president. It was good presumably because
of increased viewership resulting more ad revenue. I’m sure it’s still
true today, though CBS stopped boasting about it in public.</p>
