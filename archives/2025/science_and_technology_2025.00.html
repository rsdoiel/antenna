<h2 id="running-netbsd-on-an-ibm-thinkpad-380z">Running NetBSD on an IBM
ThinkPad 380Z</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Launched in 1998, the 380Z was one very fine ThinkPad. It was the
last ThinkPad to come in the classic bulky and rectangular form factor.
It was also one of the first to feature a huge 13.3″ TFT display,
powerful 233MHz Pentium II, and whopping 160 megs of RAM. I recently
stumbled upon one in perfect condition on eBay, and immediately thought
it’d be a cool vintage gadget to put on the desk. I only wondered if I
could still use it for some slow-paced, distraction-free coding, using
reasonably modern software. ↫ Luke’s web space You know where this is
going, right? I evaluated a bunch of contemporary operating systems,
including different variants of BSD and Linux. Usually, the experience
was underwhelming in terms of performance, hardware support and
stability. Well… except for NetBSD, which gave me such perfectly smooth
ride, that I thought it was worth sharing. ↫ Luke’s web space Yeah, of
course it was going to be NetBSD (again). This old laptop, too, can run
X11 just fine, with the EMWM that we discussed quite recently – in fact,
bringing up X required no configuration, and a simple startx was all it
needed out of the box. For web browsing, Dillo works just great, and
building it took only about 20 minutes. It can even play some low-fi
music streams from the internet, only stuttering when doing other
processor-intensive tasks. In other words, this little machine with
NetBSD turns out to be a great machine for some distraction-free
programming. Look, nobody is arguing that a machine like this is all you
need. However, it can perform certain specific, basic tasks – anything
being better than sending it to a toxic landfill, with all the
transportation waste and child labour that entails. If you have old
laptops lying around, you should think twice about just sending them to
“recycling” (which is Western world speak for “send to toxic landfill
manned by children in poor countries”), since it might be quite easy to
turn it into something useful, still.</p>

Developer’s Kit from 1999</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Rare, hard to come by, but now available on the Internet Archive: the
complete book set for the Windows CE Developer’s Kit from 1999. It
contains all the separate books in their full glory, so if you ever
wanted to write either a Windows CE application or driver for Windows CE
2.0, here’s all the information you’ll ever need. The Microsoft Windows
CE Developer’s Kit provides all the information you need to write
applications for devices based on the Microsofte Windowso CE operating
system. ↫ Windows CE Developer’s Kit The Microsoft Windows CE
Programmer’s Guide details the architecture of the operating system, how
to write applications, how to implement synchronisation with a PC, and
much more that pertains to developing applications. The Microsoft
Windows CE User Interface Services Guide can be seen as an important
addition to the Programmer’s Guide, as it details everything related to
creating a GUI and how to handle various input methods. Going a few
steps deeper, and we arrive at the Microsoft Windows CE Communications
Guide, which, as the name implies, tells you all you need to know about
infrared connections, telephony, networking and internet connections,
and related matter. Finally, we arrive at the Microsoft Windows CE
Device Driver Kit, which, as the name implies, is for those of us
interested in writing device drivers for Windows CE, something that will
surely be of great importance in the future, since Windows CE is sure to
dominate our mobile life. To get started, you do need to have Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 and the Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual
C++ version 6.0 up and running, since all code samples in the
Programmer’s Guide are developed with it, but I’m sure you already have
this taken care of – why would you be developing for any other
platforms, am I right?</p>

<h2 id="lineageos-22.1-based-on-android-15-qpr1-released">LineageOS
22.1, based on Android 15 QPR1, released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>LineageOS, the Debian of the custom Android ROM world, released
version 22 – or, 22.1 to be more exact – today. On the verge of the new
year, they managed to complete the rebase to Android 15, released in
September, making this one of their fastest rebases ever. We’ve been
hard at work since Android 15’s release in September, adapting our
unique features to this new version of Android. Android 15 introduced
several complex changes under the hood, but due to our previous efforts
adapting to Google’s UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14, we
were able to rebase onto Android 15’s code-base faster than anticipated.
Additionally, this is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a
device perspective we have seen in years. This means that many more
devices are ready on day one that we’d typically expect to have up this
early in the cycle! ↫ Nolen Johnson LineageOS is also changing its
versioning scheme to better match that of Google’s new quarterly Android
releases, and that’s why this new release is 22.1: it’s based on Android
15 QPR1. In other words, the 22 aligns with the major Android version
number, and the .1 with the QPR it’s based on. LineageOS 22.1 brings all
the same new features as Android 15 and QPR1, as well as two brand new
applications: Twelve, a replacement for LineageOS’ aging music player
application, and Camelot, a new PDF reader. The list of supported
devices is pretty good for a new LineageOS release, and adds the Pixel 9
series of devices right off the bat. LineageOS 22.1 ships with the
November Android security patches, and also comes with a few low-level
changes, like completely new extract utilities written in Python, which
massively improve extracting performance, virtIO support, and much
more.</p>

<h2 id="chimera-linux-enters-beta">Chimera Linux enters beta</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve talked about Chimera Linux before – it’s a unique Linux
distribution that combines a BSD userland with the LLVM/Clang toolchain,
and musl. Its init system is dinit, and it uses apk-tools from Alpine as
its package manager. None of this has anything to do with being
anti-anything; the choice of BSD’s tools and userland is mostly
technical in nature. Chimera Linux is available for x86-64, AArch64,
RISC-V, and POWER (both little and big endian). I am unreasonably
excited for Chimera Linux, for a variety of reasons – first, I love the
above set of choices they made, and second, Chimera Linux’ founder and
lead developer, q66, is a well-known and respected name in this space.
She not only founded Chimera Linux, but also used to maintain the
POWER/PowerPC ports of Void Linux, which is the port of Void Linux I
used on my POWER9 hardware. She apparently also contributed quite a bit
to Enlightenment, and is currently employed by Igalia, through which she
can work on Chimera. With the description out of the way, here’s the
news: Chimera Linux has officially entered beta. Today we have
updated apk-tools to an rc tag. With this, the project is now entering
beta phase, after around a year and a half. In general, this does not
actually mean much, as the project is rolling release and updates will
simply keep coming. It is more of an acknowledgement of current status,
though new images will be released in the coming days. ↫ Chimera Linux’s
website Despite my excitement, I haven’t yet tried Chimera Linux myself,
as I figured its pre-beta stage wasn’t meant for an idiot like me who
can’t contribute anything meaningful, and I’d rather not clutter the
airwaves. Now that it’s entered beta, I feel like the time is getting
riper and riper for me to dive in, and perhaps write about it here.
Since the goal of Chimera Linux is to be a general-purpose distribution,
I think I’m right in the proper demographic of users. It helps that I’m
about to set up my dual-processor POWER9 machine again, and I think I’ll
be going with Chimera Linux. As a final note, you may have noticed I
consistently refer to it as “Chimera Linux”. This is very much on
purpose, as there’s also something called ChimeraOS, a more standard
Linux distribution aimed at gaming. To avoid confusion, I figured I’d
keep the naming clear and consistent.</p>

10.1 on a 1998 Toshiba laptop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Here are my notes on running NetBSD 10.1 on my first personal laptop
that I still keep, a 1998 i586 Toshiba Satellite Pro with 81Mb of RAM
and a 1Gb IBM 2.5″ IDE HD. In summary, the latest NetBSD runs well on
this old hardware using an IDE to CF adapter and several changes to the
i386 GENERIC kernel. ↫ Joel P. I don’t think the BSD world – and NetBSD
in particular – gets enough recognition for supporting both weird
architectures and old hardware as well as it does. This here is a 26
year old laptop running the latest version of NetBSD, working X11 server
and all, while other operating systems drop support for devices only a
few years old. So many devices could be saved from toxic landfills if
only more people looked beyond Windows and macOS.</p>
