may now be out of production</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple’s first-generation Vision Pro headset may have now ceased
production, following reports of reduced demand and production cuts
earlier in the year. ↫ Hartley Charlton at MacRumors I think we’ll

id="nvidias-rtx-5090-will-supposedly-have-a-monstrous-575w-tdp">NVIDIA’s
RTX 5090 will supposedly have a monstrous 575W TDP</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>The RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 are receiving their final updates.
According to two highly reliable leakers, the RTX 5090 is officially a
575W TDP model, confirming that the new SKU requires significantly more
power than its predecessor, the RTX 4090 with TDP of 450W. According to
Kopite, there has also been an update to the RTX 5080 specifications.
While the card was long rumored to have a 400W TDP, the final figure is
now set at 360W. This change is likely because NVIDIA has confirmed the
TDP, as opposed to earlier TGP figures that are higher and represent the
maximum power limit required by NVIDIA’s specifications for board
partners. ↫ WhyCry at VideoCardz.com These kinds of batshit insane GPU
power power requirements are eventually going to run into the limits of
the kind of airflow an ATX case can provide. We’re still putting the
airflow stream of GPUs (bottom to top) perpendicular to the airflow
through the case (front to back) like it’s 1987, and you’d think at
least someone would be thinking about addressing this – especially when
a GPU is casually dumping this much heat into the constrained space
within a computer case. I don’t want more glass and gamer lights. I want
case makers to hire at least one proper fluid dynamics engineer.</p>

<h2 id="windows-2-final-fantasy-of-operating-systems">Windows 2: Final
Fantasy of operating systems</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that Final Fantasy could have been the last
game in the series. It is far less known that Windows 2, released around
the same time, could too have been the last. If anything, things were
more certain: even Microsoft believed that Windows 2 would be the last.
The miracle of overwhelming commercial success brought incredible
attention to Windows. The retro community and computer historians
generally seem to be interested in the legendary origins of the system
(how it all began) or in its turnabout Windows 3.0 release (what did
they do right?). This story instead will be about the underdog of
Windows, version 2. To understand where it all went wrong, we must start
looking at events that happened even before Microsoft was founded. By
necessity, I will talk a lot about the origins of Windows, too. Instead
of following interpersonal/corporate drama, I will try to focus on the
technical aspects of Windows and its competitors, as well as the
technological limitations of the computers around the time. Some details
are so convoluted and obscure that even multiple Microsoft sources,
including Raymond Chen, are wrong about essential technical details. It
is going to be quite a journey, and it might seem a bit random, but I
promise that eventually, it all will start making sense. ↫ Nina Kalinina
I’m not going to waste your previous time with my stupid babbling when
you could instead spend it reading this amazingly detailed, lovingly
crafted, beautifully illustrated, and deeply in-depth article by Nina
Kalinina about the history, development, and importance of Windows 2.
She’s delivered something special here, and it’s a joy to read and stare

<h2 id="aros-centimeters-closer-to-64bit">AROS centimeters closer to
64bit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve just entered the new year, and that means we’re going to see
some overviews about what the past year has brought. Today we’re looking
at AROS, as AROS News – great name, very classy, you’ve got good taste,
don’t change it – summarised AROS’ 2024, and it’s been a good year for
the project. We don’t hear a lot about AROS-proper, as the various AROS
distributions are a more optimal way of getting to know the operating
system and the project’s communication hasn’t always been great, but
that doesn’t mean they’ve been sitting still. Perhaps the most
surprising amount of progress in 2024 was made in the move from 32bit to
64bit AROS. Deadwood also released a 64-bit version of the system
(ABIv11) in a Linux hosted version (ABIv11 20241102-1) and AxRuntime
version 41.12, which promises a complete switch to 64-bit in the near
future. He has also developed a prototype emulator that will enable
64-bit AROS to run programs written for the 32-bit version of the
system. ↫ Andrzej “retrofaza” Subocz at AROS News This is great news for
AROS, as being stuck in 32bit isn’t particularly future-proof. It might
not pose many problems today, as older hardware remains available and
64bit x86 processors can handle running 32bit operating systems just
fine, but you never know when that will change. Int the same vein,
Deadwood also released a 64bit version of Oddysey, the WebKit-based
browser, which was updated this year from August 2015’s WebKit to
February 2019’s WebKit. Sure, 2019 might still be a little outdated, but
it does mean a ton of complex sites now work again on AROS, and that’s a
hugely positive development. Things like Python and GCC were also
updated this year, and there was, as is fitting for an Amiga-inspired
operating system, a lot of activity in the gaming world, including big
updates to Doom 3 and ScummVM. This is just a selection of course, so be
sure to read Subocz’s entire summary at AROS News.</p>

<h2 id="the-gpu-not-the-tpm-is-the-root-of-hardware-drm">The GPU, not
the TPM, is the root of hardware DRM</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Do you think streaming platforms and other entities that employ DRM
schemes use the TPM in your computer to decrypt stuff? Well, the Free
Software Foundation seems to think so, and adds Microsoft’s insistence
on requiring a TPM for Windows 11 into the mix, but it turns out that’s
simply not true. I’m going to be honest here and say that I don’t know
what Microsoft’s actual motivation for requiring a TPM in Windows 11 is.
I’ve been talking about TPM stuff for a long time. My job involves
writing a lot of TPM code. I think having a TPM enables a number of
worthwhile security features. Given the choice, I’d certainly pick a
computer with a TPM. But in terms of whether it’s of sufficient value to
lock out Windows 11 on hardware with no TPM that would otherwise be able
to run it? I’m not sure that’s a worthwhile tradeoff. What I can say is
that the FSF’s claim is just 100% wrong, and since this seems to be the
sole basis of their overall claim about Microsoft’s strategy here, the
argument is pretty significantly undermined. I’m not aware of any
streaming media platforms making use of TPMs in any way whatsoever.
There is hardware DRM that the media companies use to restrict users,
but it’s not in the TPM – it’s in the GPU. ↫ Matthew Garrett A TPM is
imply not designed to handle decryption of media streams, and even if
they were, they’re far, far too slow and underpowered to decode even a
1080P stream, let alone anything more demanding than that. In reality,
DRM schemes like Google’s Widevine, Apple’s Fairplay, and Microsoft’s
Playready offer different levels of functionality, both in software and
in hardware. The hardware DRM stuff is all done by the GPU, and not by
the TPM. By focusing so much on the TPM, Garrett argues, the FSF is
failing to see how GPU makers have enabled a ton of hardware DRM without
anyone noticing. Personally, I totally understand why organisations like
the Free Software Foundation are focusing on TPMs right now. They’re one
of the main reasons why people can’t upgrade to Windows 11, it’s the
thing people have heard about, and it’s the thing that’ll soon prevent
them from getting security updates for their otherwise perfectly fine
machines. I’m not sure the FSF has enough clout these days to make any
meaningful media impact, especially in more general, non-tech media, but
by choosing the TPM as their focus they’re definitely choosing a viable
vector. Of course, over here in the tech corner, we don’t like it when
people are factually inaccurate or twisting and bending the truth, and
I’m glad someone as knowledgeable as Garrett stepped up to set the
record straight for us tech-focused people, while everyone else can
continue to ignore this matter.</p>

ThinkPad 380Z</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Launched in 1998, the 380Z was one very fine ThinkPad. It was the
last ThinkPad to come in the classic bulky and rectangular form factor.
It was also one of the first to feature a huge 13.3″ TFT display,
powerful 233MHz Pentium II, and whopping 160 megs of RAM. I recently
stumbled upon one in perfect condition on eBay, and immediately thought
it’d be a cool vintage gadget to put on the desk. I only wondered if I
could still use it for some slow-paced, distraction-free coding, using
reasonably modern software. ↫ Luke’s web space You know where this is
going, right? I evaluated a bunch of contemporary operating systems,
including different variants of BSD and Linux. Usually, the experience
was underwhelming in terms of performance, hardware support and
stability. Well… except for NetBSD, which gave me such perfectly smooth
ride, that I thought it was worth sharing. ↫ Luke’s web space Yeah, of
course it was going to be NetBSD (again). This old laptop, too, can run
X11 just fine, with the EMWM that we discussed quite recently – in fact,
bringing up X required no configuration, and a simple startx was all it
needed out of the box. For web browsing, Dillo works just great, and
building it took only about 20 minutes. It can even play some low-fi
music streams from the internet, only stuttering when doing other
processor-intensive tasks. In other words, this little machine with
NetBSD turns out to be a great machine for some distraction-free
programming. Look, nobody is arguing that a machine like this is all you
need. However, it can perform certain specific, basic tasks – anything
being better than sending it to a toxic landfill, with all the
transportation waste and child labour that entails. If you have old
laptops lying around, you should think twice about just sending them to
“recycling” (which is Western world speak for “send to toxic landfill
manned by children in poor countries”), since it might be quite easy to
turn it into something useful, still.</p>

Developer’s Kit from 1999</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Rare, hard to come by, but now available on the Internet Archive: the
complete book set for the Windows CE Developer’s Kit from 1999. It
contains all the separate books in their full glory, so if you ever
wanted to write either a Windows CE application or driver for Windows CE
2.0, here’s all the information you’ll ever need. The Microsoft Windows
CE Developer’s Kit provides all the information you need to write
applications for devices based on the Microsofte Windowso CE operating
system. ↫ Windows CE Developer’s Kit The Microsoft Windows CE
Programmer’s Guide details the architecture of the operating system, how
to write applications, how to implement synchronisation with a PC, and
much more that pertains to developing applications. The Microsoft
Windows CE User Interface Services Guide can be seen as an important
addition to the Programmer’s Guide, as it details everything related to
creating a GUI and how to handle various input methods. Going a few
steps deeper, and we arrive at the Microsoft Windows CE Communications
Guide, which, as the name implies, tells you all you need to know about
infrared connections, telephony, networking and internet connections,
and related matter. Finally, we arrive at the Microsoft Windows CE
Device Driver Kit, which, as the name implies, is for those of us
interested in writing device drivers for Windows CE, something that will
surely be of great importance in the future, since Windows CE is sure to
dominate our mobile life. To get started, you do need to have Microsoft
Visual C++ version 6.0 and the Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual
C++ version 6.0 up and running, since all code samples in the
Programmer’s Guide are developed with it, but I’m sure you already have
this taken care of – why would you be developing for any other
platforms, am I right?</p>

<h2 id="lineageos-22.1-based-on-android-15-qpr1-released">LineageOS
22.1, based on Android 15 QPR1, released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>LineageOS, the Debian of the custom Android ROM world, released
version 22 – or, 22.1 to be more exact – today. On the verge of the new
year, they managed to complete the rebase to Android 15, released in
September, making this one of their fastest rebases ever. We’ve been
hard at work since Android 15’s release in September, adapting our
unique features to this new version of Android. Android 15 introduced
several complex changes under the hood, but due to our previous efforts
adapting to Google’s UI-centric adjustments in Android 12 through 14, we
were able to rebase onto Android 15’s code-base faster than anticipated.
Additionally, this is far-and-away the easiest bringup cycle from a
device perspective we have seen in years. This means that many more
devices are ready on day one that we’d typically expect to have up this
early in the cycle! ↫ Nolen Johnson LineageOS is also changing its
versioning scheme to better match that of Google’s new quarterly Android
releases, and that’s why this new release is 22.1: it’s based on Android
15 QPR1. In other words, the 22 aligns with the major Android version
number, and the .1 with the QPR it’s based on. LineageOS 22.1 brings all
the same new features as Android 15 and QPR1, as well as two brand new
applications: Twelve, a replacement for LineageOS’ aging music player
application, and Camelot, a new PDF reader. The list of supported
devices is pretty good for a new LineageOS release, and adds the Pixel 9
series of devices right off the bat. LineageOS 22.1 ships with the
November Android security patches, and also comes with a few low-level
changes, like completely new extract utilities written in Python, which
massively improve extracting performance, virtIO support, and much
more.</p>

<h2 id="chimera-linux-enters-beta">Chimera Linux enters beta</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve talked about Chimera Linux before – it’s a unique Linux
distribution that combines a BSD userland with the LLVM/Clang toolchain,
and musl. Its init system is dinit, and it uses apk-tools from Alpine as
its package manager. None of this has anything to do with being
anti-anything; the choice of BSD’s tools and userland is mostly
technical in nature. Chimera Linux is available for x86-64, AArch64,
RISC-V, and POWER (both little and big endian). I am unreasonably
excited for Chimera Linux, for a variety of reasons – first, I love the
above set of choices they made, and second, Chimera Linux’ founder and
lead developer, q66, is a well-known and respected name in this space.
She not only founded Chimera Linux, but also used to maintain the
POWER/PowerPC ports of Void Linux, which is the port of Void Linux I
used on my POWER9 hardware. She apparently also contributed quite a bit
to Enlightenment, and is currently employed by Igalia, through which she
can work on Chimera. With the description out of the way, here’s the
news: Chimera Linux has officially entered beta. Today we have
updated apk-tools to an rc tag. With this, the project is now entering
beta phase, after around a year and a half. In general, this does not
actually mean much, as the project is rolling release and updates will
simply keep coming. It is more of an acknowledgement of current status,
though new images will be released in the coming days. ↫ Chimera Linux’s
website Despite my excitement, I haven’t yet tried Chimera Linux myself,
as I figured its pre-beta stage wasn’t meant for an idiot like me who
can’t contribute anything meaningful, and I’d rather not clutter the
airwaves. Now that it’s entered beta, I feel like the time is getting
riper and riper for me to dive in, and perhaps write about it here.
Since the goal of Chimera Linux is to be a general-purpose distribution,
I think I’m right in the proper demographic of users. It helps that I’m
about to set up my dual-processor POWER9 machine again, and I think I’ll
be going with Chimera Linux. As a final note, you may have noticed I
consistently refer to it as “Chimera Linux”. This is very much on
purpose, as there’s also something called ChimeraOS, a more standard
Linux distribution aimed at gaming. To avoid confusion, I figured I’d
keep the naming clear and consistent.</p>

10.1 on a 1998 Toshiba laptop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Here are my notes on running NetBSD 10.1 on my first personal laptop
that I still keep, a 1998 i586 Toshiba Satellite Pro with 81Mb of RAM
and a 1Gb IBM 2.5″ IDE HD. In summary, the latest NetBSD runs well on
this old hardware using an IDE to CF adapter and several changes to the
i386 GENERIC kernel. ↫ Joel P. I don’t think the BSD world – and NetBSD
in particular – gets enough recognition for supporting both weird
architectures and old hardware as well as it does. This here is a 26
year old laptop running the latest version of NetBSD, working X11 server
and all, while other operating systems drop support for devices only a
few years old. So many devices could be saved from toxic landfills if
only more people looked beyond Windows and macOS.</p>

a minimal, resource efficient unikernel for cloud services</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>IncludeOS is an includable, minimal unikernel operating system for
C++ services running in the cloud and on real HW. Starting a program
with #include &lt;os&gt; will literally include a tiny operating system
into your service during link-time. ↫ IncludeOS GitHub page IncludeOS
isn’t exactly the only one of its kind, but I’ve always been slightly
mystified by what, exactly, unikernels are for. The gist is, as far as I
understand it, that if you build an application using a unikernel, it
will find out at compile time exactly what it needs from the operating
system to run, and then everything it needs from the operating system to
run will be linked inside the resulting application. This can then be
booted directly by a hypervisor. The advantages are clear: you don’t
have to deal with an entire operating system just to run that one
application or service you need to provide, and footprint is kept to a
minimum because only the exact dependencies the application needs from
the operating system are linked to it during compilation. The downsides
are obvious too – you’re not running an operating system so it’s far
less flexible, and if issues are found in the unikernel you’re going to
have to recompile the application and the operating system bits inside
of it just to fix it (at least, I think that’s the case – don’t quote me
on it). IncludeOS is under heavy development, so take that under
advisement if you intend to use it for something serious. The last full
release dates back to 2019, but it’s still under development as
indicated by the GitHub activity. I hope it’ll push out a new release
soon.</p>

<h2 id="emulating-hp-ux-using-qemu">Emulating HP-UX using QEMU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>While we’re out here raising funds to make me daily-drive HP-UX 11i
v1 – we’re at 59% of the goal, so I’m starting to prepare for the pain –
it seems you can actually run older versions, HP-UX 10.20 and 11.00 to
be specific, in a virtual machine using QEMU. QEMU is an open source
computer emulation and virtualization software, first released in 2003
by Fabrice Bellard. It supports many different computer systems and
includes support for many RISC architectures besides x86. PA-RISC
emulation has been included in QEMU since 2018. QEMU emulates a complete
computer in software without the need for specific virtualization
hardware. With QEMU, a full HP Visualize B160L and C3700 workstation can
be emulated to run PA-RISC operating systems like HP-UX Unix and
compatible applications. ↫ Paul Weissman at OpenPA The emulation is
complete enough that it can run X11 and CDE, and you can choose between
emulating 32bit PA-RISC of 64bit PA-RISC. Devices and peripherals
support is a bit of a mixed bag, with things like USB being only
partially supported, and audio not working at all since an audio chip
commonly found in PA-RISC workstations isn’t supported either. A number
of SCSCI and networking devices found on HP’s workstations aren’t
supported either, and a few chipsets don’t work either. As far as
operating system support goes, you can run HP-UX 10.20, HP-UX 11.00,
Linux, and NetBSD. Newer (11i v1 and later) and older (9.07 and 9.05)
versions of HP-UX don’t work, and neither does NeXTSTEP 3.3. Some of
these issues probably stem from missing QEMU drivers, others from a lack
of testing; PA-RISC is, after all, not one of the most popular of the
dead UNIX architectures, with things like SPARC and MIPS usually taking
most of the spotlight. Absolutely nothing beats running operating
systems on the bare metal they’re designed for, but with PA-RISC
hardware becoming ever harder to obtain, it makes sense for emulation
efforts to pick up speed so more people can explore HP-UX. I’m weirdly
into HP-UX, despite its reputation as a difficult platform to work with,
so I personally really want actual hardware, but for most of you,
getting HP-UX 11i to work properly on QEMU is most likely the only way
you will ever experience this commercial UNIX.</p>

<h2 id="a-systemd-sysupdate-plugin-for-gnome-software">A
systemd-sysupdate plugin for GNOME Software</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>In late June 2024 I got asked to take over the work started by Jerry
Wu creating a systemd-sysupdate plugin for Software. The goal was to
allow Software to update sysupdate targets, such as base system images
or system extension images, all while respecting the user’s preferences
such as whether to download updates on metered connections. To do so,
the plugin communicates with the systemd-sysupdated daemon via
its org.freedesktop.sysupdate1 D-Bus interface. I didn’t know many of
the things required to complete this project and it’s been a lot to chew
in one bite for me, hence how long it took to complete. ↫ Adrien Plazas
This new plugin was one of the final pieces of moving GNOME OS – which
we talked about before – from OSTree to sysupdate, which in turn is part
of GNOME OS’ effort to have a fully trusted boot sequence. While I’m not
sure GNOME OS is something that will find a lot of uptake among the kind
of people that read OSNews, I think it’s a hugely important effort to
create a no-nonsense, easy-to-use Linux system for normal people to
embrace. The Steam Deck employs similar implementations, and it’s easy
to see why.</p>

Tasmania LAN party photos archive reminded me of my terrible teenage
fashion choices</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve never been to a LAN party, not even back in the ’90s and early
2000s when they were quite the common occurance. Both my family and
various friends did have multiple computers in the house, so I do have
fond memories of hooking up computers through null modem cables to play
Rise of the Triad, later superseded by direct Ethernet connections to
play newer games. LAN parties have left lasting impressions on those
that regularly attended them, but since most took place before the era
of ever-present digital camera and smartphones, photos of such events
are rarer than they should be. Luckily, Australian software engineer
Issung did a lot of digging and eventually struck gold: a massive
collection of photos and a few videos from LAN parties that took place
from 1996 and 2010 in Australia. After trying a few other timestamps and
a few more web searches I sadly couldn’t find anything. As a last ditch
effort I made a few posts on various forums, including the long dormant
Dark-Media Steam group, then I forgot about it all, until 2 months ago!
Someone reached out and was able to get me into a small private Facebook
group, once in I could see I had gotten more than I bargained for! I was
just looking for Dark-Media photos, but found another regular LAN I had
forgotten about, and photos from even more LANs from the late 90s. I was
able to scrape all the photos and now upload them to archive.org where
they can hopefully live forever. ↫ Issung I love browsing through these,
as they bring back so many memories of the computers and dubious fashion
choices of my teenage years – I used to combine different colours
zip-off pants, and even had mohawks, spikes, and god knows what else
before I started losing all my hair in my very early 20s. Anyway, the
biggest change is the arrival of flat displays signalling the end of the
widespread use of CRTs, and the slow dissappearence of beige in favour
of black. Such a joy to see the trends change in these photos. If anyone
else is sitting on treasure troves like these, be sure to share them
with the world before it’s too late.</p>
