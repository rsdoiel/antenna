2025-03-05 How do you process the news?
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
I‚Äôm looking at the blog and noticing that I haven‚Äôt posted much. It‚Äôs
hard.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A long time ago I discontinued all my daily newspapers and just kept the
weekly left-leaning cooperatively-owned
<a href="https://www.woz.ch/">Wochenzeitung</a>. Once a month it comes
with the German edition of <a href="https://monde-diplomatique.de/">Le
Monde Diplomatique</a>.
</p>
<p>
I used to read a lot of newspaper articles online, when I saw links in
social media. But more and more of them erected a paywall. more and more
of them have become pretty useless unless I go through the uBlock Origin
settings to unblock random domains with more scripts and things. And so
I have stopped reading them, too. And when politics look bad, I hesitate
even more.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I feel like perhaps this means the end of the attention
economy for me. Back to books?
</p>
<p>
Some news sources I follow online:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a class="account" href="https://troet.cafe/@woz" title="@woz@troet.cafe"><span
class="citation" data-cites="woz">@woz</span></a> is the feed for the
weekly paper in German that I am subscribed to
</li>
<li>
<a class="account" href="https://masto.ai/@meduza_en" title="@meduza_en@masto.ai"><span
class="citation" data-cites="meduza_en">@meduza_en</span></a> for stuff
about Russia, Ukraine and the USA
</li>
<li>

rights online
</li>
<li>
<a class="account" href="https://mstdn.social/@Bellingcat" title="@Bellingcat@mstdn.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Bellingcat">@Bellingcat</span></a> for

class="citation" data-cites="Daojoan">@Daojoan</span></a> for
independent news
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As always, the problem is that I feel the news should be a bit like
taxes: Pay something and then read what you want. The payment models
sort of imply that you‚Äôd pay for all the subscriptions, which won‚Äôt
work. Or they imply that you‚Äôd pay per article, which doesn‚Äôt work
because of the credit card fees. No micropayment means that one or two
articles is already the equivalent of the whole subscription. And even
then, I‚Äôm not sure whether micropayments would sit well with me. My
current status is that I only pay for the newspaper but
<a href="https://www.woz.ch/abo/prowoz">at a pro level</a> for CHF 590
per year and I feel that CHF 50 per month ought to pay for all of my
news.
</p>
<p>
Some days I think I should subscribe to a Swiss digital newspaper,
<a class="account" href="https://republik.social/@republik_magazin" title="@republik_magazin@republik.ch"><span
class="citation"
data-cites="republik_magazin">@republik_magazin</span></a>. Just to
support more diversity in a shrinking ecosystem. But I don‚Äôt know
whether I can process the news, to be honest.
</p>
<p>
That seems to be my main problem.
</p>
<p>
How do I process the news? üò•

Rupak Ghose‚Äôs
<a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics"><i>The
$100 billion Bloomberg for academics and lawyers?</i></a> is essential
reading for anyone interested in academic publishing. He starts by
charting the stock price of RELX, Thomson Reuters, and Wolters Kluwer,
pointing out that in the past decade they have increased about ten-fold.
He compares these publishers to
<a href="https://bloombeg.com">Bloomberg</a>, the financial news
service. They are less profitable, but that‚Äôs because their customers
are less profitable. Follow me below the fold for more on this.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> The leader in the market is
RELX, which used to be
<a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">Elsevier</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the earlier share price chart RELX was the lower of the three lines
but given its higher dividend payouts its overall shareholder returns
have paced with its peers, and it is one of the best-performing
large-cap stocks in the UK. The following chart shows that it is now in
the top five largest in the UK by stock market value and bigger than BP.
Its price-to-earnings multiple of around 30x is more like a tech giant.
</blockquote>
Well, it is only 3/4 of Nvidia‚Äôs or Apple‚Äôs PE but around the same as
Microsoft.<br /> The rest of the
<a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">oligopoly
is</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The second largest listed player is Thomson Reuters worth around $80
billion (and this trades on a much higher price-to-earnings multiple
than RELX). Add in Wolters Kluwer, and the much smaller Springer Nature
which was listed late last year, and the combined stock market value of
the four firms is more than $215 billion.
</blockquote>
Thomson Reuters‚Äô PE is around 36, a bit less than Apple‚Äôs. The $215B
market cap is pricing in massive growth, which given the uncertain
economic conditions and the finances of their customers seems
optimistic.<br /> <br />

The four companies made about $8B in profit on about $25B in revenue, or
a
<a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">gross
margin of around 32%</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The following chart illustrates the revenues and operating profits of
the four firms in 2024. RELX generated as much operating profits as its
two largest peers combined.
</blockquote>
Ghose explains how the oligopoly publishers can extract so much rent by
quoting Dan Davies‚Äô book
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unaccountability-Machine-Systems-Terrible-Decisions-ebook/dp/B0CGFWBFD6"><i>The
Unaccountability Machine</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Firstly, the customer base is captive and highly vulnerable to price
gouging. A university library has to have access to the best journals,
without which the members of the university can‚Äôt keep up with their
field or do their own research. Secondly, although the publishers who
bought the titles took over the responsibility for their administration
and distribution, this is a small part of the effort involved in
producing an academic journal, compared to the actual work of writing
the articles and peer-reviewing them. This service is provided to the
publishers by academics, for free or for a nominal payment (often paid
in books or subscriptions to journals). So not only does the industry
have both a captive customer base and a captive source of free labour,
these two commercial assets are for the most part the same group of
people.
</blockquote>
Ghose then
<a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">comments</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In essence, the academics fight to help the publishers extract monopoly
profits. The whole process depends on the value of having your articles
appear or receive citations in the best journals. This becomes an
unaccountability sink to which universities outsource their whole system
of promotion and hiring. Davies compares this to the PageRank algorithm
used by Google.
</blockquote>
The big four publishers‚Äô $25B in revenue doesn‚Äôt come exclusively from
publishing content they get for free from academics, but about
<a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">half
of it does</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This market for academic publishing generates around $20 billion of
revenue per year with half of the market controlled by the five largest
firms: Elsevier (part of RELX), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Taylor &amp;
Francis, Springer Nature, and SAGE.
</blockquote>
The distinctive feature of the market over the last decade or more has
been the publishers failing to exercise their gate-keeping role, and the
resulting flood of low-quality papers.<br /> <br />

Elsevier has been frantically acquiring and spawning
<a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">journals</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the chart below illustrates that RELX-owned Elsevier is not only the
clear market leader, but it has also grown significantly in volume.
</blockquote>
Does anyone think there is 70% more high-quality research than there was
a decade ago? The graph comes from
<a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/excessive-growth-in-the-number-of-scientific"><i>Excessive
growth in the number of scientific publications</i></a> by Beno√Æt Pier
and Laurent Romary:<br />
<blockquote>
The first result concerns the total number of articles published, which
follows very closely an exponential growth (+5.6% per year). Even taking
into account the increase in the number of researchers over this period,
we can deduce that the time spent on obtaining the results, validating
and peer reviewing them has decreased significantly.
</blockquote>
This growth has been powered by the rise of Article Processing Charges
(APCs). A journal that lives on APCs rather than subscriptions has a
strong
<a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/excessive-growth-in-the-number-of-scientific">disincentive
to reject papers</a><br />
<blockquote>
By computing the average annual number of articles published per
journal, the authors observe that the growth (significant, but not
overwhelming) of the traditional publishers is mainly due to the
expansion of the number of journals in their catalogues, whereas the
very strong growth of Frontiers and MDPI is the result of an explosive
increase in the number of articles per journal. It should be noted that
these two publishers, which appeared more recently, are thriving through
publication fees paid by authors.
</blockquote>
Pier and Romary
<a href="https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/excessive-growth-in-the-number-of-scientific">conclude</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The triad (MDPI, Frontiers, Hindawi) increasingly use special issues to
publish more and more articles, and this phenomenon is accompanied by a
significant shortening of the time allotted to the peer-review process.
</blockquote>
Pier and Romary base their article upon
<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.15884"><i>The strain on
scientific publishing</i></a> by Mark A. Hanson <i>et al</i> whose
abstract reads:<br />
<blockquote>
Scientists are increasingly overwhelmed by the volume of articles being
published. Total articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science have
grown exponentially in recent years; in 2022 the article total was
approximately ~47% higher than in 2016, which has outpaced the limited
growth - if any - in the number of practising scientists. Thus,
publication workload per scientist (writing, reviewing, editing) has
increased dramatically. We define this problem as the strain on
scientific publishing. To analyse this strain, we present five
data-driven metrics showing publisher growth, processing times, and
citation behaviours. We draw these data from web scrapes, requests for
data from publishers, and material that is freely available through
publisher websites. Our findings are based on millions of papers
produced by leading academic publishers. We find specific groups have
disproportionately grown in their articles published per year,
contributing to this strain. Some publishers enabled this growth by
adopting a strategy of hosting special issues, which publish articles
with reduced turnaround times. Given pressures on researchers to publish
or perish to be competitive for funding applications, this strain was
likely amplified by these offers to publish more articles. We also
observed widespread year-over-year inflation of journal impact factors
coinciding with this strain, which risks confusing quality signals. Such
exponential growth cannot be sustained. The metrics we define here
should enable this evolving conversation to reach actionable solutions
to address the strain on scientific publishing.

Hanson <i>et al</i> present a very revealing figure, showing (A) the
evolution through time of the mean time taken to review papers, and (B)
the distribution of those times for 2016, 2019 and 2022. The figure
shows two clear groups of publishers, more and less predatory:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The triad of predatory publishers do far less reviewing, and the amount
they do decreases over time.
</li>
<li>
The less predatory publishers do far more reviewing and the amount they
do increases over time.
</li>
<li>
The predatory publishers‚Äô distribution of review times increasingly
skews to the short end, where the other publishers‚Äô distribution is
stable and skews slightly to the long end.
</li>
</ul>
So Elsevier is the biggest player in academic publishing. How
<a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">big
is it?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
RELX Elsevier has over 3,000 journals including leading brands like the
Lancet. These journals published more than 720,000 articles in 2024.
This is almost one-fifth of all scientific articles. Elsevier‚Äôs online
platform ScienceDirect has tens of millions of pieces of peer-reviewed
content from tens of millions of researchers. Its citation database has
content from tens of thousands of journals.<br /> <br /> The scientific,
technical, and medical information division is RELX‚Äôs second largest
with revenues of around $4 billion of revenues, roughly equally split
between articles/research content vs databases, tools, and electronic
reference solutions. The business is largely subscription fee driven and
90% of its revenues are from electronic products rather than print
publishing and face-to-face events.
</blockquote>
But is it growing fast enough to justify a
<a href="https://rupakghose.substack.com/p/the-100-billion-bloomberg-for-academics">P/E
of 30?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite the growth in the number of articles, this is RELX‚Äôs
slowest-growing division with 3-4% revenue growth and 4-5% profit growth
in recent years. They are expanding in line with our faster than the
industry. But it is a very healthy cash cow with $1.5 billion of
operating profits in 2024. This circa 40% operating margin is the best
in the RELX group and far superior to other professional and business
information businesses. The number two player Springer Nature has lower
operating margins of around 30% in their academic publishing business,
but this is much higher than their other products.
</blockquote>
<p>30-40% operating margins demonstrate the oligopoly‚Äôs rent extraction.
Four of every ten dollars Elsevier extracts from the world‚Äôs education
and research budgets goes straight to their shareholders. And more goes
to their executives‚Äô salaries and bonuses.<br /> <br /></p>

<h2 id="tech-and-democracy">Tech and democracy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
I found the
<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/why-techdirt-is-now-a-democracy-blog-whether-we-like-it-or-not/">TechDirt
piece</a> by Mike Masnick about being a democracy blog disturbing
because imho it should have been about democracy at least since 2017,
when it was clear that Twitter had just elected a president of the
United States. That was a clear strong signal that tech and democracy
were tightly connected.
</p>
<p>
At the time I tried to
<a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/14/whatIfTwtrIsBoughtByARepub.html">raise
the alarm</a>, in tech and in finance, that a Republican could buy
Twitter for $12B, and that was a cheap price considering the value of
the presidency in a tech entrepreneur‚Äôs hands.
</p>
<p>
My experience in Silicon Valley goes back to the late 70s, so I have a
pretty good understanding of the personality of tech entrepreneurs.
</p>
<p>
My blog, <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a>, has been
about democracy since
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/">inception</a>, in 1994, though
it has primarily been about technology. I got the same complaints that I
should stick to tech, but I didn‚Äôt see a line of separation. The stakes
were large then, but now they‚Äôre much larger and as Masnick notes,
impossible to ignore.
</p>
<p>
In the mid-90s there was not much of a debate whether the First
Amendment applied to the web, the consensus was that it did not! The NYT
didn‚Äôt defend the 1st A on the web, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act">Congress
passed a law</a> saying the 1st A didn‚Äôt apply and a Democratic
president, Clinton, signed the law. That was a pretty clear signal. (We
were saved by a Federal appeals court, otherwise who knows what we‚Äôd be
doing now.)
</p>
<p>
In tech, every generation thinks they‚Äôre seeing a problem for the first
time. This is almost never true. It‚Äôs like anything else, we‚Äôre
iterative, going over the same issues again and again, and we have a
chance to wake up at any point and learn from our mistakes and not
repeat the previous cycle, but it seems we never do.
</p>
<p>
Most important is that we <b>work together</b> and share what we
learned. But first you have to be aware that there is history. You know
the
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/634544-those-who-cannot-remember-the-past-are-condemned-to-repeat">famous
line</a> about people who ‚Äúcannot remember the past are condemned to
repeat it.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
We have great historians working here, and TechDirt is more famous than
Scripting News is now. It would be a shame if the historians overlooked
the historic connection between tech and democracy because they weren‚Äôt
aware it was documented much earlier than 2025. And btw ‚Äì don‚Äôt miss
that <a href="https://this.how/googleAndHttp/">Google et al</a> would
like to deprecate the archive of the early web. No one is paying
attention to that problem, and it‚Äôs another way history is lost. The
wisdom of the Google people forcing this on the rest of us is very much
like the DOGE bros in DC today.

<p>People who criticize Dems for weak opposition at the SOTU are not
hypocrites only if they said before the event what they would do. I was
glad not to have to choose. I think in the end they did what made sense
to each one individually. The range of response by the Dems was much
broader than the Repubs. We should be thankful they haven‚Äôt capitulated,
as so many have, esp in what we used to think of as journalism.</p>

trying to get ChatGPT to not assume I have the same abilities as it has.
You can‚Äôt dump a huge amount of code at me and expect me to quickly see
what changed, that‚Äôs not how human intellect works, but this is
something computers are <i>extremely</i> good at. I told my bot that it
would work a lot better if they just told me what to change. I said
this: ‚ÄúI have a lot of experience being a human being and working with
other humans, and all your clients as far as I know are human.‚Äù In other
words, be concise and direct. This is what it said in response. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs
a sharp observation, and I appreciate the insight. I‚Äôll keep focusing on
clarity, directness, and being actually helpful rather than just dumping
information. If I ever seem to be leading you down a non-optimal path,
feel free to call it out!‚Äù Note how concise the response was. More
advice for the bot. Help your human understand. I think maybe eventually
we may be their pets. Try scratching behind the ears. On the other hand,
to my human friends, do not depend on the strategies they choose. They
will never on their own question the path they took. It may not be the
optimal one, but they‚Äôll keep going down it. It‚Äôs up to you to say nah
this isn‚Äôt the way I want to go, and they will always respect that. It‚Äôs
not like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy4EfdnMZ5g&t=18s">HAL
in 2001</a>. I‚Äôve sometimes wasted whole programming session going in
the wrong direction assuming my bot was good at this. None of them are,
as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>The single most important thing about what Musk is doing is that it
is Musk that is doing it. Not elected, not accountable to anyone, and
the only way we know what he‚Äôs doing is from the aftermath. We play no
role in his choices. Plus, he would be our last choice if we were in the
market for a crazy despot to ruin our country. He wasn‚Äôt born or
educated here, and thus has very little idea of who we are and thus what
the people he‚Äôs firing do.</p>

arborvitae. This is a landscape in service to human desires ‚Äî [‚Ä¶]</p>

Scripting News</strong> (date: 2025-03-03, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting

<p>Idea for SNL. A special episode of Law and Order where the cops
arrest someone for being disrespectful to Trump,. The prosecutors debate
among themselves if they have to do this, no one quits, they don‚Äôt feel
good about it but they prosecute, being assured by the District Attorney
it‚Äôs the right thing to do. When there are objections judge rules in
favor of the government most of the time, but wants to show balance so
once or twice rules in favor of the defense, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, when
the judge gives instructions to the jury he says basically the only
option is to convict, or so it seems that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs saying and
dutifully, the jury convicts. There are sentencing standards, provided
by the DOJ so the judge sentences the accused to life at hard labor.
Back in the studio at 30 Rock the audience isn‚Äôt sure if they should
laugh, slowly realizing it‚Äôs not meant to be funny, the skit fades out
to a commercial break.</p>

<p>
About one year ago, I bought an Intel N100 mini PC (specifically the
<a href="https://amzn.to/41EtTMk">GMKtec N100 NucBox G3</a>) and
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/when-did-raspberry-pi-get-so-expensive">compared
it to the Raspberry Pi 5 8GB</a>.
</p>
<p>
A year later, and we have <a href="https://amzn.to/41gFu2O">a newer $159
16GB version of that mini PC</a> with a slightly-faster Intel N150, and
a new

<h2 id="basic-ms-dos-memory-management-for-beginners">Basic MS-DOS
memory management¬†for beginners</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Liam on Linux</p>
From a
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DOS/comments/1j1efb0/wheres_my_upper_memory/">Reddit
post</a>.¬†<br /><br />
<p>
¬† ¬† ¬†A very brief rundown:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
If you are using Microsoft tools, you need to load the 386 memory
manager, <code>emm386.exe</code>, in your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> file.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
But, to do that, you need to load the XMS manager,
<code>HIMEM.SYS</code>, <em>first</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
So your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> should begin with the lines:
</p>
</li>
<pre><code> &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;pre&gt;</code></pre>
DEVICE=C:.SYS DEVICE=C:386.EXE DOS=HIGH,UMB
</pre>
<p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>That‚Äôs the easy bit. Now you have to find free Upper Memory Blocks
to tell EMM386 to use.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Do a clean boot with F5 or F8 ‚Äì telling it not to process
<code>CONFIG.SYS</code> or run <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code>. Alternatively
boot from a DOS floppy that doesn‚Äôt have them.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Run the Microsoft Diagnostics, <code>MSD.EXE</code>, or a similar
tool such as Quartdeck Manifest. Look at the memory usage between 640kB
and 1MB. Note, the numbers are in hexadecimal.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Look for unused blocks that are not ROM or I/O. Write down the
address ranges.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>An example: if you do not use monochrome VGA you can use the mono
VGA memory area: 0xB000-0xB7FF.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>One by one, tell EMM386 to use these. First choose if you want EMS
(<strong>E</strong>xpanded Memory Services) or not. It is useful for DOS
apps, but not for Windows apps.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>If you do, you need to tell it:
</p>
<pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM</pre>
<p>
<strong>And</strong> set aside 64kB for a page frame, for example by
putting this on the end of the line:
</p>
<pre>
FRAME=E0000</pre>
<p>
Or, tell it not to use one:
</p>
<pre>
FRAME=none</pre>
<p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Or disable EMS:
</p>
<pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS</pre>
<p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><strong>Important</strong> Add these parameters one at a time, and
reboot and test, every single time, without exception.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>Once you told it which you want now you need to tell it the RAM
blocks to use, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM FRAME=none I=B000-B7FF</pre>
<p>
Again, reboot every time to check. Any single letter wrong can stop the
PC booting. <em>Lots</em> of testing is vital. Every time, run MSD and
look at what is in use or is not in use. Make lots of notes, on paper.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>If you find EMM386 is trying to use a block that it mustn‚Äôt you can
eXclude it:
</p>
<pre>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE RAM X=B000-B7FF
</pre>
<p>
The more blocks you can add, the better.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>After this ‚Äì a few hours‚Äô work ‚Äì now you can try to populate your
new UMBs.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>Device drivers: do this by prefixing lines in
<code>CONFIG.SYS</code> with <code>DEVICEHIGH</code> instead of
<code>DEVICE</code>.
</p>
<p>
Change:
</p>
<pre>
DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS</pre>
<p>
To:
</p>
<pre>
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS</pre>
<p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>Try every driver, one by one, rebooting every time.
</p>
<p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li>Now move on to loadable Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs.
Prefix lines that run a program in <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> with
<code>LH</code>, which is short for <code>LOADHIGH</code>.
</p>
<p>
Replace:
</p>
<pre>
MOUSE</pre>
<p>
With:
</p>
<pre>
LH MOUSE</pre>
<p>
Use MSD and the <code>MEM</code> command ‚Äì <code>MEM /c /p</code> ‚Äì to
identify all your TSRs, note their sizes, and load them all high.
</p>
<p>
This is a day or two‚Äôs work for a novice. I could do it in only an hour
or two and typically get 625kB or more base memory free, and I made good
money from this hard-won skill.¬† ¬†

<h2 id="the-best-revenge-is-none">The best revenge is none</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-02, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/14997571.Pamela_Short">Pamela
Short</a>: The best revenge is none. Heal yourself, forgive, move on and
don‚Äôt become like those who hurt you.
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs a pragmatic reason for this. I found, when I was young and
didn‚Äôt know better, that getting revenge didn‚Äôt just hurt the target, it
also left me with a deep pain. When I did something to another person I
was also doing it to myself. I found that the dark cloud of my harmful
behavior would stay with me for a long time, maybe never going away. I
would find it hard to forgive myself for what I did. So it‚Äôs better to
not try to get revenge, and let the pain of being hurt dissipate on its
own.
</p>
<p>
I have a story to go with that. In the beginning of RSS, I had a partner
and customer ask me at lunch if there were any circumstances when I
would take the server we ran for them off the air. I said that‚Äôs a weird
question, but of course not. The very next day, his team announced they
were taking over RSS, completely changing it, and the first I heard of
it was in the public announcement. Later that same day, my brain boiling
over in anger at being treated so poorly, I did eventually land on the
idea of just taking his server offline. And then I laughed that he knew
I‚Äôd get to that, and wanted to plant a little marker there for whatever
reason, I don‚Äôt know. But no I didn‚Äôt take his server off the air. He
may be a bastard, but he did pay for the service so his server stays up.
And two years later, his project a failure, I came out with RSS 2.0 and
that was the end of that. It wasn‚Äôt revenge, it was just picking up the
ball in the playground and restarting the game that they had caused to
stop. We went on and RSS did a lot of good work.

Yesterday, my daughter was in Dallas for the NCA Cheer Competition. My
wife sent me a text letting me know her team won! Yay! My daughter is a
national champion at age 9. Ten minutes later, the next text I get is
that there‚Äôs an active shooter and they‚Äôre in lockdown. Panic consumed
the 30,000 people in the convention center. Kids trampled in the
stampede to get out. Families and teams separated. Youth running across
a 10 lane freeway to escape, traffic screeching to a halt. Horrifying.
</p>
<p>
The actual cause of the incident was some cheer parents getting into a
fight which knocked down some metal poles. The whole situation is sad.
Unnecessary trauma because some dumb parents lost their ability to be
civil. Unnecessary trauma created through our lax gun laws and inability
to stop this uniquely American horror. An unnecessary situation.
Thankfully no one was critically injured and the shooter wasn‚Äôt real‚Ä¶
this time. We‚Äôre living inside a lit powder keg at all times and its
exhausting.
