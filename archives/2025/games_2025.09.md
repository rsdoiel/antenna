## Mickey 17 belongs to a particularly weird subgenre: doppelgänger movies

date: 2025-03-09, updated: 2025-03-07, from: Polygon Website

Bong Joon Ho’s latest movie, Mickey 17, is a lot of things. It’s a story about work, cloning, colonization, inequality, first contact, and the evils of capitalism. It’s a satire, a slapstick comedy, and a sci-fi epic. It also belongs to one of the rarest and strangest subgenres of film: doppelgänger movies. Robert Pattinson plays [&#8230;]

## 3 things game creators can learn from the Balatro dev’s diary

Developer LocalThunk, the anonymous individual who made Balatro, recently published an extensive breakdown of how they made the game. The post, which details all the milestones involved with launching the indie game, goes deep on personal experiences, from self-doubt and disbelief at his success to serious health concerns and anxiety attacks. It’s also about the [&#8230;]

## You already missed the best supernatural murder mystery of the year

date: 2025-03-09, updated: 2025-03-07, from: Polygon Website

The perfect murder mystery is a rare thing to come by these days. Procedurals are a dime a dozen, of course; for FBI agents alone there’s a whole universe. But the art of a murder mystery is something more specific. Plenty of episodic procedurals borrow the idea and contain each investigation to a single episode; [&#8230;]

## The coolest game developer ever put to film appears in a very unexpected movie

date: 2025-03-08, updated: 2025-03-07, from: Polygon Website

Game developers get pretty short shrift on screen, mostly by not being represented at all. Filmmakers generally love to make movies about driven, uncompromising artists just like themselves, but for some reason — probably either snobbery, fear, or lack of understanding — they don’t often choose people who make video games as subjects. On the [&#8230;]

## Who said it, Daredevil’s Wilson Fisk or actual NYC mayor Eric Adams?

I’m both a lifelong superhero fan and a born and bred New Yorker, which means that as this week’s Daredevil: Born Again rolled out its version of Wilson “The Kingpin” Fisk’s rise to the office of mayor of New York City, I wasn’t thinking about what this would mean for Matt Murdock.

Gigantamax Charizard was one of the first Gigantamax Pokémon to show up in Pokémon Go, alongside its fellow Kanto starters, Blastoise and Venusaur.

Gigantamax Venusaur was one of the first Gigantamax Pokémon to debut in Pokémon Go, along its Kanto starter cousins, Blastoise and Charizard.

## Blizzard admits Diablo 4 was too easy, plans to crank the difficulty up next season

date: 2025-03-07, updated: 2025-03-07, from: Polygon Website

Slaying hundreds of demons is cool, but slaying hundreds of demons 20 minutes after creating your character is a little ridiculous for a loot-based action RPG. You want to feel each step as you ascend in power. Otherwise, there’s no point in chasing more loot. For many players, this is the core problem with Diablo [&#8230;]

## What is the Dragon element in Monster Hunter Wilds?

Dragon is an element in Monster Hunter Wilds that can appear on weapons as a type of damage you can deal, and on armor as a type of damage you can resist.

## Somehow my fave Marvel Comic right now is the one where the Avengers fight xenomorphs

## Atomfall mixes STALKER, Doctor Who, and Children of Men into a very British nuclear disaster
