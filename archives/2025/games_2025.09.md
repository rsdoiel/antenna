date: 2025-03-05, updated: 2025-03-04, from: Polygon Website

The lore of League of Legends is like a massive painting in progress. Some parts of the world are broad brushstrokes, enough to give you a general idea without greater detail.

The Man Without Fear returns to TV this week with Daredevil: Born Again, more than six years after the final season of Netflix’s Daredevil. But don’t let its name fool you. Born Again is not a reboot of Matt Murdock’s TV continuity; it’s picking up right where the old show left off.  Well, sort of. [&#8230;]
