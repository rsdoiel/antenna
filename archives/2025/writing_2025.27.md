## “Do the next right thing”: TV Writing Wisdom from Showrunner Jonathan Groff

date: 2025-07-11, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/do-the-next-right-thing-tv-writing-wisdom-from-showrunner-jonathan-groff" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Jonathan%20Groff%20Headshot.png" alt="Headshot of showrunner and writer Jonathan Groff" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>What makes a successful writer tick? How do they handle bad news? How have others changed their lives and how do they pay it forward?&nbsp;<br><br>If you want to learn from the best, you’ve come to the right place. Read on below for a deep dive into the mind of Jonathan Groff, writer and showrunner for such series as <em>Black-ish, Happy Endings, Scrubs</em> and <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">FD: Do you have any projects in development right now?&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jonathan Groff:</span> I do. I’m still at 20th. I was at ABC Signature for many years and then they got folded into 20th last fall and they extended my deal. I’ve done a lot of work for them over the years. Sometimes I’m in a sort of supervisory role all the way from the very beginning of an idea through the development of it. Sometimes I come in a little bit later. And then I have my own projects, too.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">FD: Do you have a life or career motto of any kind?&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jonathan Groff:</span> I think a good career motto is the idea that success is working on stuff you like with people you like. And then other success generally will follow. I’ve been very, very blessed. I haven’t had toxic work environments. When I first started out, I had a couple experiences early on that were less positive, so I learned early that when I’m in charge, I’m going to try to make it pretty positive for people. So that’s one motto.<br><br>My brother also said one that I like a lot. He’s a wonderful writer, and he may have borrowed this, but it’s: just do the next right thing.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">FD: “Do the next right thing” is a great one. There’s a productivity hack called The Hunter Method that leans into that idea of only focusing on ‘the one’ task before you. Nothing else exists until you complete that one thing. Supposed to help a lot with procrastination.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speaking of procrastination — what’s your go-to when you find yourself procrastinating or side-tracked?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jonathan Groff:</span> I try to turn my procrastination into something positive, so then I see it as not really being procrastination in that way. Like I try to go and do something, exercise, take a hike, and that actually, if I let it, can also be this great way to clear your brain and get past writer’s block or to think about something differently, because I’m literally getting the blood flowing. It’s nothing new, but, you know, I think it was Madonna who said, “If all you do is exercise in a day, at least you’ve exercised.” So you’ve got to give yourself credit for the things you do get done.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, though, like all writers, I do have a <em>little</em> bit of the chores/cleaning disease, but just a bit. My wife will tell you that I don’t have it as acutely as she would like.</p>

## What Is a Final Girl and How To Write One

date: 2025-07-09, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-is-a-final-girl-and-how-to-write-one" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Jamie%20Lee%20Curtis%20in%20Halloween.png" alt="Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<h2>What Is a Final Girl?</h2> 
<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Girl</span> is <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/using-film-tropes-in-screenwriting">a trope</a> and <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/mean-screenplay-arch">character archetype</a> associated with the horror <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-genre-is-my-screenplay">genre</a> and sometimes more specifically the slasher subgenre (although Final Girls aren’t limited to slasher films).&nbsp;<br><br>One crucial element to a Final Girl is they’re the protagonist and survivor of a film with a body count (hence, why they often appear in slasher films). A cast of characters are slowly killed off by the film’s antagonist and, in most cases, the Final Girl has to face the antagonist head on, after trying to evade them throughout the film and always narrowly escaping. Typically, the Final Girl bests or kills the antagonist and lives to see another day (and sometimes a sequel if not <span style="font-style: italic;">several</span> sequels).&nbsp;<br><br>This trope/archetype was especially popular in 1980s horror films, but you’ll still find Final Girls in many movies today. Because of this, screenwriters are always looking to put a new spin on the Final Girl and this presents a challenge: how do you create one that’s fresh and different from their predecessors? And how do you make the reader connect with and care about them?&nbsp;<br><br>But before we give tips on how to write a Final Girl, let’s take a look at some past examples.</p>

## Screenwriting Prep: 5 Things to Do Before You Write a Single Word

date: 2025-07-08, from: Final Draft blog

</div> 
<p>It’s both exciting and terrifying to start a new screenplay — whether it’s your first, second, third, or beyond.&nbsp;<br><br>The excitement takes hold because you’ve had this idea playing in your head for a while and you’re finally committed to getting that idea — and its story and character elements — onto the page. It’s always exciting to see your concepts come to life.&nbsp;<br><br>The terror can reside in the fact that you now have to bring those visuals and thoughts into the realm of screenwriting structure by way of laying it out in script format, story structure, scene description, dialogue, and characterization.&nbsp;<br><br>That’s the thrill though. That’s why screenwriters do this. You want to see your ideas and concepts grow into compelling and engaging cinematic tales that entice Hollywood to buy them and bring them to life on the screen for audiences to experience.&nbsp;<br><br>But for all of that to happen, your scripts have to not just be good — they need to be amazing. You always want to showcase your best work to the powers that be.&nbsp;<br><br>With that in mind, here we’ll share five screenwriting prep exercises you should do <span style="font-weight: bold;">before you write a single word</span>. Front-end screenwriting tasks are key to the success of any screenplay. If you do the front-end work before you jump into the writing process, your script will be far, far more successful than just jumping into the writing and “vomiting” out a quick first draft.&nbsp;</p>

## Commentary: Cory Doctorow: Rubber-Hose Cryptanalysis

date: 2025-07-07, from: Locus Magazine

<p>If there’s one thing I can’t abide, it’s nontechnical technothrillers. You know the trope: “We’ve got eight minutes to crack this mainframe, but it’s protected with encryption that is rated for ten minutes. We’re gonna have to hack really hard. Come on, hacker, HACK AWAY!”</p>
<p>Technothrillers are consumed by an increasingly computer-savvy audience, which means that the kind of technical elision and corner-cutting that dominates the field grows thinner by  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/07/commentary-cory-doctorow-rubber-hose-cryptanalysis/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
