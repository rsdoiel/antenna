## Characterization of the gut microbiota in urinary calculi patients with preoperative urinary tract infection

date: 2025-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundUrinary tract infection is one of the most common comorbidities of urinary stones. Disorders of gut microbiota can affect various infectious diseases and the formation of the stones. Therefore, alterations in the gut bacteria profile may be a potential risk factor for the development of infections in patients with urinary tract stones.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study to analyze the association of urinary tract infections with gut microbiota and serum metabolism in patients with stones.ResultsPatients with urolithiasis were predominantly in combination with diabetes mellitus (11.4% vs. 20%) and hypertension (36.4% vs. 50%). There were no statistically significant differences in hematological and urinary parameters. Compared to negative patients, IL-17A was significantly higher in the positive group (25.0 vs 21.1 pg/ml p = 0.038). The majority of pathogens detected in urine cultures were urease-negative bacteria, and urease-positive bacteria accounted for 15% of the total number of patients. We analyzed the community composition of the two groups of patients and found a significant difference in their β-diversity (p = 0.025), suggesting that dysbiosis of the gut bacteria may be associated with the combination of urinary tract infections in urolithiasis. For identification of crucial bacteria, we found changes in the abundance of both Intestinibacter (p = 0.036) and Dialister (p = 0.039), and abundance of Intestinibacter was positively correlated with IFN-α, IL-12P70 (p<0.05), and especially IL-17A (p<0.01), which may result from differences in translational, ribosomal structural and biosynthetic functions in stone patients (p < 0.05).ConclusionUrolithiasis with gut dysbiosis developed a higher incidence of urinary tract infections, which may be associated with the increasing of Intestinibacter and affect the expression of IL-17A by translational, ribosomal structural and biosynthetic function.

## Comparative study of the inhibitory effects of different antibiotic administration routes on bone healing in a rat tibial infection model

date: 2025-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous versus oral antibiotic treatments in managing bone infections, particularly osteomyelitis, using a rat tibial infection model.MethodsA tibial bone infection model was established in twelve-week-old Wistar rats via injection of Staphylococcus aureus at a cortical defect site. After six weeks, rats were treated with vancomycin (intravenous), cefazolin (intravenous), ciprofloxacin (oral), or ciprofloxacin combined with rifampin (oral). Microbial analysis, blood analysis for pro-inflammatory cytokines, micro-computed tomography (μCT), histological analysis, and osteoclast activity were used to assess the efficacy of each treatment.ResultsBlood analysis showed significant reductions in white blood cell count and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the intravenous treatment groups, especially with vancomycin. μCT imaging revealed better preservation of bone structure in intravenous treatment groups, while oral treatments resulted in more pronounced structural deterioration. Microbial analysis confirmed a lower bacterial load in the intravenous groups, particularly vancomycin, compared to oral treatments. Histological analysis revealed reduced inflammation, lower fibrosis, and minimal bacterial presence in intravenous groups. Osteoclast activity was notably reduced in the vancomycin and cefazolin groups, indicating better control of bone resorption.ConclusionIntravenous administration of vancomycin demonstrated superior efficacy in controlling bone infection, reducing inflammation, and preserving bone structure compared to oral treatments. While ciprofloxacin and the ciprofloxacin-rifampin combination showed some efficacy, they were less effective than intravenous vancomycin, likely due to lower bioavailability and insufficient drug penetration in bone tissue.

## Long-chain unsaturated free fatty acids reduce the host cell invasion of Listeria monocytogenes outbreak strains

date: 2025-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is a highly adaptable pathogen capable of causing severe foodborne infections, particularly in vulnerable populations. During infection, L. monocytogenes uses a variety of virulence factors to invade and multiply within host cells. The transcriptional regulator PrfA controls the expression of these virulence factors and is essential for the intracellular lifestyle of L. monocytogenes. Long-chain unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) have long been recognized for their antimicrobial activity and were recently shown to inhibit PrfA-dependent virulence gene expression in L. monocytogenes. To date, the antimicrobial and anti-virulent activities of FFAs have been primarily studied in laboratory strains. However, to fully evaluate their potential as anti-infective agents, it is essential to assess the effects of long-chain FFAs on clinically relevant isolates, including outbreak strains associated with high-fat food products. Here, we demonstrate that five different clinically relevant L. monocytogenes isolates are sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of long-chain unsaturated FFAs. Furthermore, at subinhibitory concentrations, these FFAs inhibit PrfA-regulated expression of virulence factors across all tested strains and reduce their invasive potential in non-phagocytic cells. These findings underscore the potential of long-chain unsaturated FFAs in developing new preventive strategies against L. monocytogenes strains associated with severe foodborne infections.

## Major antigenic differences in Aeromonas salmonicida isolates correlate with the emergence of a new strain causing furunculosis in Chilean salmon farms

date: 2025-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Aeromonas salmonicida is the etiological agent of furunculosis, a septicemic disease with high mortality rates affecting salmonids and other teleost species worldwide. Reviewing molecular diagnostic protocols for routine diagnostics, we realized that the amplification of the vapA target gene failed in some cases of furunculosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that the emergence of a new strain may be involved in recent outbreaks. In this work, we demonstrate that the vapA locus is absent in the new strain, which explains why it lacks the major membrane component VapA protein, a critical virulence factor. In addition, we found that the vapA-absent strain differs from its counterparts in outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles, suggesting profound changes at the membrane structure level and in antigenic properties. These features along with sequence analysis information allowed us to infer that a complex genomic rearrangement, probably an indel encompassing the entire vapA locus, gave rise to this membrane phenotype. Although the causes for pathogen evolution and emergence were not fully elucidated, our results strongly suggest that the vapA-absent strain is responsible for a raising proportion of recent furunculosis cases, and that it may be related to a less virulent disease and a low serological response upon vaccination with the A. salmonicida antigen formulation currently used in Chile.

## Virology, epidemiology, transmissions, diagnostic tests, prophylaxis and treatments of human Mpox: Saudi Arabia perspective

date: 2025-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Mpox (Monkeypox) is a highly contagious viral disease that can be transmitted from animal-to-human or human-to-human through intimate contact, Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), which is an enveloped double-stranded DNA that belongs to the genus Orthopoxvirus, Poxviridae family, and subfamily Chordopoxvirinae. Mpox cases were previously only reported in West and Central Africa, however in recent times non-endemic countries including Saudi Arabia (SA) also reported confirmed Mpox cases. The first laboratory-confirmed human Mpox case in SA was reported on 14 July 2022, since then a number of confirmed Mpox cases have been reported by WHO in SA. These confirmed Mpox cases in SA were observed among individuals with a history of visiting European Union countries. SA is not only at risk of importation of Mpox cases owing to travel to such countries, but also there are various other risk factors including geographic proximity to the African continent, trade in exotic animals, and massive inflow of tourists. Therefore, government health authorities of SA should continue to collaborate with various international health organizations including WHO to prevent, manage or monitor potential health risks at most of the entry points in SA including highways, seaports, and airports by ensuring adherence to hygiene protocols, vaccinations, and health screenings. There are a range of diagnostic tests are currently available that can be used in SA to confirm Mpox infections, including real-time PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, serological testing, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas)-based systems, whole-genome sequencing, electron microscopy, and virus isolation and culture. There is no approved treatment specifically for Mpox, however multiple approved antiviral agents for smallpox treatment were found to be useful in Mpox treatment and in the management of Mpox outbreaks, such as- trifluridine, brincidofovir, tecovirimat, and cidofovir. The aim of this review is to provide valuable insights regarding virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, transmissions, clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, prophylactic measures and therapeutic options of Mpox from SA perspective. Moreover, a side-by-side discussion on the global trend and scenarios of Mpox has been provided for comparison and further improvement in measures against Mpox in SA.

## Establishment of a novel double-antibody sandwich fluorescence microsphere immunochromatographic test strip for rapid detection of swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) infection

date: 2025-02-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionSwine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes clinical symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea in 10-day-old piglets. SADS-CoV has caused significant economic losses in the swine industry in southern China. Currently, no effective treatments or vaccines are available for this disease, making it crucial to establish a point-of-care testing (POCT) technology for early diagnosis and prevention.MethodsIn this study, we first validated the specificity and immunogenicity of four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the nucleocapsid (N) protein of swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). The optimal antibody pair for constructing the fluorescent microsphere-based immunochromatographic assay (FM-ICA) was determined through systematic pairwise screening. Critical parameters of the FM-ICA test strip, including antibody labeling concentration, coating concentration, incubation time, and sample dilution ratio, were subsequently optimized. Analytical performance characteristics of the developed FM-ICA were then rigorously evaluated. Finally, clinical validation was conducted by parallel testing of 72 field samples using both FM-ICA and quantitative PCR (qPCR), followed by concordance rate analysis.ResultsFirst, we demonstrated that all four monoclonal antibodies exhibited favorable immunogenicity and specificity. Subsequently, mAb 12E1 was identified as the coating antibody, and mAb 5G12 was selected as the labeled antibody, forming the optimal combination for FM-ICA preparation. After optimization, the ideal parameters were determined: a labeling concentration of 200 μg/mg for antibodies, a coating concentration of 1 mg/mL, an incubation time of 10 min, and a dilution factor of 10. The FM-ICA exhibited outstanding specificity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and stability, achieving a maximum detectable dilution factor of 1280 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 78 PFU mL⁻¹. Finally, the concordance rate between FM-ICA and qPCR for clinical samples reached 97.22%.DiscussionThese results indicate that FM-ICA is an excellent POCT technology that can be used for the early diagnosis of SADS-CoV, providing support for disease prevention and treatment.

date: 2025-02-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe synthesis of natural compounds with strong biological activity from affordable sources has proven challenging for scientists. As a natural resource rich in a variety of bioactive substances, fungal metabolites have the potential to be used in medical applications to serve a global purpose towards a sustainable future.MethodsA total of 25 filamentous fungi were isolated, and their secondary metabolites were assessed for their antimicrobial efficiency. ResultsThe extracellular extract of the strain Penicillium chrysogenum Pc was selected for its high bioactivity compared with the other whole isolates. The GC-MS analysis of the extracellular extract of P. chrysogenum Pc was found to contain approximately 16 variable compounds. After several separation and purification processes using flash chromatography, HPLC, TLC, NMR, and FTIR, the most bioactive compound was identified as (Z)-13-docosenamide or erucylamide with a molecular formula of C22H43NO and a molecular weight of 337.0. The purified (Z)-13-docosenamide possessed antimicrobial activity with an MIC of approximately 10 μg/mL for the tested pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli), and 20 μg/mL against the tested fungi (Penicillium aurantiogriseum and Aspergillus fumigatus). Furthermore, MTT assay showed that (Z)-13-docosenamide inhibited cellviability and the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma, in vitro, with an IC {sb}{/sb}50 of 23.8 ± 0.8 μg/mL.ConclusionThe remarkable bioactivity of (Z)-13- docosenamide makes it a potential candidate to assist the pipeline for the creation of antibacterial and anticancer drugs, which will help to reduce the incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and fatalities related to cancer.

## In-depth genome and comparative genome analysis of a metal-resistant environmental isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa S-8

date: 2025-02-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The present study aimed to identify the mechanisms underlying the survival of an environmental bacterium originally isolated from the waste-contaminated soil of Jhiri, Ranchi, India. Based on 16S rRNA, ANI (average nucleotide identity), and BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG) analysis, the isolated strain was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The present study extends the characterization of this bacterium through genomic and comparative genomic analysis to understand the genomic features pertaining to survival in stressed environments. The sequencing of the bacterium at Illumina HiSeq platform revealed that it possessed a 6.8 Mb circular chromosome with 65.9% GC content and 63 RNAs sequence. The genome also harbored several genes associated to plant growth promotion i.e. phytohormone and siderophore production, phosphate solubilization, motility, and biofilm formation, etc. The genomic analysis with online tools unraveled the various genes belonging to the bacterial secretion system, antibiotic resistance, virulence, and efflux pumps, etc. The presence of biosynthetic gene clusters (BCGs) indicated that large numbers of genes were associated to non-ribosomal synthesized peptide synthetase, polyketide synthetase, and other secondary metabolite production. Additionally, its genomes encode various CAZymes such as glycoside hydrolases and other genes associated with lignocellulose breakdown, suggesting that strain S-8 have strong biomass degradation potential. Furthermore, pan-genome analysis based on a comparison of whole genomes showed that core genome represented the largest part of the gene pools. Therefore, genome and comparative genome analysis of Pseudomonas strains is valuable for understanding the mechanism of resistance to metal stress, genome evolution, HGT events, and therefore, opens a new perspective to exploit a newly isolated bacterium for biotechnological applications.

## Age-specific kinetics of neutralizing antibodies and infection enhancement among ≤1 year-old Indian infants

date: 2025-02-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundInfants born to dengue-immune mothers acquire maternal antibodies to dengue. Maternal antibodies decline over time, making infants susceptible to primary dengue infections. Another important concern is the role of maternal antibodies in causing antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) during primary infections. In this study, we aimed to investigate the kinetics of dengue virus (DENV)-neutralizing antibodies and infection-enhancing activity in Indian infants.MethodsHealthy infants at birth (cord blood), and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age (n=32/group) were included in this cross-sectional study. Serum samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies using the foci-reduction neutralization test and enhancing antibodies using the ADE assay against DENV1-4 serotypes.ResultsNeutralizing antibody positivity declined with the increasing age of the infants. Undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies to DENV1-4 serotypes were reported in 84% of infants by 9 months. Significantly lower neutralizing antibody titers were also reported in 9-month-old infants compared to that in 6-month-old infants and infants at birth. Comparable levels of enhancement of DENV1-4 infection at a particular dilution to at least one serotype were noted in infants at 3 and 6 months of age. Fold enhancement of DENV1-4 infection was found to be highest in 6-month-old infants at a dilution of 1:20. In summary, our data suggests that DENV infection–enhancing activity aligns with the decline of neutralizing antibodies.ConclusionOur study indicates that maternally acquired neutralizing antibodies could be protective until 6 months of age and capable of facilitating ADE on exposure to dengue infections in later months of life.

## Synergistic antifungal effects and mechanisms of amantadine hydrochloride combined with azole antifungal drugs on drug-resistant Candida albicans

date: 2025-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe increasing resistance of Candida albicans (C. albicans) to conventional antifungal drugs poses a great challenge to the clinical treatment of infections caused by this yeast. Drug combinations are a potential therapeutic approach to overcome the drug- resistance of C. albicans. This study explored the synergistic effects of amantadine hydrochloride (AMH) combined with azole antifungal drugs against drug-resistant C. albicans in vitro and in vivo.MethodsThe in vitro sensitivity of Candida spp. to drugs was determined by the microdilution method. The effect of drugs on the efflux pump activity of C. albicans was determined by the rhodamine 6G tracer method. The egg yolk agar plate method was used to determine the activity of extracellular phospholipase, a C. albicans virulence factor. The Galleria mellonella model of C. albicans infection was used to test the in vivo efficacy of the combination therapy.ResultsIn vitro experiments showed that combinations of AMH with azole antifungal drugs had synergistic antifungal effects on planktonic cells of drug-resistant C. albicans, with fractional inhibitory concentration index values of <0.5. The in vivo synergistic effects and mechanism of drug combinations with AMH were further studied using fluconazole (FLC) as a representative azole antifungal drug. In vivo, G. mellonella larvae were used to evaluate the antifungal efficacy of AMH +FLC. AMH + FLC treatment increased the survival rate of larvae infected with drug-resistant C. albicans and reduced tissue invasion. Studies of the mechanism of synergy showed that AMH inhibited drug efflux pump activity in drug-resistant C. albicans, and that AMH + FLC synergistically inhibited early biofilms and the extracellular phospholipase activity of drug-resistant C. albicans.ConclusionThis study provides strong evidence that combinations of non-antifungal drugs and antifungal drugs can effectively overcome drug-resistant C. albicans infection. Both AMH and FLC are FDA-approved drugs, eliminating concerns about safety. Our findings provide a foundation for further clinical antifungal research.

## Inflammatory and neuropathological responses to Vesiculovirus carajas encephalitis in adult mice: variability, tolerance and resistance

date: 2025-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Vesiculovirus carajas (CARV) is a pathogen with neuroinvasive potential, yet its impact on neuroinflammation and sickness behavior remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the neuropathological and immunological responses to CARV encephalitis in adult BALB/c mice. Mice were intranasally inoculated with either infected or uninfected brain homogenates, and clinical, histopathological, and cytokine profiles were analyzed. CARV antigens were primarily detected in necrotic neurons, with prominent microglial activation near the ventricles and blood vessels. By day 10 post-infection, infected mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of MCP-1, IFN-γ, IL-12 p70, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in the brain, indicating a strong inflammatory response. These findings highlight the inflammatory modulation associated with CARV infection and suggest a hematogenous route of neuroinvasion, distinguishing CARV from other vesiculovirus species. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of CARV encephalitis and its potential impact on neuroimmune dynamics.

## L-serine metabolic regulation and host respiratory homeostasis

date: 2025-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

L-Serine, a non-essential amino acid (NEAA), can be obtained through diet or in situ synthesis. Functionally, L-serine not only serves as the precursor of other amino acids, lipids, and nucleotides, but also participates in the folate/methionine cycle. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that L-serine is widely used in the adjuvant therapy of many diseases (e.g., inflammation, infections, fibrosis, and tumors). Here, we summarize the synthesis and metabolism of serine followed by its functions in health and disease. Moreover, we delineate the potential mechanisms whereby L-serine is involved in the occurrence and progression of respiratory diseases. This review aims to summarize the research progress of serine in diseases, propose the problems that need to be solved in the future, and provide guidance for subsequent research and development.

## Establishment and validation of a dual qPCR method for the detection of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in bloodstream infections

date: 2025-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveBloodstream infections(BSIs) caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) have a high mortality rate due to the high levels of drug resistance. There is an urgent need to establish a sensitive and accurate detection method to rapidly detect CRAB in BSIs.MethodsA new method was developed based on fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the specific region of 16sRNA and OXA-23 gene from CRAB. The parameters were evaluated and optimized. This qPCR method was further applied in the detection of AB from 30 clinical specimens.ResultsThe qPCR method established in this study showed high specificity. The method successfully differentiated Acinetobacter baumannii(A. baumanii) from 26 other common pathogens in BSIs and identify the carbapenem resistance gene. The qPCR method shows a limit of detection (LOD) of 3×10-3 ng/μL, and displays good linear relationship between 16sRNA and OXA-23 and excellent repeatability (CV ≤2%). The results for the detection of 30 clinical specimens using this new qPCR method are in complete agreement with those using blood culture and drug susceptibility test.ConclusionThe qPCR method established in this study has strong specificity, wide linear range, good repeatability, and a lower LOD than PCR (Non-fluorescence quantification). The method provides new technical support for the early clinical diagnosis of CRAB in BSIs.

## Monte Carlo simulation to optimize polymyxin B dosing regimens for the treatment of Gram-negative bacteremia

date: 2025-02-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThis study aimed to predict and evaluate the efficacy of various polymyxin B dosing regimens for Gram-negative bacteremia using Monte Carlo simulation, with a specific focus on assessing the efficacy in patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The goal was to optimize clinical dosing regimens and guide rational polymyxin B use in practice.MethodsA total of 1,939 Gram-negative bacterial strains were analyzed, collected between April 2019 and December 2021 through the China Bloodstream Gram-negative Pathogens Antimicrobial Resistance and Virulence Surveillance Network (CARVIS-NET). Pharmacokinetic parameters of polymyxin B from existing literature were used to conduct a Monte Carlo simulation based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) theory. The probability of target attainment (PTA) and cumulative fraction of response (CFR) were evaluated across various dosing regimens.ResultsThe main pathogens of Gram-negative bacteremia were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, all of which demonstrated high susceptibility to polymyxin B. For pathogens with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≤1 mg/L, all regimens achieved PTA >90%. However, when the MIC increased to 2 mg/L, the PTA for the 500,000 IU q12h regimen decreased to 77.53%, and at an MIC of 4 mg/L, none of the dosing regimens achieved a PTA >90%. For P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae with MIC ≤0.5 mg/L, all regimens demonstrated effectiveness. However, at MIC ≥1 mg/L, significant declines in PTA were observed, with the 500,000 IU q12h and 1.25 mg/kg q12h regimens yielding suboptimal outcomes. In CRRT patients, PTA values declined further, particularly against K. pneumoniae, raising concerns about potential treatment failure.ConclusionPolymyxin B demonstrates high efficacy for Gram-negative bacteremia with MIC ≤1 mg/L. However, efficacy diminishes as MIC increases, particularly for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, where 500,000 IU q12h and 1.25 mg/kg q12h regimens may result in suboptimal outcomes. For CRRT patients with K. pneumoniae bacteremia, therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustments are crucial to mitigate treatment failure risks.

## Cerebrospinal fluid profiles of targeted metabolomics on neurotransmitters in patients with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis

date: 2025-02-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPost-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis (PNBM) is a severe complication in patients receiving neurosurgical treatments. Pathogens and neuroinflammation have been reported to influence metabolites in the microenvironment of the central nervous system. However, information about the relationship between neurotransmitter levels and PNBM is still limited. In this study, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic potential of neurotransmitters for PNBM in the patients with stroke.MethodsIn this study, a total of 66 stroke patients were recruited. Among them, 40 patients were complicated with PNBM. We profiled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of neurotransmitter precursors and metabolites using the targeted metabolomics method, which contained 26 precursors and metabolites of neurotransmitters, using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS).ResultsWe found that 14 biomarkers were downregulated but 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) was upregulated in the CSF of PNBM patients. Among the biomarkers, D-glutamine (AUC=1.000), Boc-D-Tyr-OH (AUC=0.9447), L(+)-arginine (AUC=0.9418), and DOPAC (AUC=0.9173) had strong diagnostic efficiency for PNBM. Bioinformatic analysis showed that tyrosine metabolism, butanoate metabolism, histidine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism might be involved in the pathogenesis of PNBM. After reviewing previous studies, we found a probable diverse pathophysiological alteration between PNBM and community-acquired bacterial meningitis.ConclusionsIn summary, we identified downregulated levels of D-glutamine, Boc-D-Tyr-OH, L(+)-arginine, and phenprobamate, and an upregulated level of DOPAC in CSF to have strong diagnostic efficiencies. The results also offered potential targets for the treatment of PNBM.

## Enhancing antibiotic therapy through comprehensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles

date: 2025-02-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Antibiotic therapy relies on understanding both pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), which respectively address drug absorption, distribution, and elimination, and the relationship between drug concentration and antimicrobial efficacy. This review synthesizes decades of research, drawing from in-vitro studies, in-vivo models, and clinical observations, to elucidate the temporal dynamics of antibiotic activity. We explore how these dynamics, including concentration-effect relationships and post antibiotic effects, inform the classification of antibiotics based on their PD profiles. Additionally, we discuss the pivotal role of PK/PD principles in determining optimal dosage regimens. By providing a comprehensive overview of PK/PD principles in antibiotic therapy, this review aims to enhance understanding and improve treatment outcomes in clinical practice.

## Global research trends in the intestinal microflora and depression: bibliometrics and visual analysis

date: 2025-02-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundIn recent years, the relationship between gut microbiota and human health has garnered significant attention. Notably, the potential connection between gut microbiota and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, has emerged as a new focal point for research. While some studies suggest a possible link between these factors, the field remains in its early stages of development, and there are notable methodological and sample size limitations.PurposeThis study aims to systematically summarize the knowledge systems, research hotspots, and development trends related to intestinal microflora within the context of depression research.MethodsThis study conducted a search for publications related to intestinal microflora and depression in the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) prior to August 6, 2024. The selected literature was subsequently analyzed using VOSviewer (v.1.6.20), SCImago Graphica (v.1.0.39), and CiteSpace (v.6.3.1).ResultsThe study encompassed a total of 1,046 publications, demonstrating a consistent increase in annual publication volume. The primary research countries identified are China and the United States, with notable contributions from institutions such as the University of California and University College Cork, among others. Keywords analysis highlighted high-frequency terms including “gut microbiota,” “depression,” and “anxiety,” and revealed 10 keyword clusters along with 20 strongest citation bursts keywords. The focus of research has shifted from compositional analysis of gut microbiota to its role in the pathogenesis of depression.ConclusionsResearch on gut microbiota and depression is growing, but there is still a need for greater collaboration between authors and institutions across regions, more ongoing interaction and communication to further explore the mechanisms of action of gut microbiota, to develop microbiota-based interventions, and to facilitate translation of research findings into clinical practice.

## Drug resistance mutations to integrase inhibitors, proteinase, and reverse transcriptase inhibitors in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections in Hebei province, China, 2018–2022

date: 2025-02-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundHIV-1 protease (PR)-reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors as national free antiretroviral drugs have been used for 20 years. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been conditionally used as a component of HIV/AIDS treatment regimens in recent years. However, the systematic investigation on the changes in primary drug resistance (PDR) in Hebei province, China was limited.MethodsA continuous cross-sectional investigation on HIV-1 PDR was conducted, integrating detection of drug resistance genotype, molecular network, and statistical analysis.ResultsThe overall prevalence of PDR was 8.3%, with 77 of 925 samples showing different levels of resistance to INSTIs (1.9%), protease inhibitors (PIs, 0.2%), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, 1.2%), and non-NRTIs (NNRTIs, 5.2%). In the PR-RT gene coding region, E138EK/G was the most common (1.6%), followed by K103N (1.4%), G190GE/A/S (0.6%), K101E (0.5%), A98G (0.4%), and T215I/TS (0.3%), associated with the low- to high-level resistance to doravirine (DOR), efavirenz (EFV), etravirine (ETR), nevirapine (NVP), rilpivirine (RPV), and zidovudine (AZT). In the INSTI gene coding region, six mutations were identified, namely, four major mutations (P145PS, Q148QH, Y143S, and T66A) and two accessory mutations (S153SF and G163GRS/EK). Of these mutations, the most frequent INSTI mutations were S153SF (0.6%) and G163GRS/EK (0.6%), followed by P145PS (0.2%), Y143S (0.2%), Q148QH (0.1%), and T66A (0.1%). G163GRS/EK, P145PS, Y143S, and T66A were associated with the resistance to elvitegravir (EVG) and raltegravir (RAL). S153SF and Q148QH were mainly related to the resistance to dolutegravir (DTG), bictegravir (BIC), and caboteravir (CAB). Furthermore, 30 resistant sequences were circulating in 16 transmission networks with HIV-1 DR mutations (DRMs), accounting for 62.5% of 77 total participants with DRMs. Multivariable analysis showed that those who had CRF07_BC had 1.79 times greater odds of PDR compared with participants with CRF01_AE. Compared to participants with volunteer blood donor, those with voluntary consultation and testing had 0.27 times greater odds of PDR.ConclusionsThe overall prevalence of HIV-1 PDR in Hebei is high, belonging to a moderate resistant level (5.0%–15.0%). It is necessary for us to strengthen the effective surveillance of PDR among treatment-naive patients, and we should adjust the treatment plan according to the results of PDR surveillance.

## Differential effects of high-fat diet on salivary and gut microbiota

date: 2025-02-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesMicroorganisms contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity, while more studies focus on gut microbiome. However, the relationship between oral microbiota and obesity has yet to be elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the similarities and differences in the effects of a high-fat diet on salivary and gut microbiota through mouse experiments, exploring the hypothesis that oral microbial mechanisms may contribute to obesity.MethodsAn obese mouse model was established in male C57BL/6J mice by feeding a high-fat diet, confirmed by body weight records and blood glucose tests. This study evaluated the physiological effects of the high-fat diet on mice. 16S rRNA sequencing technology was used to analyze changes in salivary and gut microbiota, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to evaluate 17 short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids quantitatively.ResultsThe microbiota distribution in salivary was different between the high-fat diet (HFD) and normal chow diet (NCD) groups. At the genus level of salivary microbiota, Streptococcus and Escherichia were highly abundant in the HFD group. Rodentibacter and Turicibacter were more abundant in the NCD group. Regarding the gut microbiome, the diversity changes of gut microbiota are more significant than those of salivary microbiota. The HFD group had a significantly higher abundance of Kineothrix, Cryptobacteroides, and a lower abundance of CAG-485. Nine genera had consistent alterations in salivary and gut microbiota, among which Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, and Intestinimonas were significantly correlated with physiological indicators, and Muribaculum was significantly correlated with increased decanoic acid levels in the HFD group. The dysregulated nine genera were associated with significant upregulation of certain metabolic pathways of the HFD group, including the pentose phosphate, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, and steroid biosynthesis pathways.ConclusionsThere are differences and similarities in the effects of HFD on salivary and gut microbiota. Certain genera of the oral-gut axis altered consistently by HFD may affect obesity through mechanisms involving metabolic pathways and inflammation.

## Biological boundary conditions regulate the internalization of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia by alveolar cells

date: 2025-02-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe lung environment is defined by unique biological boundary conditions, including complex alveolar geometry, extracellular matrix composition and mechanical forces generated during respiration. These factors were shown to regulate alveolar permeability, surfactant secretion, cell contractility and apoptosis, but their role in fungal infections remains unknown. Aspergillus fumigatus is a critical fungal pathogen that causes severe pulmonary infections in immunocompromised individuals. Our study addresses a knowledge gap by investigating how boundary conditions affect A. fumigatus conidia interactions with alveolar epithelial cells.MethodsWe applied micropatterned substrates to confine cells into defined shapes and densities, allowing precise control over geometric conditions and extracellular matrix composition. Using cell line stably expressing the phagolysosomal protein Lamp1-NeonGreen and multiplane fluorescent microscopy, we evaluated A. fumigatus conidia binding and internalization efficiency.ResultsWe observed significantly faster and more efficient A. fumigatus conidia internalization in cells confined on micropatterns compared to previously reported studies using cell monolayers. Altering cell geometry, density and extracellular matrix composition strongly affected conidia binding and localization to Lamp1+ phagolysosomes. Cells on X-shaped or multicellular micropatterns showed higher internalization rates, particularly at the periphery, suggesting spatial heterogeneity in pathogen uptake. Additionally, changes in extracellular matrix composition influenced the intracellular trafficking of A. fumigatus conidia.DiscussionOur findings emphasize the essential role that local mechanical and biochemical cues play in shaping the interactions between fungal pathogens and alveolar cells. Understanding how lung boundary conditions change in disease states will provide important insights into fungal infection outcomes.

## A critical review of microbiome-derived metabolic functions and translational research in liver diseases

date: 2025-02-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Significant changes in gut microbial composition are associated with chronic liver disease. Using preclinical models, it has been demonstrated that ethanol/alcohol-induced liver disease is transmissible through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). So, the survival rate of people with severe alcoholic hepatitis got better, which suggests that changes in the makeup and function of gut microbiota play a role in metabolic liver disease. The leaky intestinal barrier plays a major role in influencing metabolic-related liver disease development through the gut microbiota. As a result, viable bacteria and microbial products can be transported to the liver, causing inflammation, contributing to hepatocyte death, and causing the fibrotic response. As metabolic-related liver disease starts and gets worse, gut dysbiosis is linked to changes in the immune system, the bile acid composition, and the metabolic function of the microbiota in the gut. Metabolic-related liver disease, as well as its self-perpetuation, will be demonstrated using data from preclinical and human studies. Further, we summarize how untargeted treatment approaches affect the gut microbiota in metabolic-related liver disease, including dietary changes, probiotics, antibiotics, and FMT. It discusses how targeted therapies can improve liver disease in various areas. These approaches may improve metabolic-related liver disease treatment options.

## Antivirotics based on defective interfering particles: emerging concepts and challenges

date: 2025-02-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Viruses are obligate parasites, that use the host’s internal metabolic systems for their own reproduction. This complicates the search for molecular targets to prevent the spread of viral infection without disrupting the vital functions of human cells. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are natural competitors of viruses for important resources of viral reproduction. DIPs emerge during infection, originate from the normal viral replication process and inhibit its progression, making them an interesting candidate for antiviral therapy. Here we describe the biology of DIPs, advances in DIP-based antiviral technology, analyze their therapeutic potential and provide a systemic overview of existing preventive and therapeutic antiviral strategies.
