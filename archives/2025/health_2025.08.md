## Drug resistance mutations to integrase inhibitors, proteinase, and reverse transcriptase inhibitors in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infections in Hebei province, China, 2018–2022

date: 2025-02-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundHIV-1 protease (PR)-reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors as national free antiretroviral drugs have been used for 20 years. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been conditionally used as a component of HIV/AIDS treatment regimens in recent years. However, the systematic investigation on the changes in primary drug resistance (PDR) in Hebei province, China was limited.MethodsA continuous cross-sectional investigation on HIV-1 PDR was conducted, integrating detection of drug resistance genotype, molecular network, and statistical analysis.ResultsThe overall prevalence of PDR was 8.3%, with 77 of 925 samples showing different levels of resistance to INSTIs (1.9%), protease inhibitors (PIs, 0.2%), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, 1.2%), and non-NRTIs (NNRTIs, 5.2%). In the PR-RT gene coding region, E138EK/G was the most common (1.6%), followed by K103N (1.4%), G190GE/A/S (0.6%), K101E (0.5%), A98G (0.4%), and T215I/TS (0.3%), associated with the low- to high-level resistance to doravirine (DOR), efavirenz (EFV), etravirine (ETR), nevirapine (NVP), rilpivirine (RPV), and zidovudine (AZT). In the INSTI gene coding region, six mutations were identified, namely, four major mutations (P145PS, Q148QH, Y143S, and T66A) and two accessory mutations (S153SF and G163GRS/EK). Of these mutations, the most frequent INSTI mutations were S153SF (0.6%) and G163GRS/EK (0.6%), followed by P145PS (0.2%), Y143S (0.2%), Q148QH (0.1%), and T66A (0.1%). G163GRS/EK, P145PS, Y143S, and T66A were associated with the resistance to elvitegravir (EVG) and raltegravir (RAL). S153SF and Q148QH were mainly related to the resistance to dolutegravir (DTG), bictegravir (BIC), and caboteravir (CAB). Furthermore, 30 resistant sequences were circulating in 16 transmission networks with HIV-1 DR mutations (DRMs), accounting for 62.5% of 77 total participants with DRMs. Multivariable analysis showed that those who had CRF07_BC had 1.79 times greater odds of PDR compared with participants with CRF01_AE. Compared to participants with volunteer blood donor, those with voluntary consultation and testing had 0.27 times greater odds of PDR.ConclusionsThe overall prevalence of HIV-1 PDR in Hebei is high, belonging to a moderate resistant level (5.0%–15.0%). It is necessary for us to strengthen the effective surveillance of PDR among treatment-naive patients, and we should adjust the treatment plan according to the results of PDR surveillance.

## Differential effects of high-fat diet on salivary and gut microbiota

date: 2025-02-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesMicroorganisms contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity, while more studies focus on gut microbiome. However, the relationship between oral microbiota and obesity has yet to be elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the similarities and differences in the effects of a high-fat diet on salivary and gut microbiota through mouse experiments, exploring the hypothesis that oral microbial mechanisms may contribute to obesity.MethodsAn obese mouse model was established in male C57BL/6J mice by feeding a high-fat diet, confirmed by body weight records and blood glucose tests. This study evaluated the physiological effects of the high-fat diet on mice. 16S rRNA sequencing technology was used to analyze changes in salivary and gut microbiota, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to evaluate 17 short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids quantitatively.ResultsThe microbiota distribution in salivary was different between the high-fat diet (HFD) and normal chow diet (NCD) groups. At the genus level of salivary microbiota, Streptococcus and Escherichia were highly abundant in the HFD group. Rodentibacter and Turicibacter were more abundant in the NCD group. Regarding the gut microbiome, the diversity changes of gut microbiota are more significant than those of salivary microbiota. The HFD group had a significantly higher abundance of Kineothrix, Cryptobacteroides, and a lower abundance of CAG-485. Nine genera had consistent alterations in salivary and gut microbiota, among which Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, and Intestinimonas were significantly correlated with physiological indicators, and Muribaculum was significantly correlated with increased decanoic acid levels in the HFD group. The dysregulated nine genera were associated with significant upregulation of certain metabolic pathways of the HFD group, including the pentose phosphate, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, and steroid biosynthesis pathways.ConclusionsThere are differences and similarities in the effects of HFD on salivary and gut microbiota. Certain genera of the oral-gut axis altered consistently by HFD may affect obesity through mechanisms involving metabolic pathways and inflammation.

## Biological boundary conditions regulate the internalization of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia by alveolar cells

date: 2025-02-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe lung environment is defined by unique biological boundary conditions, including complex alveolar geometry, extracellular matrix composition and mechanical forces generated during respiration. These factors were shown to regulate alveolar permeability, surfactant secretion, cell contractility and apoptosis, but their role in fungal infections remains unknown. Aspergillus fumigatus is a critical fungal pathogen that causes severe pulmonary infections in immunocompromised individuals. Our study addresses a knowledge gap by investigating how boundary conditions affect A. fumigatus conidia interactions with alveolar epithelial cells.MethodsWe applied micropatterned substrates to confine cells into defined shapes and densities, allowing precise control over geometric conditions and extracellular matrix composition. Using cell line stably expressing the phagolysosomal protein Lamp1-NeonGreen and multiplane fluorescent microscopy, we evaluated A. fumigatus conidia binding and internalization efficiency.ResultsWe observed significantly faster and more efficient A. fumigatus conidia internalization in cells confined on micropatterns compared to previously reported studies using cell monolayers. Altering cell geometry, density and extracellular matrix composition strongly affected conidia binding and localization to Lamp1+ phagolysosomes. Cells on X-shaped or multicellular micropatterns showed higher internalization rates, particularly at the periphery, suggesting spatial heterogeneity in pathogen uptake. Additionally, changes in extracellular matrix composition influenced the intracellular trafficking of A. fumigatus conidia.DiscussionOur findings emphasize the essential role that local mechanical and biochemical cues play in shaping the interactions between fungal pathogens and alveolar cells. Understanding how lung boundary conditions change in disease states will provide important insights into fungal infection outcomes.

## A critical review of microbiome-derived metabolic functions and translational research in liver diseases

date: 2025-02-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Significant changes in gut microbial composition are associated with chronic liver disease. Using preclinical models, it has been demonstrated that ethanol/alcohol-induced liver disease is transmissible through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). So, the survival rate of people with severe alcoholic hepatitis got better, which suggests that changes in the makeup and function of gut microbiota play a role in metabolic liver disease. The leaky intestinal barrier plays a major role in influencing metabolic-related liver disease development through the gut microbiota. As a result, viable bacteria and microbial products can be transported to the liver, causing inflammation, contributing to hepatocyte death, and causing the fibrotic response. As metabolic-related liver disease starts and gets worse, gut dysbiosis is linked to changes in the immune system, the bile acid composition, and the metabolic function of the microbiota in the gut. Metabolic-related liver disease, as well as its self-perpetuation, will be demonstrated using data from preclinical and human studies. Further, we summarize how untargeted treatment approaches affect the gut microbiota in metabolic-related liver disease, including dietary changes, probiotics, antibiotics, and FMT. It discusses how targeted therapies can improve liver disease in various areas. These approaches may improve metabolic-related liver disease treatment options.

## Antivirotics based on defective interfering particles: emerging concepts and challenges

date: 2025-02-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Viruses are obligate parasites, that use the host’s internal metabolic systems for their own reproduction. This complicates the search for molecular targets to prevent the spread of viral infection without disrupting the vital functions of human cells. Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are natural competitors of viruses for important resources of viral reproduction. DIPs emerge during infection, originate from the normal viral replication process and inhibit its progression, making them an interesting candidate for antiviral therapy. Here we describe the biology of DIPs, advances in DIP-based antiviral technology, analyze their therapeutic potential and provide a systemic overview of existing preventive and therapeutic antiviral strategies.
