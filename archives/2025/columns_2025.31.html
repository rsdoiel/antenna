<p>Since the govt is no longer funding NPR maybe they could stop bending
over for the Repubs. Lay it all out there, stop spinning all the crazy

They know we’re in a lot deeper. Since we’re now paying the bills, how
about plain facts.</p>

<h2 id="antisemitism-is-everywhere">Antisemitism is everywhere</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Academics, who speak scientific language, won’t say “there’s no
antisemitism at UCLA” because they know that’s not true. Antisemitism is
everywhere. The question is how limiting and dangerous is it. And how
often is it encountered.
</p>
<p>
I grew up in the 1960s in a Queens neighborhood where antisemitism was a
real thing. We were blamed for World War II. If it weren’t for Jews my
uncle Pete would still be alive. That was the story. No doubt the kids
heard that at home.
</p>
<p>
Antisemitism was bred into us at home. Because of all the abuse my
parents and grandparents, uncles and cousins, suffered in Europe, before
coming the US during the war, their own idea of what it meant to be
Jewish was not entirely positive. You can’t help but feel responsible in
some ways for the abuse you suffer. And you can’t help but pass that on
to your kids.
</p>
<p>
There was and is a fair amount of pain associated with being Jewish in
the United States. Fact.
</p>
<p>
But: At UCLA? Harvard? Columbia? Please.
</p>
<p>
At the same time scientists can admit that there is antisemitism at
these places we must also acknowledge that to single these institutions
out among all, is complete utter total fucking bullshit.
</p>
<p>
That’s a scientific appraisal, btw. Provable in peer-reviewed
publications (though not submitted).
</p>
<p>
Antisemitism is complex. We should be hearing, openly, what exactly the
case is against these universities. The government is theoretically
representing the Constitution and the people of the United States. The
old “no taxation without representation”
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation">thing</a>.
Let’s hear the case in clear terms, and why the universities are
supposedly so bad.

modest proposal for new holidays to manage your digital life</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The cost of being online is getting too damn high and I’m tired of
pretending it’s possible to fit these tasks into a normal life. That’s
why I’d like to share a modest proposal for a new set of holidays to
manage our digital lives:
</p>
<p>
(Ahem.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A day to clear out your inboxes
</li>
<li>
A day to reset your passwords and delete old accounts
</li>
<li>
A day to fix your calendars
</li>
<li>
A day to cancel online service subscriptions
</li>
<li>
A day to manage the tags on your website
</li>
<li>
A day to switch out any critical apps
</li>
<li>
A day to backup your computer and phone
</li>
<li>
A day to organize your photos
</li>
<li>
A day to organize your music collection and playlists
</li>
<li>
A day to setup your new phone/computer
</li>
<li>
A day to try out a new app or major piece of software for your primary
workflow
</li>
<li>
A day to delete old text messages
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All I’m asking for is 1/30th of a year that we end up cramming into
other days. I’m willing to trade some of the B-tier holidays (Easter,
Thanksgiving, etc) for this. If you work in the government please call
me, it is URGENT.

<p>date: 2025-08-03, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-08-03-gotosocial-and-the-butlerian-jihad">
2025-08-03 GoToSocial and the Butlerian Jihad
</h1>
<p>
I run a single user instance for the fediverse using GoToSocial and
since I’m blocking <a href="2025-07-23-test">thousands of IP address
ranges</a> – mostly from companies renting out bandwidth and computing
power to web scrapers – I’m also blocking my instance from seeing a lot
of the fediverse. That’s not good.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to continue blocking the big cloud providers like
Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Hentzner, OVH, Alibaba and whatever else they
are called. But if I’m following somebody from a fedi instance hosted by
these big cloud providers, I should put the IP numbers associated with
just those domain names onto a separate allow list.
</p>
<p>
Instead of using the Mastodon client protocol to get the list of people
I’m following, I can just access the database directly.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the script that adds IP addresses:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
# Redirect the output of this script into /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.sh
echo &quot;#&quot; (date --iso)
set domains (sqlite3 /home/gotosocial/sqlite.db '
select distinct b.domain from follows as f
join accounts as a on f.account_id = a.id
join accounts as b on f.target_account_id = b.id
where a.username = &quot;alex&quot;
and b.domain is not null
order by 1')
set i 1
set m (count $domains)
for domain in $domains
    set ipv6 (host -t AAAA $domain | awk '/has IPv6 address/ { print $5}')
    set ipv4 (host -t A $domain | awk '/has address/ { print $4}')
    echo &quot;$i/$m $domain:&quot; $ipv4 $ipv6 &gt;&amp;2
    set i (math 1 + $i)
    for ip in $ipv4
        echo &quot;ipset add gotosocial $ip # $domain&quot;
    end
    for ip in $ipv6
        echo &quot;ipset add gotosocial6 $ip # $domain&quot;
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This prints lines such as the following to STDERR:
</p>
<pre><code>157/244 republik.ch: 172.67.74.47 104.26.5.143 104.26.4.143 2606:4700:20::681a:48f 2606:4700:20::ac43:4a2f 2606:4700:20::681a:58f
</code></pre>
<p>
And it prints lines such as the following to STDOUT:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset add gotosocial 172.67.74.47 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial 104.26.5.143 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial 104.26.4.143 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::681a:48f # republik.ch

ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::681a:58f # republik.ch
</code></pre>
<p>
I redirect STDOUT to a file called <code>gotosocial.sh</code> and then I
run this script, which creates to IP sets called <code>gotosocial</code>
and <code>gotosocial6</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish

iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set gotosocial src -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set gotosocial6 src -j ACCEPT

# recreate using: gotosocial-follower-ips &gt; gotosocial.sh
source gotosocial.sh

netfilter-persistent save

# Find the number of the rule (hopefully it is number one)
#   iptables --list INPUT
#   ip6tables --list INPUT
# To delete, verify the number of the rule:
#   iptables --list INPUT 1
#   ip6tables --list INPUT 1
# Now delete it the rule:
#   iptables --delete INPUT 1
#   ip6tables --delete INPUT 1
# Now you can destroy the two ipsets, too
#   ipset destroy gotosocial
#   ipset destroy gotosocial6
# And now you can rerun this script!
</code></pre>
<p>
If you run it, you’ll get warnings about duplicate entries, I’m sure:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset v7.17: Element cannot be added to the set: it's already added
</code></pre>
<p>
In my case, for example, I have both of these entries and I didn’t
bother to fix this:
</p>
<pre><code>ipset add gotosocial 151.101.129.91 # mastodon.online
ipset add gotosocial 151.101.129.91 # mastodon.social
</code></pre>
<p>
There are plenty more, of course.
</p>
<p>
In any case, you should now have an allow list that prevents these IP
addresses from getting blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> because the
<code>gotosocial</code> rule comes first:
</p>
<pre><code># iptables --list INPUT
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set gotosocial src
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set allowlist src
f2b-alex-apache  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports http,https
f2b-butlerian-jihad  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports 0:65535
f2b-butlerian-jihad-week  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports 0:65535
f2b-alex-bots  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports http,https
f2b-recidive  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            
DROP       all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set banlist src
</code></pre>
<p>
We’ll see how it goes. 😅
</p>
<p>
Problems that I expect: This needs to run periodically.
</p>
<p>
Most importantly, accounts that I am no longer following should be
removed. It might be easier to just delete and recreate the lists, every
now and then.

<p>A basic question I had about the
<a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11752874-chatgpt-agent">ChatGPT
agents</a> that I can answer now that I have the feature, is whether or
not the code you create can run on a server, where you can give it a URL
and make it an endpoint other networked software can call. Or if it
could run periodically, say once every five minutes for a function that
was creating an RSS feed anyone could subscribe to. The answer is no –
it can’t do either of these things. I’m sure they could do it at a
technical level, but they don’t want to host applications. But now I may
understand better why they want to make a web browser, I bet you will be
able to call these agents from apps that run in the browser. And in
their case, they might not even have to support JavaScript? Heh. A
wholly different programming model? Maybe I’m overestimating how much
they’re biting off? I wonder if anyone at OpenAI reads this blog and
might want to get me in a tighter loop, so I can be among the first to
try new features like this, rather than, in this case, among the very
last.</p>

<p>One of the more depressing things in having so much code that I can
easily search, is the number of times I’ve rewritten the same code
without remembering I had written it before. Yesterday I did it
knowingly, I wanted a function that could tell me if one of a set of
categories applies to a WordLand draft. So I could say “don’t list
drafts with ‘linkblog’ as a category.” It could have other categories,
and there could be more than one category to exclude. I wanted to take
the time to write perfect code for this one problem. Not dense, not
particularly efficient. No matter how inefficient the code is, on
today’s hardware such a function couldn’t use any time at all. It’s fair
to say I’ve solved this problem before, but there was always more to it.
Here’s the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/d61110c1d74eb1162ebc726c09dd22f1">function</a>.
Now you know something about what I think is readable, understandable,
respectful of a human more than I am of the computer. I know the
computer would come up with much more dense and tricky code, but it
doesn’t have a mind, and I do. At times it can be relaxing, I magine, to
not have a mind. And btw, in a couple of years this layer of code will
be obsolete. We already are able to tell the machine how to do this in
human language, it understands what we mean. One tiny little but hugely
significant breakthrough made possible by ChatGPT and its cousins.</p>

<p>As you get older your memory gets less reliable. It makes programming
more of a challenge because as your software gets more features, there’s
more to remember and at the same time you’re getting older. I wonder if
there isn’t some way to use ChatGPT to augment the aging mind dealing
with more software complexity. It’s very much in line with the idea I’ve
had for a long time of putting all my writing in an AI database so I
could then ask it to edit it down to book length. Or get a table of
contents of what I think and then be able to read chapter-length
sections on, say platforms, or how important prior art is, or what
interop makes possible, and why everyone should give back when they take
from open ecosystems. Each one of those topics has lots of associated
stories over the years, but I probably couldn’t find most of them, but
an AI database certainly could. How to set that up? I’ve not figured
that out so far.</p>
