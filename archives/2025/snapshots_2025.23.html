The Orange Pi R2S is a single-board computer computer that’s a little
smaller than a Raspberry Pi 5, but it’s made for a very different use
case. While Raspberry Pi’s credit card-sized computers are positioned as
general purpose computers with ARM-based processors, the R2S features a

<h2 id="o3-pro">o3-pro</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, updated: 2025-06-10, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3-pro">o3-pro</a></strong>
</p>
OpenAI released o3-pro today, which they describe as a “version of o3
with more compute for better responses”.
</p>
<p>
It’s only available via the newer Responses API. I’ve added it to my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin">llm-openai-plugin</a>
plugin which uses that new API, so you can try it out like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-openai-plugin
llm -m openai/o3-pro "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
</code></pre>
<p>
<img alt="Description by o3-pro: The image is a playful, minimalist cartoon showing a white bird riding a bicycle. The bird has a simple oval body, a round head with a small black eye, and a yellow beak. Its orange feet are positioned on the bicycle’s pedals. The bicycle itself is drawn with thin black lines forming two large circular wheels and a straightforward frame. The scene has a light blue background with a soft gray oval shadow beneath the bicycle, giving the impression of ground. Overall, the illustration has a light, whimsical feel." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o3-pro-pelican.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
It’s <em>slow</em> -
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6bc7dda9dbe07281d902d254e5fb6e33">generating
this pelican</a> took 124 seconds! OpenAI suggest using their
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/background">background
mode</a> for o3 prompts, which I haven’t tried myself yet.
</p>
<p>
o3-pro is priced at $20/million input tokens and $80/million output
tokens - 10x the price of regular o3 after its
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/10/o3-price-drop/">80% price
drop</a> this morning.
</p>
<p>
Ben Hylak had early access and published his notes so far in
<a href="https://www.latent.space/p/o3-pro">God is hungry for Context:
First thoughts on o3 pro</a>. It sounds like this model needs to be
applied very thoughtfully. It comparison to o3:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s smarter. <em>much smarter.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>But in order to see that, you need to give it</strong>
<strong><em>a lot</em></strong> <strong>more context. and I’m running
out of context.</strong> […]
</p>
<p>
My co-founder Alexis and I took the the time to assemble a history of
all of our past planning meetings at Raindrop, all of our goals, even
record voice memos: and then asked o3-pro to come up with a plan.
</p>
<p>
We were blown away; it spit out the exact kind of concrete plan and
analysis I’ve always wanted an LLM to create — complete with target
metrics, timelines, what to prioritize, and strict instructions on what
to absolutely cut.
</p>
<p>
The plan o3 gave us was plausible, reasonable; but the plan o3 Pro gave
us was specific and rooted enough that <strong><em>it actually changed
how we are thinking about our future.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
This is hard to capture in an eval.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>It sounds to me like o3-pro works best when combined with tools. I
don’t have tool support in <code>llm-openai-plugin</code> yet,

<h2 id="o3-price-drop">o3 price drop</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, updated: 2025-06-10, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
OpenAI just dropped the price of their o3 model by 80% - from
$10/million input tokens and $40/million output tokens to just
$2/million and $8/million for the very same model. This is in advance of
the release of o3-pro which apparently is coming
<a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1932483131363504334">later
today</a> (update:
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/10/o3-pro/">here it is</a>).
</p>
<p>
This is a pretty huge shake-up in LLM pricing. o3 is now priced the same
as GPT 4.1, and slightly less than GPT-4o ($2.50/$10). It’s also less
than Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 ($3/$15) and Opus 4 ($15/$75) and sits
in between Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro for &gt;200,00 tokens ($2.50/$15) and
2.5 Pro for &lt;200,000 ($1.25/$10).
</p>
<p>
I’ve updated my <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/">llm-prices.com</a>
pricing calculator with the new rate.
</p>
<p>
How have they dropped the price so much? OpenAI’s Adam Groth

<p>
<strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/magistral">Magistral — the
first reasoning model by Mistral AI</a></strong>
</p>
Mistral’s first reasoning model is out today, in two sizes. There’s a
24B Apache 2 licensed open-weights model called Magistral Small
(actually Magistral-Small-2506), and a larger API-only model called
Magistral Medium.
</p>
<p>
Magistral Small is available as
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506">mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506</a>
on Hugging Face. From that model card:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Context Window</strong>: A 128k context window, but performance
might degrade past 40k. Hence we recommend setting the maximum model
length to 40k.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Mistral also released an official GGUF version,
<a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506_gguf">Magistral-Small-2506_gguf</a>,
which I ran successfully using Ollama like this:

That fetched a 25GB file. I ran prompts using a chat session with

this:

hopefully a community variant can add that, it’s one of the best ways I
know of to unlock the potential of these reasoning models.
</p>
<p>
I just noticed that Ollama have their own
<a href="https://ollama.com/library/magistral">Magistral model</a> too,
which can be accessed using:
</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull magistral:latest
</code></pre>
<p>
That gets you a 14GB <code>q4_K_M</code> quantization - other options
can be found in the
<a href="https://ollama.com/library/magistral/tags">full list of Ollama
magistral tags</a>.
</p>
<p>
One thing that caught my eye in the Magistral announcement:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Legal, finance, healthcare, and government professionals get traceable
reasoning that meets compliance requirements. Every conclusion can be
traced back through its logical steps, providing auditability for
high-stakes environments with domain-specialized AI.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I guess this means the reasoning traces are fully visible and not
redacted in any way - interesting to see Mistral trying to turn that
into a feature that’s attractive to the business clients they are most
interested in appealing to.
</p>
<p>
Also from that announcement:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our early tests indicated that Magistral is an excellent creative
companion. We highly recommend it for creative writing and storytelling,
with the model capable of producing coherent or — if needed —
delightfully eccentric copy.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I haven’t seen a reasoning model promoted for creative writing in this
way before.
</p>
<p>
You can try out Magistral Medium by selecting the new “Thinking” option
in Mistral’s <a href="https://chat.mistral.ai/">Le Chat</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Screenshot of a chat interface showing settings options. At the top is a text input field that says &quot;Ask le Chat or @mention an agent&quot; with a plus button, lightbulb &quot;Think&quot; button with up arrow, grid &quot;Tools&quot; button, and settings icon. Below are two toggle options: &quot;Pure Thinking&quot; with description &quot;Best option for math + coding. Disables tools.&quot; (toggle is off), and &quot;10x Speed&quot; with lightning bolt icon and &quot;PRO - 2 remaining today&quot; label, described as &quot;Same quality at 10x the speed.&quot; (toggle is on and green)." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/magistral-le-chat.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
They have options for “Pure Thinking” and a separate option for “10x
speed”, which runs Magistral Medium at 10x the speed using
<a href="https://www.cerebras.ai/">Cerebras</a>.
</p>
<p>
The new models are also available through
<a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/api/">the Mistral API</a>. You can
access them by installing
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral">llm-mistral</a> and
running <code>llm mistral refresh</code> to refresh the list of
available models, then:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mistral/magistral-medium-latest \
  'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle'
</code></pre>
<p>
<img alt="Claude Sonnet 4 described this as Minimalist illustration of a white bird with an orange beak riding on a dark gray motorcycle against a light blue sky with a white sun and gray ground" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/magistral-medium-pelican.jpg" />

<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Conor O’Niell’s blog, Cross Dominant</p>
<p>For personal projects, I generally follow Andrej Karpathy’s original
definition of Vibe Coding - I don’t look at the generated code, I just
tell the LLM what I want, paste in the error messages and iterate until
it gives me the output I need. But that’s a lot easier to do when you’ve
been writing software for 40+ years and know what to ask for! But when
it comes to creating Open Data projects, I often find that the challenge
isn’t the code, it’s the data.</p>

Apple supercharges its tools and technologies for developers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-09, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-supercharges-its-tools-and-technologies-for-developers/">WWDC:
Apple supercharges its tools and technologies for
developers</a></strong>
</p>
Here’s the Apple press release for today’s WWDC announcements. Two
things that stood out to me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Foundation Models Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>
With the Foundation Models framework, developers will be able to build
on Apple Intelligence to bring users new experiences that are
intelligent, available when they’re offline, and that protect their
privacy, using AI inference that is free of cost. The framework has
native support for Swift, so developers can easily access the Apple
Intelligence model with as few as three lines of code.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here’s new documentation on
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FoundationModels/generating-content-and-performing-tasks-with-foundation-models">Generating
content and performing tasks with Foundation Models</a> - the Swift code
looks like this:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">session</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">LanguageModelSession</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span>

<span class="pl-kos">)</span>
<span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">prompt</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"</span><span class="pl-s">Rum old fashioned cocktail</span><span class="pl-s">"</span>
<span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">response</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-k">try</span></span> <span class="pl-k">await</span> session<span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">respond</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span>

<span class="pl-kos">)</span></pre>
<p>
There’s also a
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/286/">23
minute Meet the Foundation Models framework</a> video from the
conference, which clarifies that this is a 3 billion parameter model
with 2 bit quantization. The model is trained for both tool-calling and
structured output, which they call “guided generation” and describe as
taking advantage of constrained decoding.
</p>
<p>
I’m also <em>very</em> excited about this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Containerization Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Containerization framework enables developers to create, download,
or run Linux container images directly on Mac. It’s built on an
open-source framework optimized for Apple silicon and provides secure
isolation between container images.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I continue to seek the ideal sandboxing solution for running untrusted
code - both from other humans and written for me by LLMs - on my own
machines. This looks like it could be a really great option for that
going forward.
</p>
<p>
It looks like
<a href="https://github.com/apple/container">apple/container</a> on
GitHub is part of this new feature. From the
<a href="https://github.com/apple/container/blob/main/docs/technical-overview.md">technical
overview</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On macOS, the typical way to run Linux containers is to launch a Linux
virtual machine (VM) that hosts all of your containers.
</p>
<p>
<code>container</code> runs containers differently. Using the open
source
<a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization">Containerization</a>
package, it runs a lightweight VM for each container that you create.
[…]
</p>
<p>
Since <code>container</code> consumes and produces standard OCI images,
you can easily build with and run images produced by other container
applications, and the images that you build will run everywhere.
</p>

hits $10 billion in annual recurring revenue fueled by ChatGPT
growth</a></strong>
</p>
Noteworthy because OpenAI revenue is a useful indicator of the direction
of the generative AI industry in general, and frequently comes up in
conversations about the sustainability of the current bubble.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
OpenAI has hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue less than three
years after launching its popular ChatGPT chatbot.
</p>
<p>
The figure includes sales from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT
business products and its application programming interface, or API. It
excludes licensing revenue from Microsoft and large one-time deals,
according to an OpenAI spokesperson.
</p>
<p>
For all of last year, OpenAI was around $5.5 billion in ARR. […]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>So these new numbers represent nearly double the ARR figures for last
year.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://crawshaw.io/blog/programming-with-agents">
<p>
The process of learning and experimenting with LLM-derived technology
has been an exercise in humility. In general I love learning new things
when the art of programming changes […] But LLMs, and more specifically
Agents, affect the process of writing programs in a new and confusing
way. Absolutely every fundamental assumption about how I work has to be
questioned, and it ripples through all the experience I have
accumulated. There are days when it feels like I would be better off if
I did not know anything about programming and started from scratch. And
it is still changing.

<h2 id="copying-spinoza">Copying Spinoza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</p>
<p>
I’ve run into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza">Spinoza</a> a few
times, sometimes in unexpected places like <a
href="https://joyfulmilitancy.com/">Joyful Militancy</a>, but I’ve not
yet spent any time reading his work. He popped up in a recent Between
the Covers <a
href="https://tinhouse.com/podcast/madeleine-thien-the-book-of-records/">podcast</a>
interview with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Thien">Madeleine Thien</a>
about her new book <a
href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-book-of-records-madeleine-thien/21798601">The
Book of Records</a>. You’ll have to listen to the interview, or read the
book, to get a sense of how the book works, but it’s my understanding
that the main character is a refugee, and yet was able to bring with her
three slim books from a series called <em>The Great Lives of
Voyagers</em>, one of which is about Spinoza, the others being about Du
Fu and Hannah Arendt. I believe that readings of these fictional books
form part of The Book of Records.
</p>
<p>
During the interview Thien was asked about the importance of these
stories, and friendships to her work as a writer…not only friendships
with contemporaries, but across time as well.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s certainly true when I placed all the stories side by side, or as
they began to weave through each other, that it became clear that all of
them are at times, many times, sometimes, saved by another, and none of
their work would reach us had these acts of friendship not occurred. And
Moriel asked about that idea of friendship across the centuries between
the living and the dead. I was always struck by Hannah Arendt writing
about Rahel Varnhagen and saying she was my best friend even though she
had died a hundred years ago before her. I often felt this with the
three figures who were moving around in the Sea, that they were amazed
that we wanted to sit with them, even if we didn’t always agree with
them, even if we might have quite serious critiques of some of their
ideas. But even then, the desire to value the teacher, to value the
teaching, and to understand what it was that each of us might be looking
for each time we sit with a text, with a person, with another human
being, <em>I only really feel like I was with Spinoza when I, over many
months, copied up Ethics.</em> I understood then the way the geometry
would work on a person’s mind, that it is such a step-by-step process,
that text. One thing really must be understood before one moves to the
next proposition. One has to draw the angles of the triangle and the
measurements and understand what a triangle is before one can begin to
“constellate” it with other things. That’s very much how Ethics works.
It is this seed, that everything that it contains is in it from its
first axioms, its first propositions, and you can kind of unfold them
and see how that all works.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This idea of <em>copying</em> Spinoza’s Ethics in an effort to form an
understanding and a friendship with him is compelling: to get a copy of
Ethics, and a blank notebook, and just start copying it out. It’s my
understanding that the text takes shape in the form of axioms and
propositions that draw on geometry, in order to propose a “human
geometry”? Of all the maths that I needed to do in school it was
geometric proofs that I always got the most enjoyment from. This made me
think it would be fun to try do this copying practice with others, to
meet and discuss, and share our notebooks and thoughts? But then again,
I imagine if it took Thien months to do the copying it would take me
<em>much</em> longer…so perhaps it would be best to just work at my own
pace, when I can, without the peer pressure?
</p>
<p>
Another thing I learned while reading about Spinoza’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza%27s_Ethics">Ethics,
Demonstrated in Geometric Order</a> on Wikipedia is that the first
translation into English was done by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot">George Eliot</a> in
1883, and it was left unpublished until almost a hundred years later.
Spinoza wrote the book over 14 years and it was only published after he
died. According to Thien, it took her 9 years to write The Book of
Records. In this age of move fast and break things, the idea of doing
something restorative, over the course of years, is maybe what appeals
to me most.

I’m a bit of a nut and don’t use SQLMesh or dbt. Instead, I built

we still use it at <a href="https://carbonfact.org">Carbonfact</a>. I

explore new ideas, so I’m sticking to it for now.
