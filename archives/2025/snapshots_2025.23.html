can be a supercharger for Open Data projects and Vibe Coding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: Conor O’Niell’s blog, Cross Dominant</p>
<p>For personal projects, I generally follow Andrej Karpathy’s original
definition of Vibe Coding - I don’t look at the generated code, I just
tell the LLM what I want, paste in the error messages and iterate until
it gives me the output I need. But that’s a lot easier to do when you’ve
been writing software for 40+ years and know what to ask for! But when
it comes to creating Open Data projects, I often find that the challenge
isn’t the code, it’s the data.</p>

Apple supercharges its tools and technologies for developers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-09, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-supercharges-its-tools-and-technologies-for-developers/">WWDC:
Apple supercharges its tools and technologies for
developers</a></strong>
</p>
Here’s the Apple press release for today’s WWDC announcements. Two
things that stood out to me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Foundation Models Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>
With the Foundation Models framework, developers will be able to build
on Apple Intelligence to bring users new experiences that are
intelligent, available when they’re offline, and that protect their
privacy, using AI inference that is free of cost. The framework has
native support for Swift, so developers can easily access the Apple
Intelligence model with as few as three lines of code.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here’s new documentation on
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FoundationModels/generating-content-and-performing-tasks-with-foundation-models">Generating
content and performing tasks with Foundation Models</a> - the Swift code
looks like this:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">session</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">LanguageModelSession</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span>
    instructions<span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-s">"</span><span class="pl-s">Reply with step by step instructions</span><span class="pl-s">"</span>
<span class="pl-kos">)</span>
<span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">prompt</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"</span><span class="pl-s">Rum old fashioned cocktail</span><span class="pl-s">"</span>
<span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">response</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-k">try</span></span> <span class="pl-k">await</span> session<span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">respond</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span>

<span class="pl-kos">)</span></pre>
<p>
There’s also a
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/286/">23
minute Meet the Foundation Models framework</a> video from the
conference, which clarifies that this is a 3 billion parameter model
with 2 bit quantization. The model is trained for both tool-calling and
structured output, which they call “guided generation” and describe as
taking advantage of constrained decoding.
</p>
<p>
I’m also <em>very</em> excited about this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Containerization Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Containerization framework enables developers to create, download,
or run Linux container images directly on Mac. It’s built on an
open-source framework optimized for Apple silicon and provides secure
isolation between container images.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I continue to seek the ideal sandboxing solution for running untrusted
code - both from other humans and written for me by LLMs - on my own
machines. This looks like it could be a really great option for that
going forward.
</p>
<p>
It looks like
<a href="https://github.com/apple/container">apple/container</a> on
GitHub is part of this new feature. From the
<a href="https://github.com/apple/container/blob/main/docs/technical-overview.md">technical
overview</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On macOS, the typical way to run Linux containers is to launch a Linux
virtual machine (VM) that hosts all of your containers.
</p>
<p>
<code>container</code> runs containers differently. Using the open
source
<a href="https://github.com/apple/containerization">Containerization</a>
package, it runs a lightweight VM for each container that you create.
[…]
</p>
<p>
Since <code>container</code> consumes and produces standard OCI images,
you can easily build with and run images produced by other container
applications, and the images that you build will run everywhere.
</p>

hits $10 billion in annual recurring revenue fueled by ChatGPT
growth</a></strong>
</p>
Noteworthy because OpenAI revenue is a useful indicator of the direction
of the generative AI industry in general, and frequently comes up in
conversations about the sustainability of the current bubble.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
OpenAI has hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue less than three
years after launching its popular ChatGPT chatbot.
</p>
<p>
The figure includes sales from the company’s consumer products, ChatGPT
business products and its application programming interface, or API. It
excludes licensing revenue from Microsoft and large one-time deals,
according to an OpenAI spokesperson.
</p>
<p>
For all of last year, OpenAI was around $5.5 billion in ARR. […]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>So these new numbers represent nearly double the ARR figures for last
year.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://crawshaw.io/blog/programming-with-agents">
<p>
The process of learning and experimenting with LLM-derived technology
has been an exercise in humility. In general I love learning new things
when the art of programming changes […] But LLMs, and more specifically
Agents, affect the process of writing programs in a new and confusing
way. Absolutely every fundamental assumption about how I work has to be
questioned, and it ripples through all the experience I have
accumulated. There are days when it feels like I would be better off if
I did not know anything about programming and started from scratch. And
it is still changing.

<h2 id="copying-spinoza">Copying Spinoza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</p>
<p>
I’ve run into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza">Spinoza</a> a few
times, sometimes in unexpected places like <a
href="https://joyfulmilitancy.com/">Joyful Militancy</a>, but I’ve not
yet spent any time reading his work. He popped up in a recent Between
the Covers <a
href="https://tinhouse.com/podcast/madeleine-thien-the-book-of-records/">podcast</a>
interview with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Thien">Madeleine Thien</a>
about her new book <a
href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-book-of-records-madeleine-thien/21798601">The
Book of Records</a>. You’ll have to listen to the interview, or read the
book, to get a sense of how the book works, but it’s my understanding
that the main character is a refugee, and yet was able to bring with her
three slim books from a series called <em>The Great Lives of
Voyagers</em>, one of which is about Spinoza, the others being about Du
Fu and Hannah Arendt. I believe that readings of these fictional books
form part of The Book of Records.
</p>
<p>
During the interview Thien was asked about the importance of these
stories, and friendships to her work as a writer…not only friendships
with contemporaries, but across time as well.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s certainly true when I placed all the stories side by side, or as
they began to weave through each other, that it became clear that all of
them are at times, many times, sometimes, saved by another, and none of
their work would reach us had these acts of friendship not occurred. And
Moriel asked about that idea of friendship across the centuries between
the living and the dead. I was always struck by Hannah Arendt writing
about Rahel Varnhagen and saying she was my best friend even though she
had died a hundred years ago before her. I often felt this with the
three figures who were moving around in the Sea, that they were amazed
that we wanted to sit with them, even if we didn’t always agree with
them, even if we might have quite serious critiques of some of their
ideas. But even then, the desire to value the teacher, to value the
teaching, and to understand what it was that each of us might be looking
for each time we sit with a text, with a person, with another human
being, <em>I only really feel like I was with Spinoza when I, over many
months, copied up Ethics.</em> I understood then the way the geometry
would work on a person’s mind, that it is such a step-by-step process,
that text. One thing really must be understood before one moves to the
next proposition. One has to draw the angles of the triangle and the
measurements and understand what a triangle is before one can begin to
“constellate” it with other things. That’s very much how Ethics works.
It is this seed, that everything that it contains is in it from its
first axioms, its first propositions, and you can kind of unfold them
and see how that all works.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This idea of <em>copying</em> Spinoza’s Ethics in an effort to form an
understanding and a friendship with him is compelling: to get a copy of
Ethics, and a blank notebook, and just start copying it out. It’s my
understanding that the text takes shape in the form of axioms and
propositions that draw on geometry, in order to propose a “human
geometry”? Of all the maths that I needed to do in school it was
geometric proofs that I always got the most enjoyment from. This made me
think it would be fun to try do this copying practice with others, to
meet and discuss, and share our notebooks and thoughts? But then again,
I imagine if it took Thien months to do the copying it would take me
<em>much</em> longer…so perhaps it would be best to just work at my own
pace, when I can, without the peer pressure?
</p>
<p>
Another thing I learned while reading about Spinoza’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza%27s_Ethics">Ethics,
Demonstrated in Geometric Order</a> on Wikipedia is that the first
translation into English was done by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot">George Eliot</a> in
1883, and it was left unpublished until almost a hundred years later.
Spinoza wrote the book over 14 years and it was only published after he
died. According to Thien, it took her 9 years to write The Book of
Records. In this age of move fast and break things, the idea of doing
something restorative, over the course of years, is maybe what appeals
to me most.

they’re taking. I’m hopeful it has the potential to streamline the data

way.

I’m a bit of a nut and don’t use SQLMesh or dbt. Instead, I built

we still use it at <a href="https://carbonfact.org">Carbonfact</a>. I
would probably pick SQLMesh if I had to start over, but lea allows me to
explore new ideas, so I’m sticking to it for now.

of Florence (Part 1)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-08, from: This is history podcast</p>
<p>
What are the origins of one of history’s most glittering, and for a
time, most powerful families in Europe; the Medici? How were they able
to seize supreme power in the Republic of Florence , one of the most
dazzling cities in the world, during the 15th century, at the height of
the Renaissance? When […]

The first Xbox-branded handhelds are on the way and, as expected,
they’re not made by Microsoft… or at least the hardware isn’t. Instead
Microsoft is partnering with Asus to launch a new ROG Xbox Ally and ROG

<h2 id="qwen3-embedding">Qwen3 Embedding</h2>

Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-embedding/">Qwen3
Embedding</a></strong>
</p>
New family of embedding models from Qwen, in three sizes: 0.6B, 4B, 8B -
and two categories: Text Embedding and Text Reranking.
</p>
<p>
The full collection
<a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-embedding-6841b2055b99c44d9a4c371f">can
be browsed</a> on Hugging Face. The smallest available model is the 0.6B
Q8 one, which is available as a 639MB GGUF. I tried it out using my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers">llm-sentence-transformers</a>
plugin like this:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-sentence-transformers
llm sentence-transformers register Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
llm embed -m sentence-transformers/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B -c hi | jq length
</code></pre>
<p>
This output 1024, confirming that Qwen3 0.6B produces 1024 length
embedding vectors.
</p>
<p>
These new models are the highest scoring open-weight models on the well
regarded <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">MTEB
leaderboard</a> - they’re licensed Apache 2.0.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Table showing ranking of embedding models with columns for Rank, Model name, Zero-shot performance, Memory Usage, Number of Parameters, Embedding Dimensions, and Max Tokens. Top models include gemini-embedding-001 at rank 1 with 99% zero-shot and 3072 embedding dimensions, Qwen3-Embedding-8B at rank 2 with 99% zero-shot and 4096 embedding dimensions, and several other Qwen3 variants. Most models show 99% zero-shot performance with green highlighting, except gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct at rank 6 which shows &quot;NA&quot; with red highlighting and a warning triangle icon." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-mteb.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
You can also try them out in your web browser, thanks to a
<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index">Transformers.js</a>
port of the models. I loaded
<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/qwen3-embedding-webgpu">this
page in Chrome</a>
(<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/qwen3-embedding-webgpu/tree/main">source
code here</a>) and it fetched 560MB of model files and gave me an
interactive interface for visualizing clusters of embeddings like this:
