<h2 id="come-ror-with-us-using-ror-ids-in-place-of-funder-ids">Come ROR
with us: Using ROR IDs in place of Funder IDs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-05, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Today, we’re delighted to let you know that Crossref members can now use
ROR IDs to identify funders in any place where you currently use Funder
IDs in your metadata. Funder IDs remain available, but this change
allows publishers, service providers, and funders to streamline
workflows and introduce efficiencies by using a single open identifier
for both researcher affiliations and funding organizations.
</p>
<p>
As you probably know, the
<a href="https://ror.org" target="_blank">Research Organization Registry
(ROR)</a> is a global, community-led, carefully curated registry of open
persistent identifiers for research organisations, including funding
organisations. It’s a joint initiative led by the California Digital
Library, Datacite and Crossref launched in 2019 that fulfills the
long-standing need for an open organisation identifier.
</p>
<p>
In 2023, we shared our plan to
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/open-funder-registry-to-transition-into-research-organization-registry-ror" target="_blank">transition
the Open Funder Registry into ROR</a>. More recently, we announced that
we were planning to
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/roring-ahead-using-ror-in-place-of-the-open-funder-registry" target="_blank">update
our schema so that it is possible to collect ROR IDs where we currently
collect Funder IDs</a> such as in the funding metadata section for works
and funder section for grants. Now that we have completed this work,
Crossref members can start depositing ROR IDs where they would normally
deposit Funder IDs. This update also means that the community, including
funders, service providers, researchers, and data scientists can
retrieve this metadata
<a href="https://api.crossref.org/works?filter=has-ror-id:true" target="_blank">via
our API</a>.
</p>
<p>
So come and ROR with us and start depositing ROR IDs for both researcher
affiliations and funding organisations.
</p>
<h2 id="open-funder-registry-ror-transition">
Open Funder Registry-ROR transition
</h2>
<p>
This is of course a significant first step in the Open Funder Registry
to ROR transition.
</p>
<p>
We’ve
<a href="https://ror.readme.io/docs/funder-registry" target="_blank">always
said</a> that we would continue supporting Funder IDs in our schema and
in our tools and services until the community is ready to transition -
and we will. In the last year, Crossref and ROR conducted a series of
Open Funder Registry user interviews to help us understand how it was
being used and identify practical challenges to this transition in our
members’ workflow (thank you to those who took part, it was incredibly
useful!).
</p>
<p>
One major takeaway from this consultation was around the pivotal role
that peer review management systems played in the Open Funder
Registry-ROR transition. We look forward to seeing more service
providers integrating with ROR in the future. If you are a service
provider and are ready to integrate with ROR, drop
<a href="mailto:support@ror.org">support@ror.org</a> an email.
</p>
<h2 id="including-ror-ids-in-crossref-metadata">
Including ROR IDs in Crossref metadata
</h2>
<p>
If you are ready to begin including ROR IDs in your funding metadata,
you only need to include the ROR itself to identify a funder.
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-XML" data-lang="XML"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">&lt;fr:program</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&#34;fundref&#34;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"> <span class="nt">&lt;fr:assertion</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&#34;ror&#34;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>https://ror.org/00fq5cm18<span class="nt">&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"> <span class="nt">&lt;fr:assertion</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&#34;award_number&#34;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>10.3030/725840<span class="nt">&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">&lt;/fr:program&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
Examples of more complex combinations of funding information are
available in our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/funder-registry/funding-data-overview/" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
This update has been made across all schema that support funding
metadata.
</p>
<p>
Our grants schema has recently been updated to
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/grants-schema/" target="_blank">version
0.2.0</a> to support ROR IDs in place of funder identifiers as well. As
with funding metadata, only the ROR ID needs to be supplied within the
record:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-XML" data-lang="XML"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">&lt;funding</span> <span class="na">amount=</span><span class="s">&#34;750&#34;</span> <span class="na">currency=</span><span class="s">&#34;USD&#34;</span> <span class="na">funding-percentage=</span><span class="s">&#34;75&#34;</span> <span class="na">funding-type=</span><span class="s">&#34;APC&#34;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"> <span class="nt">&lt;ROR&gt;</span>https://ror.org/02twcfp32https://ror.org/02twcfp32<span class="nt">&lt;/ROR&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"> <span class="nt">&lt;funding-scheme&gt;</span>Sofa Lending Programme<span class="nt">&lt;/funding-scheme&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">&lt;/funding&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
Although previously a funder name was collected with the funder
identifier, for both grants records and funding data in an attempt to
avoid redundant, incorrect or conflicting metadata, now we’re accepting
an identifier only as the ROR ID has an existing metadata record. The
organisation name exists within the record in the
<a href="https://ror.org/search" target="_blank">ROR registry</a> and
the ROR record is the authoritative source of the name.
</p>
<h2 id="ror-ids-in-json-outputs">
ROR IDs in JSON outputs
</h2>
<p>
We have an existing legacy practice of representing Open Funder Registry
IDs as just a DOI, but ROR IDs are represented in the JSON outputs as a
full URL with id-type “ROR”, for example:

Threat: The Battle for Inclusive Research</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Scholarly Kitchen</p>
<p>

eroded trust, and weakened scientific progress—and why inclusive
research remains critical.
